Carmouche, </em>449 F.3d 655 (5th Cir.2006). Defendants-appellees are various officials of the State of Louisiana. Before the district court, the Center contended that the State was enforcing the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act impermissibly under <em>Car-mouche, </em>which upheld the constitutionality of the statute against a First Amendment \u201cvagueness\u201d challenge by applying a limiting construction to the statute\u2019s reach. The district court struggled, understandably, with how to interpret the Center\u2019s claim, whether as contending that the statute is unconstitutional on its face, that the statute is being enforced in an unconstitutional manner, or otherwise. The district court concluded, however, that, under any interpretation of the claim, the motion for a preliminary injunction should be denied. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Under the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">[a]ny person, other than a candidate or a political committee, who makes any expenditure ..., shall file reports if ... said expenditures ... exceed five hundred dollars in the aggregate during the aggregating period as defined for committees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18:1501.1(A)(1). An \u201cexpenditure\u201d means generally a use of money or property \u201cfor the purpose of supporting, opposing, or otherwise influencing the nomination or election of a person to public office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 18:1483(9). If an organization\u2019s expenditures \u201cexceed five hundred dollars in the aggregate\u201d during the statutory \u201caggregating period,\u201d the organization \u201cshall file reports\u201d containing, among other things, the name and address of the organization and the organization\u2019s donors that funded the expenditures. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 18:1491.7. Failure to file the reports could result in civil or criminal sanctions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 18:1505.4, 18:1505.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">In <em>Carmouche, </em>the Center claimed that the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d (which includes the use of money or property \u201cfor the purpose of ... <em>otherwise influencing </em>the nomination or election of a person to public office,\u201d \u00a7 18:1483(9) (emphasis added)) was impermissibly \u201cvague and overbroad\u201d under the First Amendment because it could be read to cover (and thus trigger corresponding disclosure requirements enforced by civil and criminal sanctions) both the use of money and property for \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d <em>(ie., </em>endorsement of a candidate) and \u201cissue advocacy\u201d <em>(ie., </em>espousal of a particular viewpoint on a given issue that may have an indirect relation to an election). 449 F.3d at 663. This court upheld the statute by applying a limiting construction derived from <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976), which addressed federal campaign finance statutes requiring similar disclosures. <em>Carmouche, </em>449 F.3d at 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">In <em>Buckley, </em>the plaintiffs challenged, on First Amendment grounds, the constitutionality of various provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (\u201cFECA\u201d). That statute, at the relevant time, defined an \u201cexpenditure\u201d as including the use of money or property \u201cfor the purpose of ... influencing ... the nomina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tion for election, or the election, of any person to Federal office.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(f)(1)(A) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). If sufficient expenditures were made, the statute required similar disclosures as at issue here. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 434(e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). As we explained in <em>Carmouche:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWA\">Rather than striking [the statutory disclosure requirements] down as unconstitutional, however, the <em>[Buckley] </em>Court imposed a limiting construction on the statute, bringing it within constitutional bounds by drawing a line between express advocacy and issue advocacy. The Court stated that \u201cwe construe \u2018expenditure\u2019 for purposes of [the disclosure requirement] to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">449 F.3d at 664. In a footnote, <em>Buckley </em>stated, by way of illustration, that words such as \u201cvote for,\u201d \u201celect,\u201d \u201csupport,\u201d \u201ccast your ballot for,\u201d \u201cSmith for Congress,\u201d \u201cvote against,\u201d \u201cdefeat,\u201d and \u201creject,\u201d would constitute \u201cexpress words of advocacy.\u201d 424 U.S. at 44 n. 52, 96 S.Ct. 612. In <em>Carmouche, </em>we referred to these as \u201cwell-known \u2018magic words.\u2019 \u201d 449 F.3d at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Thus, this court in <em>Carmouche </em>upheld the constitutionality of the Louisiana Campaign Finance Disclosure Act against the Center\u2019s \u201cvagueness\u201d challenge by, per <em>Buckley, </em>construing the statute\u2019s disclosure requirements to be invoked only by \u201cexpress advocacy,\u201d <em>ie., </em>\u201ccommunications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,\u201d and not by \u201cissue advocacy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 665. Under such a reading, we held, the challenged provisions are \u201cfacially constitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Turning to the present case, the Center now contends that, per <em>Carmouche, </em>disclosure under the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act cannot be required unless a particular communication includes \u201cmagic words,\u201d and, the Center further contends, the State is no longer limiting enforcement of the statute to communications including \u201cmagic words\u201d and is thus violating <em>Car-mouche. </em>The Center seeks a declaration that \u201cmagic words\u201d are a prerequisite to disclosure and an injunction against enforcement otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any harm that the injunction might cause to the defendant; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest. <em>Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, </em>697 F.3d 279, 288 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Tex. Med. Providers Performing Abortion Servs. v. Lakey, </em>667 F.3d 570, 574 (5th Cir.2012). We agree with the district court that the Center cannot satisfy the first requirement, a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">.The Center insists that its claim is a \u201cfacial\u201d attack, but what precisely the Center means is unclear. Insofar as the Center\u2019s claim is that the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face, this court has already denied that claim in <em>Carmouche </em>and the Center neither contends that new law should change that outcome nor that the statute\u2019s text has been amended since we decided <em>Carmouche. </em>Accordingly, <em>Car-mouche </em>controls and we are impelled to once again deny the Center\u2019s claim of facial infirmity. <em>See, e.g., In re Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>690 F.3d 650, 663 (5th Cir.2012) (rule of orderliness).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The Center contends that circumstances have changed since <em>Carmouche </em>because, while previous State officials enforced the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act in accordance with <em>Carmouche, </em>the officials currently in office do not, and thus, the</p>\n<p id=\"Ar3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Center faces the risk of an unconstitutional application of the statute against it. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim. Federal courts may adjudicate claims only when they are based on \u201cconcrete\u201d injuries that are \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cimminent,\u201d not merely \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (citations omitted). To enjoin government conduct that has not yet occurred, there must be a showing that unlawful conduct is sufficiently likely to occur. <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). Here, the record is entirely devoid of, one, any indication of what sort of political speech the Center intends to create, and two, any reason to think that the State will unconstitutionally burden or suppress that speech. In other words, the record is devoid of relevant facts suggesting a real dispute between the parties. <em>See Jordahl v. Democratic Party, </em>122 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1997) (declining to adjudicate First Amendment challenge to campaign finance disclosure statute because there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of \u201cactual or threatened [enforcement] of the [statute]\u201d); <em>Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8 v. </em>Bowen, 752 F.3d 827, 839 (9th Cir.2014) (declining to adjudicate First Amendment challenge to statute requiring certain disclosures because the plaintiff could not demonstrate any \u201cconcrete plan to engage in protected conduct\u201d that could fall within the ambit of the statute); <em>Full Value Advisors, LLC v. S.E.C., </em>633 F.3d 1101, 1106 (D.C.Cir.2011) (declining to adjudicate First Amendment challenge to certain disclosure provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 when \u201cit is not yet certain [the company would] be required to comply with [the disclosure provisions]\u201d); <em>cf. Elend v. Basham, </em>471 F.3d 1199, 1211 (11th Cir.2006) (declining to adjudicate First Amendment claim involving protest rights because the \u201canalysis depends so critically on the location and circumstances of the protest zone\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t know when [the plaintiffs] will protest, we don\u2019t know where they will protest, and we don\u2019t know how they will protest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u201cA court is not permitted to prescribe how a state must deal with disputes that have never arisen and may never do so.\u201d <em>Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. Paradise, </em>138 F.3d 1183, 1187 (7th Cir.1998). \u201cSuch a foray is the paradigm of an advisory opinion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
