Chaney. King challenges the finding that she lacked standing to sue on her daughter\u2019s behalf, pointing out that the magistrate judge allowed her to file an amended complaint and that she had obtained the permission of her deceased daughter\u2019s husband to file the complaint against the members of the Texas Medical Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">This court reviews a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) de novo. <em>Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 364 (5th Cir.2008). Standing must be shown to provide an Article III court with subject matter jurisdiction over the case. <em>K.P. v. LeBlanc, </em>729 F.3d 427, 436 (5th Cir.2013). A party must have standing under the state\u2019s wrongful death or survival statutes to bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Pluet v. Frasier, </em>355 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Rhyne v. Henderson County, </em>973 F.2d 386, 390-91 (5th Cir.1992). In order for King to bring a survival action on behalf of her daughter or her estate, Texas law requires proof that King is the administrator of her daughter\u2019s pending estate or, if the administration of the estate is unnecessary, that she is an heir of the estate. <em>Mayhew v. Dealey, </em>143 S.W.3d 356, 370 (Tex.App.2004). Under state law, if. King\u2019s daughter died intestate, her heirs are her spouse and children. TEX. EST. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 201.002, 201.003. King has not provided any evidence whether her daughter died testate or intestate or whether her estate is under administration or will be administered. Further, King has not shown that she is a rightful heir. Thus, she has not shown that she has standing to bring a survival action on behalf of her daughter or her estate. The district court\u2019s dismissal of King\u2019s claim brought on behalf of her daughter\u2019s estate for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is affirmed. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-19\">In addition to her claims on her daughter\u2019s behalf, King alleged that she had been emotionally and financially harmed by the death of her daughter. Under Texas law, the parents of the deceased may bring a wrongful death action for the loss of support and companionship of their adult child. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 71.004. King may have standing to file suit for her personal losses. However, although King characterizes her claims as being constitutional in nature, her com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>plaint and other pleadings allege that the Board members were negligent in failing to exercise their duty of ordinary and reasonable care owed to her daughter. In her briefs, she complains that the Board was negligent in failing to impose sufficient sanctions upon her daughter\u2019s doctor to prevent him from engaging in his medical practice. Mere negligence is not sufficient to prove a substantive due process claim. <em>McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314, 325 (5th Cir.2002). King\u2019s allegations that the disciplinary action taken by the Board against her daughter\u2019s doctor in 1999 was not sufficiently stringent to prevent her daughter\u2019s death in 2008 did not reflect that the Board members engaged in egregious or arbitrary conduct that would support a substantive due process claim. <em>Id. </em>at 326. If King has standing to make a wrongful death claim, her complaint is still subject to dismissal for failure to state a valid constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>at 325-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED with respect to the dismissal of King\u2019s claim brought on behalf of her daughter or her estate based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Insofar as King sought relief for her personal losses, the dismissal is AFFIRMED, but it is MODIFIED so as to be a dismissal of King\u2019s personal claim based on her failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
