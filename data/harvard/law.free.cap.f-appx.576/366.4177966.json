The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Hicks and dismissed as frivolous the claims against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Bell does not challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Hicks with regard to the accident. He argues that Hicks was deliberately indifferent to his health and safety when Hicks moved the bus from the freeway to a gas station after the accident, knowing that the brakes had failed. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them, <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Bell has not briefed any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to amend to add this claim or its failure to address this issue, any such challenge is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Similarly, Bell has abandoned by failing to adequately brief any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that there was no legal basis for holding Ward liable for Hicks\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) of Bell\u2019s claims against Dr. Avila. <em>See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767 (5th Cir.2009). Bell alleged that at least two nurses saw him on the date of the accident, and he did not allege any facts that Dr. Avila knew of and wantonly disregarded a serious medical condition or that any delay in treatment resulted in substantial harm. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Bell\u2019s claims against Dr. Avila. <em>See Brewster, </em>587 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">Bell filed several motions to compel discovery and for the disclosure of documents by Hicks and moved in the district court for sanctions against Hicks\u2019s attorney for failing to provide him with copies of all of the exhibits attached to Hicks\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court denied these motions because Hicks was entitled to qualified immunity, which shielded him from unnecessary discovery and because Bell had attached to his pleading the missing documents. Bell makes no argument challenging these determinations and, thus, has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of these motions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Bell\u2019s assertion that defense counsel should be sanctioned for making false declarations to the court is not supported by the record, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Bell\u2019s motions for sanctions on that basis. <em>See Friends for Am. Free Enterprise Ass\u2019n v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>284 F.3d 575, 577-78 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">He has not adequately briefed any argument in support of his conclusional assertion that the district court was biased against him. Accordingly, this argument is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
