The IJ recited numerous inconsistencies upon which he based his credibility finding, and the BIA recounted many of those inconsistencies in its decision. Singh has not shown that the totality of the circumstances underlying the credibility finding, as explained by the IJ and BIA, compels a different conclusion. <em>See Wang v.
