Motions to reopen are disfavored, and the moving party must carry a heavy burden. <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006). The denial of such a motion is reviewed \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date on which the final administrative decision is issued. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). An alien is not bound by this time limit, however, if the motion is made for purposes of applying for asylum or for withholding of removal \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Rabari does not contest that he failed to file his motion within the 90-day time limit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Although he cites new evidence not contained in the administrative record to show a change of country conditions in India, we may not consider this evidence. <em>See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, </em>741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir.2014). To the extent that Rabari has not otherwise abandoned his appeal through his failure to brief his arguments adequately, <em>see Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003), his conclu-sional assertions that his motion to reopen should have been granted are wholly insufficient to show that the BIA abused its discretion. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez, </em>435 F.3d at 549. His petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
