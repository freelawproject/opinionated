The district court dismissed Schmidt\u2019s complaint without prejudice \u201cas malicious under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae for [Schmidt\u2019s] abuse of the judicial process.\u201d Specifically, the district court dismissed Schmidt\u2019s complaint as a sanction for his failure to disclose two prior federal actions on his standard prisoner complaint form. On appeal, Schmidt argues that the district court abused its discretion because his omissions were unintentional. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, a district court must dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>action if the court determines that the action is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cDiscretion means the district court has a range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">Generally, a dismissal without prejudice does not constitute an abuse of discretion because the plaintiff may simply refile his complaint. <em>See Dynes v. Army Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>720 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir.1983) (concluding that dismissal without prejudice for failing to file a court-ordered brief was not an abuse of discretion). Where, however, a dismissal without prejudice has the effect of precluding the plaintiff from refiling his complaint because the statute of limitations has run, it is tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice. <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1482 n. 15 (11th Cir.1993). Dismissal with prejudice is a drastic sanction to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>used only where lesser sanctions are not appropriate. <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 1915, \u201c[a] finding that the plaintiff engaged in bad faith litigiousness or manipulative tactics warrants dismissal.\u201d <em>Attwood v. Singletary, </em>105 F.3d 610, 613 (11th Cir.1997) (applying prior version of \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(l), then codified as \u00a7 1915(d), and affirming a dismissal with prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Schmidt\u2019s complaint. Schmidt filed his action on a standard prisoner complaint form, which required him to answer a series of questions about his previous lawsuits under penalty of perjury. In response to one question, Schmidt indicated that he had never filed any previous actions in federal court that had been dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim or prior to service. The complaint form also warned that the failure to disclose all prior civil cases could result in the dismissal of his present action and that if he was unsure of any prior cases, \u201cthat fact must be disclosed as well.\u201d Schmidt wrote next to his answer, \u201cnot to my memory.\u201d Schmidt, however, had at least two earlier federal actions dismissed prior to service or for abuse of judicial process. Thus, under penalty of perjury, and knowing that failure to disclose these two prior actions could lead to dismissal, Schmidt failed to include those two dismissed federal actions on his complaint form.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">We cannot say it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to sanction Schmidt for his omissions, especially given that the dismissal was without prejudice and Schmidt can refile his complaint. We note that Schmidt does not argue that he will be precluded from refiling a complaint with the same claims. Furthermore, a review of the dismissed complaint indicates that the operative facts began in October 2011, when Defendant Krista Navarro brought civil and criminal charges against Schmidt, suggesting Schmidt was (and is) still within the applicable four-year statute of limitations. <em>See City of Hialeah, Fla. v. Rojas, </em>311 F.3d 1096, 1103 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that the limitations period for \u00a7 1983 claims is governed by the forum state\u2019s residual personal injury statute of limitations, which in Florida is four years).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Schmidt contends the dismissal was improper because it was <em>sua sponte </em>and he was not given notice and an opportunity to respond. The record belies this claim. A magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending that Schmidt\u2019s action be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), and Schmidt objected to the R &amp; R. The district court reviewed the R &amp; R <em>de novo </em>before adopting it and dismissing Schmidt\u2019s complaint. Under the circumstances, Schmidt received adequate notice and an opportunity to respond and was not denied due process. <em>See Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2001) (finding no due process violation where the plaintiff was given an opportunity to object to the R &amp; R, and the district court conducted a <em>de novo </em>review before dismissing the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">To the extent Schmidt argues that the instant dismissal and his two earlier dismissals do not constitute \u201cstrikes\u201d under the three-strikes provision in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), the district court dismissed Schmidt\u2019s complaint as malicious under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), not as a violation of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1347-48 (11th Cir.2004) (ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>plaining that there are \u201cthree separate provisions of the PLRA\u201d\u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), 1915(g), and 1915A \u2014 any of which may be used to dismiss a complaint brought by a prisoner proceeding <em>in forma </em>pauperis). By its terms, \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) applies to <em>all </em>complaints filed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>without regard to the plaintiffs past litigation. Thus, whether any of these three dismissals constitutes a \u201cstrike\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g) is not an issue presented in this appeal. Also, contrary to Schmidt\u2019s claims, \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) applies regardless of whether the plaintiff is challenging his conditions of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Schmidt\u2019s complaint without prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Because dismissal as a sanction under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) was proper, we do not address Schmidt\u2019s arguments as to the sufficiency of the pleadings in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. Schmidt\u2019s complaint includes allegations that Defendant Navarro breached a business contract with Schmidt in \"July or August of 2010.\u201d To the extent Schmidt asserted state contract claims, they still are not barred by Florida's five-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.1 l(2)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
