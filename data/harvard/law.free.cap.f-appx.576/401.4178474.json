He argues that the district court reversibly erred by refusing to grant a third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) and that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>court erred by imposing a term of supervised release without referencing any particularized facts warranting imposing such a sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The Government concedes that there was error in this regard but argues that the error was harmless. A procedural error may be harmless, even if the district court does not consider the correct guidelines range, if the proponent of the sentence can show that the district court would have imposed the same sentence for the same reasons absent the error. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 713-19 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The record reflects that the district court was aware that it could reduce Garcia\u2019s total offense level by one level. The district court listened to Garcia\u2019s arguments in support of a lower sentence. The district court concluded that a 55-month sentence was appropriate in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In making this determination, the district court specifically relied upon Garcia\u2019s personal characteristics, the serious nature of the offense of conviction, and Garcia\u2019s criminal history. In imposing the sentence, the district court stated that it would impose the same sentence \u201ceven without that advisory system.\u201d In light of the totality of the record, any error committed was harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The district court retains the discretion to impose supervised release in cases involving a deportable alien where added deterrence and protection are needed. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012). Here, the district court adopted the pre-sentence report, which informed the court of the recommendation contained at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). At sentencing the district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the personal characteristics of Garcia, and specifically found that there was \u201ca serious need to promote respect for the law\u201d in light of his criminal history, as well as a need to protect the public and Garcia from himself. The district court\u2019s implicit consideration of \u00a7 5D1.1 and its consideration of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a) satisfies the requirement that the district court provide reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 350-51 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
