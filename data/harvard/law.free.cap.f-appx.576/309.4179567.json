Because Woods committed the offense after two prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses, he was considered a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He now argues that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because his sentence is grossly disproportionate to his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-22\">Although we ordinarily review claims of constitutional error de novo, <em>United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 377 (5th Cir.2000), we have applied a plain error standard of review to constitutional challenges not raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Ebron, </em>683 F.3d 105, 155 (5th Cir.2012). Woods argued in the district court against the career offender designation and noted that \u201cbased on a proportionality argument, if ... he wasn\u2019t a career offender, he would be in a range of 27 to about 36 months.\u201d Regardless whether this objection was sufficient to preserve the issue raised on appeal, Woods has failed to demonstrate any error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">The Eighth Amendment \u201cpreclude^] a sentence that is greatly disproportionate to the offense, because such sentences are \u2018cruel and unusual.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGruder v. Puckett, </em>954 F.2d 313, 315 (5th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). In determining whether a sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate, we make a threshold comparison of the gravity of the offense against the severity of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>627 F.3d 146, 160 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>McGruder, </em>954 F.2d at 316).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">When measured against the benchmark in <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980), Woods\u2019s sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the severity of his controlled substance offense. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 943 (5th Cir.1997), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 234, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010). Thus, no further comparison is required. <em>See McGruder, </em>954 F.2d at 316. Moreover, Woods\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tence was within the Guidelines, which are a \u201cconvincing objective indicator of proportionality.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
