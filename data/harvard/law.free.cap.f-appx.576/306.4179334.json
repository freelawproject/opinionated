On appeal, Maillet argues that the district court committed procedural error. He also contends that he is entitled to the return of snakes that the Government allegedly seized from his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">Even if the parties do not challenge the appellate jurisdiction of this court, we must examine the basis of our jurisdiction, sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). This court has jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, certain interlocutory decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, and partial judgments certified as final under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). <em>United States v. Powell, </em>468 F.3d 862, 863 (5th Cir.2006). For an order to be a final judgment it must end the litigation and leave nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment. <em>Silver Star Enters., Inc., v. M/V SARAMACCA, </em>19 F.3d 1008, 1013 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">The order that Maillet asked the district court to reconsider is not a final judgment. As Maillet\u2019s criminal proceedings had ended, the district court\u2019s order properly construed his Rule 41(g) motion for return of property as a civil action arising under \u00a7 1331. <em>See Clymore v. United States, 217 </em>F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s order did not rule, nor purport to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>rule, on the merits of Maillet\u2019s claim. Because the district court had not yet ruled on the merits of Maillet\u2019s filing, its order did not \u201cleave nothing for the court to do but execute judgment.\u201d <em>See Silver Star Enter., </em>19 F.3d at 1013. Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of Maillet\u2019s motion for reconsideration is non-appealable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">No other exception to the final judgment rule applies to the district court\u2019s order construing Maillet\u2019s claim as a civil action. The ruling does not constitute an appeal-able interlocutory order. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1292. Finally, the district court\u2019s ruling does not fall within a jurisprudential exception to the final order rule. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>218 F.3d 415, 420-22 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Accordingly, Maillet\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction, and all outstanding motions are denied as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
