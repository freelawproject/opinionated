He contends that the district court erred in increasing his total offense level for reckless endangerment during flight on the basis that he tossed bundles of marijuana from a moving vehicle toward oncoming traffic. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">We pretermit determination of the standard of review in connection with Vasquez\u2019s claim that the district court made a mistaken finding in connection with the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement because he cannot prevail under either standard. <em>See United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). In making its findings, the district court was free to rely on the information in the presentence report (PSR) that Vasquez tossed the marijuana bundles at oncoming traffic. <em>See United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992). It was Vasquez\u2019s burden to show that the PSR was inaccurate. <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995). Vasquez, however, presented no evidence about the tossed bundles.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">In addition, we reject Vasquez\u2019s contention that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. The district court imposed a sentence below the PSR\u2019s recommended guidelines range. As the district court made clear, it selected the sentence in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Vasquez has provided us with no basis for questioning the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in evaluating the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">Vasquez concedes that his contention that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to sentences calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) is foreclosed, and he raises the issue solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
