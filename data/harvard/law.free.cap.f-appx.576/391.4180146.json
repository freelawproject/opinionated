Relying on <em>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) <em>(National Federation), </em>he contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. He argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied because there was no testimony or stipulation that his possession of the firearm was an economic activity or that he was engaged in the relevant market at the time of the regulated conduct. Further, he contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because <em>National Federation </em>interpreted the Commerce Clause to mandate that \u201cCongress may regulate only ongoing economic activity,\u201d and his possession of a firearm purchased many years ago does not qualify. The Government moves for summary affirmance, or in the alternative, for an extension of time to file an appel-lee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We review preserved sufficiency of the evidence and constitutional claims de novo. <em>See United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 256 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>602 F.3d 313, 315 (5th Cir.2010). Since our decision in <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>889 F.2d 580, 583 (5th Cir.1989), we have consistently held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1570, 188 L.Ed.2d 579 (2014). <em>National Federation </em>did not overrule this court\u2019s precedent upholding \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 146. Accordingly, Lister\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 146 &amp; n. 4; <em>United States v. Meza, </em>701 F.3d 411, 418 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Therefore, we GRANT the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, DENY its alternative motion for an extension of time to file an appellee\u2019s brief, and AFFIRM Lister\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
