Specifically, Dresser-Rand contends three of the five Board members were not properly appointed by the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">In May 2013, the appeal was placed in abeyance pending a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>NLRB v. Noel Canning, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2550, 189 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014). In June 2014, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Noel Canning </em>and agreed with Dresser-Rand that the President\u2019s recess appointments to the Board were unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 2578.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Dresser-Rand moves to lift the abeyance in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. That motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">The Board also filed a motion asking this Court to grant Dresser-Rand\u2019s petition, vacate the unconstitutionally constituted Board\u2019s decision, and to remand this case to the Board for further proceedings. The Board also asks that the mandate issue expeditiously. Dresser-Rand opposes remand arguing all of the issues are fully briefed and ripe for review, and remand will add unnecessary delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">The Board\u2019s request is consistent with our practice when the Board has previously acted without lawful authority to render a decision. For example, in <em>Bentonite Performance Mineral LLC v. NLRB, </em>while the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided that the then two-member Board lacked authority adjudicate cases. 382 Fed.Appx. 402, 403 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citing <em>New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, </em>560 U.S. 674, 130 S.Ct. 2635, 177 L.Ed.2d 162 (2010)). We vacated the Board\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, nearly every circuit has vacated and remanded the Board\u2019s decisions during the applicable time period in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Noel Canning.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>We see no reason to depart from that practice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Therefore, the Board\u2019s motion is GRANTED. Dresser-Rand\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED, the order of the Board is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Further, the Clerk of the Court is directed to issue the mandate expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
