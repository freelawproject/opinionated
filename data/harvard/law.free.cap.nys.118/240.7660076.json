There is no ground for a reargument. This court, upon mature deliberation and discussion, affirmed the order appealed from by a vote of three to two. The affirmance by this court, without an opinion, of an order of the trial court, made in the exercise of its discretion, setting aside the verdict of a jury, is not to be taken as an approval in any degree of the expression by the trial court of its views in colloquy with counsel. All that is determined is that this court has declined to reverse an order, made in the discretion of the Trial Term, directing a new trial, upon which new trial all the issues are to be presented de novo to another jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">The motion is denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
