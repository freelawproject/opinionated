The libel is contained in a letter, addressed to the lodge and read to its members, purporting to be a complaint against the plaintiff, with specifications, on which charges were later based, upon the trial of which the plaintiff was exonerated. The \u25a0 defendant contends that this was a privileged communication, in consequence of which it devolved upon the plaintiff, before he could' recover, to prove the existence of express malice, and that the le\u00e1rned trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the complaint, and in submitting to the jury as a question of fact whether or not the communication was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">The facts upon which the defendant bases his claim of privilege were in dispute, and it therefore became the duty of the trial court to submit that question to the jury. It is only where such facts are not controverted that a trial court is privileged to determine, as matter of law, that the writing containing the libel is a privileged com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>munication. Lovell Co. v. Houghton, 116 N. Y. 520, 22 N. E. 1066, 6 L. R. A. 363. So fair and impartial was the charge of the learned trial justice that no exception was taken to any portion of it by counsel for either party, and no objection was taken to the submission of the question as to whether the communication was privileged. The question as to whether the plaintiff had proven actual malice was also one of fact for the determination of the jury. Hamilton v. Eno, 81 N. Y. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The verdict is supported by the evidence, and the judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
