The expenses for packing and for transportation of the same to said city of San Francisco shall be paid from my estate. The whole collection of these articles shall be designated and be known by the name of \u2018The Emanuel Walter Art Collection\u2019 and shall be delivered by my executors to the Art Museum of the city of San Francisco, California, and become the property of said art museum forever. This collection shall be kept in a suitable room or in suitable rooms connected with such art museum, and such room or such rooms shall be known and designated \u2018The Emanuel Walter Art Collection.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-13\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing such a suitable room or suitable rooms, and to keep them in good repair, I hereby give and bequeath to said art museum the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-14\">\u201cIf in the judgment of my executors and trustees it would be advisable to have my nephew Edgar Walter act as superintendent or director of said \u2018Emanuel Walter Art Collection,\u2019 and should he be willing to so act, then I hereby order and direct that my executors and trustees shall invest the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in first-class securities, and the accruing interest of such fund shall be paid to said Edgar Walter as a salary for his services as such superintendent or director, in annual installments. Should said Edgar Walter, however, resign as such superintendent or direct- or, or for any reason become disqualified to serve, then this amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) shall revert to my estate and shall be disposed of in the same manner as hereinafter provided with reference to the rest, residue and remainder of my estate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-15\">Neither at the time when the will was executed in the year 1904 nor at any time was there an association or corporation named the \u201cArt Museum of the City of San Francisco, California,\u201d and the issue presented is whether the testator had reference to the \u201cSan Francisco Art Association,\u201d an organization affiliated with the Regents of the University of California, and constituting the- \u201cMark Hopkins Institute of Art,\u201d or whether he intended to describe as the legatee the city of San Francisco, which conducted a museum of applied arts, known as the \u201cGolden Gate Park Museum.\u201d In March, 1894, when the testator left San Francisco, the Park Museum had not actually come into existence. The building which it subsequently occupied was one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of the buildings designed for the \u201cMid-winter Exhibition\u201d of 1894; and. while the testator visited the exposition and this particular building among others, there is nothing to indicate that he actually knew of the project\u2014 developing after the exposition closed and a surplus of the funds was found \u2014to establish a permanent museum of applied arts at this place. On the other hand, the San Francisco Art Association had an established institution for the exhibition of the fine arts, and controlled a very large and well-known building donated for the purpose. Close relatives of the testator were members of the association, and he himself had often attended at its rooms. His nephew Edgar Walter\u2014designated by the will to act as superintendent of the collection\u2014had obtained his technical training as a sculptor in the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, the school affiliated with the Art Association, and while assisting the testator in the collection of these works of art in Europe, during five or six summers, had often spoken of the Art Association where specimens of his work as a sculptor were exhibited with mention of their-merits in a pamphlet issued by the association and which the testator had seen and commented upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-Fg\">It would thus appear that the only institution actually meeting the description of an \u201cArt Museum\u201d in San Francisco at the time when the testator left that city was the San Francisco Art Association, and that this was the legatee which he had in mind is, I think, rendered quite clear by the naming of his nephew Edgar, for whom he evidently had much affectionate regard, as superintendent or custodian of the collection. Edgar Walter\u2019s interest in the Art Association was well known to the testator. They had been in close companionship in the work of making a collection, and it does violence to the probabilities to assume that the testator would have named this nephew to take charge of the display of that collection in some other institution more or less in 'rivalry. The testimony of Mr. De Young, called as a witness for the city of San Francisco, has been so far infirmed, intrinsically, by the circumstances to which the witness referred, that I cannot give it much weight. This witness, who had been an active and, indeed, the prime mover in establishing the \u201cGolden Gate Park Museum,\u201d testified that he knew the testator; that in a conversation had with him relative to the witness\u2019 collection of ivories Mr. Walter had said that he himself had some fine specimens of ivories which he had picked up; and that some day he would give them to \u201cyour museum.\u201d The ivories thus seen by Mr. Walter, however, Were on exhibition at the rooms at the Art Association, and the conversation must have had reference to this exhibit, since the testator was never in San Francisco after Mr. De Young\u2019s ivories were placed in the Park Museum. Hence, in the absence of any actual proof that Mr. Walter knew of the projected Park Museum, or of Mr. De Young\u2019s connection with it, the words used by him would appear to relate to the Art Association rather than to the Park Museum-. But, on cross-examination, the witness became more explicit and gave testimony which, if acceptable, would point directly to an intention on the part of the testator to benefit the Park Museum. This testimony was: \u201cHe (testator) opened the conversation by saying: \u2018That is a fine museum you have out in the park. I enjoyed very much visiting it. I see you have been working at your fad on ivories. You have quite a nice collection of them.\u2019 He then remarked: \u2018You have a very fine collection of ivories in your own house\u2014so have I.\u2019 As far as I can recollect he then added: T intend some day to give my curios and ivories to your museum.\u2019 \u201d Now, it was impossible for the testator to have visited the Park Museum, because he left San Francisco before it was opened. And yet the witness testified that this conversation was had on one of the testator\u2019s \u201creturn visits\u201d to San Francisco after 1894, visits which, in fact, were never made. The witness\u2019 subsequent withdrawal of his statement that the place of the conversation was San Francisco necessarily takes all force from the proof that is offered to, show the testator\u2019s knowledge of the Park Museum and his intention to make some disposal of his collection in its favor; and it appears from the testimony of Edgar Walter that at no time during his close association with the testator after the latter\u2019s departure from San Francisco and during all the years devoted to making the collection of paintings was any word spoken by Mr. Walter indicating that he knew about the Park Museum at all. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>proof stands, I am impressed with the fact that the testator had in mind, when making his will, the only place of art exhibition in San Francisco (satisfying the artist\u2019s use of the word \u201cmuseum\u201d) which was well established in 1904, and with which he was familiar and his family identified, and that the words \u201cof the city of San Francisco,\u201d which are equally suggestive of location or ownership, and were used in the sense of location merely. The circumstances all point to this intention, and, indeed, so far as he named the person to take charge of the exhibit beyond the power of the legatee to remove or replace, the will could not have been fully carried out, for this condition the city of San Francisco had no lawful authority to meet.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">As to the forty-second clause of this will, therefore, my construction is that the words \u201cArt Museum of the City of San Francisco\u201d described the \u201cSan Francisco Art Association,\u201d conducting the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">The provisions of paragraph forty-third as to which construction is sought are as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situated, I give and bequeath to my executors and trustees, in trust for the following uses, intents and purposes: The proceeds of the sales of all this rest, residue and remainder of my estate shall be invested in first-class securities, and the interest derived therefrom shall be used by my executors and trustees for the support, if necessary, and in aiding any of my needy kin of the first six degrees, provided that, in the sole discretion and judgment of my executors and trustees, such action is advisable. Any and all of the accruing interest not so expended by my executors and trustees shall become a part of the principal. It is, however, provided that the trust hereby created shall cease after the expiration of fifty (50) years from the time of my death, and then the total amount of the principal and the accrued interest shall be divided among all the members of my kin, up to and inclusive of the sixth degree of kinship, in equal parts, share and share alike, for the own use, benefit and behoof of these respective kinfolk forever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">The 50-year limitation of the trust, not being measured by lives, operates to render the trust itself invalid and unenforceable. This proposition needs no argument as the parties concede, and the question for discussion is whether the devise and bequest to \u201call the members of my kin up to and inclusive of the sixth.degree of kinship in equal parts\u201d may be upheld, and the estate be taken to vest in them at the testator\u2019s death, eliminating the invalid limitation of years to which the distribution was postponed. In my view, this result would be violative of settled principles of testamentary construction; it being apparent that the 50-year limitation and a distribution at the expiration of that period were integral parts of a complete scheme for the disposal of the residuary estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-9\">In the case of Central Trust Company v. Egleston, 185 N. Y. 23, 28, 33, 77 N. E. 989, 991, 992, it was said: \u201cIt is the very plain duty of the courts to find out what a testator has meant to do with his property after his death, and, then, if it be possible to give his plan effect by a construction which will validate it, to do so, but the court cannot make a new will for him; nor should it be expected to resolve into lawfulness \u25a0 of disposition some tangle of desire to provide for future contingencies. The inquiry, in each case, must be what provisions has the testator intended to make for the disposition of his estate and not whether he intended to dispose of his estate according to the statutory rules governing testamentary dispositions. When the provisions are ascertained and understood, then is their legality to be determined.\u201d And again: \u201cNor can it be successfully argued that such (invalid) provisions of the will may be lopped off without prejudice to the testator\u2019s plans. The question is, as I had before suggested, what provisions the testator intended to make and to determine their validity as made. As it was observed by Judge Martin, in Herzog v. Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., 177 N. Y. 86, 69 N. E. 283, 67 L. R. A. 146: \u2018The intent to be discovered is not whether he intended to make a valid disposition of his estate, but what provisions he in fact intended to make. When that is found it is for the court to determine whether such intended provisions are valid or otherwise. * * * The duty of the court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to interpret, not to construct.\u2019 \u201d In Tilden v. Green, 130 N. Y. 29, 51, 28 N. E. 880, 884, 14 L. R. A. 33, 27 Am. St. Rep. 487, after a discussion of the authorities, the court said: \u201cThe result of these and other cases is that in applying the rule invoked by the appellants, which permits unlawful trusts to be eliminated from the will and those that are lawful to be enforced, we must not violate the intention of the testator, or destroy the scheme that he has created for the disposition of his property. We may enforce and effectuate his will and give full effect to his intent, provided it does not violate any cardinal rule of law, but we cannot make a new will or build up a scheme for the purpose of carrying out what might be thought wise or would be in accordance with his wishes.\u201d Where invalid provisions have been eliminated from a will, and the devise or bequest so far as valid upheld,' the result has always been reached with due regard to this rule. Kalish v. Kalish, 166 N. Y. 368, 59 N. E. 917, was a case of an attempted unlawful suspension which could be cut out and still leave the substantial disposal of the property unaffected, and the court said: \u201cHere we are not required to make a new will for the testator. We have a valid life estate, followed by a void intermediate trust for five years, succeeded by a valid ultimate trust and good remainders. The void intermediate trust .is for the benefit of the same legatees who take under the ultimate trust and remainders, respectively. The excision of the void trust simply gives immediate effect to those ulterior devises which under it were to be postponed for five years. The same persons take in the same proportions as before.\u201d In Smith v. Chesebrough, 176 N. Y. 317, 68 N. E. 625, the doctrine of acceleration was applied to an invalid postponement of two years, and the intermediate transfer to the designated takers (whose interests were vested, subject only to the postponement) was decreed; the court saying: \u201cBy taking out of the codicil the invalid provision for postponement, the only change in the testator\u2019s plan for the disposition of his residuary estate is that the physical possession of the remainder is accelerated so as to take effect upon the testator\u2019s death instead of two years later. In all other respects the testamentary scheme is not only essentially, but literally, preserved.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">It is quite plain from the language employed by the testator that the assistance of his \u201cneedy kin\u201d for 50 years was the main purpose for this residuary provision, in furtherance of which purpose he provided for the increase of the principal fund by the addition of income not presently required\u2014a future and possibly more needy generation to benefit by the increase which would thus result. To eliminate this provision and to direct that the residuary estate should be enjoyed immediately by the persons who now answer the description of \u201ckin up to and inclusive of the sixth degree of kinship\u201d would so materially change the intended result as to amount to the reconstruction of the will. Again, the persons to enjoy the income were not kin to the sixth degree, but only \u201cneedy kin.\u201d Thus to accelerate the position would be to give to the remaindermen a benefit which the testator never intended them to have in any possible aspect, and it would also appear that the present kin to the sixth degree were not the remaindermen whom the testator had in mind. True, in legal acceptance, a man\u2019s kin for the purposes of succession are those who are found at his death, but I think it must be held that, as the testator used the term, it was applied in a more general sense and described his relatives who would answer the description of kin to the sixth degree-at the end of the fifty years\u2019 period. He says in his will: \u201cThe trusts hereby created shall cease after the expiration of fifty years from the time of my death, and then the total amount of the principal and accrued interest shall be divided among all the members of my kin up to and inclusive of the sixth degree of kinship.\u201d These words evidently referred to a class of persons to be determined in the future, not to the mere, future enjoyment by a presently known class, and it is-impossible to find any other meaning without straining the language used to the verge of absurdity. While the law favors a construction which would avoid intestacy, this does not mean the law may presume the testator\u2019s knowledge that he has made a faulty will, and construe the words as used with a view to save the fragments of the testamentary rights after an expected successful onslaught upon its solemn provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">The testator\u2019s intention, as expressed in the forty-third paragraph, is not open to doubt, and, since the residuary estate cannot lawfully be disposed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>upon a construction of the will which would be in substantial harmony with that intention, I must hold that, so far, he died intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">The twenty-eighth paragraph of the will contained a bequest as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">\u201cTwenty-Eight: I hereby give and bequeath to Max Hessberg, of the firm of Knauth, Nachod &amp; Kuehne, of New York City, the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for the purpose of dividing the same among.such needy relatives, on her parental side, of my deceased mother Rosa Walter, n\u00e9e Hess-berg, late of Reckendorf, Bavaria, as he in his discretion and judgment may select.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\">Max Hessberg, the legatee named, survived the testator, but has since died, and the plaintiffs seek a direction in the matter of paying the legacy to his personal representatives, who have signified their willingness and intention to disburse the amount in accordance with the purpose intended by the testator. Certainly the words used did not create a trust, and the right of the legatee to receive or'hold the legacy was not made conditional upon the continuation of his life until the amount was disbursed by him, nor upon the willingness of his executors so to disburse it. Since he was living when the will became effective, the legacy did not abate, and the fact that he has died does not really affect the question: for, if the legatee was entitled to the legacy, then his personal representatives may, of course, take it. The only theory upon which the payment of this legacy could be withheld would be that the testator intended to create an express trust void in law, but no such contention is made by any of the parties, and the words of this clause, as to the legatee\u2019s payment over to persons whom he may select in his discretion from among the members of a certain class, import an intention not to create a trust. Harper v. Phelps, 21 Conn. 257-269 ; 2 Story, Eq. Jud. \u00a7\u2022\u00a7 1070, 1071; Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725, 3 Sup. Ct. 575, 27 L. Ed. 1089.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">The legacy provided for in the twenty-eighth clause should, therefore, be paid to the defendants Sommerich, Hessberg and Wolf, as executors of Max Hessberg, deceased. Proposed findings and judgment may be submitted in accordance with this opinion upon notice of settlement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">Bischoff, J., also filed an opinion upon application for an allowance, as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-10\">As I have had occasion to rule in Hafner v. Hafner, 34 Misc. Rep. 99, 69 N. Y. Supp. 460, allowances to defendants, in addition to costs, under section 3253 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cannot be made in an action for the construction of a will. This situation results from the framing of sections 3252 and 3253, which are similar to the corresponding provisions of sections 308 and 309 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as construed in Downing v. Marshall, 37 N. Y. 380. Such slight changes of phraseology as have occurred in these provisions do not affect the force of Downing v. Marshall as an authority (Re Holden, 126 N. Y. 589, 27 N. E. 1063), and the case of Allen v. Stevens, 161 N. Y. 123, 55 N. E. 568, cannot well be viewed as supporting a different rule. True, in that case the court assumed that there was power in the court below to grant advances to the defendants, but the question was not presented for discussion, since it appears that each party who app\u00e9aled from the allowance to the other had an allowance to protect for his own part, and the quantum only was the subject of the appeal, not the power to make an allowance, which power the parties evidently conceded in their common interest. The guardian ad litem for one of the defendants has rendered services of a substantial character, and an allowance for his services should certainly be awarded to him if the court had the power to do so. If additional allowances could be made to defendants in the action under section 3253 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it would appear that the infant defendant could properly be granted an allowance in addition to costs, like any other defendant represented by counsel in the litigation. Such an allowance, when awarded, would be of the character of the \u201ctaxed costs\u201d by which a guardian ad litem\u2019s compensation may be measured (Re Robinson, 40 App. Div. 30, 33, 57 N. Y. Supp. 523), and is to be distinguished from a general award to the guardian\u2014without the scope of section 3253, and made from a fund not actually belonging to the infant\u2014\u25a0 as1 in Doremus v. Crosby, 66 Hun, 125, sub nom. Doremus v. Doremus, 20 N. Y. Supp. 906, and in the cases therein referred to. The distinction is noted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Re Robinson, supra, after a review of the authorities including the case of Doremus v. Orosby, and there would appear to be no proper theory upon which an infant party is to be excluded from the benefit of section 3253 where an adult defendant similarly situated would receive an additional allowance under that section because of his appearance and participation in litigation to which he has been joined, to the end that the proper disposal of a fund before the court may be made with a joinder of all necessary parties. Where the situation is such that a party defendant, if an adult, would be granted from the fund in suit an allowance in addition to costs under section 3253, the policy of the law would certainly not require that, because of infancy, compensation for the services of counsel must be withheld, or, which is the same thing, deducted from the infant\u2019s own particular share in the fund. The unfairness to the infant of such a result is obvious, and it is certainly uncalled for upon what appears to me to be the proper reading of the authorities in connection with the apparent meaning of section 3253 of the Code. Were this a case other than for the construction of a will, therefore, I could properly grant a statutory allowance to this infant defendant, as in the case of others, but in view of the rule stated in Hafner v. Hafner, supra, no allowance may be made other than to the plaintiffs, and, since the infant has no interest in a fund from which compensation to the guardian for necessary services may be directed to be made, the court can find no means of providing that compensation in the judgment be entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\">Decision and judgment signed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b300-6\">Argued before INGRAHAM, ' McLAUGHLIN, LAUGHLIN, CLARKE, and HOUGHTON, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-7\">Rose &amp; Putzel, for appellants Erank and Hessberg.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-8\">Emil Goldmark, guardian ad litem for appellant Bruckner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-9\">Wolf &amp; ICohn, for appellant Backhaus.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-10\">S.
