Judgment has been entered dismissing the complaint on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Applying the rule that the plaintiff is entitled to the most favorable inference that can be drawn from the evidence, the jury might have found that the automobile approached the crossing without giving any warning, that it was going fast when it hit the plaintiff, -and that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The plaintiff was not permitted to testify because, at the time of the trial, a year after the accident, he did not possess sufficient intelligence to comprehend the nature of an oath. Under these circumstances, he could not be held to the same degree of care that should be exacted of a mature person, and it was for the jury to say whether he exercised the degree of care with which a person of his years and intelligence is chargeable. In any event, it was error to dismiss the complaint upon the merits. McDonald v. Metropolitan St. R. Co., 167 N. Y. 66, 60 N. E. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
