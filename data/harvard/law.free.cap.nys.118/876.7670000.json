Before the plaintiff could succeed, it'was incumbent upon him to establish that the defendants as town officers were doing or about to do some illegal act, which he failed to do. A resolution was adopted by the town board and board of highway commissioners, sitting together, on July 11, 1906, reciting it to be the sense of the meeting that of the moneys appropriated by the town board for highway purposes in October following the sum of $2,000 be devoted to the work of improving the shore road at Port Jefferson, and that the highway commissioners be authorized to expend said sum, to be paid in February, 1907. Before the next meeting some question had apparently arisen as to the title of the town to the road which it was proposed to improve, and the following resolution yras then (August 24,1906) adopted: \u201cResolved: That the supervisor be authorized to employ counsel to determine if the town owns the road around George\u2019s Neck\u201d\u2014and, if the town does own said road, a competent engineer be employed to ascertain the cost of construction of the road, and report at the next meeting of the board. The effect of this resolution was to hold the contemplated improvement in abeyance until its cost and the ownership of the town had been ascertained. On September 4th following \u201cSupervisor Bennett as committee to ascertain whether the town owned the road around George\u2019s Neck reported progress in the matter,\u201d and it was resolved that the sum of $25,000 be appropriated for maintenance of highways the ensuing year, $2,000 of which was to be devoted to the building of the road around \u201cGeorge\u2019s Neck,\u201d the preliminary expenses of which Commissioner Darling was directed to pay from said $2,000. In March, 1907, before any specific work was ordered or commenced, or any action taken by the town authorities other than the adoption of these resolutions, and while the town was engaged in ascertaining whether it owned the road proposed to be improved, the plaintiff commenced this action alleging in his complaint\u201d that he was a taxpayer; that the defendants \u201cthreaten and intend illegally- to expend and to authorize and allow the illegal and wasteful expenditure of said sum of $2,000 * * * in the \u2018construction\u2019 or \u2018repair\u2019 of said alleged road\u201d; that the expenditure of said money would be a waste of the funds of the town for the reasons that the locality designated by the town board as \u201cGeorge\u2019s Neck\u201d was not in fact and never had been the \u201cGeorge\u2019s Neck\u201d referred to in resolutions of the board of trustees in 1672 and 1905, the latter of which set aside three rods of the town\u2019s property as a highway running around \u201cGeorge\u2019s Neck\u201d and placing the control of said highway under the management of the highway commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ers of the town; that the road in question was not a legally opened highway, or, if it was, that it had never been worked by the highway commissioners and had been abandoned; and that he was the- legal owner of a part of the premises over which it was proposed to construct the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\">Reading the resolutions together, it is apparent that no money was intended to be expended or work done until it had been ascertained, first, whether the town was \"the owner of the road to be improved; and, second, if it was, the cost of such improvement to be ascertained by a competent engineer and reported. There is no evidence in the record showing a report upon either question or that the highway commissioners had expended or intended to expend any money until such reports were received and considered. No act or words of the town officials or. either of them warranting the belief that they were doing or intended to do any work or make any expenditure connected with the proposed improvement until they had determined the ownership of the road by the town appears from the record. It is not the purpose of this action to restrain the authorities from including in the amount raised for highway purposes the $2,000 authorized to be used for the improvement or from the levying of the tax containing the same. The relief sought is the restraining of such of the town authorities as are made defendants from constructing or improving a highway, and while, by the resolution adopted on September 4th, a commissioner was authorized to pay for the preliminary work out of the fund designated for the improvement, it does not follow that such preliminary work other than that of counsel in ascertaining the title of the town, which the authorities clearly had the right to incur, was to be done. When read in connection with the other resolutions, it is clear that the intention of the boards was that such acts other than the employment and work of counsel in ascertaining title were not to be performed until the ownership and rights of the town dependent thereon had been ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In the absence of any evidence of an illegal act done or intended to be done, the action was prematurely commenced, and the complaint properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">' The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
