KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4ES\">The plaintiff, Pearl Green, and one Bennett, between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock on a September evening, were driving \u2022in a top buggy along a country road which connects the Decatur road running into Worcester and the road running into Westford and is about 3% miles in length. The road follows the windings of a creek, and is called the \u201cGulf road\u201d as it goes along the gulf or valleys through the hilly country. The road has been traveled about 40 years, and at the place in question has been during that time in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>stantially the same condition. No accident ever occurred there before. There are 12 farmhouses upon the road. The town has about 100 miles of highways. The traveled part of the road was about 12 feet wide. Next to the traveled part of the road the westerly bank rises abruptly about two feet, the highland extending back to a stone wall. On the easterly side of the road is another bank, or \u201cshoulder\u201d to the road, as the witnesses call it, rising from 20 to 22 inches from the beaten path. Just northerly of the driveway extending from the road to Conrow\u2019s house, this shoulder along the easterly part of the road, for a space of about 9 feet, is only 6 inches in height, but rises abruptly on either side. Opposite the 9 feet is a precipitous descent of about 19 feet. The road opposite the 9 feet, and for some distance on either side of it, is substantially straight. A driveway leads from the road westerly and diagonally to the Conrow house, leaving the road a short distance south of the 9-foot space. Bennett, the driver, was sitting in the middle of the buggy seat. A part of the way the buggy top was up, but as it was dark it was put down, and the track and horse could be seen by the occupants of a wagon. The horse, coming from the south, and before it arrived opposite the 9-foot space mentioned, left the beaten path and went upon the embankment upon the westerly side, presumably mistaking the true path of the Conrow driveway. The driver backed the horse nearly straight across the road, and the wagon and occupants went down .the precipice, and the plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">A town does not assume to make its highways absolutely safe and to guarantee against accident, but is to make them reasonably safe for public use in the ordinary way. A team driving in either way along the road could not get off the precipice except by driving upon the shoulder ^t a considerable elevation before it arrived at the 9-foot space. Teams would not ordinarily be turning at sharp angles or backing across the road at this place because of the embankment upon both sides. A team could not go down the embankment except in just the way this team did by backing right across, the highway into it, and it could not be foreseen that any one would drive so carelessly at this place that it would become necessary or possible to back across the highway. I do not think therefore that the town was negligent in failing to maintain a barrier at this place. The occurrence was so improbable and unnatural that it, or an occurrence of any similar nature, would not ordinarily be anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows that Bennett was driving. Plaintiff\u2019s witness Pearl Green testified to that fact. Upon cross-examination she swore she did not state at the Conrow house, immediately after the accident, that the plaintiff was driving up to near the scene of the accident. The defendant then called the witness Waterman and offer-\" ed to show that the witness Green did make such statement. The evidence related to a matter material to the issue, for if the plaintiff was driving, and succeeded in plaping the horse in the position where it was backed down the precipice, it would make her contributory negligence a live question in the case. It was competent to discredit the witness by proving her contradictory statement with reference to this material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The judgment should therefore be reversed upon the law and the facts, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., and COCHRANE, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
