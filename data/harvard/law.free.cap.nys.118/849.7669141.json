The facts are practically undisputed. On the 7th of June, 1907, the defendant sold to an agent of. the Department of Agriculture .a liquid in a bottle upon which was a label, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-17\">\u201cPEERLESS EXTRACT OF VANILLA For Flavoring Ice Cream, Syrups, Jellies, Custards, Pies, Puddings, &amp;c. Put up by James Butler, 406 Greenwich St. New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">The words \u201cPeerless Extract of Vanilla\u201d are in large, full-face type. The background of the label is gilt and white. On the reverse side of the bottle is pasted a small white strip of paper upon which is printed in small type the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-19\">\u201cFormula Vanilline Gumerin Spirits Sugar Coloring Water.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-20\">i The article sold was not vanilla. It was in fact a compound composed of the ingredients given in said formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-21\">Sections 164 and 165 of the agricultural law, so far as material, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-22\">\u201cSec. 164. Prohibition as to adulteration or misbranded food.\u2014No person or persons, firm, association or corporation shall within this state, manufacture, produce, sell, offer or expose for sale any article of food which is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of this act. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-23\">\u201cSec. 165. Definition of adulterated or misbranded food.\u2014* * * An article of food shall be deemed to be misbranded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>\u201cFirst\u2014If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-3\">\u201cThird.\u2014If the package containing it or its label shall bear any statement regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein, which statement shall be false or misleading in any particular: * * * Provided, that an</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-4\">article of food which does not contain any added poisonous or deleterious ingredients shall not be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">\u201cFirst.\u2014In the case of mixtures or compounds which may be now or from time to time hereafter known as articles of food, under their own distinctive names, and not included in definition first of misbranded articles of food in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">\u201cSecond.\"\u2014In the case of articles labeled, branded, or tagged so as to plainly indicate that they are mixtures, compounds, combinations, imitations or blends: Provided, that the same shall be labeled, branded, or tagged so as to show the character and constituents thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">There can be no doubt that the label is false and misleading, and that the article in question was offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article. Vanilla is an extract of the vanilla bean. A purchaser would think from the label that he was getting that article, not a compound of vanilline, cumerin, spirits, sugar, coloring, and water. A case, then, of misbranding was established, unless the case falls within one of the two exceptions. It does not come within the first, because plainly the article was not a mixture or compound, known under its own distinctive name, and not included under definition first of misbranded articles of food. The defendant contends that this particular article had its own distinctive name, i. e., \u201cPeerless Extract of Vanilla\u201d; but it could not escape the charge of misbranding by selecting for- a spurious article the name of the genuine article. The case would plainly be included in definition first of misbranded articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The case does not come within the second exception, because the article was not labeled, branded, or tagged so as plainly to indicate that it was a mixture, compound, combination, imitation, or blend. The label, which was obviously designed to attract notice, plainly indicated that the article was an extract, not a compound. A purchaser might be undeceived if he chanced to notice the formula on the reverse side of the bottle. Doubtless, the compound of vanilline, cumerin, spirits, sugar, coloring, and water can be prepared much more cheaply than the genuine vanilla extract. Plainly, the statute was intended to prevent the selling of counterfeit for the genuine article, even though the counterfeit does not contain poisonous or deleterious ingredients; and, where a false label is put on one side of an article in such manner as to arrest the eye, the offense is not cured by a true label, put where it is likely to escape notice. This conclusion is supported by the decision and the reasoning of the court in the case of People v. Luke, 122 App. Div. 64, 106 N. Y. Supp. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The respondent calls our attention to the case of People v. Berghoff, 47 Misc. Rep. 1, 95 N. Y. Supp. 257, affirmed 112 App. Div. 772, 99 N. Y. Supp. 201. As shown by the opinion of Mr. Justice Chester, that was not a case of misbranding, and the label used was only important as bearing on the question whether an article, a compound of honey and glucose, was manufactured for sale, sold, and exposed for sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>for \"pure honey.\u201d That question was held to be a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. GAYNOR, BURR, and RICH, JJ\u201e concur. HIRSCHBERG, B. J., dissents, on the ground that a penal statute is to be strictly construed, and the one in question does not make it an offense to disclose the constituents of a product in smaller type than is used in naming it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
