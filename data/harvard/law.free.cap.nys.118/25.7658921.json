J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akb\">The action is brought to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. The plaintiff was employed by the defendants to make some improvements upon the real property owned by Azilda Noonan. He claimed the sum of $241. The defendants claimed that the repairs were to be made for $200, which was found as a fact by the referee. There was a claim for extras to the amount of $9.26, about which there was no dispute, so that upon the findings of the referee the plaintiff had a lien for $209.26, less the amount of any counterclaim that the defendants held against the plaintiff. .</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The defendants pleaded two counterclaims; one a counterclaim for groceries and provisions furnished by the defendant John Noonan. Of this, however, no evidence was given. It is claimed that there was no reply to this counterclaim, and, therefore, that the claim'was admitted. The action is brought against two joint obligors. The counterclaim is in behalf of one of them only, and is not properly pleaded in the action; and this objection may be urged by the plaintiff, even without a reply. Lipman v. Jackson Architectural Iron Works, 128 N. Y. 58, 27 N. E. 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">The other counterclaim of the defendants was for lumber furnished. Upon the defendants\u2019 computation there was some 14,313 feet of lumber originally piled, from which 3,500 feet had been sold before the sale was made to the plaintiff. This leaves 10,813 feet, which was sold to the plaintiff. Of this 548 feet was found to be worth $10 per thousand. This would amount to $5.48. The remaining amount, to wit, 10,265 feet, was sworn to have been worth from $18 to $20 per thousand. But the evidence of a witness that lumber is worth from $18 to $20 is no legal proof of a value greater than $18, and at $18 the value of this lumber was $184.77. This, added to the $5.48, makes $190.25, the extent of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim against the plaintiff. This leaves the plaintiff with a valid lien for $19.01. The referee has apparently made an error in computation, as well as in allowing the defendants the sum of $20 per thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>sand for lumber upon the testimony stated. He found for the defendants in the sum of about $5, and charged the plaintiff with the costs of the action. If the conclusion which I have indicated be right, this judgment was erroneous, and should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Judgment reversed on law and facts, referee discharged, and new; trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
