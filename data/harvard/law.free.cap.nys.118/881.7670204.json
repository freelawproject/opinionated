The judgment appealed from was rendered on the 29th day of December, 1905, on proof by affidavit of the service of a summons on the defendant on the 22d day of December, 1905. But the defendant swears positively that no such summons' was ever served upon him, and that he never learned of the judgment until shortly before taking this appeal. In support of the judgment, the affidavit of the on\u00e9 who claims to have served the summons is presented, which positively states that the summons was served on the defendant on the 22d day of Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ber, 1905. However, the affiant does not state that he was personally acquainted with the defendant or even knew him by sight. He says that, after the day on which the summons was served, he described the man upon whom service was made to the plaintiff, and that the description tallied with a description given him by employ\u00e9s in the plaintiff\u2019s office. Manifestly that is not sufficient to overcome the positive statement of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.
