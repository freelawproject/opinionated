The plaintiffs allege ownership of a parcel of land on the west side of Rockaway avenue, in the borough of Brooklyn, 50 feet in width front and rear and 100 feet deep; that the defendant Fleisher owns and is in possession of an adjoining parcel of land on the north, 25 by 100 feet, on which is erected a four-story brick building, and that the-defendant Goldstein owns and is in possession of an adjoining parcel of land on the south, 25 by 100 feet, on which is erected a three-story frame building and frame shed in the rear thereof; that all of the parties derived their title from the same grantor; that the space or distance in width of the plaintiffs\u2019* 1 land between the buildings of the defendants is less than 50 feet, and that such buildings, one or both, encroach on the land of the plaintiffs to the extent of about 15 inches, and that they are deprived thereby of the possession and use of their land to that extent; that the plaintiffs have caused several surveys to be made by different surveyors, who agree that an encroachment exists to the extent alleged, but disagree as to which of defendants\u2019 buildings so encroach, and that plaintiffs cannot determine that fact; \u201cthat owing tO' such complications and entanglements the rights of the parties are in doubt, and it is difficult to determine who is liable and who is not, except upon a full hearing, in which all the persons in any way affected or interested are before the court.\u201d The prayer for relief is as follows: \u201cWherefore plaintiffs pray judgment of this court determining and fixing the boundary lines between the properties of the parties hereto, and that the defendants, or such of them as ^hall be found to encroach upon plaintiffs\u2019 land, be enjoined and restrained therefrom, and for a mandatory injunction for the removal of said encroachment, and for the sum of fifteen hundred ($1,500) dollars damages, together with the costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b886-13\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

I concur in this view. But he has reached the conclusion that the complaint did not state a cause of action for equitable relief. In this I think he was in error. If it should appear that a building has been erected upon the land of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>plaintiffs, equitable interference to compel its removal by the person who wrongfully erected or maintains it is proper. Such removal necessarily imperils the remainder of the building, and the trespasser, not the injured party, ought to assume that risk. The primary object of the action is to compel the removal of the encroaching buildings, which involves, as an incident, the determination of the boundary lines of the respective parties. Equitable jurisdiction, being properly invoked upon the first branch of the case, will be retained and continued to settle all incidental issues, and the question of the boundaries is a proper incidental issue for equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The complaint is not to be condemned because it does not point out the actual trespasser. That is made impossible because of the conflict of boundaries created by the defendants themselves, each of whom adopted a line as the proper division line between their land and that of the plaintiffs, and built accordingly. One or both are in error, the buildings of one or both are alleged to encroach upon the land of the plaintiffs, and the plaintiff is entitled to relief against one or both of the defendants who are interested and may possibly be affected by the determination. If it should be found that the buildings of both defendants encroach, the plaintiffs are entitled under the pleadings to relief against both. Equity permits all persons related to the subject-matter, who have a common interest in one or more branches of it, to be joined in an action, when the subject-matter has become so involved that the rights of the parties are in doubt and it is difficult to determine who is and who is not liable, except upon a full hearing before the court, which can adjudicate the questions and settle the rights of all of the parties, and make its judgment so full and comprehensive as to quiet the controversy in all of its aspects, protect those compelled to obey its decree, and prevent further litigation.

All concur, except MILDER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
