These maps show the said west line, and also the line.- of the creek. Being on a scale of 100 feet to the inch, it appears that the width between the said two lines of the street is always at least fifty feet, except at one place, where there is a narrow jog or spur (viz., about 35 feet wide) on the creek which runs into or a little over the said west line of the street. It is therefore objected by the appellant that <em>at </em>that point the street will be of no width for the reason that it cannot cross the said jog or spur, inasmuch as that would be to encroach on tidewater, although the order of the commissioners permits that to\" be done. But to bridge or even fill up this trifling jog or break in the bank would be no encroachment on the creek. The custom is to fill them up. The permission of the order to carry the line out into the water where that would be necessary to get a road width of fifty feet was put in the order only because of the objection raised before the commission in respect of this spur or jog, and is superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Determination affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
