Before the completion of the work the contractor went into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>bankruptcy, and receivers were appointed to wind up its affairs. At this time a delay of over five months had occurred. The plaintiff, who was a subcontractor, filed a lien upon the property for $91,493.18. Eight other liens were also filed. They all amounted in the aggregate to $113,735.48. Subsequently the receivers, the plaintiff, and the defendants Procter &amp; Gamble Company and P. Hart &amp; Sons entered into a contract, in which the plaintiff agreed to complete the contract of Milliken Bros, by finishing the work, and, upon this being done, appellant undertook to pay them $15,219.60, that being the estimated cost of the work, and on completion of the contract, and upon the discharge of record of all of the aforesaid mechanic\u2019s liens set forth in the agreement, promised to pay a further sum stipulated to become due to the receivers, which should be paid to the lienors as therein provided. The work was completed by plaintiff in accordance with its agreement, and on the 18th day of January, 1908, appellant certified that plaintiff was entitled to the said sum of $15,219.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">It is conceded that upon the completion of the contract the sum of $27,486.46 became due to the receiver of Milliken Bros, from the appellant, and the different parties to the action claimed to share in this amount as lienors. Interest has been awarded upon this amount from the time the contract was finally completed. In making the award of interest, I think the learned justice was in error. The lienors had failed to satisfy the liens mentioned in the contract under which the work was continued, and the appellant could not with safety have paid the balance due to the receivers of Milliken Bros, with liens outstanding aggregating over $100,000. The amount of the owner\u2019s liability was fixed upon the execution of the agreement with the plaintiff and other lienors for completion, but this agreement superseded the original contract with Milliken Bros., and the balance became payable \u201con the completion of said contract and the discharge of record of all the mechanic\u2019s liens set forth in schedule' marked \u2018C\u2019 and those filed by said Hedden and Hart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">There is no evidence that these liens have been satisfied. It follows, therefore, that the judgment should be modified by striking out the allowance of interest, and as so modified affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
