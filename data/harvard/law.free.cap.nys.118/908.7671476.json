The pleadings were oral. After the jury had been impaneled and counsel for plaintiff had opened'his case and a witness had been sworn, and while he was being examined, the corporation counsel interrupted the examination and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">\u201cI <em>move to </em>dismiss this action on the ground that there is no complaint indorsed on, the summons or the docket of this court as required by section 145 of the Municipal Court act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">The motion was denied and an exception taken. Section 145 of the Municipal Court act provides, among other things (subdivision 1) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-11\">\u201cWhere the action is commenced by the service of a summons only, the pleadings may be oral, and the substance thereof shall be endorsed upon the summons and entered in the docket book of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">As appears from the return, a sheet of paper was attached to the summons, with printed forms thereon, suitable to be filled up and used under various circumstances, as when the action was tried before a jury and verdict rendered for the plaintiff, or when a judgment of discontinuance was entered, or when a judgment on inquest was rendered for the plaintiff, or when a judgment was rendered for the defendant dismissing the complaint without prejudice, on defendant\u2019s motion, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, or where judgment was rendered after trial on the merits. On the back of this was another printed form headed, \u201cProceedings on Return of Summons,\u201d which contained, among other things', the word \u201cComplaint.\u201d Following this were the written words \u201cDamages to personal property.\u201d This was an indorsement upon the summons within the meaning of the section of the Municipal Court act above referred to. Thurman v. Cameron, 24 Wend. 87. The words, \u201cdamages to personal property,\u201d was a statement of the substance of the complaint, with the meaning of the act. The defendant asked for and obtained a bill of particulars before proceeding to trial, so that he was fully advised as to the cause, nature, and extent of plaintiff\u2019s claim. There is no evidence as to what, if any, entry was made in the docket book of the court as to the substance of the complaint, and every intendment must therefore be in support of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">The motion to dismiss the complaint upon this ground having been denied, the corporation counsel thereupon moved to dismiss the complaint \u201con the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>lish a cause of action, and, further, that the complaint does not comply with section 261 of the charter.\u201d This section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-3\">\u201cNo action or special proceeding, for any cause whatever, shall be prosecuted or maintained against the city of New York, unless it shall appear by and as an allegation in the complaint or necessary moving papers that at least thirty days have elapsed since the demand, claim or claims upon which such action or special proceeding is founded were presented to the comptroller of said city for adjustment, and that he has neglected or refused to make an adjustment or payment thereof for thirty days after such presentment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The pleadings having been oral, it does not appear what, if any, statement was made respecting the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. No defect was specified as a ground of the motion except the failure to allege in the complaint compliance with the provisions of the section of the charter above quoted. But the partieg had already stipulated upon the record at the commencement of the trial that the notice of claim in the action was served on the Comptroller on the 20th day of January, 1905, and that the notice of intention to sue was served on the corporation counsel on the same day; and it appears that the summons was served on the 4th day of December, 1908. If the complaint was originally defective in respect to the allegation of service of notice on the Comptroller and the expiration of the time required before commencing suit, it could have been amended in the Municipal Court to conform to the proof already in the case (Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 166), and it may now be amended if necessary to sustain the judgment (Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 20; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2944; Runge v. Esau, 6 Misc. Rep. 147, 26 N. Y. Supp. 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The judgment of the Municipal Court and the order denying the motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">The \"plaintiff also appeals from an order of the Municipal Court correcting the date of the entry of the judgment. At the close of the trial, which was held on the 29th of January, 1909, and after the jury had rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant made a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and against the weight of the evidence, and upon all the grounds contained in section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 254 of the Municipal Court act. The Municipal Court justice reserved his decision upon the said motion. On the 4th day of March he made his decision, denying such motion. Notwithstanding the pendency of the said motion, immediately after the rendition of the verdict and on the 29th day of January, 1909, the clerk of the Municipal Court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant. After the decision of the motion for a new trial, the learned corporation counsel for the first time discovered that such judgment had been entered, and immediately moved to amend the same as to the date of its entry. This motion was granted,' and from the order granting it the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">It was within the power of the Municipal Court to grant the relief asked for. Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 1, subd. 19; Id. \u00a7 20. It was in the interest of justice that the date of the entry of the judgment should be corrected. It was improperly entered while the motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>trial was pending, and, unless corrected, the defendant\u2019s time to appeal from the judgment would have expired. The provision of section 254 of the Municipal Court act that a motion to amend a Judgment must be made within five days from the time the judgment was rendered applies to motions made under the provisions of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-3\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs to the defendant respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
