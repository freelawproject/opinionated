The action is to recover securities valued at $13,710 as a gift inter vivos made by Cartwright to the plaintiffs. The defendant is the sole surviving executor of Cartwright, but is sued personally. He makes general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-26\">The plaintiffs' case rests mainly upon the testimony of Johnson, a servant in Cartwright\u2019s house for 12 years. On July 20, 1906, Cart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>wright, aged 84 years, ill in his home, was about to be taken on that day to the hospital for a desperate operation. Johnson testifies that about 8 a. m. he and the plaintiff D. Tompkins were alone with Cartwright, who picked up a key from a number which he had in his hand and said to Tompkins, \u201cDan, this is the key of my desk down in my office, and you unlock the top of my desk, and you will find some money there and securities- of considerable value,\u201d and that thereupon Cartwright handed the keys to Tompkins, saying, \u201cTake my keys.\u201d Tompkins said, \u201cWhat will I do with those securities, Uncle George ?\u201d and Cartwright answered: \u201cKeep them for you and your wife, you and Mary.\u201d The witness then said to Tompkins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">\u201c \u2018Ask him how about running the house while he is gone to the hospital,\u2019\u2019 because [says the witness] he wanted me to stay there, and Cartwright said\u2018Let Richard and Lucy [i. e., Johnson and another servant] buy the necessary food to suit themselves, and you see that the bills are paid.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The witness testifies that in a very few minutes the ambulance came and took Cartwright away. Cartwright died in the hospital the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Circumstances which may make for the plaintiffs are that Cartwright was the godfather of Tompkins\u2019 wife; that the Tompkinses lived in the same town; that they appear to have been frequent and intimate visitors in Cartwright\u2019s home; and that Cartwright had no near relatives, and mentioned none nearer than first and second cousins-in his will. And plaintiffs\u2019 witness Ellegood testifies that Cartwright had said to him that Cartwright\u2019s sister had given once a deed of a house to Mrs. Tompkins, but had withdrawn it and then remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">\u201c \u2018Now, I cannot understand why Libby didn\u2019t make some provision for Mary.\u2019 Mary is a namesake of the family, and had always been regarded almost like one of their own children. \u2018I will have to see what I can do to-make it up for her.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">On the other hand, Cartwright had made a will eight months before, whereby he devised certain pieces of realty to a church and a hospital, respectively, 100. shares of stock to two cousins respectively, $11,000-each to four second cousins, and $2,000 to a Miss Swain. He also-gave to Mary Tompkins and her husband (these plaintiffs) his house and land wherein he resided, with the furniture thereof, for their lives, and then to their son. He gave legacies to two churches and made some small specific bequests. The said house and land given to these plaintiffs were worth about $8,000, exclusive of the contents thereof. The total estate was about $104,000. After deduction for the church of $20,000, for the hospital of $15,000, for St. Matthews Church of $1,000, for Star of Bethlehem Church of $1,000, and of $8,000 for the house left to the plaintiffs, the balance of the estate was $35,000, including the securities in suit. The total pecuniary legacies were $46,000, leaving a deficiency of $10,000, subject to the determination whether a legacy had lapsed which would leave the deficiency about $700. If the securities in suit were taken out,' there would be a shortage of $13,000 or $14,000. This proof is pertinent to show that the testator did make a provision for Mary\u2014a house\u2014which could be said to make up for the house taken from her; that the provision was probably as large as that made for any other individual; and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>if the securities sued for are excluded from the scope of the will, such exclusion would seriously disturb the specific provisions thereof. No reason is suggested why such exclusion should have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\">Johnson is confronted by a witness, Mrs. Rosa Coutant, a professional nurse, who was in charge of Cartwright, and who had been an inmate of his house for a long time. Her testimony may be summarized as follows: She was in attendance upon Cartwright on that day until she went with him to the hospital. The plaintiff D. 1'ompkins came into Cartwright\u2019s room at 8:30 a. m., when she was alone with Cartwright. Johnson had gone to order a carriage to take her to the hospital. She gave a fan to Tompkins to take her place in fanning Cartwright. As she was about to fetch her bag from her room, she noticed Cartwright\u2019s watch on a bureau, and said to him: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">\u201c\u2018Here is your watch. What do you want to do with it?\u2019 And he says: \u2018Well, I will take it with me.\u2019 She said: \u2018If you take the watch, they will take it from you at the hospital,\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, then, I won\u2019t take the watch.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Then he held it up with his hand and said: \u201cDanny Tompkins, I will give you this watch and chain.\u201d Then, as the witness turned to \u25a0 him, she saw his keys on the bureau. She picked them up, and said to Cartwright, \u201cWhat do you want done with your' keys ?\u201d He took them up in his hand\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">\u201cand he fumbled them a little while. He stopped and paused, and he says, he handed them to Danny Tompkins, and he said, T will give you these keys to keep while I am gone, and I will give you full charge of the house while I am gone.\u2019 And then he said, \u2018Danny, there is quite a good deal of money in my desk, and there is bonds and mortgages or stocks and mortgages in my desk.\u2019 Also he says: \u2018Take good care of them.\u2019 He commenced to tell them what he had done for Mr. Tompkins\u2019 son, he says: T have given your son Danny this- house and lot, but I have given you and your wife, Mary, the use of this as long as you live.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The witness then stepped out of the room to get her bag, and Cartwright continued in this strain, telling what he had done, and the witness testifies, \u201cBut I could hear everything.\u201d The bag was on the edge of the witness\u2019 room outside the door, and the witness did not go out of hearing. She testifies that, as she started back, she saw the doctor and Johnson and Ellegood coming up the stairs, and thereupon Cartwright was .brought down. She testifies that Johnson was not present at the conversation, that \u201call he heard of it was while he was coming up the stairs, just as he came in the room there with the other people. He was not present.\u201d She positively denies that Cartwright said in her hearing in words or substafice that the securities were for the plaintiffs. She testifies that D. Tompkins said, \u201cThank you, Uncle George,\u201d after Cartwright had told him of the provision made in his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">It does not follow that either Johnson or Mrs. Coutant is a deliberate perjurer. Moore on Facts quotes the observation of Manning, J., in Piffet\u2019s Succession, 37 La. Ann. 871-873 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">\u201cThe narration of conversations correctly is the most difficult feat of memory and of expression, and of all evidence the narration of a witness of his conversation with a dead person is esteemed in justice the weakest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>See, too, McKinney\u2019s Administratrix v. Slack, 19 N. J. Eq. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">The effect of the variance between them is whether Cartwright by his conversation intended to give the key to Tompkins to take charge of th\u00e9 property in the desk while Cartwright was absent in the hospital, or whether Cartwright sought to give the securities to D. Tompkins and his wife. Johnson on cross-examination testified that Mrs. Coutant, about to go to the hospital, put on her \u201ccoat and furs and hat,\u201d but when his attention was called to the statement, he said, \"She didn\u2019t put on her furs. She put on her shawl, something to wrap around her.\u201d Pressed, he said it was a light shawl, he thought, and he was not sure about the hat. This was July 20th, and the evidence is that Cartwright was fanned at the time. Mrs. Coutant testifies that she did not even put on a hat. This may seem trivial, but it is to be remembered that it is by such trivialities that testimony is often tested. Again, Johnson was asked whether he told Mr. Larkin (the defendant\u2019s attorney) that Cartwright had said that these securities were for Tompkins and his Wife \u201cwhen the breath leaves my body,\u201d and he answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-4\">\u201cNo, sir; I didn\u2019t state that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">\u201cQ. Did you use that expression at all as coining from Cartwright, when you were talking with Mr. Larkin? A. No, sir; I didn\u2019t bring it in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">\u201cQ. Did you use it at all? A. Yes, sir; I did, but Mr. Cartwright didn\u2019t say that to me. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">\u201cQ. Did you tell Mr. Larkin that Mr. Cartwright had said that, to Tompkins? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">\u201cQ. That they should have these things \u2018when the breath leaves my body\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">A. No, sir; I didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t tell that to Mr. Larkin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">Mr. Larkin testifies thereafter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-11\">\u201cQ. Did Johnson at that time say to you as to this conversation that he said he had.overheard between Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Tompkins July 20, 1906, this: \u2018Mr. Cartwright selected a key on a bunch of keys, and said to Mr. Tompkins, \u201cHere is the key to my desk.\u201d Tompkins said: \u201cUncle George, what shall I do with it?\u201d And Mr. Cartwright said: \u201cThere is some money in the top part of the desk, and there are some securities of considerable value in it.\u201d Tompkins said: \u201cWho are they for?\u201d Mr. Cartwright said: \u201cThey are for you and Mary or your wife, and everything in the house belongs to you and her when the breath leaves my body.\u201d \u2019 A. That is my recollection of the conversation had with Mr. Johnson in my office. I made this memorandum of that conversation within five minutes after he left the office or after he h\u00e1d made the statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">I do not mean to say that Mrs. Coutant passed unscathed under the cross-examination. She was attacked vigorously, on the ground that she had profited as the nurse of Cartwright\u2019s sister by gifts from that sister, and that she had filed a large claim for services which had been reduced by the surrogate, and that she had included in her alleged term of service certain weeks when she was elsewhere; Johnson and a maid in the house testified that Mrs. Coutant had proposed to them that they should all file large claims, but this she denies. On the other hand; it appears that Johnson now works for the plaintiff; that he, too, although a servant in the house, filed a claim against the estate for $200 as, night watchman. Mr. Tompkins\u2019 conduct subsequent to the alleged gift at least cannot be said to make for his contention that there was such gift of these securities perforce of the conversation narrated by Johnson. If he considered that he therefore owned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>securities, and if he was in possession of them\u2014that is, with the key to the desk\u2014he could readily have taken them into possession after Cartwright left the house, for upon his theory the gift was then complete. He testifies that he asked the defendant to the house on July 20th as \u201can adviser,\u201d not knowing him to be an executor; that he. then unlocked the desk and looked over the cont\u00e9nts in a casual way; that they then knew that there were securities and mortgages in the desk. He testifies that he told the defendant that the house belonged to them, and asked him if they should.take the securities put of the house, but that defendant said, \u201cNo; I would leave them there.\u201d He testifies that in a few days thereafter the defendant and he were in the house with the will; that defendant read the will with the witness looking over his shoulder; that the eighth paragraph was called to his attention, and he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-3\">\u201cWell, it is coming to us any way by the will. I meant what I had already told him, the securities in. the desk, the property in dispute. Mr. Leary [the defendant] didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Tompkins also testified that shortly thereafter Mr. Leary and Mr. Gibney, the other executor (who is dead), came to the house, went through the desk, picked up the things, and among them the deeds in the desk and these securities, whereupon he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\u201cNow, I will let you have these if you will promise that whatever is right for me\u2014to return them to me. Mr. Leary said: \u2018Why, certainly, I haven\u2019t anything in this. Whatever belongs to you you shall have.\u2019 * * * And I let him have them with that understanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Mr. Leary testifies that he has no recollection of the interview of July 20th, and testifies that, he was certain he was not there, that he made memoranda of his visits, and, further, that he never had any conversation with Tompkins \u201cas an adviser,\u201d that he never looked over.-any papers in Cartwright\u2019s desk with Tompkins prior to the time of his taking possession. He testifies that he has no recollection of any such statement testified to by Tompkins as made to him and Mr. Gibney, or of any claim of ownership made except \u201cby the paper served on him.\u201d There is evidence that at the reading of the will in the presence of the plaintiffs no claim to these securities was asserted. It is undisputed that Tompkins was present when the inventory was made by the appraiser, and asserted no claim whatever to any of the securities now sued for. The first demand, therefore, was made about 11 months after the alleged gift; and this action was brought two years thereafter. There is reason for the conclusion that D. Tompkins considered that the securities belonged to him under the will because they were in the desk in this house which was left to him and to his wife. Seth G. Ellegood, a witness called by the defendant, testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">\u201cI remember having an interview with Mr. Tompkins a few days after the reading of the will, at the First National Bank, Ossining. That is Mr. Tompkins\u2019 Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">\u201cQ. What did he say at that time? A. pe said he thought that all those securities whatever there was in the desk there belonged to him under Mr. Cartwright\u2019s will, and I think now that he also made the assertion that he had given him \"the keys, which showed that he meant him to have them, or something to that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-10\">\u201cQ. In this statement, you didn\u2019t say anything about Tompkins having said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>that Cartwright had given him the keys? A. No; I remember now, though, that he said something about having had the keys to the desk, but he said he was going to claim those securities under that clause of the will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">There is no dispute as to the character and standing of D. Tompkins. Moore on Facts says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\">\u201cConsequently, if the validity of a witness\u2019 memory is under discussion, no argument based upon the elevated character of the witness should have the slightest weight in his favor. Ordinary tests of trustworthiness of memory, in view of the circumstances of the case, must be unflinchingly applied. His testimony must be weighed as if he were unknown, and it is not entitled to a whit more of consideration than is justified by its own intrinsic force connected with the other circumstances of the case\u201d.\u2014citing authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The act of delivering the keys or the key was ambiguous. It cannot make for the plaintiffs as against the defendant, for it is consistent with leaving a close friend in charge of the house during an absence. It cannot be said that the gift was an entirely natural act under the circumstances of the relations of the plaintiffs and the decedent because Cartwright had made a substantial provision for the plaintiffs and their son under his will. There is no surrounding fact which makes cogently for the plaintiffs. The case 'ultimately turns, then, on the testimony of Johnson. In view of it, it cannot be said that it presents the clear, convincing, and cogent proof that is required in such cases. A gift is not presumed. Matter of Bolin, 136 N. Y. 177-180, 32 N. E. 626; Devlin v. Greenwich Savings Bank, 125 N. Y. 756, 26 N. E. 744. It must be established by evidence that is \u201cclear and convincing, strong and satisfactory,\u201d by evidence which is \u201cvery plain and satisfactory.\u201d Devlin v. Greenwich Savings Bank, supra; Ridden v. Thrall, 125 N. Y. 572-576, 26 N. E. 627, 11 L. R. A. 684, 21 Am. St. Rep. 758; Bray v. O\u2019Rourke, 89 App. Div. 400, 85 N. Y. Supp. 907; Scoville v. Post, 3 Edw. Ch. 204; Grymes v. Hone, 49 N. Y. 17, 10 Am. Rep. 313. This rule applies to gifts inter vivos. Bray v. O\u2019Rourke, supra, and authorities cited. Unless the facts are clearly proved and uncontradicted, so as to point to an uncontroverted conclusion, the question of delivery is for the jury. Thornton on Gifts, p. 186, I have serious doubt, however, whether the facts are sufficient to justify the verdict in this case. Of course, a delivery may be symbolical, and the tradition of a key to a receptacle of the gift may be sufficient delivery, but such an act is not a satisfaction of the rule, but in derogation of it, and it is sufficient only when the conditions were so adverse to actual delivery as to make the symbolic delivery as nearly perfect and complete as is possible. Some of the cases hold that such conditions contemplate the nature of the gift and the location of it, but Thornton on Gifts says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">\u201cThe rule, we think, has been greatly modified by the more modem decisions on the subject. It is that the delivery must be according to the nature of the thing, and usually that means according to the physical nature of the thing to be delivered, such as the bulk or weight, and does not refer to the locality of the thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">However, it is unnecessary to discuss the situation of the securities in this case, for admittedly these were in a desk in the house. No good reason appears in this record why the alleged donor could not have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the securities brought to him forthwith, and then and there have made a delivery of them, and hence there is no reason why a symbolical delivery should suffice in this case. There is great force in the utterance of Dixon, J., for the court, in Keepers v. Fidelity Title &amp; Deposit Co., 56 N. J. Law, 302, 28 Atl. 585, in New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, 23 L. R. A. 184, 186, 44 Am. St. Rep. 397, where the question presented was as to the symbolic delivery by key:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">\u201cWe agree with the sentiment expressed in Ridden v. Thrall, 125 N. Y. 572, 26 N. E. 627, 11 L. R. A. 684, 21 Am. St. Rep. 758, that \u2018public policy requires that the laws regulating gifts causa mortis should not be extended, and that the range of such gifts should not be enlarged.\u2019 . When it is remembered that these gifts come into question only after d\u00e9ath has closed the lips of the donor, that there is no legal limit to the amount which may be disposed of by means of them, that millions of dollars\u2019 worth of property is locked up in vaults, the keys of which are carried in the owners\u2019 pockets, and that, under the rule applied in those cases, such wealth may be transferred from the dying owner to his attendant, provided the latter will take the key, and swear that it was delivered to him by the deceased for the purpose of giving him the contents of the vault\u2014the dangerous character of the rule becomes conspicuous. Around every other disposition of the property of the dead the legislative power has thrown safeguards against fraud and perjury. Around this mode, the requirement of actual delivery is the only substantial protection, and the court should not weaken it by permitting the substitution of convenient and easily proven devices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The judgment and order must be reversed and a new trial must be granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
