Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2725, 2726. </em>The learned surrogate held that she is entitled to \u201ca pecuniary provision under j:he will,\u201d but did not state .what it is. The brief of the learned counsel for the appellant says that, the second paragraph of the will leaves all of the testator\u2019s estate to the appellant, who is the testator\u2019s son and executor, \u201cto use it for the benefit of -himself and his sisters\u201d (and then professing to literally quote the words of the will) \u201cin such portion, in such terms, and in such manner as he * * * shall in his judgment and discretion deem right and advisable.\u201d Turning to the said paragraph the words are found to be \u201cin such proportions and at such times and in such manner as he- * * * shall in his judgment and discretion deem proper, right and advisable.\u201d Later on in his brief the learned counsel refers to the late eminent Judge Rapallo of our Court of Appeals as \u201cRappolli, J.\u201d It is growing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>irksome to have such briefs and papers submitted by members of our learned profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\">When the said paragraph of the will is read in its entirety, it is found to give the legal title of the entire estate to the appellant individtially, \u201cto use it for the benefit of himself and my other hereinbefore mention.ed children,\" which includes the respondent, \"in such proportions and at such times and in such manner as he * * * shall in his judgment and discretion deem proper, right and advisable.\u201d With this, and in the doing of it by the testator, is coupled an expression of her \u201cfull confidence in the ability, integrity and sense of justice and fairness of my said son, and in his love for me and regard for my wishes.\u201d But these precatory words do not impose any legal duty or trust upon the son. All is left to his discretion. He may give such amount to his sisters as he may choose to, or nothing. Whatever he gives is of his own discretion.and bounty, and not out of any obligation imposed on him by the will. Lawrence v. Cooke, 104 N. Y. 632, 11 N. E. 144. The language of the will in Re Conner\u2019s Will, 6 App. Div. 594, 39 N. Y. Supp. 900, is different. There the direction was to \u201cdistribute and apportion\u201d among wife and children, and only the manner and time were left to the judgment of the executors, and not the \u201cproportion\u201d that should be given to each. The testator required them to \u201capportion\u201d the estate, and that general direction meant, as is provided by statute, share and share alike. 1 Rev. St. (1st Ed.) p.. 734, \u00a7 98. The next section of the statute would apply to the present case if the appellant were a trustee, and its express words uphold him in giving the respondent nothing, that being left to his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The order should be reversed and the petition denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings County reversed, with $10 costs -and disbursements, and application denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">RICH and MILLER, JJ.,' concur.
