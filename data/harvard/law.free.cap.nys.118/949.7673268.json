The proceedings were dismissed, and from the final order of dismissal this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The statute expressly specifies those cases in which a tenant of real property may be summarily removed therefrom. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2231. The breach of a covenant to make repairs is not within either of the specifications, and will not authorize the proceedings any more than a covenant not to cut wood. Oakley v. Schoonmaker, 15 Wend. 226. The appellant- contends that because the l\u00e9ase contains the language above quoted, that upon breach of said covenant the landlord may \u201cre-enter the premises and repossess himself of the same,\u201d the parties have agreed that the fact of the breach of such covenant may be tried in summary proceedings. It would be extending the ordinary meaning of words to hold that the word \u201crepossess\u201d was equivalent to the word \u201cdispossess,\u201d as used in the statute, and to base the right to maintain summary proceedings upon such construction. But, unless the statute gives jurisdiction, even consent of the parties would be ineffective to confer the same. Beach v. Nixon, 9 N. Y. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The breach .of a covenant to repair is not in the nature of a conditional limitation (Cramer v. Amberg [Com. Pl.] 4 N. Y. Supp. 613, affirmed 115 N. Y. 655, 21 N. E. 1119; Beach v. Nixon, supra), and the landlord cannot base his proceeding upon the claim that the lease has expired by reason of the breach of such covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The cases of Baylies v. Ingram, 84 App. Div. 360, 82 N. Y. Supp. 891, affirmed 181 N. Y. 518, 73 N. E. 1119, Anzolone v. Paskusz, 96 App. Div. 188, 89 N. Y. Supp. 203, and Pannuto v. Foglia, 55 Misc. Rep. 244, 105 N. Y. Supp. 495, cited by the appellant, have no application. Each of these was an action at law upon a covenant in the lease, and the question involved was whether the provisions of said covenant relative to a deficiency in the payment of the amount of rent reserved during the term covered thereby survived the termination of the tenancy by summary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">The water furnished to these premises was measured through meters, and the amount of the charge was determined by the quantity of water consumed. Under such circumstances a water rate is not to be deemed a tax, within the provisions of subdivision 3 of section 2231 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Daws 1901, p. 211, c. 466, \u00a7 474). Silkman v. Water Commissioners, 152 N. Y. 327, 46 N. E. 612, 37 L. R. A. 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
