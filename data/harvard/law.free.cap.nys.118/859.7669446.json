The amendment stated an entirely new cause of action, based upon alleged statements of a person acting as superintendent of the defendant. At common law, and in the absence of the employer\u2019s liability act (Laws 1902, p. 1748, c. 600), the complaint as amended would not have justified a recovery against the defendant. The notice which was served under that act was insufficient to permit a recovery upon the ground stated in the amended complaint; and, as this was the only ground upon which the plaintiff obtained a verdict, the judgment entered on that verdict should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
