Diamond, at Putnam, in the state of Connecticut, and delivered the same to the Adams Express Company for shipment; that there was pasted on the wrapper around the package the name of the consignor and the consignee and his address; that some time after such delivery to the express company one of its employ\u00e9s discovered that there was pasted over the original label another one, from which the package purported to be consigned by I. Feldman, importer, or Feldman &amp; Co., to \u201cJ- Zuckerman, 62 East 113th street,\u201d as consignee; that the police department was thereupon notified, and an arrangement made by which one of the express company\u2019s employ\u00e9s, accompanied by a detective of the police department, delivered the package to the defendant at the address given; that after Zuckerman received the package, and receipted for it, and paid the express charges thereon, he was immediately placed under arrest; that after his arrest he stated to the officer who had him in charge that he expected to receive a package from I. Feldman for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>friend of his; that the officer testified he asked him who the. friend was, and the defendant refused to state, and when asked what was; the address of Feldman, or Feldman &amp; Co., he stated, \u201cWhere the label says they are from;\u201d and that no such person as Feldman, or Feldman &amp; Co., could be found at the address on the label, .nor could any such name be found in any of the directories of the city. Neither the defendant nor any witnesses were sworn in his behalf, nor did he offer any evidence whatever, '</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I think the evidence presented on the part of the people established a prima facie case against the defendant, which required submission to the jury. It was proved beyond a question that some one had placed the false Feldman label over the true Ginsburg one, while the package was in the express company\u2019s office. From this the jury was justified in finding that such false label was placed there by some person with intent to steal the package, and this, taken in connection with the fact that the defendant was the consignee named, that he received the package at the address given, and receipted for it, and paid the express charges thereon, that he stated to the officer who made the arrest that he expected a package from a concern which could not be found, for a \u25a0\u201cfriend who had asked him to receive it,\u201d and his refusal to give the name of the \u201cfriend\u201d or to offer any other explanation, justified the jury in finding, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that he was such person, or that it was some person acting in concert with him. In the latter case the defendant was just as much a principal as the one who acted with him. Section 29, Pen. Code; People v. McKenna, 118 App. Div. 766, 103 N. Y. Supp. 870. The intent to steal the package, under such circumstances, seems to be the only reasonable conclusion which can be reached. McCarney v. People, 83 N. Y. 408, 38 Am. Rep, 456; People v. Klein, 117 App. Div. 196, 102 N. Y. Supp. 289; People v. Darrow, 69 App. Div. 615, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1141, affirmed 171 N. Y. 697, 64 N. E. 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Several errors are alleged, but an examination does not disclose that the defendant could have been prejudiced by them, or that they are of such a character as would justify a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
