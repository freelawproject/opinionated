And the conclusion at which it arrived indicates clearly that it did not find as a matter of fact that the objections were sustained. The evidence before us shows that there were some apparent forgeries and irregularities in the petition of nomination, but does not show such facts with sufficient clearness that such apparent forgeries and irregularities reduced the number of legal nominators below the requisite number to justify in overruling the board of elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
