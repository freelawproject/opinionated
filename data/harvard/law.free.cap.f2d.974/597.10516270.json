The district court found an absence of a significant injury, a requirement under then controlling circuit precedents. Those precedents were overruled by the intervening decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Hudson v. McMillian.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We vacate and remand for reconsideration in light of <em>Hudson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-26\">Shabazz filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit against various officials of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and a corrections officer at the Eastham Unit, complaining of excessive force which resulted in injury to his knee and shoulder. Following a <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing, and determining that no significant injury was sustained, the district court exercised the authority vested by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) and dismissed the <em>in forma pauperis </em>suit as frivolous. Shabazz timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>In overruling this courts precedents, the <em>Hudson </em>Court held that in order to establish an eighth amendment violation in an excessive force case, the complainant need not plead and prove significant injury as a necessary requisite for his claim. Accordingly, we must vacate the dismissal and remand for reconsideration in light of the teachings of <em>Hudson. </em>In this reconsideration the district court should look to: the extent of the injury suffered; the need for application of force; the relationship between that need and the amount of force used; the threat reasonably perceived by responsible officials; and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.

McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). In <em>Spears </em>we approved the use of a limited evidentiary hearing in lieu of a written questionnaire to flesh out the factual and legal bases for <em>pro se </em>prisoner complaints. These hearings were recorded on audiotape, a procedure which, after transcription, produced what we implicitly approved as a sufficient appellate record. <em>See Wesson </em>v. <em>Oglesby, </em>910 F.2d 278 (5th Cir.1990). In the present case, as in several others previously reviewed by us including <em>Sparks v. Murphy, </em>961 F.2d 1572 (5th Cir.1992); 92-4191, <em>Green v. Ward, </em>973 F.2d 925 (5th Cir.1992); 92-4183, <em>Green v. Scott; </em>92-4256, <em>Aguilar v. Terrell; </em>92-4205, <em>Winn v. Turner; </em>92-4298, <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Russell; </em>and 92-4233, <em>Holman v. Reed, </em>the hearing was recorded on videotape which is superior to the audiotape and, for <em>Spears </em>hearings purposes, is considered a sufficient record of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-15\">. \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 999, 117 L.Ed.2d at 166 (citing <em>Whitley v.
