(Sutro), plaintiff, appeals from a judgment dismissing its complaint against Indemnity Insurance Company of North America (INA), defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The controversy arose over the construction of a provision in an indemnity bond issued by INA in favor of Sutro. The issue is whether the facts are such as to create liability under the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">\n<em>The Bond</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">INA issued to Sutro, a brokerage firm, its standard Brokers\u2019 Blanket Bond, Form 14 (the Bond), to cover such losses as might be sustained by Sutro because of larceny, theft and misappropriation. More specifically, the clause of the Bond relied upon by Sutro to establish liability reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">\u201cIn Transit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">\u201c(C) Any loss of Property (occurring with or without negligence) through robbery, common-law or statutory larceny, embezzlement, misappropriation, theft, holdup, misplacement, mysterious unexplainable disappearance, being lost or otherwise made away with, damage thereto or destruction thereof, and any loss of subscription, conversion, redemption or deposit privileges through the misplacement or loss of Property, while the Property is in transit anywhere in the custody of any person acting as messenger or in the custody of any armored motor vehicle company, except while in the mail and while being transported by express or as freight after receipt of the Property by a carrier for hire other than an armored motor vehicle company, such transit to begin immediately upon receipt of such Property by the transporting person or company, and to end immediately upon delivery thereof at destination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Another provision of the Bond must also be read in connection with Sutro\u2019s claim. This paragraph provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-12\">\u201c(e) Any loss resulting directly or indirectly from trading, with or without the knowledge of the Insured, in the name of the Insured or otherwise, whether or not represented by any indebtedness or balance shown to be due the Insured on any customer\u2019s account, actual or fictitious, except when covered under Insuring Clause (A), (D) or (E).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">\n<em>The Issue on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ax_-dedup-0\">The facts, therefore, must be examined in the light of the above provisions to determine (1) whether the loss sustained resulted from common-law or statutory larceny, misappropriation or theft while the property was in transit anywhere in the custody of any person acting as a messenger, the transit \u201cto end immediately upon delivery thereof at destination\u201d; or (2) whether the loss resulted \u201cdirectly or indirectly from trading * * * whether or not represented by any indebtedness or balance shown to be due the Insured [Sutro] on any customer\u2019s account, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">\n<em>The Business Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">The business transactions which gave rise to Sutro\u2019s claim under the Bond consisted of the purchase by Sutro for the account of its customer, Arlee Associates, Inc. (Arlee), of various securities ordered by Arlee. The principals of Arlee were Arthur Katz (Katz) and Leo Sinsheimer (Sinsheimer).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">Since May 1958 and for over two years, Sutro had had business transactions with Katz and Sinsheimer in their names and in the names of certain of their corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>tions. Katz and Sinsheimer financed security purchases for customers of Sutro and, also, purchased and sold securities through their accounts with Sutro.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">In May 1960 the New York Stock Exchange suggested to Sutro that it close all accounts with Katz and Sinsheimer. Despite this warning, Sutro resumed business with Katz and Sinsheimer, who conducted this business under the name of Arlee. Between August 1960 and June 1961, some 950 purchase orders from Arlee for securities valued at some $13,400,000 were executed and confirmations were mailed on the day the orders were executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\n<em>The Arlee-Sutro Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">On the delivery date (customarily four days after purchase), Sutro delivered the stock certificates by messenger to Arlee in New York City in the forenoon against Arlee\u2019s receipt therefor. The receipt states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cReceipt is hereby acknowledged of the described securities which Sutro Bros. &amp; Co. have declared to us in advance of payment therefor, solely for the purpose of enabling us to inspect and verify the same. Title thereto passes to us only against receipt by Sutro Bros. &amp; Co. of payment therefor, but all risks to such securities, including risk of loss, are assumed by the undersigned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">In the afternoon of the same day the messenger returned and received Arlee\u2019s uncertified check for the amount of the purchase orders. Within one day of its purchase order, Arlee sold the same securities through other brokers. When Arlee received the securities from Sutro\u2019s messenger, it delivered them to its selling brokers. Arlee received from these brokers a certified check on a New York City bank which it could collect immediately. The cheek given to Sutro\u2019s messenger, on the other hand, was drawn on a suburban bank and took as long as four days to clear. Arlee thus had the use of large amounts of money until a deposit was required at the suburban bank to cover the checks given to Sutro. The \u201cfloat\u201d which was thereby created eventually exceeded one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Originally, Sutro\u2019s managing partner had approved the receipt of up to $25,000 daily of Arlee\u2019s uncertified checks, but during the period of August 1960 to May 1961, Sutro actually accepted from Arlee some 838 uncertified checks without regard to amount. Of this number, the last 63 checks were not collected because Arlee had stopped payment thereon. The amount of the loss has been stipulated to be $1,137,775.54. Sutro made a claim under the Bond for the loss sustained. INA rejected the claim on the ground that it was not covered under the Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The proceedings by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Arlee, Sutro and its managing partner and the criminal charges against Katz and Sinsheimer who pleaded guilty and received prison sentences are noted but only the facts giving rise to such proceedings are here considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">\n<em>The Bond</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">On its face, the Bond would appear clearly to express its coverage and its limitations, namely, to insure against loss while property was in Sutro\u2019s possession or \u201cin transit.\u201d By Bond definition, transit was to begin immediately upon receipt of the property by Sutro\u2019s messenger and was \u201cto end immediately upon delivery thereof at destination.\u201d And this is exactly what occurred. Not a single certificate was lost \u201cthrough robbery, common-law or statutory larceny, embezzlement, misappropriation, theft, holdup, misplacement, mysterious unexplainable disappearance, being lost or otherwise made away with, damage thereto or destruction thereof * * *.\u201d The cause of the loss is equally clear-\u2014 Arlee did not pay for the securities which Sutro had delivered to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">Conversely, the Bond excluded any loss, direct or indirect, resulting from trading, whether or not represented by an indebtedness or balance due to Sutro on any customer\u2019s account. And this is exactly the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>In. an effort by Procrustean methods to fit the facts to the Bond coverage, Sutro argues that it was Ar-lee\u2019s intention to steal the securities and that such intent is established by the check-kiting practices of Arlee. Sutro points to Arlee\u2019s insolvency, to the fact that cheek-kiting gives rise to civil and criminal liability and to violations of mail fraud statutes and to the guilty pleas of Katz and Sinsheimer in the criminal proceedings. But these facts do not establish liability under the Bond. The \u201cin transit\u201d provision of the Bond is primarily concerned with such perils as might thwart delivery. Here delivery of all the securities had been made\u2014 they were no longer \u201cin transit.\u201d Sutro contends that the securities were unlawfully taken by trick or device, namely, by the giving of uncertified checks against accounts containing inadequate funds to meet them, and that until they were validly paid for, they were still \u201cin transit.\u201d But it must be remembered that Sutro had been willing to deliver the securities as a regular and accepted course of business against 838 uncertified checks of which 775 were paid. But for the fact that every Ponzi-type scheme has its ultimate breaking point, the 63 checks might have been paid, leaving to others in the future the role of being the victims of the swindle. Therefore, Sutro\u2019s assertion that \u201cArlee\u2019s theft occurred while the securities were in transit\u201d (Brief, Pt. II) cannot be accepted. The district court properly held that, if theft there were, it did not occur in transit. This conclusion is supported by the fact that there would have been no \u201ctheft\u201d until days later and even then the existence of a \u201ctheft\u201d would have been dependent on the collectibility of the check. After all, 775 checks had been collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">A review of the entire record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Sutro had failed to show by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that \u201cwhen, or before, Arlee received the securities from Sutro, Arlee intended to steal the certificates.\u201d (Finding 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">This being a diversity case, the question arises: what New York law, if any, is applicable to the facts here presented? Sutro argues that decision here is controlled <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by the <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Underwood </em>cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In those cases, the New York Court of Appeals faced the problem of construing bonds, substantially the same as the Bond here, in the light of the specific facts before that Court. No semantic distinctions between \u201ctransit\u201d <em>(Underwood) </em>and \u201ctransit risk\u201d <em>(Hanson) </em>will be relied upon because a much firmer footing on a factual foundation is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">In <em>Underwood </em>a salesman employed by the insured broker delivered bonds to the broker\u2019s customer against a cheek which bore a false and incomplete certification. The New York Court of Appeals chose to regard this securing of possession by the customer as a larceny by trick and device equivalent to a taking as \u201cif he had grabbed Del Re by the throat and taken the bonds from his custody,\u201d (245 N.Y. at 115, 156 N.E. at 634) and hence held that the loss was covered by the robbery and theft provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">In Hanson the messenger delivered securities to Baran &amp; Co. against a receipt similar to the Arlee receipt, but when the messenger returned for the check in the afternoon, he found that Baran &amp; Co. had abandoned its office and had absconded with the securities. The Court of Appeals assumed that \u201cboth before and at the time when the pretended purchaser obtained possession of the securities he had the fraudulent intent to convert them.\u201d (257 N.Y. at 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>177 N.E. at 427.) The Court held this to be larceny; that \u201cthe plain intent of the bond was to furnish protection against loss by larceny through a felonious taking of possession from the messenger\u201d (id.); and completed the syllogism by holding that the bond covered such a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">An important factual difference is immediately observed. In <em>Underwood </em>and <em>Hanson </em>there were single transactions with deliveries by no means in the manner anticipated. Here the deliveries were completed in exactly the manner approved by Sutro \u2014 expressly by Friedman and impliedly by the knowing acceptance of some 838 uncertified checks. The loss was not occasioned by the taking of the delivered securities which Arlee forthwith turned into cash but by the subsequent non-payment of the checks which Sutro was satisfied to accept at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The surety here, IN A, is probably little interested in the confessed admissions of guilt by Katz and Sinsheimer in the criminal case against them. The Bond does not cover their personal misconduct. A fair diagnosis of the Sutro-Arlee relationship reveals a customer\u2019s account with many transactions over a substantial period of time which by reason of an ultimate non-payment of a debit balance caused Sutro\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Few factual situations can be cut into such a stencil as will fit contract clauses with the nicety of geometric congruous triangles. Were this so, there would be no lawsuit to decide. The problem is: which clause, the inclusionary (\u201cC\u201d) or the exclusionary (\u201c(e)\u201d), more closely fits the facts because the Bond as such has no meaning except as related to the facts which give rise to the claim. Assuming the intent to defraud theories of <em>Underwood </em>and <em>Hanson </em>were justified on the facts presented by those cases, the facts of this case do not fit into the same mold. The 838 transactions were evidence of an accepted business practice. A scheme to take the last 63 deliveries with larcenous intent \u2014 in contrast to the other 775 \u2014 cannot be imputed to Katz and Sinsheimer by hindsight. The conclusion must, therefore, be reached that the Bond in the light of its words and Sutro\u2019s conduct does not cover the losses sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The task of speculating as to how the New York courts would decide this case, as mandated by <em>Erie, </em>remains. In a field in which even slight factual differences create substantially different legal conclusions and in a search for that \u201ceducated guess\u201d as to New York law, other New York decisions cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Much that was said in the Appellate Division opinion in Condon v. National Surety Corp., 22 A.D.2d 305, 254 N.Y.S.2d 620, aff\u2019d without opinion, 16 N.Y.2d 775, 262 N.Y.S.2d 499, 209 N.E.2d 819 (1965) is apposite \u2014 particularly as to \u201ctrading\u201d (fictitious there to be sure) and as to due care in investigating the financial stability of customers. In Kean v. Maryland Casualty Co., 221 App.Div. 184, 223 N.Y.S. 373 (1st Dept., 1927), aff\u2019d without opinion, 248 N.Y. 534, 162 N.E. 514 (1928) an uncertified check given in purported payment for bonds was dishonored. The court (221 App.Div. at 191, 223 N.Y.S. at 381) noted that the \u201ctransaction\u201d was \u201ca part of the running account\u201d and concluded that \u201cThe loss, therefore, whether regarded as arising directly or indirectly, clearly grew out a trading account.\u201d See also Sade v. National Surety Corp., 203 F.Supp. 680 (D.D.C.1962), aff\u2019d 114 U.S. App.D.C. 281, 314 F.2d 286 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The conclusion is reached that New York law today would support a decision of non-liability under the Bond on the facts here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-18\">.
