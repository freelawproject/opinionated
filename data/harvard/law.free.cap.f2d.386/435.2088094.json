He now contends that his plea was induced by a promise of an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to ask the sentencing court to deal leniently with him. Upon conflicting evidence the district court found that the appellant had not established this factual claim. That finding was permissible and we sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-25\">The court below considered all other contentions of the appellant and, in a properly dispositive opinion, found them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-26\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
