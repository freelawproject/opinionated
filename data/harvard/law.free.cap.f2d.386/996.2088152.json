N. Amos, its Vice President, execute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>a valid and enforceable guaranty in favor of appellee, Edelmann &amp; Company, rendering appellant and Amos jointly and severally liable to appellee for goods sold in the sum of $12,661.85 advanced by ap-pellee on open account to one of appellant\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Trans-co Southern?</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">After thoroughly scrutinizing the record as a whole, we agree that the findings of the District Court reported in Edel-mann &amp; Company v. Transonic Corporation, 277 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.Ga.1967), are not clearly erroneous, F.R.Civ.P. 52 (a), and that the authorities cited therein were governing and correctly applied. In accordance with these views, we affirm the judgment rendered by the District Court on February 7, 1967, awarding judgment to Edelmann, in the above amount with interest thereon from November 7, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
