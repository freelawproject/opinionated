The request for a continuance came after a jury had been selected and witnesses had appeared to testify in a case already four years old. Moreover, the trial judge was persuaded and stated that the request for a continuance was \u201cnot in good faith\u201d. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
