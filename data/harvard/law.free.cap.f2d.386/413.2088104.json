The District Court found in plaintiff\u2019s favor. We agree with the reasoning of Judge Marsh below that \u201cthe accident occurred in the course of operations performed for the named insured (Latrobe) by the independent contractor (Dill),\u201d and that the hazard involved was covered by the policy issued by plaintiff\u2019s coinsurer (Ocean). 261 F.Supp. 223, 226 (W.D. Pa.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Latrobe Brewing Company (Latrobe) contracted with Dill Construction Company, Inc. (Dill) to remove and replace an ammonia system used by Latrobe as the brewery\u2019s cooling plant. According to a stipulation by counsel the ammonia system included: \u201cpipes of various sizes, condensers in shape of tanks for collecting the ammonia gas, and valves which performed varied functions in the system and ammonia gas in the pipes.\u201d An employee of Dill was fatally injured during the removal of the old system due solely to the negligence of Latrobe. In an action by the employee\u2019s estate against Latrobe, defended by Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), a judgment was entered against Latrobe and satisfied by Aetna. There is no question concerning Aetna\u2019s obligation to Latrobe.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Latrobe, however, was also the named insured in a policy issued by Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corporation, Ltd. (Ocean). Aetna seeks reimbursement from Ocean. The question for decision is whether the Ocean policy extends coverage to the accident which occurred. Ocean has not questioned Aetna\u2019s standing to pursue this litigation as the equitable subrogee of Latrobe,</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">The pertinent language of the Ocean policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-13\">[Ocean agrees] [t]o pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person, caused by accident and <em>arising out of the hazards hereinafter defined. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-14\">Definition of Hazards</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-15\">Division 3 \u2014 Independent Contractors Operations performed for the named insured by independent contractors and general supervision thereof by the named insured, if the accident occurs in the course of such operations, other than (a) maintenance and repairs at premises owned by or rented to the named insured and (b) <em>structural alterations </em>at such premises which do not involve changing the size of or moving buildings or other structures. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">Two questions arise. (1) Did Latrobe\u2019s liability arise out of an accident occurring in the course of operations performed for Latrobe by an independent contractor? (2) Was the operation a structural alteration; if so, did it involve changing the size or moving a building or other structure? There is no argument that the work performed by Dill constituted maintenance or repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">Ocean initially contends that since the accident was caused solely by Latrobe\u2019s negligence that it did not arise out of operations performed by an independent contractor (Dill) for the named insured (Latrobe). We agree with Ocean\u2019s argument that Aetna cannot now contest Latrobe\u2019s legal responsibility for the accident. We do not agree that this precludes Aetna from arguing that the accident arose out of Dill\u2019s operation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>two arguments are not mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The policy language \u201carising out of\u201d is very broad and vague. It must, therefore, \u201cbe construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d Manufacturers Cas. Ins. Co. v. Goodville Mut. Cas. Co., 403 Pa. 603, 170 A.2d 571, 573 (Pa.1961). Construed in this manner \u201c \u2018arising out of\u2019 means causally connected with, not proximately caused by. \u2018But for\u2019 causation, i. e., a cause and result relationship, is enough to satisfy this provision of the policy.\u201d Ibid. Although the accident in the instant ease was not caused by Dill\u2019s negligence it did occur while Dill\u2019s employee was performing work for Latrobe. But for Dill\u2019s operations, the accident would not have occurred and Latrobe would have incurred no liability for breaching a duty owed to the employee of an independent contractor. It is not inconsistent to say that the accident arose out of operations performed for Dill by Latrobe because of Latrobe\u2019s negligence. Aetna is not attempting to relitigate the question of Latrobe\u2019s legal responsibility for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Having decided that this accident arose out of operations performed for the insured by an independent contractor we must decide whether the operations involved structural alterations. With one exception insurance coverage is excluded for accidents arising from structural alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">As with the language \u201carising out of,\u201d the phrase \u201cstructural alterations\u201d is indefinite and equivocal. The policy affords no guidelines to disclosure of meaning of the words. Without attempting to give an all-inclusive definition of the term, it is our judgment that the replacement of a cooling system, although perhaps a major undertaking, is not a structural alteration within the accepted meaning of that term. \u201cA structural alteration of a building or its equipment is one which affects some portion thereof in a vital and substantial manner, and changes its characteristic appearance. It denotes a change or substitution in a substantial particular.\u201d Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Hilder-brandt, 119 F.2d 291, 300 (10th Cir. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In the context of the instant case a structural alteration would involve some substantial change in the characteristic appearance of the building itself, and not in the equipment within the building. Having concluded that there was no structural alteration we need not be concerned with the exception to the exclusion of coverage for structural alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Judge Smith did not participate in the decision of this case because of illness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
