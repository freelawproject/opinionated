Section 10(f) Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (f). The Board\u2019s answer prays the order\u2019s enforcement. We think the Board should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-22\">As a whole, the evidence cannot be appraised as failing to furnish substantial undergirding for the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions. It found undue inquisition and surveillance of the employees\u2019 union interest, and the firing of three employees for union sponsorship. Denials of these charges \u2014 originated by the Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen of North America, Local 442, AFL-CIO \u2014 were made, but the Board resolved all the traverses against the employer. Within the Board\u2019s prerogative, the decision cannot now be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-23\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
