The district court heard appellant\u2019s testimony and that of the officer in question, and found specifically that appellant\u2019s version of the facts was not worthy of belief. From a review of the record including the transcript of that hearing we conclude that the district court was not in error in finding that appellant\u2019s plea of guilty was understandingly and voluntarily made and was not the product of threats, beatings, or other coercive acts. We need not consider appellant\u2019s remaining allegations. United States v. Doyle, 2 Cir. 1965, 348 F.2d 715, certiorari denied 382 U.S. 843, 86 S.Ct. 89, 15 L.Ed.2d 84; Snipe v. United States, 9 Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 25, cer-tiorari denied, 382 U.S. 960, 86 S.Ct. 440, 15 L.Ed.2d 363; Benton v. United States, 9 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 59. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-28\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
