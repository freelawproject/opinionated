At gunpoint, the record shows, Allen had held up a laundry. Two eyewitnesses identified him as the culprit. Commissioner Wertleb in compliance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(b) made the determination that <em>the </em>condition of release which \u201cwill reasonably assure\u201d the presence of the accused at trial was a bond \u201cset at $5,000 with 8% cash deposit.\u201d Judge Hart thereafter in the District Court denied Allen\u2019s motion for release on personal recognizance or on other non-financial conditions. Allen then appealed to this court. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147(b) provides as applicable here, \u201cAny order so appealed shall be affirmed if it is supported by the proceedings below.\u201d A majority has concluded that Judge Hart\u2019s order is not lacking in such support and, accordingly, that order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">The \u201cBail Reform Act of 1966,\u201d 80 Stat. 214, Fed.R.Crim.P. 46(c) and the \u201cDistrict of Columbia Bail Agency Act,\u201d 80 Stat. 327, must be read together. A bail determination is a judicial act, an order by a judicial officer, respecting the terms of release, including \u201cany order setting the amount of bail bond or any other kind of security given to assure appearance in court.\u201d Each case presents its own circumstances to be considered by the judicial officer, and no accused is automatically entitled to release. Rather, under the applicable Rule and the statutes, the judicial officer now is not limited to the former bail bond procedure, but is free to impose the first of a series, or a combination of conditions which in his judgment will secure the appearance of the accused for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">The judicial officer in arriving at his determination of conditions of release shall, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-17\">\u201ctake into account the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the evidence against the accused, the accused\u2019s family lies, employment, financial resources, character and mental condition, the length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>of his residence in the community, [and] his record of convictions * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">It is obvious from the record and from the reasons specified by the Commissioner that he had complied with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(b) in making his determination. He had weighed and rejected statements by Allen\u2019s parents as \u201cnot consistent with the evident lack of parental control\u201d over the months preceding arrest. Although only twenty years old and unemployed at the time of his arrest, Allen had been living some months with his \u201cgirl friend.\u201d The Commissioner also had properly taken into account Allen\u2019s previous serious criminal record, including a housebreaking conviction, and an obvious lack of stability on the part of the accused. The <em>first </em>of the conditions to be imposed, he decided, which would \u201creasonably assure the appearance\u201d of Allen for trial was that spelled out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146 (a) (3). That was a decision the Commissioner was authorized to make, and it did not turn upon a position taken by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">It is not at all a question of whether we in the first instance would have required a deposit of 8% or 4% of the amount of the bond set, subject to return of the deposit if Allen appeared for trial. We might even have moved to condition (4) in section 3146(a) which permits the judicial officer to require the execution of a bail bond with solvent sureties or the deposit of substantial cash. This accused had not been detained \u201cneedlessly\u201d but for an end which serves the public interest \u2014 that there be reasonable assurance of Allen\u2019s appearance for trial. The law specifies that a responsible judicial officer must make the determination, and absent cognizable error, it is not open to this court to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We find nothing unlawfully arbitrary or capricious about the bail determination by the Commissioner. There was established no ground whatever for Judge Hart to grant the appellant\u2019s motion for release on <em>personal </em>recognizance or <em>other </em>non-financial conditions. His order finds support in \u201cthe proceedings below,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147(b), and we are bound to affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b684-12\">BAZELON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AjeG\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Our indigent appellant, charged with noncapital offenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was ordered released prior to trial in Criminal No. 623-67 upon the execution of a $5,000 appearance bond and the deposit of 8% thereof ($400) in the Registry of the District Court. His family could raise only $200. He moved for release on personal recognizance or, alternatively, on certain nonfinancial conditions. Although the Government consented to release upon execution of a $1,000 unsecured appearance bond and certain non-financial conditions, the District Court nevertheless denied the motion <em>in toto. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">I believe there are three reasons why the order of the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may not be affirmed: (1) The District Court\u2019s determination that the appellant had insufficient community ties rested on a statement of the District of Columbia Bail Agency that it had been unable to verify appellant\u2019s residence. (2) The District Court offered no reason, and the record reflects none, why a deposit of $400, which appellant cannot furnish, would reasonably assure his appearance for trial, while a deposit of $200, which he can furnish, would not. (3) The District Court considered the nature of the offense charged to assess appellant\u2019s danger to the community, and not to assess the risk of flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">From the Bail Agency\u2019s report that it had been unable to verify the appellant\u2019s address, the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>appellant had insufficient community ties and would not \u201clikely appear.\u201d Appellant\u2019s undisputed testimony, however, showed that he had been living with his parents and that they had changed their address just prior to his arrest. In addition, counsel for appellant represented that appellant had \u201cfor the most part\u201d been living with his parents, staying at his girl friend\u2019s house \u201cnow and then,\u201d and that the Bail Agency\u2019s inability to verify appellant\u2019s address resulted from the fact that his parents had just moved and had no telephone at the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The determination that appellant is without \u201cany great community ties\u201d is not \u201csupported by the proceedings below.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147(b). Boxley v. United States, (order of June 9, 1967), 128 U.S.App.D.C.-, 385 F.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">It plainly appears from the language and history of the Bail Reform Act that its central purpose was to prevent pretrial detention because of indigency. Section 2<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of Senate Bill 1357, U. S. Congressional and Administrative News, p. 2293, which became the Bail Reform Act of 1966, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">(a) The Congress. finds that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">(2) Persons reasonably expected to appear at future proceedings should not be deprived of their liberty solely because of their financial inability to post bail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-16\">(3) Respect for law and order is diminished when the attainment of pretrial liberty depends solely upon the financial status of an accused;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-17\">(4) Bail practices which rely primarily on financial consideration inevitably disadvantage persons and families of limited means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-19\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-20\">(6) Family and community ties, a job, residence in the community, and the absence of a substantial criminal record, are factors more likely to assure the appearance of a person than the posting of bail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-21\">* * * * * * -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-22\">(b) The purpose of this Act is to revise the practices relating to bail to assure that all persons, regardless of their financial status, shall not needlessly be detained pending their appearance to answer charges, to testify, or pending appeal, when detention serves neither the ends of justice nor the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">The committee reports in both the House and Senate identified as the chief evil of the old bail system the automatic reliance on monetary bail with the result that indigent defendants remained in custody while their wealthier counterparts were set free. It was pointed out that the difference in treatment is not justified by any reason relevant to the legitimate purpose of pretrial bail, <em>i. e., </em>deterring flight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>In order to implement the purpose of the Act, \u00a7 3146 establishes a presumption in favor of release on personal recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond; the judge may impose other conditions only if he finds that release upon the preferred conditions will not reasonably assure the accused\u2019s appearance for trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And even after making such a finding, the judge must give priority to non-financial conditions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The Government has agreed to appellant\u2019s release on unsecured appearance bond and certain other conditions; the District Court ordered appellant\u2019s release, as it must under \u00a7 3146(a). Thus, the only question is what conditions are reasonably necessary to assure appellant\u2019s appearance for trial, after he has been released. Nothing in the record supports the determination that a $400 deposit will insure appellant\u2019s appearance while a $200 deposit will not. Without such support, it appears that he is being deprived of pretrial release solely because he cannot raise the additional $200. This deprivation plainly violates both the letter and basic purpose of the Bail Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">It is true, as the majority states, that under the Act \u201cno accused is automatically entitled to release\u201d in a case where the accused is unable to satisfy the only condition which will reasonably assure his appearance. But in light of the scheme and history of the Bail Reform Act, I would require a strong showing that bail in an amount the accused can \u00e1fford will not reasonably assure his appearance, before I would permit him to be detained for lack of bail funds. In the absence of a rational basis, clearly demonstrated, for setting bail in an amount greater than the accused can provide,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I do not believe that the order under review may be affirmed as \u201csupported by the proceedings below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">The Bail Reform Act does not permit pretrial detention in noncapital cases. 18 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a). In establishing conditions of release, the judicial officer is limited to determining what measures are necessary to insure the accused\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>pearance at trial and may not take into account the accused\u2019s potential dangerousness to the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Regardless of the wisdom of its decision, and whether Congress\u2019 constitutional doubts were warranted, Congress clearly did not authorize \u201cpreventive detention.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In the present case, it would seem that the District Court refused to modify conditions of release largely on the belief that appellant would pose a danger to the community if released:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">THE COURT: * * * This was a robbery at gunpoint. He had a gun on him when he was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">MR. LANE [counsel for appellant]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-16\">THE COURT: And he has no record of any address \u2014 he cannot verify any address or any great community ties. I do not think he would likely appear and further I feel he would <em>likely present a danger to the public, </em>and I will deny it. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">MR. LANE: Your Honor, I have confirmed that \u2014 his parents were at the preliminary hearing and I did confirm that two days prior to the time of the arrest they did move from the Oakdale address to the address that the defendant has just given you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">THE COURT: Did you also confirm at the time of his arrest he had in his possession a loaded gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>MR. LANE: That is the testimony at the hearing, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">THE COURT: All right. I will not change my mind on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">As the majority points out, \u00a7 3146(b) does authorize consideration of the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d- \u2014 but <em>only </em>\u201c[i]n determining which conditions of release will reasonably <em>assure appearance\u201d. </em>The nature of the offense may be relevant in assessing the likelihood of flight where, for example, the gravity of the offense raises the prospect of a very long sentence. But the Act does not permit an inference of dangerousness to be drawn from the nature of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">For the above reasons, I would set aside the order of the District Court and remand with the following instructions: that the court re-evaluate the evidence on appellant\u2019s community ties, requesting a verified report from the Bail Agency if it deems inadequate the information supplied by the parties; that the amount required to be deposited be reduced to $200 unless there is some rational explanation in the record why a $400 deposit will assure appellant\u2019s appearance but $200 will not; and that the court take into account the nature of the offense only as it bears upon the likelihood of flight.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">.

Counsel stated that he was able to confirm the information with respect to appellant\u2019s residence by arranging, through appellant\u2019s girl friend, an interview with appellant\u2019s parents. According to counsel, \u201cthe reason the Bail Agency was unable to verify their information was due to the time pressure under which the Bail Agency operates * * * [which] would preclude the kind of arrangements made by defendant\u2019s counsel\u201d. The Bail Agency\u2019s failure to exert greater effort may be the result of inadequate funding and staffing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b685-13\">. The \u201cfindings of legislative intent\u201d in \u00a7 2 (a) of S. 1357 were deleted from the Bill prior to final passage, \u201chaving served their purpose as a means of emphasizing the foundations upon which the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights had initiated the reform.\u201d Ervin, <em>The Legislative Role in Bail Reform, </em>35 Geo. Wash.E.Rev. 429, 452 (1967). (Senator Ervip was the Bill\u2019s chief sponsor in the Senate, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary.) See also H.R.Rep. No. 1541, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1966). Section 2(b) was retained in the final Bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b685-26\">. In reporting S, 1357 to the Senate, the Committee on the Judiciary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-27\">The principle that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of lpw is perhaps the most basic concept (of American criminal justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agi-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>A corollary of this presumption of innocence is that a person accused of crime should not be confined because of his impecuniosity prior to his trial and conviction so long as he can provide adequate assurance that he will be available to stand trial when called.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">Every witness before the subcommittees agreed that, at least in noncapital eases, the principal purpose of bail is to assure that the accused will appear in court for his trial. There is no doubt, however, that each year thousands of citizens accused of crimes are confined before their innocence or guilt has been determined by a court of law, not because there is any substantial doubt that they will appear for trial if released, but merely because they cannot afford money bail. There is little disagreement that this system is indefensible. S.Rep. No. 750, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Similar sentiments were expressed by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">The practice in admitting persons to bail which places primary reliance on financial inducements as the means to assure the presence of the accused at the time of trial seems to ignore the fact that those defendants of limited means who are unable to secure the necessary bail are faced with an impossible situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">iH sfc sj\u00ab jjj</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">The present system of monetary bail would be adequate if all could afford it. The facts, however, are to the contrary. The rich man and the professional criminal readily raise bail regardless of the amount. But it is the poor man, lacking sufficient funds, who remains incarcerated prior to trial. H.R.Rep. No. 1541, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 8, 9 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">See also, remarks of Senator Tydings, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Committee on the Judiciary, during the Senate debate on S. 1357:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-12\">[T]he plain truth is that under our present bail system we do not have equal justice under law. Equality under our bail system is a cherished myth, not a living reality \u2014 the poor have been getting a poorer brand of justice than the rich. The bill before us, S. 1357, revises pretrial release procedures and bail practices in the Federal courts in order to eliminate the unjust discrimination against the poor that our present system fosters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-15\">The legitimate purpose of bail is to guarantee the presence of the accused at his trial. The existing bail system attempts to effectuate this guarantee primarily by conditioning pretrial release on the deposit of a secured bond. But experience has shown, Mr. President, that an accused\u2019s financial ability or inability to post a money bond is largely unrelated to the likelihood that he will appear either at trial or at some other future judicial proceeding. Yet every year, thousands of such persons languish in our jails for weeks and even months, because they cannot afford to pay for their freedom. The number of people who cannot afford even low bail is surprisingly large. The tragic truth is that many of our citizens, simply because they are too poor to afford bail, needlessly suffer the humiliation of extended imprisonment even though they are later acquitted of the crime with which they have been charged, and despite the fact that other measures short of imprisonment might well have been sufficient to give reasonable assurance that they will be present at trial.
