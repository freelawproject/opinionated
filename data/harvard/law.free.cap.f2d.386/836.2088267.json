The government concedes that the Tax Court erred in including income of E T Farming Company in the taxpayers\u2019 income. In all other respects we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s decisions, on the ground that the Tax Court was not clearly wrong in determining that the taxpayers failed to establish that they had transferred growing, unharvested crops to the taxpayers\u2019 twelve corporations rather than transferring to the corporations proceeds from the sale of those crops.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-25\">Remanded for recomputation under Rule 50 in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
