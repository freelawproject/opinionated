The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 156 N.L.R.B. No. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The Board found that respondent interrogated its employees in a coercive manner and requested to see copies of affidavits which employees had furnished an investigator of the Board, thereby violating Section 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Board also found that respondent discharged an employee, Barry James Looney, because of his union membership and activity, thereby violating Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The Board\u2019s order requires that respondent cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found; make an offer of reinstatement to Barry James Looney with back pay to be computed in the usual manner; and post the usual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">We find upon consideration of the entire record that the Board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
