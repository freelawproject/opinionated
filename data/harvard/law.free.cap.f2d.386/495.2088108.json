GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Appellants, John Phillips McClard, Carroll Franklin Simmons and Yerlon Hershel Ussery, appeal from a conviction entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas for violating Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 by entering a bank, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, at Ola, Arkansas, with intent to commit larceny. Judgment was based on a jury verdict of guilty to a one-count indictment on all appellants. The Court sentenced Mc-Clard and Ussery to a commitment of four years, and Simmons to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">Appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, the admission of evidence of a boot worn by Simmons and boot prints taken from the floor of an insurance office that was located in the same building housing the bank, the admission of evidence concerning a pistol found on the front seat of a pickup truck that Ussery was occupying when he was arrested, and the Government\u2019s use of alleged leading questions in the interrogation of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">The appellants did not testify, as is their privilege, and did not offer any evidence in their own defense. Thus the Government\u2019s evidence stands uncontroverted except as to any discrepancies that might appear in the testimony of the eyewitnesses to the incriminating actions of the appellants and other matters relevant to the case. In a criminal case where there has been a conviction resulting from a jury verdict of guilty, the appellate court must take that view of the evidence that is most favorable to supporting the jury verdict and must accept as established all reasonable inferences that tend to support the action of the jury. Any conflicts in the evidence are resolved in favor of the jury verdict. Taylor v. State of Mississippi, 319 U.S. 583, 585-586, 63 S.Ct. 1200, 87 L.Ed. 1600 (1943); Koolish v. United States, 340 F.2d 513, 519 (8 Cir. 1965), cert. den. 381 U.S. 951, 85 S.Ct. 1805, 14 L.Ed.2d 724 (1965); Smith v. United States, 331 F.2d 265, 278 (8 Cir. 1964), cert. den. 379 U.S. 824, 85 S.Ct. 49, 13 L.Ed.2d 34 (1964); Koop v. United States, 296 F.2d 53 (8 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">The record discloses that on January 22, 1967 between the approximate hours of 1:00 a. m. and 3:00 a. m., some person or persons entered the Ola, Arkansas branch of the First State Bank of Plain-view, Arkansas, by prying open the front door of the bank. The front door had been jimmied and there were marks on the doorjamb indicating that some type of tool had been used to force open that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>door. A combination on the vault door of the bank had been hammered off, the outside braces to the door\u2019s locking mechanism had been loosened and the handle on the door that opened the lock had been broken. Several tellers\u2019 drawers had been removed from their receptacles and left on the floor of the bank, and several desk drawers were also removed and the contents \u201crifled\u201d in a search for items of value. Apparently nothing was taken and the intruders left empty-handed. In addition, they left a large screwdriver, a hatchet and a light sledge hammer, together with a tire tool that looked like and probably served the purpose of a crowbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The bank was located at the corner of the intersection of Highway 10 and Main Street. An insurance office was located in the rear of the building that housed the bank, but this was not a part of the bank\u2019s operation. A connecting interior door between the bank and the insurance agency was so constructed that the door could be opened from the bank side at any time, but was locked from the insurance agency area and could only be opened from the insurance agency side with a key. The two outside doors to the insurance agency could be opened from the inside when locked, and were used by the bank\u2019s custodian as his sole means of exit when he would leave after finishing his chores. He did not have a key to the bank premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">When officials entered the bank at 10:00 a. m. of the same morning of the attempted burglary boot prints were noticed in the insurance agency part of the building, the marks being visible because water had apparently been taken from a refrigerator in the insurance agency room and some of it spilled on the floor. The intruder wearing the boots made several well defined boot prints on the insurance agency floor\u2014 eleven boot prints were visible, four of which were processed. There was no question that the bank had been entered and a burglary attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The evidence connecting or implicating the appellants with the attempted burglary is as follows: The appellants were seen by five witnesses during a period of approximately 12:00 o\u2019clock midnight to around 3:00 a. m. on the night of the burglary. When first observed, the appellants were riding in a dark green or black old model Chevrolet pickup truck with red cattle sideboards that was passing up and down the street on which the bank was located. Later the pickup drove up and parked in front of the bank, and the occupants first came around to the bank windows and \u201cfooled around there a little bit and went around to the door\u201d; two of the occupants of the pickup truck were identified by witness Glenn Floyd, who had stopped his car close to the pickup, mistakenly thinking that the occupants were some coon hunting friends of his, and he was thus placed in a position to view all of the occupants, except the driver. Witness Eddie Joe Lawrence noticed the pickup twice cruising up and down the street on which the bank was located. Witness Floyd noticed the pickup parked in front of the bank after he had previously seen it, thinking that he knew the parties. When he saw this pickup parked in front of the bank around 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. and noticed them \u201cfooling around the window\u201d and also \u201cmessing with the door\u201d he left to find the deputy sheriff located in Ola, but he was unable to arouse him. Floyd came back to town and talked with some other boys .in the vicinity of the bank, parking his pickup between the Dairy Queen and the Conoco station which were across the street and located a short distance from the bank. He noticed the individuals in the old model Chevrolet pickup truck with red sideboards again come back to the area of the bank where one of them got out at the bank and went across over between the D-X Station and the cafe. The other two drove the pickup around the block and parked close to the bank. Floyd again went to get the law and was successful in wakening him, after which they both proceeded back to the bank area in the deputy sheriff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">When the deputy first came to the scene he drove by the pickup that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>parked about fifty steps from the bank and saw that it was empty. After driving behind the cafe and the post office he saw three persons running from the bank area toward the filling station. Floyd stayed in the deputy\u2019s car, while the deputy jumped out with a shotgun and gave pursuit to three individuals running across the street. He commanded them to stop but ceased immediate pursuit when he heard a shot. He turned around and saw one of them running back toward the intersection and the others in another direction when he attempted to stop them by firing his gun in the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The deputy then went back to the parked pickup where he found Ussery on the front seat. The deputy ordered him out of the pickup, placed him under arrest and retrieved a .38 snub-nosed revolver lying on the front seat formerly occupied by Ussery. This gun was loaded and one chamber had been fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">McClard and Simmons were arrested that same morning after daylight when they were together on Highway 7, about one and one-half miles from Ola. They were armed with a .357 magnum and a .22 pistol. The appellants were taken to separate jails and the FBI was notified. The FBI agent arrived that morning, inspected the bank and made imprints of the boot prints that were found in the insurance agency area. Simmons was taken to the Russellville jail where the sheriff attempted to interrogate him, but after being advised of his rights he refused to make a statement, and the sheriff that night took his boots to use as evidence. The Government submitted evidence showing that the boot prints found in the insurance agency area were of the same size, design and had the same wear characteristics as the right boot of Simmons. The sheriff also testified that the license on the old model Chevrolet pickup was fictitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">We, therefore, have a situation presented where the three appellants all armed with loaded pistols were driving around the area of the bank in a pickup truck bearing a fictitious license plate in the early hours of the morning, were seen coming from the pickup to the immediate area of the bank \u201cfooling\u201d around the outside windows and \u201cmessing\u201d around the front door that later was shown to have been jimmied. These individuals were later in the same area of the bank and when accosted by the deputy sheriff all fled, which is an indication of guilt. They were apprehended, Ussery immediately, apparently hiding in the pickup truck with a loaded pistol, and the other two after daylight that same morning. The boot prints of Simmons were shown to fit the size, design and wear characteristics of the boot prints found in the insurance agency office, which area is easily accessible from the interior of the bank and allows an undisturbed passage to the outside by use of the insurance agency doors which were locked to the outside but not to the interior.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The Government submitted its case on the theory that at least Simmons had entered the bank and tried to burglarize it, and he was either accompanied by Ussery and McClard, or McClard and Ussery were guilty as principals by aiding and abetting Simmons under Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\"> The evidence, both direct and circumstantial, strongly indicates that appellants were guilty of an attempt to burglarize the bank at Ola. The jury is the judge of the credibility of the witnesses and of the factual issues connecting the appellants with the undenied attempted burglarization of the bank. In reviewing a judgment entered upon a verdict of guilty by the jury we must view the evidence in the most favorable light tending to support the convictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>including all inferences which may be reasonably drawn in support of the jury\u2019s conclusion. (Koop v. United States, 296 F.2d 53, 54 (8 Cir. 1961).)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The evidence strongly singles out the appellants as the perpetrators of this offense, and their conduct in fleeing from the law is indicative of guilt. They were all in the bank area and Simmons\u2019 boot print places him in the insurance agency. They all appeared to be engaged in an attempt to burglarize the bank. No other evidence was introduced or received at the trial to explain their actions, and their actions standing alone with proof of forced entry into the bank were sufficient for the jury to find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The boots worn by Simmons at the time of his arrest and the bootprints processed from the insurance area were clearly admissible. Simmons contends some violation of his constitutional rights and also that no foundation was laid for the admission of this evidence. The relevancy of the bootprints is obvious. Simmons was seen near the bank prior to the offense charged and was no doubt one of the men seen running from the bank at the time the deputy sheriff was investigating the suspicious conduct of Simmons and his companions. When Simmons was apprehended hours later, about one and one-half miles from town, he was wearing the boots which made the boot tracks or prints in the insurance agency area. This evidence under the circumstances places Simmons in the bank. It is an accepted rule of evidence that, for the purpose of identifying the accused as the guilty party, evidence of the correspondence of the accused\u2019s footwear or tracks to prints or tracks found near the scene of the crime is admissible. This is similar to fingerprint evidence that is usually admissible for the purpose of identifying the accused as the offender and to connect him with the offense. As noted in 1 Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 149 (3rd Ed. 1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cThe presence upon the person or premises of articles, fragments, stains, tools, or any other resulting circumstance is consistently employed as the basis of an inference that the person did an act with which these circumstances are associated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Wigmore further notes \u201cTheir relevancy is so patent that no occasion is given for rulings of law; * * See Downey v. United States, 263 F.2d 552 (10 Cir. 1959); Patterson v. United States, 62 F.2d 968 (10 Cir. 1933); Sheppard v. State, 239 Ark. 785, 394 S.W.2d 624 (1965); Anno. 35 A.L.R.2d 856 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\"> The boots may be taken from a suspect as an incident to a lawful arrest for an investigation of the crime and the connection of the accused with the commission of the crime. Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399 (1946). This is not testimonial evidence and does not come within the protection of the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Clothes, features and fingerprints, including imprinting of a suspect\u2019s foot in a plaster cast for the purpose of identification are all permissible steps in a proper investigation of an offense and the accused\u2019s connection therewith. See 8 Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 2265, (McNaughton rev. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">The boot is only an identifying piece of apparel worn by the accused and is far removed from any Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Even identifying physical characteristics are permitted in evidence when relevant. As reasoned by Justice Brennan in Gilbert v. State of California, 388 U.S. 263, at 266; 87 S.Ct. 1951, at 1953, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u201cThe privilege reaches only compulsion of \u2018an accused\u2019s communications, whatever form they might take, and the compulsion of responses which are also communications, for example, compliance with a subpoena to produce one\u2019s papers,\u2019 and not \u2018compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \u201creal or physical evidence\u201d * * * \u2019Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 763-764, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1833, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. One\u2019s voice and handwriting are, of course, means of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>munication. It by no means follows, however, that every compulsion of an accused to use his voice or write compels a communication within the cover of the privilege. A mere handwriting exemplar, in contrast to the content of what is written, like the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside its protection. [United States v. Wade, supra, 388 U.S. 218, 222-223, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Appellants next question the seizure of Ussery\u2019s .38 snub-nosed revolver that was seized when Ussery was placed under arrest. The revolver appeared in plain view lying on the front seat of the pickup truck at a place where it had previously been concealed by Ussery\u2019s body. One shot had been fired from this gun and its seizure and admission into evidence were permissible and relevant to the offense charged. It is common knowledge that burglars and those intent on predatory practices often carry or have at their command loaded guns. These concealed guns are often associated with and mostly used to perpetrate criminal acts. This is but another significant incident in the overall investigation of the attempted burglary of the bank. The arrest of Ussery was legal both for investigation of attempted burglary and for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The legality of an arrest is determined by state law in the absence of an applicable federal statute. United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 589, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1949). Under Harris v. United States, supra, the revolver could be seized as an incident to the arrest or even as an instrument of the crime itself of carrying concealed weapons. As discussed in the Arkansas case of Williams v. State, 237 Ark. 569, 375 S.W.2d 375 (1964), the seizure of articles that were seen by officers in a truck and seized is permissible as a reasonable search and is not violative of the Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures. Here the sight of Ussery\u2019s pistol on the front seat under the circumstances of this case afforded the deputy sheriff probable cause to believe that a crime had been or was being committed in his presence. The arrest of Ussery and the seizure of his pistol without a warrant were proper and legal, as was the subsequent admission into evidence of the testimony concerning the pistol. Busby v. United States, 296 F.2d 328 (9 Cir. 1961), cert. denied 369 U.S. 876, 82 S.Ct. 1147, 8 L.Ed.2d 278 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Some leading questions were asked by counsel for the Government during the trial of this case, but whenever objection was properly made the objection was sustained and Government counsel admonished against asking leading questions. Oftimes leading questions are asked on preliminary and collateral matters to expedite the trial. In any event the control of leading questions is a matter left to the discretion of the trial judge. Absent an abuse of this discretion, there can be no prejudicial error and the appellants in this case have not shown that any of the rulings of the experienced trial judge were erroneous, let alone prejudicial. Stahl v. United States, 144 F.2d 909 (8 Cir. 1944). 3 Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 770 (3rd Ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Appellants had a fair trial and the issues were properly submitted to and explained to the jury in the charge of the trial judge. The evidence, both direct and circumstantial, made a clearly submissible case upon which the jury was warranted in rendering a verdict of guilty. No prejudicial error has been shown to have occurred in the trial of this case. We think the verdict of the jury should stand, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">. \u201c\u00a7 2 Principals</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201c(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is a principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANkJ\">\u201c (b) Whoever causes an act to be done, \u25a0which if directly performed by him would be an offense against the United States, is also a principal and punishable as such.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-11\">LAY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0i\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">I cannot concur in the majority opinion. I do not believe that any man should be convicted of any crime when the government proves only suspicion and circumstances and totally fails to properly prove identification of those persons charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>With all due respect to the majority\u2019s experienced judgment, the record fails to show in any way the essential identification of the three defendants with the crime charged. Individual identification of each of the three defendants is necessary, but totally lacking. Mass identity is even obscured by the government\u2019s proof. The law asks very little in requiring the government to <em>properly </em>prove a case when the ultimate consequence may be to deprive a man of his life or liberty. Courts should not be willing to allow convictions where inferences are derived from facts only suspicioned and not proved. Regardless how zealous we are to have good communities and proper criminal law enforcement, we have contracted with the rule of law that all men are presumed to be innocent until <em>proven </em>by competent evidence to be otherwise. The basic rights of all free men depend upon this principle. Each of the defendants has pleaded not guilty. Each of them must be proven to have participated in the crime charged. Unexplained presence in the vicinity of a burglarized bank is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The majority opinion reflects that the appellants were identified by five witnesses from midnight to around 3:00 a. m. the night of the burglary. I respectfully submit the record not only does not justify this conclusion but totally absent is any competent identification whatsoever. Witnesses called by the state and their evidence are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">EDDIE JOE LAWRENCE. Age 18. He was sitting at a DX station across the street from the bank at approximately 1:00 a. m. with four other boys. He stated he saw a dark Chevrolet pickup \u201cwith red sideboards\u201d pass up and down the main street of Ola. <em>At no time did he identify the appellants or even state how many persons, if more than one, were in the pickup.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">EDWARD ISOM. He was the Mayor of Ola, who was returning from a night of fox hunting at approximately 1:10 a. m. He saw an old pickup with \u201cred sideboards\u201d at the Y intersection of highways 10 and 7, approximately five blocks from the bank. <em>At no time did he identify the people in the pickup or even state how many persons, if more than one, were there. At no time did he identify the appellants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">DR. JAMES PENNINGTON. Coming home from the hospital at 1:00 a. m. on the same night of the burglary he saw an old pickup with red sideboards. He said he saw it a distance of 100 yards in his rear view mirror. Later he saw the lights of \u201csome kind of vehicle\u201d near the bank when he was several blocks away. <em>Obviously, at no time did he identify the appellants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">WILLIAM C. BAKER. Age 18. He was sitting at the Esso station across the street near the bank. He testified that he noticed a pickup truck, dark green or black, go by the main street twice at about 12:30 or 1:00 a. m. <em>At no time did he identify the appellants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">HERBERT M. LAWRENCE. Age 17. He was at the DX station with Eddie Joe Lawrence at approximately 12:30 or 1:00 a. m. He saw a dark pickup twice that night. It had sideboards but he did not notice what color. He said he also saw Ed Isom\u2019s pickup. <em>At no time did he identify the appellants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">OTT ROSE. He was the Deputy Sheriff. He was aroused by the witness Floyd around 2:00 a. m. and drove downtown. He shined his lights between the DX station and the cafe across the street from the bank. He claims to have heard a shot while pursuing three <em>unknown </em>persons. After this chase he returned to a parked pickup and upon opening the door discovered the appellant Ussery lying down inside. There was a gun on the seat. Rose then arrested Ussery. The Deputy Sheriff did not examine the gun at that time to see whether it had been fired. The next day the gun was examined and one chamber was empty. At daybreak he discovered appellants McClard and Simmons one and one-half miles outside of town on the highway. It was shown that they both had possession of loaded guns. <em>The first time Rose identified any of the appellants was up</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>on arrest. </em>There is no evidence that he recognized them as the ones being chased. <em>This leaves only one witness wpon whom the state must rest its case of identification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">GLENN FLOYD. At approximately 12:30 or 1:00 a. m. he came into town to look for Dr. Pennington. He saw a dark green pickup parked at the car wash with its hood up. He thought it was some of his \u201ccoon hunting buddies.\u201d He approached the pickup and observed three persons in it. He could only identify two of them at the trial, and in this regard the following is what the record reflects to be the government\u2019s proof of identity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cQ. Did you see who was inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cA. I seen two of the fellows good, but the other one I didn\u2019t see real good, I saw him, but I didn\u2019t see him real good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">\u201cQ. Could you identify them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">\u201cQ. Could you identify them now, in the Courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">\u201cQ. Will you do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\">\u201cA. The two guys sitting right there, the big one was setting on the outside and the other in the middle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\">\u201cQ. Which one was in the middle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\">\u201cA. The one on the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-17\">\u201cQ. You couldn\u2019t see who was driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-18\">\u201cA. No, sir, I didn\u2019t get a good look at him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-19\">From this testimony we can only assume that the witness identified two of three defendants as occupying the pickup truck. It was either Ussery and Me-Clard, or Ussery and Simmons, or perhaps it was MeClard and Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">In oral argument the government admitted it had failed to properly identify the two persons pointed out by Floyd in the courtroom as being seen at 12:30 in a pickup parked at a car wash. However, the government suggested the two identified were MeClard and Simmons. The government states that appellants\u2019 counsel, Mrs. Weid, implied as much in oral argument. I know of no rule which allows counsel for the parties to even stipulate to incriminating facts on appeal which are otherwise omitted in proof below. If further appeal is taken, or post conviction proceedings are instituted, what record is available of such oral admissions? No authority is offered to show the right of counsel to stipulate to facts in a case where the evidence might otherwise be insufficient to incriminate or convict the accused. The record must be properly presented. We do not sit as \u201ccitadels of technicality\u201d when we require proper identifications in criminal cases. Due process demands it! When multiple parties are tried together, partial identification cannot convict all defendants. To allow this suggests that a joint indictment of co-defendants permits conviction of both upon proof of the guilt of only one. See Butler v. United States, 317 F.2d 249, 254, 6 A.L.R. 3d 582 (8 Cir. 1963), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap7\">\u201cThe authorities dealing with the general subject of identification of the accused, and particularly with the quantum and quality of proof required to establish this element of a criminal case, uniformly hold that proof of <em>the identity of the person toho committed the offense is essential to a conviction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-24\">See also Dawes v.

They first \u201cfooled around a window\u201d of the bank. They then came around to the bank door and then according to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">\u201cA. I couldn\u2019t tell what they were doing, just messing with the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cQ. Messing with the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">**-\u00bb*-\u00bb*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201cQ. Could you tell, Mr. Floyd, whether they were touching the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">\u201cA.

How far away were you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">\u201cA. I was a half a block, I guess, something like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">They then drove away in the pickup. Floyd stated he waited until an hour or so, supposedly to call Dr. Pennington, and then this same pickup drove up and one unidentified person got out and went between the DX station and the cafe. These buildings are both across the street from the bank. The pickup went around the block and then dropped off another person. It was at this time that Floyd went to get the Deputy Sheriff. When they came back they turned their headlights on two persons between the DX station and the cafe. Floyd did not hear a gun go off. The Deputy Sheriff said he shot his and heard another. After the chase, they went back to the parked pickup and found Ussery lying down in the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">I submit the above constitutes a complete summary of the total evidence on identification of the appellants prior to their arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-18\">If we assume Floyd made a proper identification of McClard and Simmons earlier in the evening at the car wash, the fact remains he did not identify the third person driving. This was approximately 12:30. (It is an interesting observation that Floyd confused this pickup with one owned by some fellow coon hunters. He drove a pickup. The Mayor had one. There were several in the area).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-19\">Defendants may well be guilty. My complaint is that the evidence offered did not prove it. It is far better that the guilty go free than to condone conviction of any man on suspicion alone. I think it is important to consider the evidence on the basis of the proven individual participation in the crime alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-20\">McCLARD. The government conceded in oral argument that the only evidence of guilt of McClard is that he was found with Simmons the next day with a loaded gun. There is no evidence McClard was near the bank on the night in question. Assuming Simmons was proven guilty by competent evidence, is the presence with him of McClard the following day sufficient to convict Mc-Clard? No commentary is necessary to condemn \u201cguilt by association.\u201d It is not a rule of law recognized under American justice. The law is that, \u201cIn order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\u201d See Learned Hand, J., in United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2 Cir. 1938), as cited with approval by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the Supreme Court in Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949). See also Diaz-Rosendo v. United States, 364 F.2d 941 (9 Cir. 1966). The latter case, a narcotics smuggling case, also remonstrates that, \u201cGuilt cannot be established by mere association.\u201d 364 F.2d at 944. See United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581 at 593, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210; United States v. Garguilo, 310 F.2d 249, 253-254 (2 Cir. 1962).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Notwithstanding the prejudice to the jury, the possession by McClard and Simmons of guns, hardly tends to prove that they committed burglary the night before.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. Moody v. United States, 376 F.2d 525 (9 Cir. 1967). Assume the witness Floyd made proper identification, and McClard was seen with Simmons parked in the pickup at the car wash about 12:30 a. m. Later that morning two unidentified men were seen getting out and back into the same pickup near the bank. If we infer, which we must, that McClard was one of the two, do we not have to infer he assisted in the break-in? <em>Is this not an inference upon an inference? </em>We cannot infer from a probatice fact not proven.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Again, one hour or so later three unidentified men were seen near the DX station and cafe and Post Office by the Deputy Sheriff. Floyd saw only two. Again through the processes of inductive reasoning, we are asked to conclude that McClard was one of those men. But what evidence is there that he assisted anyone in burglarizing the bank? All these factors make one suspicious of McClard. But a criminal conviction cannot rest even upon probability let alone suspicion and speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">USSERY. He was found lying down in the pickup which earlier was allegedly occupied by McClard and Simmons and a third person. Is it a reasonable inference that he was that third person? If we assume he was, where does this lead to? Can we further assume he was in the pickup when the two unidentified men got out in front of the bank ? What if he were? What did the two men do? What did he do? It was lighted up all around the bank. Several boys were together across the street. No tools were seen or described in the hands of the two near the bank. They were \u201cmessing around\u201d by the door and window. Whenever this may have been, they were not observed in any way touching the door. At the same time several boys were \u201cfooling around\u201d near the DX or Dairy Queen. What does that prove? True, the bank was burglarized, but assuredly not at this time. The men got back into the pickup and left. They did not enter the bank. Does mere presence of two unidentified men in front of the bank establish guilt of this defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">See Coleman v. United States, 113 U.S. App.D.C. 144, 306 F.2d 751 (1962). There, the defendant was convicted along with a co-defendant of housebreaking as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>defined in 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 1801 (1961). The Circuit Court affirmed conviction of the co-defendant in a separate case, there noting that the evidence was sufficient for that conviction (Britton v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 207, 301 F.2d 531 (1962)). In the <em>Coleman </em>case, however, the conviction was reversed, with the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u2018The co-defendant Britton, whose conviction we have affirmed, was shown to have been in the building where the housebreaking occurred, but the evidence failed to bring home to this appellant either that he aided and abetted Britton by acting as \u2018look-out\u2019 or that he participated in any actual breaking or entering of the building, essential elements of the offense charged. By using a police dog to follow a scent appellant was located near the scene, but neither the evidence to that effect, nor other evidence, placed him at any time in the building or established that he had collaborated with Britton in the crime itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cThe jury were not warranted in finding appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As was stated in United States ex rel. Argento v. Jacobs, 176 F.Supp. 877, 883 (N.D.Ohio 1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cThe mere fact that a person is seen in the vicinity of the commission of a crime is not sufficient evidence of his complicity in said crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Ussery was never identified until he was found in the truck. Assuming probable cause for the arrest of Ussery for investigation, this does not prove burglary of the bank. He was found in suspicious circumstances, <em>which he has no burden to try to explain. </em>He has no burden to prove that he was not one that was being chased. If we can infer that he was, does this prove guilt ? Guilt of what? Contrary to the majority opinion, they were never seen running away from the \u201carea of the bank.\u201d But if they were, flight is but the weakest of evidence, unless the facts are known as to the motive of the accused which prompts it. See Vick v. United States, 216 F.2d 228 (5 Cir. 1954), and of course, Hickory v. United States, 160 U.S. 408,16 S.Ct. 327, 40 L.Ed. 474 (1896); Alberty v. United States, 162 U.S. 499, 16 S.Ct. 864, 40 L.Ed. 1051 (1896); and Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). <em>What makes the evidence more tenuous in the present surroundings is that there is no proof in the present case that any of the three appellants were the ones being chased. </em>And it is extremely doubtful at the time of the chase that any crime had been committed by anyone. The bank had been under continued observation by the witness Floyd except for a brief period of time and he did not see anyone at any time enter by the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Ussery may have been guilty of other crimes; but he was charged with burglary and the government must prove it. True, he had a gun, he was found in a truck with a fictitious license plate, shortly after three men were being suspiciously pursued for questioning. But what is shown as to his guilt of the crime charged? His association? And if so, with whom \u2014 McClard ? What proof of association ? What did McClard do ? Perhaps his alleged association with Simmons? But what proof of association? And if so, what did Simmons do?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">SIMMONS. The case relating to Simmons must rely upon the singular proof by the FBI of the comparison of footprints made from tracks in the insurance office and prints taken from Simmons\u2019 boots after arrest. There is no doubt of the admissibility of the prints. However, these prints are again the weakest kind of evidence. They do not stand side by side with the identifying characteristics of fingerprints or blood type. The government\u2019s testimony reflects only that in the opinion of the FBI agent the bootprints from Simmons\u2019 boots are of \u201cthe same size and design and had the same wear texture of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>right.\u201d Similar tracks of shoes worn by an accused cannot stand alone to substantiate sufficient proof of guilt in a criminal trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In this regard, the case of Warren v. State, 52 Tex.Cr.R. 218, 106 S.W. 132, 133 (1907) contains the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cIt would be a dangerous precedent, however, guilty this appellant may be, for this court to lay down a rule'holding that tracks alone, plus a presence within two miles of the scene of a crime, would justify a court in affirming a case. The tracks show that the party making same had on a pair of shoes that had been half soled. The heels of one of the shoes making the tracks was run down and worn off, several tacks were prominent, or several indentations in the tracks appeared to have been made by prominent tacks. These peculiarities are shown to have existed in appellant\u2019s shoes. But * * * [i]t is too well known that shoes are frequently half soled, and it is equally well known that tacks are often prominent therein. It is further a commonly known fact that heels of shoes are often run down or worn off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cThese being matters of common notoriety and knowledge * * *. So believing, we reverse this case because the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict.\u201d 106 S.W. 133.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">See also e. g., Harris v. State, 163 Tex.

State, 122 Neb. 766, 241 N.W. 526, 527 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">What other proof of guilt is there concerning Simmons ? None exists of which I know.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>In summary, it is my opinion that the evidence falls far short of proof that Ussery, McClard or Simmons individually or collectively burglarized the Ola bank. Various burglary tools were found by the authorities inside the bank. Water was allegedly taken in <em>glass </em>jars from a refrigerator, yet no fingerprints of any of the accused were offered from the tools or the glass. Only inconclusive bootprints were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">It is not the province of this court to weigh the evidence and thereby determine guilt or innocence. Ordinarily, questions of identification of the accused are left to the jury to determine from all the facts and circumstances submitted. However, the courts must exercise their responsibility to review the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence, when it attempts to weave mere suspicious circumstances into a web of guilt. We do not encroach upon the function of the jury by setting aside convictions premised on speculative inferences. Nor can the fact that there exists more than one speculative inference satisfy the quantum of proof necessary to convict a defendant in a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Since Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), federal courts are no longer required to give separate instructions concerning circumstantial evidence. 348 U. S. at 139-140, 75 S.Ct. 127. The teaching of that case is that the commonly accepted burden of the government where proof is based upon circumstantial evidence is no different from its burden in cases where there is testimonial evidence. Thus, the rule that the burden of the government requires exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis but that of guilt is no longer acceptable. Other circuits have since adopted new standards of weighing circumstantial proof to determine its sufficiency to sustain conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some still adhere to the <em>pre-Hol-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>land </em>rule, apparently by distinguishing the <em>Holland </em>case as applying only to jury instructions given by the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In Gregory v. United States, 365 F.2d 203, 205 (8 Cir. 1966), we pointed out that there is no separate rule for circumstantial evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and affirmed a conviction on the grounds that substantial evidence tending to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was introduced. It would appear that we have adopted the rule in conformity with the majority of other circuits that where reasonable minds can find substantial evidence on each element of the offense tending to show the accused to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, courts should sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In the present case, taking all of the facts and circumstances together, I do not feel there exists sufficient evidence to sustain a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of any or all of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">Perhaps one or all of the defendants are guilty. I do not know. On this record, I can only speculate. If they are guilty, I certainly do not know when these defendants burglarized the bank. Perhaps it was done after Ussery was arrested, by the other two appellants. In any event, it was not proven. Until emotional distrust becomes the substitute for the rule of law, the presumption of innocence of every person shall persist; mere association or group identification shall not be competent evidence of guilt; and the failure of any man to take the witness stand shall not prejudice him in any way.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Today many laymen feel these rules offer too great a protection for the guilty. However, it is the tested experience of the law that this constitutes a negligible price exchanged for the protection of the rights of the innocent man everywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">I would reverse and remand for a direction of acquittal of each defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-20\">.

The government witness admitted that shoe wear is a good deal like wear and tear on a tire and that he \u201cpossibly could not tell\u201d the difference between a boot-print by a similar shoe with those taken from the floor of the insurance company. The government attempted to point out distinguishing marks of wear made from Simmons\u2019 boots which correspond to the same marks on the prints. However, cursory examination discloses that the overlay print from Simmons\u2019 boot cannot possibly be the same shoe which made the print photographed in Exhibit 26. Examination shows that the back four lugs of the overlay cannot possibly fit on the lift in question. The indistinc-tiveness of the lift cannot account for a different size boot. The heel print qn the overlay of Exhibit 25 hardly fitq within any distinctive pattern of the print itself. Any number of heels could fit the same general shape of the print in Exhibit 25. The same could be said of the overlay on Exhibit 23. On Exhibit 23 no attempt is made to explain the obvious heel mark made by a different shoe. One can only surmise it was made by another \u201cburglar\u201d or perhaps an innocent third person. Assuredly, the boots of McClard and Ussery were within similar constructive custody of the government for examination. Exhibit 24 has an overlay upon which the government demonstrates distinguishing characteristics of Simmons\u2019 boots on photographs. Such evidence sounds persuasive until examination shows that there can be no consistency or logic to this testimony.. The red marks show v\u00a3here voids appear in Simmons\u2019 boots and correspond with voids in the print. Of course, this does not always correspond. This is explained by the statement that the marks on the prints are filled in by the blurring characteristics of the fluid used in taking the prints. We are told that where the voids appear on the picture it proves identity, where they do not it is explained by the process in which the prints are lifted. Many of the red marks are obviously traced from the photograph to appear to be of the same size and design, whereas the actual overlay print demonstrates a different pattern. Some of the red marks enlarge the overlay on Exhibit 24, such as the arrow on the second lug from the left to correspond, not with a void on the photograph but with the blurred print.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">It is true the effect of this testimony and these exhibits are for the finder of fact.

Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others and attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character, and offences charged against him, will often confuse and embarrass him to such a degree as to increase rather than remove prejudices against him. It is not every one, however honest, who would therefore willingly be placed on the witness stand. The statute, in tenderness to the weakness of those who from the causes mentioned might refuse to ask to be a witness, particularly when they may have been in some degree compromised by their association with others, declares that the failure of a defendant in a criminal action to request to be a witness shall not create any presumption against him.\u201d Wilson v. United States, 149 U.S. 60, 66, 13 S.Ct. 765, 766, 37 L.Ed. 650.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
