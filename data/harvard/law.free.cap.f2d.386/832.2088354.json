Plaintiff endeavors to bring this action within federal jurisdiction by asserting that he has been deprived \u201cof his property and personal rights and professional status, contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States\u201d by reason of the alleged slander. From an order granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-23\">The court below properly held that, construing the complaint most liberally, the alleged slander gives rise to no federal claim and that whatever bases there might be for a tort action under state law \u201cthey do not fall within the aegis of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-24\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
