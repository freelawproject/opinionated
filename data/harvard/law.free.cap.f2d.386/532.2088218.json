The Portland police located the automobile in a motel parking lot and determined from the manager that the occupants of the automobile were registered in a particular room. Appellant responded to their knock on the door. They arrested him and searched the room, discovering a part of the loot from the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">We conclude that the arresting officers had \u201creasonable cause for believing the person arrested\u201d had committed a felony, and appellant\u2019s arrest without a warrant was therefore valid under Ore.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 133.310(3). The search of the motel room was incident to that arrest and hence lawful. Cf. Reed v. United States, 364 F.2d 630, 632-633 (9th Cir. 1966). See also Travis v. United States, 362 F.2d 477, 481 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">We have examined appellant\u2019s other specifications of error and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
