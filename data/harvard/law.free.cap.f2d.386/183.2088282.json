The offenses were in violation of Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. The appellant was sentenced to six years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-21\">On this appeal appellant specifies as error that, \u201cThe verdict (sic) is contrary to the weight of the evidence and the verdict (sic) is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">The transactions upon which the indictment is based are a sale of narcotics on May 3, 1964, and an attempted sale on May 20, 1964. With respect to the May 3rd sale, John Lee, a United States Treasury Agent testified that on April 30, 1964, the appellant was telephoned by Barnes, an informer, while Agent Lee listened to the conversation. Lee testified the appellant agreed to sell Barnes an ounce of heroin for $600.00; that \u201cthey\u201d (she and her codefendant Nelson) would deliver it, that she set the date and location for delivery and she guaranteed the quality of the heroin. There is further testimony by Lee that on May 13th, ten days after the sale was consummated, appellant, in answer to Lee\u2019s complaint that he had received less than a full ounce, stated that she could not understand how this happened, since they had measured the heroin with a spoon. She then assured Lee, \u201cThe next time I\u2019ll take care of the weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">Count Seven relates to the attempted sale on May 20, 1964. Agent Lee testified that during his conversation with the appellant on May 13, 1964, she set up the sale for the 20th. She set the price at $500.00 an ounce for twelve ounces. In a second conversation on May 18th, appellant modified the sale to one of two and one-half ounces for $1200.00. Amil Demes, a narcotics investigator for the Fresno District Attorney\u2019s office, who participated in the arrest of the appellant, testified that as he approached the taxi in which the appellant was sit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ting, he saw her attempt to hide a Pall Mall package that she was holding in her hand. He further testified that this Pall Mall package contained a brownish, powdery, substance which was later determined to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Upon appeal evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Teasley v. United States, 292 F.2d 460 (CA 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The evidence is not only substantial, it is overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
