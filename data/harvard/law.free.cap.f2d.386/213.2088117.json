They also obtained a search warrant for her house. The police, accompanied by a federal narcotics officer, proceeded to the Hammond residence at about 8:15 p. m. and were admitted by Joyce Hammond\u2019s common law husband. Joyce Hammond was not at home and the officers decided to wait for her return.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Defendant Martin came to the house at about 9:00 p. m. in response to an invitation from Joyce Hammond\u2019s husband. He knocked on a rear door and was admitted into the kitchen. Defendant, recognizing one of the officers, fled through a hallway leading to the front entrance of the house. He was pursued by two law enforcement officers. During his brief flight he discarded eight packets into an unlighted pantry which opened on the hall. After traveling about ten feet Martin was stopped. A police officer retrieved the packets defendant had thrown and gave them to the federal narcotics officer who identified them as \u201cjunk\u201d (narcotics). One of the police officers then informed the defendant he was under arrest and searched him. The search revealed twenty \u201cballoons\u201d containing heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">Defendant argues that the police were not legally on the Hammond premises and that this vitiated his arrest and the search. The district court found that the officers were legitimately present by reason of a valid arrest warrant. In the instant case, our evaluation of the information presented to the magistrate is considerably hampered by the absence of the affidavit given in support of the application for the search warrant. Although one of the police officers testified that an affidavit had been submitted to the magistrate, such affidavit was apparently mislaid and was never produced. However, we find it unnecessary to pass on the validity of the warrants. Even if we were to find in defendant\u2019s favor on this point, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>would still conclude that the arrest and search of defendant were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Defendant\u2019s pretrial motion, brought pursuant to Rule 41(e), Fed. Rules Cr.Proc., sought to suppress the use as evidence of the narcotics retrieved from the pantry and the \u201cballoons\u201d found on defendant\u2019s person. In denying the motion the district court found that 1) before the defendant was stopped and searched, one of the officers recognized the packets discarded by defendant as containers in which narcotics are frequently transported; and 2) defendant\u2019s person was not searched until the discarded packets had been retrieved from the pantry and identified as \u201cjunk\u201d. These findings are amply supported by uneontradicted evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Assuming defendant\u2019s contention were true, and that the police were illegally present at the Hammond house, there is no doubt that but for the illegal presence the events leading to appellant Martin\u2019s arrest would not have occurred. In Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), however, the Supreme Court refused to consider all evidence whose discovery was causally connected to illegal police activity as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d \u201cRather, the more apt question in such a case is \u2018whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 Ma-guire, Evidence of Guilt, 221 (1959).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">It seems quite clear from the record that the facts leading to defendant\u2019s arrest and search were not a result of the exploitation by police of their possibly illegal entrance into the Hammond house. As soon as Martin recognized one of the officers, he began to run toward the front of the house. He was seen throwing away packets which, when retrieved, were identified by a federal narcotics officer as \u201cjunk\u201d. Defendant\u2019s voluntary act of throwing the packets into the pantry must be deemed an abandonment of his interest therein. Vincent v. United States, 337 F.2d 891, 896-897 (8th Cir. 1964), and therefore subject to the Government\u2019s appropriation. Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 241, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960). Once the packets were identified, the officers were warranted in believing that a felony was being committed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\"> We recognize, of course, that an arrest may not be justified by what an incidental search discloses. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 103, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1960). No such attempt is made here. The continuance of Martin\u2019s detention and his search is supported by the nature of the items Martin abandoned and his provocative acts. It is the existence of this independent probable cause and not the fruits of the search that validates the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">For the reasons stated in this opinion the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">Judge WILLIAM F. SMITH, Circuit Judge, did not participate in the decision of this case because of illness.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-19\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174; 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4704(a); 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">.
