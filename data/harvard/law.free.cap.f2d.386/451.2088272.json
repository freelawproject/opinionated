The appellants claim several errors in the proceedings below; we have considered these claims and find them without merit. We note, particularly, that Judge Weinfeld found as a fact that before defendant Crawford was asked to consent to a search he was \u201cfully advised\u201d of his constitutional rights. Cf. Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Moreover, appellants did not argue in the district court that Crawford at that time was not given a proper warning under <em>Miranda, </em>United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965) (en banc), cert. denied. 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
