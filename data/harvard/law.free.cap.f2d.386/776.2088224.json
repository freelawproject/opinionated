Both Horger and O\u2019Berry sold submachine guns fully assembled and ready to fire automatically to undercover government agents. On the Sunday morning agreed upon by Horger and undercover agents for the transfer and sale of sixteen .50 caliber machine guns, Leavell delivered to Horger\u2019s home nine or ten wooden boxes containing (with what had been delivered \u25a0 by him the night before) all of the necessary parts to assemble 16 fully operational machine guns. Nothing was lacking except pintle and elevation traversing mechanism, neither of which is essential to automatic operation. Horger and O\u2019Berry paid Leavell $2,000.00 in cash and agreed to pay him $2,000.00 more, an amount of money quite inconsistent with Leavell\u2019s contention that he merely sold demilitarized or scrap machine gun parts not intended for assembly. From Horger\u2019s testimony at the trial the jury could fairly infer that Leavell agreed to sell and did sell machine guns \u2014 not just parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">The district judge fairly presented the defendant\u2019s contention and correctly charged the jury, we think, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-17\">\u201c [T] hat in determining whether the 50 caliber machine gun parts seized by the government at the Horger shed were possessed in violation of the National Firearms Act it is necessary that you determine from the evidence in the case that such lot of parts contained all necessary and essential parts needed for assembling of a machine gun; and that the accused knew that such parts were to be used, transferred, or dealt with as a complete machine gun, and with the intent to further such purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-18\">In viewing such conduct as within the ambit of the National Firearms Act, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>find ourselves in accord with the Third and Seventh Circuits. United States v. Kokin, 365 F.2d 595 (3d Cir. 1966); United States v. Lauchli, 371 F.2d 303 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\">The other numerous assignments of error have been considered and are adjudged to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-20\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5801, et seq.
