MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge, did not participate in the foregoing order.</p>\n<author id=\"b692-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">The motions before us are to dismiss, or in the alternative to transfer to another circuit, the petition of Truck Drivers and Helpers Local No. 728, International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Union) to review an order of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-17\">The Union sought before the hearing examiner and in its exceptions a remedy which was not <em>afforded </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>an injunction against \u201cdiscrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment * * * to discourage membership in\u201d the Union, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (3). The Board did not consider this issue, on the ground that it was affording the Union a- remedy under \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act. We do not consider whether on the merits this disposition was within the Board\u2019s discretion. Plainly the motion to dismiss filed by Georgia Highway Express, Inc. (Company) must be denied since the failure of the Board to grant the additional relief sought renders the Union a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s order within the meaning of \u00a7 10(f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-18\"> The Company\u2019s alternative motion for transfer to the circuit where it filed a petition for review, after the Union filed its petition in this court, rests on the claim that the Union has \u201creceived substantially all the relief contemplated, and any shortfall is inconsequential even though it does not eliminate the technical status of \u2018aggrievement\u2019.\u201d International Union, United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Workers v. NLRB (Preston Products Co.), 126 U.S.App.D.C. 11, 373 F.2d 671, 674 (1967). The Board takes no position on the motion to transfer. In our opinion, the Board\u2019s failure to provide a \u00a7 8(a) (3) remedy cannot be dismissed as \u201cinconsequential,\u201d because in the event of a future discriminatory action in regard to hire or tenure there would be a significant difference, in terms of time, convenience and expense, between initiating new proceedings be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>fore the Board or simply bringing contempt proceedings, assuming entry of an order under \u00a7 8(a) (3). Whether and to what extent the possibility of future discriminatory hiring and firing by the employer is a substantial and genuine concern on the part of the Union is not for investigation on this motion to transfer. As noted in the <em>Preston Products </em>case, <em>supra, </em>126 U.S.App.D.C. at 14, 373 F.2d at 674, the possibility of a transfer on the ground that the relief denied by the agency is \u201cinconsequential\u201d \u201cis not to be taken as permitting trial by affidavit on the issue of motivation. It is reserved for the special case where the \u2018inconsequential\u2019 character of the deficiency in findings or relief is established by the petitioner\u2019s own stipulation, * * * or other pleading or representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">We find no merit in the Company\u2019s other contentions in support of its motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Motions denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge, did not participate in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
