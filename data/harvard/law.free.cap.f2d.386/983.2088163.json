The proceedings in the District Court consist of an action by appellee against the International for compensatory and punitive damages for conduct alleged to have been engaged in by the International in connection with a strike of employees of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-17\">In denying the motion for stay of the proceedings it appears from the court\u2019s oral ruling, accompanying its order,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the denial was grounded on the court\u2019s view that the claim of appellee \u201cfor damages for an illegal strike need not be first submitted to the grievance procedure\u201d of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-18\">We affirm the denial of the motion for a stay for the reason now to be stated, without passing upon the reason assigned by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-19\">Invocation by the International of the procedures of the agreement presupposes that the International is a party to or is bound by the agreement. The International, however, did not execute the agreement and is not a formal party to it. Whether the International nevertheless has rights or responsibilities under the agreement is yet to be decided in the suit in the District Court. If it should be found to have no such rights or responsibilities the question whether the subject matter of the suit comes within the arbitration procedures of the agreement would be removed from this litigation; The construction given by the District Court to the arbitration provisions of the agreement accordingly was premature, based as it was on the assumption that the International is bound by the agreement, a matter still to be decided. For this reason alone the motion for a stay of the court proceedings pending resort to the procedures of the agreement was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">.
