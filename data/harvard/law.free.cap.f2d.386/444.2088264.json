Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 382 F.2d 961, which resulted in an affirmance of a judgment entered on March 16, 1966, in favor of the plaintiff against appellant, for personal injuries sustained aboard a ship owned by appellant. The appeal was argued on December 13, 1966. The principal ground for rehearing is the claim that this court misinterpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mascuilli v. United States, 387 U.S. 237, 87 S.Ct. 1705, 18 L.Ed.2d 743 (May 22, 1967) in relying upon that decision as a basis for affirmance herein. In my opinion, petitioner claims quite properly that <em>Mascuilli </em>being undecided at the time of the filing of its brief and of the oral argument, it had no opportunity to present its views as to the effect, if any, of <em>Mascuilli </em>upon this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-18\">On the same day (August 1, 1967) as this Court decided the <em>Candiano </em>ease, it handed down its decision in Alexander v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation, 382 F.2d 963. The issues presented are substantially similar. In the petition for a rehearing <em>en banc </em>in <em>Alexander, </em>counsel claim that \u201cthis Court has been misled by the incorrect presentation of the supposed issue before the Supreme Court in <em>Mascuilli </em>as printed in 35 L.W. 3052.\u201d Reference is made to the three specific questions contained in the petition for certiorari in <em>Mascuilli </em>and the argument is made that the Supreme Court\u2019s granting of the writ and reversing the judgment does not justify an assumption that that Court has rejected \u201cthe doctrine of \u2018operational negligence\u2019 * * * as a factor in the determination of liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-20\">Before considering whether a rehearing would or should alter the decision, a brief review of the factual situations upon which liability is asserted must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-21\">In <em>Alexander </em>the concatenation of events was the lowering of the steel by the crane operator and the striking by the steel of the protruding dunnage. If the dunnage had not been protruding, the possibly too-rapid lowering would not have been of consequence. If a superabundance of caution had been exercised in the lowering operation, probably the dunnage would not have been propelled through the air so as to strike the plaintiff. The jury\u2019s findings of no negligence by the shipowner and of unseaworthiness establish the basis of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-22\">In <em>Candiano </em>the beam fell because the hooks securing it to the lowering mechanism had been improperly attached by fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-23\">At the time of the arguments of <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Candiano, </em>there was a plethora of cases involving negligence and unseaworthiness and a paucity of consistency. No legal principle which might serve as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>a guide for the future could be gleaned from these decisions. In this circuit, the panels were hopelessly divided,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> other circuits achieved no greater consistency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Analyses of these conflicts have been made in various decisions with care and discernment. Judges railed against the necessity of stultifying their judicial minds by being required \u201cto make distasteful hair-splitting distinctions unrelated to any intelligible concepts of right and wrong\u201d (Friendly, C.J. in dissent in Skibinski v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 360 F.2d 539 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied 387 U.S. 921, 87 S.Ct. 2027, 18 L.Ed.2d 975 (1967)) and to make \u201ctrivial, meaningless and confusing distinctions\u201d (Kaufman, C.J. in dissent in Radovich v. Cunard S.S. Co., 364 F.2d 149 (2 Cir. 1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">This Court in 1962 attempted to cope with the problem by sitting <em>en banc </em>in Puddu v. Royal Netherlands S.S. Co., 303 F.2d 752. In <em>Puddu </em>by a six to two vote, the Court sought to perpetuate Judge Learned Hand\u2019s previous (1956) approach in Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919 by the \u201cincident in a continuous course of operation\u201d theory (p. 922). Subsequent cases (and quite to be expected) had to struggle with: what is \u201ccontinuous\u201d? and what is the \u201coperation\u201d? In <em>Puddu </em>the Court said both that \u201cTime is obviously irrelevant\u201d (303 F.2d p. 757) and that it should consider whether the \u201cincident\u201d was in a continuous course of operation and a \u201cmomentary step or phase in the progress of work on board\u201d (Grillea, 232 F.2d p. 922). The Supreme Court denied certiorari, 371 U.S. 840, 83 S.Ct. 67, 9 L.Ed.2d 75 (1962). In the ensuing years, 1962-1967, the cases continued to be decided virtually without rhyme or reason. Judge Feinberg (the trial judge in <em>Candiano, </em>and now on this Court) has suggested with good reason considering \u201cwhether the distinction [between operational negligence and unseaworthiness] should not be dispensed with altogether.\u201d Radovich v. Cunard Steamship Co., 364 F.2d 149, 153 (2d Cir., 1966). Judge Hastie in his dissent in Thompson v. Calmar, 331 F.2d 657 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Cir., 1964) thought, it to be \u201cridiculous to apply the concept of unseaworthiness to such eases as these\u201d (p. 663).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Now in 1967 confusion still reigns in a field wherein there is a vast amount of litigation in the federal courts \u2014 particularly in the seacoast circuits. There should be some uniformity of rule \u2014 not only in the interest of justice but also of fairly reasonable consistency. If the courts wish to create (actually by judicial legislation) a principle that any seaman injured on board a ship is entitled to recover and the only fact question which may be submitted to the jury is his contributory negligence, if any, the trial courts, shipowners, longshoremen and insurance companies at least will know the problems then facing them in and out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">But what has happened since <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Candiano </em>were argued (October 28, 1966 and December 13, 1966, respectively) ?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">On May 15, 1967 the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Foster v. Lykes Bros., 387 U.S. 908, 87 S.Ct. 1685, 18 L.Ed.2d 627, wherein the Fifth Circuit had affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of a recovery to a seaman on the ground that negligence of a fellow longshoreman does not make a ship unsea-worthy (368 F.2d 326).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">On May 22, 1967, the Supreme Court decided <em>Mascuilli, </em>supra, in a brief <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201cThe petition for a writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment is reversed. Mahnich v. Southern S.S. Co., 321 U.S. 96, 64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561; Crumady v. The Joachim Hendrik Fis-ser, 358 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 445, 3 L.Ed. 2d 413. [15 NCCA 2d 265]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The finding of the trial court in <em>Mas-cmlli </em>was specifically noted by the Court of Appeals in its <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion, 358 F.2d 133 (3 Cir., 1966), the court stating that the trial court\u2019s findings, including the finding \u201cthat the accident was caused solely by the negligent operation of the stevedoring crew as stated in finding of fact #35,\u201d were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">On June 5, 1967, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Fenton v. A. S. Glittre et al., 387 U.S. 944, 87 S.Ct. 2077, 18 L.Ed.2d 1331, wherein this Court had affirmed the dismissal of a complaint alleging injury caused by cargo falling because of the negligent handling of a crane by a fellow longshoreman (370 F.2d 146).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">Petitioner in <em>Candiano </em>argues that these denials indicate that the Supreme Court did not intend to abolish the doctrine of \u201coperational negligence\u201d and petitioner in <em>Alexander </em>contends that <em>\u201cMascuilli </em>is not authority for the proposition that the doctrine of operational negligence has now been rejected by the Supreme Court as a factor in the determination of liability.\u201d (Alexander, Pet. p. 5.) What the law is today will depend upon the decisions of the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">The time element in the operation is \u201cobviously irrelevant.\u201d Practically no loading or unloading operation could be carried on which required a separate timekeeper for every man working in a gang. Assume that every timekeeper set his stop-watch at the commencement (according to his judgment) of the \u201coperation,\u201d it still would be necessary for the courts to fix the period permitted to elapse, before operational negligence was transformed into unseaworthiness. And since notice to the shipowner is no longer of consequence, the time element is meaningless from the standpoint of giving the owner notice of, and an opportunity to remedy, the defect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">Since the Spring of 1967, the Fifth Circuit has decided at least four cases in this field. Chronologically on May 9, 1967 the Court in Dugas v. Nippon Yusen Kaisha, 378 F.2d 271, affirmed a directed verdict in favor of the defendant where dunnage boards fell on the plaintiff. The hookup man (a fellow employee) had placed a single sling, instead of the required double sling, around the load <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>which was being lowered. The Court rejected the argument that, during the 10 to 15 seconds which elapsed between the placing of the sling and the raising of the load with the resulting fall, an unseaworthy condition had been created. But, even assuming that there were an \u201cunsafe condition\u201d in this \u201cmomentary interval,\u201d the Court was satisfied that the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance after two rounds of <em>Morales </em>(Morales v. City of Galveston, 275 F.2d 191 (5th Cir.), vacated and remanded, 364 U.S. 295, 81 S.Ct. 107, 5 L.Ed.2d 84 (1960); 291 F.2d 97 (5th Cir. 1961), aff\u2019d 370 U.S. 165, 82 S.Ct. 1226, 8 L.Ed.2d 412 (1962)) required or at least permitted this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">However, less than a week later (May 15, 1967), the same Fifth Circuit in a case where there was no claim of negligence but solely a question of an unexplained escape from the cargo sling of the steel beam which struck and injured the plaintiff, reached a quite different result. Marshall v. Ove Skou Rederi, A/S, 378 F.2d 193. The trial court had found that \u201cthe equipment used in the loading operation was not shown to be unseaworthy\u201d; the appellate court found that the gear was properly operated and that there was no evidence of negligence \u25a0by any of the participants in the operation. The court had difficulty in finding \u201ctransitory unseaworthiness\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> saying, \u201cBut this accident occurred under the most antiseptic conditions possible. The winch was operated properly. The load struck nothing. The sling did not break. No new agency affected the sling. The loading operation was done without negligence. The sling simply did not perform its single assigned purpose of retaining the load without dropping it while moving it from point A to point B\u201d (p. 198). The Court imposed liability because the shipowner must have been aware of \u201canticipated operating conditions.\u201d There \u201cthe force and hazard to be incurred\u2014 single, obvious and great \u2014 by this cargo sling was the simple one of the force of gravity * * * which, unless guarded against by operating proficiency, would cause the tilled beam to slip from the sling and fall and hurt someone\u201d (p. 198). Regardless of the Court\u2019s explanatory conclusion that \u201cThe present case is of failure of equipment to carry out its assigned function while in normal use in a situation of high and known hazard and without the effect of any external force or event,\u201d the decision actually would appear to stand for the proposition that: the accident happened, therefore the ship must be considered unseaworthy. Judge Rives\u2019 concurrence, relying on <em>Van Carpals </em>in this circuit and <em>Walker </em>and <em>Mills </em>in the Fifth, supports this conclusion: \u201cThere is simply no explanation for the accident, except either the choice of an improper method of loading or the unfitness of the sling used to lower the beam\u201d (p. 202).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first hypothesis, however, would appear to involve operational negligence; the second is not supported by the facts because the equipment was found by the trial court to be without defect and of the type customarily used for this operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">To add to the confusion, the Fifth Circuit on April 13, 1967 had decided Antoine v. Lake Charles Stevedores, Inc., 376 F.2d 443 and Robichaux v. Kerr McGee Oil Industries, Inc., 376 F.2d 447. In <em>Antoine, </em>the plaintiff was injured when pinned against the side of the ship by a load being lowered into the hold. The trial court had concluded that \u201coperational negligence\u201d could not be characterized as \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d and dismissed the case. On appeal, the court affirmed. But, on the assumption that that court had never \u201cexpressed itself, until now [April 1967], in the specific area of \u2018operational negligence\u2019,\u201d it then proceeded (after analyzing many cases) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to come to the conclusion that \u201cIt would serve no useful purpose to rehash the many decisions by the Supreme Court and the various Courts of Appeals since <em>Sieracki, </em>supra, (376 F.2d p. 446). However, since to that court \u201cit does not appear that the Supreme Court has gone so far as to hold that the shipowner is liable for \u2018instant unseaworthiness\u2019, based upon the very act of a fellow longshoreman which causes the injury\u201d (p. 445), the dismissal was affirmed. In <em>Robichaux, </em>the same panel remanded for specific findings as to whether the alleged negligence created an unseaworthy condition. In both cases as well as in the court\u2019s analysis of the Ninth Circuit cases, the time element was stressed, the court in <em>Robichaux </em>indicating that if \u201cappellant was injured <em>after </em>the negligence took place, rather than at the time of the negligent act, the vessel would, under the law, be considered unsea-worthy, Beeler v. Alaska Aggregate Corp., 336 F.2d 108 (9th Cir.,. 1964) and Blassingill v. Waterman Steamship Corporation, 336 F.2d 367 (9th Cir., 1964) ; otherwise not\u201d (376 F.2d p. 449).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The time element (\u201cmomentary interval of time\u201d) stressed in <em>Antoine, Robi-chaux, </em>and <em>Dugas </em>as a determining factor was not mentioned in <em>Marshall. </em>There the element against which the shipowner should have guarded was said to be the force of gravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">This \u201crehash\u201d has probably been no more fruitful than the many previous reviews of cases by the various circuits searching for, but not finding, a rational basis for decision. The real difficulty in the future will arise at the trial level. If there are any facts to be determined by a jury other than assessment of damages and contributory negligence, how is the trial judge to charge? Is \u201coperational negligence\u201d to be mentioned at all? When does the \u201coperation\u201d commence? How momentary is a \u201cmomentary interval\u201d? Is \u201cinstant negligence\u201d to be added to \u201cinstant unseaworthiness\u201d? Many other similar questions undoubtedly will arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Some guidance from the Supreme Court in this area may be found at the end of the majority opinion in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960), where the Court, apparently unwilling to state affirmatively a rule of absolute liability, added a penultimate paragraph which has been used in whole or in part by almost every trial judge since 1960, either in the jury charge or in a non-jury decision. The Court, citing Sieracki<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Mahnich, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had just said that \u201cthe shipowner\u2019s duty to provide a seaworthy vessel\u201d is \u201cabsolute\u201d <em>(Mitchell, </em>p. 549, 80 S.Ct. p. 932). But the court straightway answered the question: what is the duty which is absolute?, by stating \u201cit is a duty only to furnish a vessel and appurtenances reasonably fit for their intended use.\u201d Were a trial judge to follow <em>Mitchell, </em>a charge refreshingly simple could be made, in substance: \u201cThe shipowner is not obligated to furnish an accident-free ship but only a vessel and appurtenances reasonably fit and suitable for their intended use and service.\u201d Based upon the Supreme Court decisions between 1945 and 1960, the law may have been clear in 1960, namely, that a principle of \u201ccomplete divorcement of unseaworthiness liability from concepts of negligence\u201d <em>(Mitchell, </em>p. 550) had evolved, but this clarity has been considerably dimmed by appellate decisions between 1960 and 1967. Negligence would appear to create unseaworthiness from the very moment of the act. The words \u201creasonably fit\u201d and \u201creasonably suitable\u201d lose all significance if the happening of the accident in and of itself is regarded as an adequate demonstration that the ship was not in such condition. See <em>Marshall, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Both <em>Candiano </em>and <em>Alexander </em>under modern concepts of unseaworthiness present \u201cunseaworthy\u201d facts. Even though operational negligence created the unseaworthiness, it is difficult to find any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>place for such a doctrine as a defense against liability, if the very finding of operational negligence is a simultaneous finding of unseaworthiness. The alchemy is instantaneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In summary <em>Mascuilli </em>may be explained on the basis of Crumady,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> namely, that the safety circuit breaker was improperly set so that the controller did not trip and thus cut off the power. <em>Wald-ron </em><footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (May 8, 1967) may have created a doctrine of unseaworthy seamen. The Fifth and Ninth Circuit cases speak of operational negligence and try to set up a momentary time theory. The Third and Fourth Circuits are virtually committed to an absolute liability doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Were <em>Candiano </em>to be resubmitted today, these intervening cases would only strengthen the conclusion that the negligent hook-up followed by \u201can appreciable period of time\u201d (as found by the trial court) would create an unseaworthy condition. As to <em>Alexander, </em>the protruding dunnage alone would have produced a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In my opinion, the whole process of straining to impose liability has become completely unrealistic. As a basis for decision, the term \u201cunseaworthy\u201d is utterly meaningless as Noah Webster defined the word. From the time notice to the shipowner of a defect with a reasonable opportunity to remedy it was written out of the law, the instances, to which the word unseaworthy has been applied, to my mind have advanced (or retrogressed) from the absurd to the ridiculous. However, believing the function of the courts to be adjudication in accordance with current applicable decisions (and not judicial legislation) I adhere to the decisions already rendered in <em>Candiano </em>and <em>Alexander </em>and, hence, believe that a rehearing by the Court would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-5\">.
