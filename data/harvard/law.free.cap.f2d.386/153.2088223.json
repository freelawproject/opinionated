Similar or identical petitions were filed by other inmates. After considerable procedural delay in application of the discovery process and through appellant\u2019s dismissal of the action and the granting of a subsequent motion to reinstate it, trial of the issues began on November 23, 1965, at Leavenworth. Before all witnesses were heard the trial was recessed and when it was resumed the defendant Warden had issued and effectuated Policy Statement No. L 7001.1</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Revised, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">\u201cSUBJECT: BLACK MUSLIMS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-17\">1. POLICY. It is the policy of this institution that groups of inmates professing belief in any faith be provided a place to meet. It is further the policy of this institution that groups of inmates meeting for any purpose whatsoever be supervised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-18\">2. PURPOSE. This issuance authorizes meetings of inmates professing to be Black Muslims or followers of the nation of Islam and outlines the conditions under which such meetings are authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-19\">3. EFFECTIVE DATE. Group meetings are authorized immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-20\">4. CONDITIONS.

SPECIAL. Special authorizations concurrent with this policy statement are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">a.

Minister Clyde will be accompanied by Mr. Bennie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">c. All inmates professing to be Black Muslims will be permitted to mail special purpose letters to Minister Clyde.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">6. CANCELLATION. This Policy Statement L 7001.1 \u2014 Revised cancels Policy Statement L 7001.1, dated 1-12-66 and is substituted therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\"><em>/&amp;/ </em>J. T. Willingham J. T. Willingham Warden\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Thereafter the trial court entertained and granted a motion to dismiss for mootness because the intervening event precluded or made unnecessary the granting of effectual injunctive relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Two contentions raised by appellant in his pro se brief seem worthy of note. First, he points out that the claims he makes are constitutional in origin and as such are not subject to the expediency of administrative policy making. We agree that appellant\u2019s First Amendment right of freedom to believe is indeed a right that is not subject to the discretion or element of grace inherent in policy making. However, it does not follow, as appellant argues, that he has an absolute right to a judicial decree based on conditions existing at the time of his original petition. An administrative compliance to appellant\u2019s rightful demands does render unnecessary a judicial determination of those rights and an enforcement of them through judicial process. And we are satisfied, as was the trial court, that Policy Statement No. L 7001.1 Revised, contains no limitation that is unconstitutional upon its face and that its issuance was a proper method of recognizing and according rights to Muslims.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">Also, and with considerable emphasis, appellant argues, in effect, that the administration of the rights purportedly expressed in the subject Policy Statement amount to sham and that the Warden is continuing to ignore and disregard the rights of Muslims. In making this contention appellant again correctly recognizes a fundamental \u2014 that an administrative rule can grant a constitutional right but deny it by method of administration. Such a contention raises the complexities inherent in the balancing of the right to believe a religion and the right to practice it in all its differing aspects within the confines of a prison. The judgment of the court below does not adjudicate this claim, nor in the posture of the case then existent was it required to. Nor do we express any opinion in regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
