He was denied entry but was paroled into the United States, where he has remained ever since. No proceedings to effect his deportation have been brought under \u00a7 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). In 1966 he made application on his own initiative for discretionary relief under \u00a7 244(a), and it is the order denying him that relief which he now seeks to have reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">The order, not having been entered in the course of \u00a7 242(b) deportation proceedings, is not ancillary to such proceedings and hence is not reviewable under \u00a7 106(a). Yamada v. I &amp; N S, 384 F.2d 214 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-22\">Accordingly the petition for review is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
