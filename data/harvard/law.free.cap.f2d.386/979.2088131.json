When such committee adopts a resolution requiring that such members be so elected, candidates for membership on said committee shall file their declaration of candidacy as other state and county officers in the primary election to be held by such political party.\u201d Ala.Code, Tit. 17, \u00a7 342.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A75\">There appears to be no law prescribing the terms of office of such committee members. The appellants\u2019 brief states that, \u201cSince elections to the Executive Committee are spaced four years apart (Deposition of T. W. Paris, 26, 27), absent a special election, the next election will not take place until 1970.\u201d The ap-pellees respond: \u201cThe statement on page 11 of Appellants\u2019 brief, \u2018new elections in Barbour County for Committeemen will not take place until 1970,\u2019 is not supported by the evidence, which will be apparent from a careful reading of the deposition of T. W. Parish (sic) on pages 26 &amp; 27.\u201d We find nothing in the evidence from which to determine whether elections to the Barbour County Democratic Executive Committee are spaced four years apart or two years apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Beginning in 1940, regular primary elections are held in Alabama on the first Tuesday in May every two years. Code of Ala.1940, Tit. 17, \u00a7 340. There is no reason to delay beyond 1968 the relief to which the district court held the plaintiffs (appellants) entitled. See Watson v. City of Memphis, 1963, 373 U.S. 526, 532, 533, 83 S.Ct. 1314, 10 L.Ed.2d 529. To remove any uncertainty, there is added to the judgment of the district court the following: \u201cThe present terms of office of members of the Barbour County Democratic Executive Committee shall expire immediately after the results of the primary election to be held in said County on the first Tuesday in May 1968 have been ascertained and declared.\u201d As so modified, the judgment is affiripgd. The costs of this appeal shall bp taxed equally against the appellants and the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
