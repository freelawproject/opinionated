Y. plant on the basis of the union\u2019s claim that it held authorization cards signed by a majority of the em-. ployees. The ground for the decision was that General Counsel had not sustained the burden, which the Board considered to rest upon him, of negating the employer\u2019s claim of good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-25\">The organizing campaign, begun in mid-August 1965, had progressed with sufficient speed that by September 2 organizer Ryan, accompanied by union vice president Richards, went to the plant, met with company president Rue-ger, claimed that a majority of the employees in the unit had signed authorization cards, and demanded recognition. Rueger rejected the demand, stating \u201cYou say you represent a majority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>people. Well, I have heard that before. And apparently it wasn\u2019t true then, and I\u2019m not sure it is true now.\u201d He refused an offer to examine the cards, referring Ryan instead to the company\u2019s lawyer, Campbell, who handled all its labor problems. Rueger promptly telephoned Campbell who then called Ryan. The latter renewed his demand for recognition and his offer to exhibit the cards. Campbell refused, saying he did not believe in card counts because \u201csomething\u201d might later come up to \u201cembarrass us,\u201d but expressed willingness to consent to an early election. Claiming that he was exceptionally busy, he said he would rather not file a petition for an election, but asked Ryan to file one and promised he would consent to an early vote. The union did file and, at a September 7 meeting at the Board\u2019s Buffalo office, both sides agreed to an election on September 16. In the course of the meeting Ryan made a final demand for recognition without an election and Campbell remarked, \u201cLook, you have had two years to be signing these employees up in gin mills, and I need a week to turn them <em>around\u201d;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is unclear whether this was said in response to Ryan\u2019s demand or was part of the discussion concerning the date for the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">During the ten day campaign period the company sent each employee two letters arguing against the union, and Rueger addressed both shifts on September 14 to the same purpose. The union lost the election 53-22, but petitioned to have it set aside, which the Board did, finding that certain portions of Rueger\u2019s speech exceeded the permissible bounds of campaign propaganda. A new election was ordered but the union withdrew its election petition after filing the charges that led to the decision here under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The Trial Examiner upheld the union\u2019s complaint that Hercules had violated \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Act, since on his view it had a majority of valid authorization cards and the company had not proved it doubted this in good faith. He held also that three portions of Rueger\u2019s campaign speech were coercive and violated \u00a7 8(a) (1). The Board adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusions as to \u00a7 8(a) (1), a ruling which Hercules has not challenged, but declined to accept his recommendation as to \u00a7 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The Board acted well within its powers in ruling that the general principle whereby the General Counsel carries the burden as to all elements of an unfair labor practice charge, cf. NLRB v. Park Edge Sheridan Meats, Inc., 341 F.2d 725, 728 (2 Cir. 1965); NLRB v. Majestic Weaving Co., 355 F.2d 854, 859 (2 Cir. 1966), applies also to the issue of good faith doubt once the employer has raised it, even though this requires the General Counsel to prove a negative. Indeed, it is not clear that the union argues otherwise; rather it contends that no substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the General Counsel had not made out his case on the facts here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">The union argues first that Hercules did not make a sufficiently clear and unequivocal statement of its doubt when the union demanded recognition. But the law does not require the employer to express this by reciting any set formula, see NLRB v. River Togs, Inc., 382 F.2d 198 (2 Cir. 1967). . Rueger\u2019s statement of disbelief in the union\u2019s majority status was a sufficient expression of doubt to negate any claim that this was' an afterthought. While attorney Campbell\u2019s statement to Ryan on the telephone was more equivocal, the Board was justified in believing that, taken at its worst, it did not undermine his client\u2019s explicit language. The Board was even more clearly warranted in refusing to attach the sinister meaning urged by the union to Campbell\u2019s statement that he needed a week to turn the employees around. The context makes it far more likely that this was said in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>with the date on which the election would be held, which was the dominant concern of the September 7 meeting, than in response to the union\u2019s renewed demand for a recognition it knew would not be forthcoming. Experienced labor attorneys do not ordinarily choose the Board\u2019s, offices as places for the commission of unfair labor practices. Campbell\u2019s demand for an adequate period to present Hercules\u2019 side of the story to its employees by no means compels the inference that the company believed the union had a valid card-count majority; it could equally manifest a desire to keep a majority convinced that unionization was not in their best interests. Even the phrase about turning the employees around is entirely consistent with an intention to appeal to employees who had signed cards on the basis of misrepresentations that these would have no effect unless confirmed by an election, as was the case with a number of the signers here.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">There is equally little force in the union\u2019s argument that an employer cannot be held to have a good faith doubt when he rejects an offer allowing him to examine authorization cards or to have a disinterested person do so. There is no need to cite the many cases in this court and others where a union with a majority of authentic cards has been found to lack a valid majority. Yet examination of the cards goes to only one element necessary to the union\u2019s majority status; it shows nothing on the equally important factor of how the cards were obtained. People\u2019s Service Drug Stores, Inc. v. NLRB, 375 F.2d 551, 556 (6 Cir. 1967). For an employer to say in effect, \u201cI will concede you may have a majority of signed cards but I distrust their validity,\u201d is in no way inconsistent with good faith doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">If we should assume, which we do without deciding, that an employer relying on good faith doubt of a union\u2019s majority, while not bearing the ultimate burden of proof, must come forward with some evidence of a reason, that was done here. The Textile Workers had demanded recognition as bargaining agent for these same employees on the basis of authorization cards two years before. When the company rejected the demand, the union lost the ensuing election 40-25.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Teamsters had made a similar demand and encountered a similar rebuff at the polls two years earlier. While loss of an election by a union with an apparent card majority does not establish that the majority never existed, it is some evidence of this, especially if the loss was by a substantial margin; moreover if such a union then turns up with another card majority, the employer has reason to question whether this was validly obtained. The cases properly recognize that \u201cPrevious experience with card checks and union elections, is a factor which must be considered in determining the good faith doubt of an employer.\u201d People\u2019s Drug Stores, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, 375 F.2d at 557; see also NLRB v. Johnnie\u2019s Poultry Co., 344 F.2d 617 (8 Cir. 1965); Wausau Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 377 F.2d 369, 373 (7 Cir. 1967); and NLRB v. Hannaford Bros. Co., 261 F.2d 638 (1 Cir. 1958) (Magruder, J.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These considerations have especial weight when, as here, the majority is slender on the union\u2019s own claim. Ryan at no time had the cards of more than 43 employees; indeed the Examiner found that when he made his first demand upon Rueger, he had only 39 cards in his possession \u2014 one less than needed for a majority even if all the cards were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>The union\u2019s argument that Hercules\u2019 communications to its employees during the election campaign prove that it never doubted the union\u2019s card majority is likewise without merit. The use of campaign speech as evidence to infer bad faith at an earlier time is a hazardous business as we pointed out in NLRB v. River Togs, Inc., supra, 382 F.2d at 206-207; since votes may be gained or lost during a campaign, presenting anti-union arguments affords no logical basis for belief that the employer did not doubt the card majority. See Wausau Steel Corp. v. NLRB, supra, 377 F.2d at 372-373; NLRB v. Hannaford Bros. Co., supra; Lesnick, Establishment of Bargaining Rights Without an NLRB Election, 65 Mieh.L.Rev. 851, 854-856 (1967). While the three portions of Rueger\u2019s speech that the Board found to be violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1) do indicate that Hercules wanted to win the election, they cast no shadow on its good faith doubt before the campaign began. A paragraph in one of the two campaign letters stating that Rueger refused to recognize the union on its card majority because the company\u2019s lawyer \u201cadvised that an NLRB supervised election was the only fair and certain way to determine whether employees wanted this union\u201d is likewise inconclusive. One excellent reason why an employer might think \u201can NLRB supervised election\u201d to be \u201cthe only fair and certain way to determine whether employees wanted\u201d a union would be knowledge of the manner in which authorization cards have often been obtained. Indeed, another paragraph of the very letters here challenged can be read as indicating that Hercules refused to trust in the union\u2019s card majority because of its past experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Our discussion of the facts of this case demonstrates how far removed they are from those in Retail Clerks Union Local No. 1179 v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 186 (9 Cir. 1967), upon which the union heavily relies, where a divided court reversed the Board\u2019s finding of good faith doubt in John P. Serpa, 155 N.L.R.B. 99 (1965). The employer in that case never stated that he doubted the validity of the cards, and he had no prior experience giving him cause to do so. Indeed, the court indicated that its decision might have been different if the employer had expressed a bona fide doubt. Id. at 189. The facts in NLRB v. Johnnie\u2019s Poultry Co., supra, are nearer those in the instant case. The employer there had refused an earlier demand for recognition on the basis of a substantial card majority; the union lost the ensuing consent election 41-27. A year later the same union forwarded photostats of the authorization cards of 49 of the 93 employees in the unit and made a demand for recognition. The company refused, simply stating that \u201cwe do not recognize the copies of the cards you sent us as a reliable indication of the present desires of our employees.\u201d The court refused to enforce an order finding the company in violation of \u00a7 8 (a) (5), holding that, given the company\u2019s previous experience with the unreliability of authorization cards as an index of employee sentiment, there was no substantial evidence that its refusal to bargain was not motivated by good faith doubts of the union\u2019s majority. <em>Johnnie\u2019s Poultry </em>is <em>a fortiori </em>authority here where the Board has found in the employer\u2019s favor. We thus find it unnecessary to determine whether we would follow the majority or the dissenting judge in <em>Retail Clerks </em>upon the facts there presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Since the Board was thus justified in holding that General Counsel had failed to sustain the burden of negating Hercules\u2019 claim of good faith doubt of the union\u2019s status, we need not consider Hercules\u2019 impressive claim that because of misrepresentations of the solicitors the union did not in fact have enough valid cards to constitute a majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The petition to review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-26\">. An additional employee was hired during the organizing campaign.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">. In fact the first group of cards had been obtained at a meeting at a tavern. The Trial Examiner found that \u201cAlthough some of the employees had drunk beer before the meeting opened, none of them drank any beer during the meeting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. At that time the rule of Aiello Farms, 110 N.L.R.B. 1395 (1954), barred the union from asserting a violation of \u00a7 8 (a) (5) if it subsequently petitioned for a representation election. The Aiello decision was reversed in Bernel Foam Products Co., 146 N.L.R.B. 1277 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">. NLRB v. Overnite Transportation Co., 308 F.2d 279 (4 Cir. 1962), is not to the contrary. The fact that the employer in that case sought to justify his refusal to recognize the union\u2019s card majority because of his prior experience with authorization cards at <em>other </em>locations affords a possible basis for distinction; moreover, the court found other evidence indicating that the employer credited the union\u2019s claim of majority support.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
