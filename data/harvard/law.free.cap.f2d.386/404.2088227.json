The Tax Court decided in the affirmative, Estate of Edna V. T. Peters, 46 T.C. 407 (1966), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Briefly stated, the facts are that the decedent inherited certain real property, known as the Mt. Olivet Road property, from her husband in 1942, at which time its fair market value was $33,650.00. Six years later, at a time when the value of the property had increased to over $64,000.00, she created a joint tenancy with her son, T. Graham Peters. From 1948 until her death in 1960, the decedent contributed $10,168.31 toward capital improvements on the property, while her son expended $16,485.19. The property was appraised in Mrs. Peters\u2019 estate at $95,000.00. The record established, and the Tax Court found, that the value of the improvements contributed by the son at the date of decedent\u2019s death was the cost to the son at the time of his contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">Applying, literally the terms of \u00a7 2040,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Tax Court held that the entire value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of the jointly owned property ($95,000.-00) was includable in the gross estate of the decedent, except the $16,485.19 contributed by her son. Rejected were two alternative contentions made by the estate, premised upon the purported application of the regulations promulgated under \u00a7 2040,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that only the actual cash contributed by the decedent and the surviving tenant in the form of capital expenditures on the property (excluding the value of the property by inheritance at the time of the creation of the joint tenancy) need be considered in apportioning their respective interests for estate tax purposes, or that the apportionment should be made of the basis of the \u201ccost of acquisition\u201d with decedent\u2019s cost including its fair market value at the date of her husband\u2019s death, thus eliminating the appreciation which occurred in the six years prior to the creation of the joint tenancy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Tax Court held that \u201c * * * the regulation in question was not written by respondent with this situation in mind and was not intended to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>does not apply to the problem before us. * * * To apply this sentence of the regulation [italicized portion footnote <em>2] </em>on the assumption that the decedent\u2019s cost was zero or that her \u2018cost of acquisition\u2019 was her basis (i. e., the fair market value of the property at the time of her husband\u2019s death) would require us to make a forced and unnatural construction of the sentence which would result in the circumvention of the obvious intendment of the statute and a contravention of the broad purposes stated in the first and fourth sentences of section 20.2040-1 (a) of the regulations.\u201d Id., p. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The obvious scheme of \u00a7 2040 is to recapture the entire value of jointly-held property into a decedent\u2019s gross estate, notwithstanding the fact that the decedent may have made a gift under local law of one-half of the property. Section 2040 looks to the source of the consideration represented by the property and disregards legal title. In a case like that before us, the value of property is includable in the decedent\u2019s gross estate to the extent that the decedent furnished the consideration for acquiring the property; to the extent that that present value was supplied by consideration in money or money\u2019s worth flowing from the other joint tenant, that value is excluded from decedent\u2019s estate. The Tax Court\u2019s determination literally meets the language of \u00a7 2040 that the entire value of the jointly-owned property at the date-of-death of the decedent ($95,000.00) should be included in her gross estate, except \u201c * * * such part * * * shown to have originally belonged to such other person and never to have been received or acquired by the latter from the decedent for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth * * In the case at bar, the excluded portion was $16,145.19, which the record showed was the cost as well as the present value of the son\u2019s contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">We agree with the Tax Court that the regulations do not require a contrary result. Implicit in the language of \u00a7 20.2040-1 (a) (2) is the concept that its application is to <em>purchased </em>property subsequently put into joint ownership, not to inherited property thereafter put into joint ownership and improved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The decedent\u2019s initial acquisition of the property in this case was by inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">It has been shown that the facts before us fit precisely into the scheme of \u00a7 2040 without reference to the regulations. The estate points out that \u00a7 20.-2040-1 (a) (1) of the regulations refers to property acquired by decedent <em>and the other joint owner or owners by gift, devise, bequest, or inheritance </em>and argues, therefore, that that section does not apply to this case. It follows, so the argument runs, that \u00a7 20.2040-1 (a) (2) which provides that \u201c[I]n all other cases,\u201d value is includable as therein provided, is applicable. To accept the estate\u2019s contention would be impliedly to hold that the treatment of value required by \u00a7 20.2040-l(a) (2) of the regulations conflicts with \u00a7 2040 of the Code, and that in this conflict the regulation prevails over the statute. This we could not do, even if we accepted the estate\u2019s reading of \u00a7 20.2040-1 (a) (2), for clearly in the event of conflict, the statutory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>vision would prevail. However, in our view this point is not dispositive of the case before us. We read the regulation as having no application to the instant case, and the decision of the Tax Court is in accord with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-12\">. \u201c\u00a7 2040.

Under the estate\u2019s first contention, the value includable in the gross estate would be $39,668.20. This figure is computed by adding decedent\u2019s and the son\u2019s <em>cash </em>contributions, determining the percentage of decedent\u2019s <em>cash </em>contribution to total <em>cash </em>contributions and applying the resulting percentage to the unquestioned value of $95,000.00 of the property at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">Under the estate\u2019s second contention, the value includable in the gross estate would be $69,723.35. This figure is computed by adding decedent\u2019s cost (the value of the property as included in her husband\u2019s estate and her <em>cash </em>contributions) and the son\u2019s cash contributions, determining the percentage of decedent\u2019s cost to total cost and applying that percentage as before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. If it is assumed that a decedent inherits property, converts it into joint ownership by gift, the joint owner expends any sum on the property .and the decedent none and then the decedent dies, under the first contention advanced by petitioner, no part of the value of the property is includable in decedent\u2019s estate, irrespective of how much the property appreciated in value over and above the other joint tenant\u2019s contribution to value. Under the alternate contention, the result in hypothetical cases is not as pronounced, but in any hypothetical case where the property has appreciated in value from the date of acquisition by decedent by inheritance and decedent has made little or no post-inheritance contribution while the other joint tenant has made contributions, such appreciation is heavily weighted to the contribution made by the other joint tenant and correspondingly excluded from decedent\u2019s estate. Undoubtedly, these were the considerations which caused the Tax Court to brand the estate\u2019s construction of the regulation as \u201cforced and unnatural,\u201d as quoted in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
