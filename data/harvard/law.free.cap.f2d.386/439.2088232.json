This contention is foreclosed by the authority of previous decisions in this and other circuits. Tillinghast v. Edmead, 31 F.2d 81 (1st Cir. 1929); United States ex rel. Ventura v. Shaughnessy, 219 F.2d 249 (2d Cir. 1955); Quilodran-Brau v. Holland, 232 F.2d 183 (3d Cir. 1956); Orlando v. Robinson, 262 F.2d 850 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 980, 79 S.Ct. 898, 3 L. Ed.2d 929 (1959); Wilson v. Carr, 41 F.2d 704 (9th Cir. 1930) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-28\">Petitioner, who was found capable of rehabilitation and therefore under New York law received an indeterminate sentence of up to three years, does not claim that that sentence did not meet the year or more requirement in Section 241(a) (4), but does point to what he claims to be the anomaly of holding de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>portable a boy who is found reformable, but not deportable an incorrigible who is sentenced to less than the one year maximum sentence for petit larceny. However, petitioner did serve more than one year under the indeterminate sentence and it is not for us to speculate as to what the sentence would have been if he had been regarded as incorrigible.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
