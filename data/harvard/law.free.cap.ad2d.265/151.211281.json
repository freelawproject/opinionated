Quality, </em>511 US 93, 98-99, 100-101). The State\u2019s argument that such a reason is provided by the fact that intrastate commuters are disproportionately burdened by other taxes that are not paid by interstate commuters, such as State sales tax, Metropolitan Transportation Authority sales tax and cigarette taxes, fails. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>There is no reliable evidence that such other taxes create a disparate burden. Even if there were a showing of disparate burden, there is no reliable evidence that the income tax the State would impose on interstate commuters approximates, but does not exceed, the amount of these other taxes. Moreover, even if there were a showing of the relative amounts of taxes paid by interstate and intrastate commuters dedicated to the City, the event on which the State would tax interstate commuters \u2014 travel into the City \u2014 is not substantially equivalent to the events on which these other taxes are based <em>(see, Austin v New Hampshire, </em>420 US 656, 665; <em>Fulton Corp. v Faulkner, </em>516 US 325, 332-333). We do not deem it necessary to grant injunctive relief against enforcement of the challenged statute. In the event of an affirmance by the Court of Appeals, responsible government officials will facilitate the process of returning improperly collected taxes and will otherwise expeditiously implement the mandate of that Court <em>(see, SoconyVacuum Oil Co. v City of New York, </em>247 App Div 163, 168, <em>affd </em>272 NY 668). We are also mindful that maintenance of the status quo pending the appeals process serves administrative convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">Concerning the City\u2019s challenge to the amendment, there is no merit to the argument that enactment of the amendment required a home rule message. While the amendment is concededly a \u201cspecial law\u201d within the meaning of the State Constitution\u2019s home rule provisions and certainly touches upon some of the City\u2019s most basic interests, it also concerns other matters of sufficient concern to the State generally to be proper subjects of State legislation <em>(see generally, Matter of Town of Islip v Cuomo, </em>64 NY2d 50, 56-57). Such authority as there is on the subject does not suggest that legislation enabling local taxation cannot be repealed without a home rule message <em>(cf, </em>NY Const, art IX, \u00a7 2 [b] [1]; <em>Matter of Roosevelt Raceway v County of Nassau, </em>18 NY2d 30, 36-37, <em>appeal dismissed </em>385 US 453). We have considered the parties\u2019 other arguments for affirmative relief, including that it was error not to award attorneys\u2019 fees against the State under either 42 USC \u00a7 1988 or Tax Law \u00a7 3030, and find them unpersuasive.
