Before Judge Mershon. Camden Superior Court. May Term, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">Morgan was placed on trial for tlie offense of burglary alleged to have been committed by breaking and entering the dwelling house of one Rose Taylor. The evidence showed that the house was rented by the husband of Rose Taylor, and occupied by him and his family. It was not shown from whom he rented, but there was no pretense that he held under her. She testified she did not own the house. The jury found him guilty. He moved for a new trial because the verdict was contrary to the evidence and the law, and because the court erred in charging the jury that if the proof showed that the house was in the occupancy of Rose Taylor and her family, in the judgment of the court, that would be a sufficient proof of ownership for this purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">The motion was overruled and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-9\">Ira E.

The true legal relation of husband and wife is in her mind reversed. Metaphorically speaking, she puts the petticoat in a more advanced position than the pantaloons. She states that she does not own the house, but she lives in it; that no one lives in it but her and her family, and that her family consists of her husband and children. From another witness we learn that the house is rented, and that the husband rented it. In legal contemplation it is the husband\u2019s house, and not, as it is charged to be in the indictment, the house of Rose Taylor, the wife. The charge of the court was erroneous, the conviction of the prisoner was unwarranted, and there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
