If, without fraud on the part of the creditor or his attorney, the property is found subject, it matters not whether she or her counsel assented to the finding or not. A judgment which would be conclusive upon her if rendered contrary to her wishes, is not the less so because rendered with her consent and as part of a compromise arrangement to end litigation, and settle disputed rights.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\">Injunction. Husband and wife. Judgment. Married women. Before Judge Hood. Randolph County. At Chambers. April 12, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-9\">Mrs. Lewis filed her bill against Gunn, alleging, in brief, as follows : She is the widow of John B. Lewis, who died in 1877. In 1872 she became possessed, by inheritance from her father, of 62 acres of land, being part of lots 146 and 147, in Randolph county; and under the will of a deceased uncle, she received lot No. 241, in Early county. All of this was her own separate estate, and her husband had no interest whatever in <em>it; </em>he always recognized it as hers, and she was in actual possession. Her husband owed Gunn a large debt. He informed her that he desired to secure this by a conveyance of <em>Ms </em>property, (not of hers), but that her written consent would be necessary to do so. Under his representations she signed a general consent to the conveyance made by him, in these terms: \u201cMy husband, J. B. Lewis, had my consent to make the conveyance of property he did to John McK. Gunn, of Cuthbert, Ga., on the 17th day of January, 1874.\u201d Dated February \u2014, 1874. In fact, however, he conveyed her said property to secure his debt, taking a bond from Gunn to reconvey on payment of the debt. Failing to pay, Gunn sued, obtained judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>made a deed and levied on the land under Code, \u00a71970. Complainant claimed. Her husband informed her that he could settle his debt on a satisfactory basis, and asked her to authorize an attorney to act for her; she declined; he assured her that her title should not, and could not, be molested, but simply that it would allow him to settle, and by using entreaties and finally threats of desertion, she was induced to sign a letter to her attorney authorizing a settletlement. The settlement actually made was to allow the lands to be found subject,,and sold to Gunn, that complainant should rent from him, and have until January 1st, 1879, to repay the purchase money; on failure to do so, she should be considered a tenant holding over. Of all this she knew nothing until her lands were advertised, and even then only knew of the advertisement, and she was induced to be quiet by the assurances of her husband that it was a mere formality, and her title was not imperiled. The compromise or settlement was carried into effect as above stated. Afterwards she sold a part of the land and depostited\u2019 the purchase money notes with Gunn as collateral security for the above stated debt of her husband. She fears a transfer of them by him. Since January 1st, 1879, she, failing to repay the purchase money, Gunn is seeking and threatening to rent out the land and dispossess her. If this should be done, she would be left penniless and homeless. The entire transaction was fraudulent and for the purpose of making her pay her husband\u2019s debts. Defendant had notice of her title (through the records of the ordinary\u2019s office), and he participated in the fraud. Discovery was waived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">The object of the bill was to set aside the transfers and deeds, re-establish the title in her, and enjoin defendant from dispossessing her or transferring the purchase money notes, to recover them, and to set aside the judgment in the claim case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">The answer denied knowledge of any fraud, etc., or notice of complainant\u2019s title. It alleged her apparent acquiesence; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and set up title to one of the lots (No. 241) by a sheriffs \u2022sale for taxes, although it was included in the general agreement made previously, to secure indebtedness of Lewis. Defendant claimed the right to possession of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Abf\">There were affidavits sustaining the bill and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">The court refused the injunction, and complainant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-7\">Bush <em>&amp; </em>Lyon; II.

But when property which she claims is levied upon as his, and she has her day in court, and it is \u25a0adjudged his, with or without her consent, under circum- . stances which would conclude any other suitor, why is she not concluded? Is her mental approbation or disapprobation of a judgment to regulate or vary its effect? Must she fight to the last in order to be beaten ? Can she concede nothing ? confess nothing ? Does the judgment of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of competent jurisdiction clasp a married woman with less force and hold her less persistently than it does a single woman ? It is the judgment, not her consent or non-com-sent to it, that closes the controversy. Whoever can gain a case can lose it, for there is, and must be, mutuality in the results of litigation. Any litigant who does not require a guardian <em>ad Utem </em>stands before the court as the equal of the ad-~ verse party, and a judgment fairly obtained which binds the one will bind the other. To this rule there is no exception in-favor of married women. The law of judgment, not the law of contract, rules the present case on the controlling, point. 60 <em>Ga., </em>189; 61 <em>lb., </em>512.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
