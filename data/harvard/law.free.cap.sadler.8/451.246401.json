His will, proved on the 14-th day of the same month, is made part of the petition.

Partition per <em>stirpes </em>was prayed. Partition was decreed accordingly; and the lands were divided into eight purparts by three persons nominated in the petition. All the parties refused to bid over or take at the valuation, and the several purparts were ordered to be sold.

That the <em>per stirpes </em>decree had been procured by the fraud of tir\u00f3se of the contestants who were interested in establishing the <em>per stirpes </em>interpretation of the will. In support of this it avers that they, well knowing that there was at least a question whether the partition should not be <em>per capita, </em>constituted themselves a \u2018\u2018committee of the heirs,\u201d procured powers of attorney, and releases from those who were interested adversely; never made known to them that such a question existed; and left many of them in utter ignorance of the fact that there was a will; and that it -was under these powers so obtained that this \u201ccommittee\u201d had instituted and conducted the partition proceedings ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\">4.

It prayed a review and correction of the proceedings and the decree and the suspension of the distributing of the proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-4\">The answer of Rev. Cyrus B. Hatch to the bill of review claims that all the parties agreed upon the mode of distribution \u201cset forth in original proceedings, and subsequent actions herein, and are hereby estopped from now objecting to the same;\u201d that there was no mistake in the agreement to the several proportions made in original proceedings; that as an heir and devisee he is entitled to one seventh; that the court had \u201cproperly and finally passed upon and decided upon the petition to amend.

J. Rankin, that the will had been contested in the common pleas and supreme courts by respondent, acting for his mother, then living, and other of the heirs; <em>ergo, </em>its provisions were well known to petitioners and all interested; that after the death of Robert Kingan, the life tenant, the question as to the distribution under the will of Samuel was \u201csomewhat discussed, and opinions of attorneys taken by some of the heirs; the weight of opinion being decidedly in favor of the distribution being <em>'per stirpesf\u2019 </em>that respondent believes no mistake of law was made in setting forth the interests of the heirs or devisees under the will, but that the devisees are correctly set forth as entitled to claim by classes; the two sisters living at testator\u2019s death being each entitled to one seventh, and the children and grandchildren of deceased brothers and sisters, by representation ; that great confusion and complication would result if said change should be allowed as to all past transactions; everything being based on the interests as stated in the petition, to which a copy of the will was attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The court filed the following opinion on the petition for an .amendment of the decree :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\">This case is not distinguishable in principle from Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 Pa. St. 304, 45 Am. Dec. 641. In the gift of the remainder of his estate to his \u201clegal heirs,\u201d testator had in view the statute of distributions, and consequently the <em>per stirpes </em>rule. 'See Osburn\u2019s Appeal, 31 Pittsb. L. J. 247.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">The expression \u201cshare and share alike\u201d is applicable as well \u2022to individuals as classes. Id.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">No case has been found in which, standing alone, it has been construed by the supreme court of this state to limit or modify the operation of the statute of distributions in respect of the proportions the next of kin should take; on the contrary, in Baskin\u2019s appeal, 3 Pa. St. 304, 45 Am. Dec. 641, and in Wood\u2019s Appeal, 18 Pa. 478, distribution <em>per stirpes </em>was made, notwithstanding this and stronger expressions were used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">Particular expressions must yield to the general intent manifested in the will. The first and main object of the testator was to provide for his brother during life, and after that the manifest purpose was that his legal heirs should share alike, in accordance with the statutes of distribution; and therefore <em>per stirpes. </em>This, as was said in Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 Pa. St. 304, 45 Am. Dec. 641, produces equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\">The opinion of the court upon the bill of review was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-9\">The questions raised by this bill of review were fully argued \u2022and considered upon the application to amend the petition for partition of the decedent\u2019s real estate; and while there is some doubt as to the proper construction of his will, the weight of authority seems to support the construction then given to it. The will gave a life estate to the testator\u2019s brother, and directed that .at his death the real estate should be divided among his legal heirs, share and share alike. Reference must be had to the intestate laws to ascertain the persons the testator intended as his beneficiaries. There they are classified, and the reasonable presumption is that the testator had this classification in view. Aurl as the words \u201cshare and share alike\u201d apply as well to classes .as to individuals, it seems he intended that each class should share equally, and the heirs would therefore take <em>per stirpes. </em>For these and other reasons given in the opinion heretofore filed, the bill for review must be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The assignments of error specified the action of the court: (1) In decreeing that the bill of review be dismissed; (2) in not reviewing and correcting the record and decree of partition, so that the same should direct partition to be made among the parties as follows: to Robert Kingan, Jane Boreland, Elizabeth Bentz, Mary K. Hautch, Amanda Hutchman, Wm. T. Kingan, J. K. Lemon, Janies II., Wm. L., Archibald M., Jno. L., Charles W. and Mary A. Alston, Mary Elder, Margaret R. Greaves, A. W. Kingan, Robt. J.

To James Brownlee, Sr., for life, with remainder to Mary Van-Horn and J ames Brownlee, Jr., one fortieth. To Hiram Rankin and Samuel J. Rankin, each, one eightieth; (3) in not reviewing and correcting the decree of partition, so that the same should provide for a <em>per capita </em>division of the real estate of which Samuel Kingan died seised, among his heirs and their representatives; (4) in awarding costs to J. K. Lemon, S. J. Rankin, Hiram Rankin, and Cyrus B. Hatch, upon dismissing the appellants\u2019 bill of review; and (5) in not giving appellants their costs upon their bill of review, at least against J. K. Lemon, S. J.

Macrum, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac_B\">The will of Samuel Kingan directs a <em>per capita </em>partition of his realty, and leaves the intestate law in force as to his personalty. His meaning is perfectly plain, and the rules of construction resorted to in doubtful cases have no application. We must impute to him a knowledge of the meaning of the words he used, and give effect to all the words according to their natural sense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-5\">The plain meaning of the words of the will, if lawful, must be enforced. \u201cIt is a rule of common sense, as well as law, not to attempt to construe that which needs no construction,\u201d Reek\u2019s Appeal, 18 Pa. 432; Bainbridge\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 482; Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa, 525.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">It is only where the will leaves the intention imperfectly expressed, or doubtful, that rules of construction are applicable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cThey are never allowed to defeat a plain intent expressed.

In the cases under the rule alluded to, there is no explicit direction, but a <em>per capita </em>distribution is produced by mere implication.
