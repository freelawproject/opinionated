Ames. They filed separate accounts. To the account of Arthamer the other heirs filed exceptions, because he had failed to charge himself with $1,200 alleged to have been borrowed from decedent, or money in accountant\u2019s hands belonging to decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-12\">The account was referred to an auditor, M. C. Acheson, Esq.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-13\">It appeared in evidence that Arthamer received the money from his father on April 2, 1884, eight days before the latter\u2019s death; after the 4th or otk day of April he was incapable of attending to business. The evidence consisted of declarations and statements of the parties prior and subsequently to this interview and an entry in a book of account, alleged to have been made by Arthamer. Appellants claimed that this book belonged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>to decedent, while the auditor finds the evidence slight that it belonged to Dem\u00e1s, his son. The book was as follows: \u201cMarch, 1884, account of money;\u201d then followed entries of several payments made by decedent and the entry, \u201cApril 2. Let Arthamer have by note, $1,200.\u201d</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Note. \u2014 For tbe conelusiveness of the findings of an auditor, see note to Warner\u2019s Appeal, 1 Sad. Rep. 310.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>It was claimed by appellants that accountant, being in need \u2022of money to pay for a farm, called on his father; and several witnesses testified to statements made by Arthamer admitting his obligation to repay his father, and that he had intended to .give him a note therefor; and Dem\u00e1s testified that Arthamer attempted to influence him to destroy the above-mentioned entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\">By accountant it was claimed that the father voluntarily gave the money, refused to accept the note, and stated to witnesses that he intended to help Arthamer, having before helped the other children; that the evidence of contrary admissions was not clear, or credible, and the gift was reasonable, considering the value of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-6\">The will provided certain life estates and remainders, <em>inter alia, </em>to the children of Arthamer; and the auditor admitted a daughter of accountant to testify in his behalf concerning matters happening before the death of John Ames.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-7\">The auditor found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">\u201cThe conclusion of the auditor drawn from the evidence is that John Ames had arranged with his son Arthamer to give him $1,200 to make a payment on his farm; that Arthamer was i\u00bb give a note or obligation binding himself to pay the interest \u2022on $1,200 to his father as long as the latter lived, and that Arthamer was not required and did not obligate himself to repay any part of the principal. As already stated, this is the auditor\u2019s inference drawn from the evidence, having in mind the fact that the accountant has stated his account under oath and that the \"\u00a1burden of proof is upon the exceptants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-9\">\u201cThe auditor, therefore, overrules the exceptions to the ac\u2022count of Arthamer Ames. If he is in error, the court on appeal will do justice to exceptants, \u2014 the finding of the auditor being an inference drawn from facts proved, and not being entitled to the same weight as if the facts had been directly found.\u201d Hind-man\u2019s Appeal, 85 Pa. 470.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-10\">To which the appellants excepted because the auditor had not \u25a0\u2022surcharged accountant with the $1,200 and because he admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>a daughter of accountant to testify in his behalf concerning matters happening before the death of John Ames.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">The court, Hart, J., dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report, filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">\u201cThe question of fact for the auditor\u2019s decision in this case was whether the $1,200 which the accountant, Arthamer Ames, received from his father, on the second of April, 1884, was intended as a gift or a loan. The testimony on the subject is something conflicting and contradictory. Judging from the mere reading of the depositions, it would not seem that the accountant, on whom rested the burden of proof from the start, has made out his case as clearly as could have been desirable. But, keeping in mind that the findings of fact by an auditor, like the verdict of a jury, are not to be set aside, except for clear and plain mistake, and that the auditor in this case had the advantage of seeing the witnesses, and noting their manner and deportment on the witness stand (and, so, of judging of their relative intelligence, candor, and credibility), I am not prepared to say that he has fallen into such flagrant error as to justify the court in reversing his decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201cThe position assumed by counsel for exceptants, that the reservation of interest to be paid to the father during his life, if there was such a reservation, took from the transaction the character of a gift, and converted it into a loan, whatever may have been the intention of the father, is not tenable. A condition of that kind may be attached to a gift, as well as to a sale or a loan. Riegel v. Wooley, 81* Pa. 227.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">\u201cI think the auditor was right in ruling that Annie Ames was a competent witness, on the ground that she was called to tqstify against her interest The fact of her being a daughter of the accountant, Arthamer Ames, went to her credibility, but did not affect her legal competency.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">From this decree appellants took this appeal, assigning as error that the court erred in not surcharging accountant</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-9\"><em>Irwin &amp; Hughes </em>and <em>McCrachen &amp; Stevenson, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AClB\">\u2014The evidence was insufficient to prove a gift; and the declarations of accountant show that the transaction was a loan, for which he intended to give his note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-10\">The money having been obtained by Arthamer, under am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>arrangement by which he was to give his father a note for it, the legal effect is the same as if a note was given and the law holds it to be a loan, and not a gift</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-4\">If a son asks his father to lend him a sum of money, and the father does so, without saying more, or anything about the repayment of jh, or taking a security of any kind for its repayment, it becomes a debt upon loan, and not an advancement; and the law in such case, it being a debt, implies a promise to repay immediately. Levering v. Rittenhouse, 4 Whart 140, 141.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">Where a son receives money from his father to enable him to embark in business, and gives his note for the amount at the time, the transaction cannot be charged from a loan to a gift, or advancement, by the loose declarations of the father that he \u2018gave\u2019 the money to the son. The idea of a gift or advancement is repelled where an obligation for the payment of the amount is taken at the time the money is received by the child from the parent. Roland v. Schrack, 29 Pa. 125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">The authorities are clear and explicit that this state of facts rebuts the idea of a gift. Levering v.

Dec. 555.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">The use of the money by Arthamer was to be paid for, and his father was to receive interest, which necessarily implies that the title to the principal was to remain in him until his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">No gift can be made by words <em>in futuro. </em>Fink v.
