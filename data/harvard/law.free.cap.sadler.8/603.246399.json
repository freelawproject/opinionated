He, along with others in this gang, was engaged under the boss, J ames McLaughlin, in repairing the track a short distance west of Pott\u2019s station, a small station at which few trains stop. McLaughlin told them to get off the tracks. This was done by some properly getting clear of all the tracks into the ditch on the side of the road. Shea did not, but merely stepped from the east-bound track to the west-bound track. A train passed them on the former track. In a few minutes another came along on the west-bound track running on its schedule time, of which McLaughlin had notice. Several of the gang saw it approaching and got out of its way. Shea, although called to look out by several, did not, and was struck and killed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-5\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit, whereupon the plaintiffs moved to take off the nonsuit and to strike off the' amendment.
