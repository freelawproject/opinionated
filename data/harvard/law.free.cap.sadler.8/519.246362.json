Bean, trading as McKinnie &amp; Bean and proprietors of the Anderson hotel in the city of Pittsburgh, to recover damages for injuries caused by an accident on the elevator of the hotel. The hotel was leased by the defendants from Joseph N. Anderson. They took possession in June, 1885, before which time the elevator had been placed in the building. The elevator was built for freight, but the plaintiff, a scrubbing girl, was required to use it when going from floor to floor, except when she was off work or dressed in clean clothes. The elevator as originally constructed was a simple movable platform without guards or inclosure and with vacant spaces between it and the walls and openings of the wall. Subsequently iron guards were placed on two sides and a gate on the third side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">The plaintiff testified that at the time of the accident \u201cthe elevator turned to one side; and when it did it took the big trunk in the center of the elevator, and the trunk fell over and held me there. I pulled the trunk over when I fell, to catch myself. . . . The elevator turned to one side, lopsided, and just as I got in the door, there was the trunk in the center of the elevator; and when I seen the elevator turn to one side I grabbed at the trunk to save myself and my foot caught out between this wire and this gate that was on the elevator. I guess the gate was about 4 feet high. It did not come down to the platform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>of the elevator; there was about % foot that it did not come level.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\">Speaking of the gate she said: \u201cThere was some kind of a gate around it, it kept us from catching our clothes on the side of wire. The portion that was closed was open through the wires \u2014 the openings were not very big \u2014 they were not big enough to get my foot through except underneath.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">\u201cI was standing at the time, there were no seats provided in the elevator. The jar threw me off my feet; the elevator when it turned over threw me off my feet and I grabbed the trunk to save myself and the trunk held me there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">\u201cI fell over against the wire gate; I had hold of the trunk all the time; I caught it to catch myself; I fell down beside the trunk; I fell flat on the floor; the moment that the elevator jarred to the side I went down immediately.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\">\u201cSometimes the elevator worked smoothly; some other times it would not \u2014 it turned to one side and joggled hack and forward; sometimes it pulled the rope and stopped a little while, and then it would get to going again.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-8\">\u201cIt used always to turn lopsided; sometimes it would turn from one side to another.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-9\"><em>Q. </em>Just describe what the motion was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-10\"><em>A. </em>When the man would pull the rope it would go a little while till it would stop again; and it might fall down at the same time when we wanted to go up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-11\"><em>Q. </em>This lopsided motion \u2014 what do you mean by that <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-12\"><em>A. </em>It would catch at one side of the walls and the other side would turn like.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s foot was so badly injured that amputation'was necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-14\">Tw'O other accidents had previously happened upon the ele-' vator, and the testimony of other witnesses showed that it \u201ctilted\u201d and \u201cjarred,\u201d and at times had fallen eight or ten feet when the rope had been pulled too far in starting. The guards did not reach the floor and there was space enough for a foot to pass under them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-15\">The defendants presented, <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-16\">9. That if the defendants leased the property from Mr. 'Anderson with the elevator in it, and the elevator was put up by a contractor of competent skill, and was in itself reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>safe or without a defect that was so plain that the defendants should have known of it, they are not responsible \u2014 they are not responsible for any defect in the original construction of the machinery; and if the accident occurred by reason of any such defect they would not be responsible and the verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-4\"><em>Ans. </em>Refused. First assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">8.

Second assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">12.
