You both agree that a contract was made, and the only question is certainly what that contract included. Now that is a matter of positive proof, and upon that matter both sides have been heard; and the jury must determine. I think this would only lead us astray.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-12\">Evidence excluded, and at defendant\u2019s request exception allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-13\">The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff, on which judgment was entered; and defendant took this writ, assigning for error the ruling of the court in rejecting the above offer of proof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Tilias Eollinger, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtA\">We are all well aware-that the plaintiff\u2019s case in the court below rested on a contract-; upon that fact there never was any dispute; but when we come-to the question, What was the contract? the evidence was not so harmonious. If the plaintiff testifies to the truth, $511 was-to be the price; if the defendant tells the truth, it was to be-considerably less than $400. How was the jury to know whose-st-atement was correct ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-4\">It seems to us on the part of the plaintiff in error that when, the witness Badabaugh was called and ruled out, this case certainly was in a situation in which it was desirable either to-corroborate the leading witness on the one hand, or to impeach the leading witness on the other; otherwise, the finding of the-jury would be to a great extent guesswork. \u201cAny evidence which tends to impeach the credibility of a witness is relevant.\u201d' Magellan v. Thompson, 9 Watts &amp; S. 54; Albert v. Northern. C. B. Co. 98 Pa. 316.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">\u201cThere is no rule of law,\u201d says Justice Bo&amp;ers, \u201cwhich has-come under my observation, which prevents a party from giving additional confirmatory, cumulative, and corroborative evidence of facts previously proved, or which tends to strengthen,, add force or probability to, such evidence.\u201d Myre v. Ludwig,. 1 Pa. St. 47.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">In an action of assumpsit, where the evidence is doubtful, almost anything which may probably throw light on the matter-is usually, and in general, properly admitted. Parker v. Donaldson, 6 Watts &amp; S. 133.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-7\"><em>Weiss &amp; Gilbert </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-8\">Pee Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The plaintiff in error, defendant- below, admits that the work-sued for was done under a contract by which its price was definitely fixed. It was, therefore, to no purpose to prove for what price others would have done the work; hence, the offer-covered by the assignment of error was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
