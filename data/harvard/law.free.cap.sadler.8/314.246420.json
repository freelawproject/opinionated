W. Hill, a farm in Allegheny township, Armstrong county, containing 174 acres, and to his son, Winchester Hill, a farm of about 200 acres, being the old homestead. The remainder, about 100 acres, was devised to his oldest daughter if she desired it, if not, the next oldest, \u2014 until all his children should have an opportunity of refusal, unless taken before descending through all of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-11\">\u201cThese several tracts of land were t\u00f3 be appraised by six men chosen by his children, and the devisees were to take them at the appraisement. The one-third part of the appraised value of the land, under said will, was set apart; and the interest thereon entirely at the disposal of his wife, Hannah Hill, during her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>life, and payment of the same to be made in such manner as she desired at her death. The remaining two thirds was bequeathed to all of decedent\u2019s children equally. Under said will, also, the widow was entitled to a sufficient quantity of the several kinds \u2022of fruit growing on the two plantations, horse and buggy, pasture and feed to be furnished to her from the products of the decedent\u2019s two plantations free of charge. The petitioner elected to take under said will. The children of decedent failing to agree as to appraisers, the orphans\u2019 court June 4, 1877, appointed the sheriff of Armstrong county and six appraisers to .appraise said real estate under said will.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Note. \u2014 It will be noticed the execution ordered by tbe orphans\u2019 court in this ease was not under the provisions of the act of February 23, 1853, relating to the disencumbering of a testator\u2019s real estate, where legacies or annuities are charged thereon, by the setting aside of sufficient personal property to meet the annuities and charges.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cThe farm devised to Winchester Hill was appraised at $9,069 and designated as allotment No. 1; that devised to Jno. W. Hill appraised at $5,730.60, and designated as allotment No. <em>2; </em>the remaining tract of about 100 acres appraised at $3,-972.42, and designated as allotment No. 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">\u201cThe said appraisements being approved by the orphans\u2019 \u2022court and rule to accept or refuse having been served on the heirs, Jno. W. Hill, December 3, 1877, appeared and accepted .allotment No. 2 at the appraisement, and October 6, 1881, the said court decreed that the said John W. Hill should presently pay the other heirs their proportional parts of two thirds of the appraised value of said allotment, to wit, the sum of $3,820.43, with interest thereon from December 3, 1877. The remainder, to wit, $1,910.22, to be and remain charged upon said purpart, .and legal interest thereon from December 3, 1877, to be annually paid by said Jno. W. Hill, his heirs and assigns, to said Hannah Hill, during her natural life (but all arrearages of said interest to be paid on or prior to October 10, 1881), to be recovered by said Hannah Hill by distress, etc., and upon her death the said principal sum of $1,910.22 to be paid by said Jno. W. Hill, his heirs and assigns, holding said premises to the persons then thereunto legally entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">\u201cJno. W. Hill having failed to comply with said order, the orphans\u2019 court, March 1, 1883, awarded a fi. fa., and the sheriff -of Armstrong county levied upon allotment No. 2, and sold the same at public sale, June 2, 1883, to John Gilpin, Esq., for $4,501, and John Gilpin and wife, June 7, 1883, conveyed the same to Simon Truby, who died on May 19, 1886, seised of said premises, leaving a widow and eight children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">\u201cSince the sheriff\u2019s sale the widow, Hannah Hill, has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>furnished from allotment No. 2 pasture, feed, fruit, etc.; neither has the said Simon Truby, or his heirs, paid to her the interest on the one third -of the appraised value of said allotment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\">\u201cThe petitioner prays that the annual pecuniary value of said pasture, etc., charged upon allotment No. 2 be ascertained, and that a fi. fa be awarded to collect the same, and also to collect: the- interest on one third of the appraised value of said allotment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">February 8, 1887, the court awarded a citation on the widow and heirs of Simon Truby, deceased, to. show cause why the-prayer of the petitioner should not be granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">The respondents demurred to the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">After argument, the following opinion and decree were rendered by the court below, Mehard, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-8\">\u201cIf the main question raised by the pleadings in this case-had not been discussed by the-learned auditor appointed to distribute the fund arising in the estate of Jacob Hill, deceased,, out of the land which this controversy concerns, and had it not been disposed of by the court on exceptions filed to the auditor\u2019s-report on behalf of the respondents and others, the able arguments of respondents\u2019 counsel would call for a full examination in this opinion. But in view of what has there been said and decided, a few words only are necessary here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-9\">\u201cJohn W. Hill\u2019s allotment of his father\u2019s real estate, which respondents\u2019 ancestor bought, was not sold under act of April1 18, 1853, Purdon\u2019s Digest, 1457. The provisions of that act do not, therefore, apply to the fund created by the sale. The lien of the fund charged on Jno. W. Hill\u2019s land by the will of his father, for the support (or annuity) of petitioner, was paramount to the title of John W. Hill; hence, petitioner need not and cannot.resort to this fund by virtue of act of February 24, 1834) McCredy\u2019s Appeal, 47 Pa. 442.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-10\">\u201cBy the decree of this court, under which this land was sold, that fund was to be and remain a charge on the land during the-natural life of Hannah Hill. It would, therefore, not be divested by the sale. Solliday v. Gruver, 7 Pa. 452.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-11\">\u201cThis case cannot be distinguished from Cowden\u2019s Estate, 1 Pa. St. 267, 284; Steele\u2019s Appeal, 47 Pa. 437; Wertz\u2019s Appeal,. 65 Pa. 306, and kindred cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201cThat petitioner has chosen the proper forum is sufficiently \u25a0shown by Mohler\u2019s Appeal, 8 Pa. 26; Gibson\u2019s Appeal, 25 Pa. 191.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">On July 2, 1887, a decree was made \u201cthat the proportionate part of the charge set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 bill, to be paid by purpart or allotment No. 2 of Jacob Hill\u2019s estate, is of the annual money value of $25, and therefore that amount owing plaintiff, on that account, by the heirs of Simon Truby, deceased, as named in the bill, due June 2, 1887, is $100; and that the amount due and owing to the plaintiff by said heirs of Simon Truby, deceased, on account of the interest accruing annually and payable to Hannah Hill, plaintiff, on the 3d day of December of each year on the one third of the appraised value of purpart No. 2 of Jacob Hill\u2019s estate charged thereon (to wit, $1,-910.22), is $469.20, which sum is made up of the payments ordered heretofore <em>(i. e., </em>by decree October 6, 1881) to be made annually, commencing April 1, 1883, and including that due December 3, 1886, -with interest on each payment from the date it fell due; and that the said heirs of Simon Truby, deceased, pay the said sums, in all $569.20, together with the costs of this proceeding, or a ii. fa. shall issue after twenty-one days from this date, for the levying of the same from said purpart No. 2 of Jacob Hill\u2019s estate, as described in plaintiff\u2019s bill; and should a sale of said purpart be made in pursuance of this decree, it shall be made subject to the charges of which the sum herein decreed to be paid is the annual value now in arrears.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">Thereupon, the respondents took their appeal by certiorari, specifying the following assignments of error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">1. The court erred in holding and deciding that the one third of the appraisement ($1,910.22) of allotment No. 2 (the interest of which was payable to the widow) was not divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">2.

Whitworth, W. D. Patton, </em>and <em>James 8. Whitworth, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abv\">The main question in this case is whether the one third of the appraisement of allotment No. 2, accepted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Jno. W. Hill (the interest of which was payable to the widow), was divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-4\">The general rule is that legacies charged on real estate, like other liens, are divested by judicial sales, and for the evident reason that \u201cpolicy requires that the title should be in the hands of the purchaser at judicial sales as unfettered and untrammeled as possible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-5\">But a legacy, or other encumbrance, to be divested, must be \u201cdefinite in its amount, certain in its application or capable of being made so.\u201d <em>Be </em>McKenzey, 3 Pa St. 160.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\">It has been held that \u201ca judicial sale of land divests it of the lien of a legacy payable in annual instalments, not due and payable at the time of the sale.\u201d Lobaeh\u2019s case, 6 Watts, 167. See also M\u2019Lanahan v. Wyant, 1 Penr. &amp; W.-96, 21 Am. Dee. 363, and Heed v. Beed, 1 Watts. &amp; S. 235.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-7\">Under the will of Jacob Hill, the widow evidently takes more than a mere interest for life. A reasonable construction of the will gives her the interest and principal for life, with power to dispose of the same absolutely at her death; and this interpretation is sustained by the fact, also, that the testator disposes of only the remaining two thirds to his children. The interest and principal are one and inseparable, and this bequest is the same as though the widow had been bequeathed a sum certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\">It was held in Parker\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 478, that \u201ca bequest of a sum \u2018the interest of which is to be paid to her during life and the principal to her children at her death\u2019 is a direct bequest of the principal for life, and the legatee is entitled to receive it on securing interest of those in remainder according to 49th section of the act of February 24, 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-9\">And so it has been repeatedly held that a bequest of interest for life is a bequest of the principal for life. 45 Pa 365; 4 Watts, 130.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-10\">It is evident that, under this will, Hannah Hill takes an amount certain and known at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, and, under the authorities, the fund set apart <em>(i. e., </em>one third of appraised value) would be divested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-11\">But cases similar to this have been decided by this court Heilman v. Heilman, 4 Bawle, 440; Christman v. Christ, 4 Pennyp. 291.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-12\">The fund being divested, it should have been paid to the widow out of the proceeds of sale upon her giving security in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>orphans\u2019 court to secure the interest of the persons entitled in remainder. Act February <em>24, </em>1834, \u00a7 49; Parker\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 478.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-4\">It is not easily seen how the cases cited by the learned court below are altogether applicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\">McOredy\u2019s Appeal, 47 Pa. 442, was where the devisee took the land on condition that he pay certain legacies. So was Solliday v. Gruver, 7 Pa. 452, and Cowden\u2019s Estate, 1 Pa. St. 267.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\">In these cases the testator expressly provides that the devisee takes the land subject to the interests of the legatee; and the legacies were not divested because the interests of the legatees were paramount to those of the devisees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">Such is not the case here. The widow receives a bequest of so much money. The desire of the testator, above everything else, seems to have been that his estate should descend to those of his own blood, and, if possible, those of his name. This was the paramount intention \u2014 everything else was subordinate. The rights of John W. Hill were paramount to those of the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-8\">In Steele\u2019s Appeal, 47 Pa. 437, cited by the learned court below, the widow was to receive a sufficient maintenance during her life. This, of course, would not be divested, the value thereof being unknown at the time of the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-9\">The remaining ease, Wertz\u2019s Appeal, 65 Pa. 306, was a case of intestacy. The widow would take an estate in the land under the intestate laws. An estate is never divested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-10\">There is yet another question. Granting that this fund was not divested, we think that the court erred in decreeing that the heirs of Simon Truby pay the petitioner the interest, etc., accruing prior to his death, it being a debt of the estate, and, as such, should be paid by the executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-11\">The act of February 24, 1834 (Purdon\u2019s Digest, p. 421), provides that \u201call debts owing by any person within this state, at the time of his decease, shall be paid by his executors or administrators so far as they have assets.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-12\">The personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of all debts, including liens on real estate.

Blackmore, 74 Pa. 418; Butz v. Butz, .2 Pennyp. 270.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-4\">Applying this doctrine of construction to the will under consideration, we gather the general intention of the testator with reference to this part of the provision he desired to make for his wife, \u2014 and that is, that she was to have absolute power and control only of the interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">If this court should hold that the power of appointment does refer to the corpus, even that would not render it susceptible of being divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale. While the direction for investment saves it from vesting absolutely in the widow, .it also preserves it for the remaindermen. Silknitter\u2019s Appeal, 45 Pa. -365, 84 Am. Dec. 494.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">That only arrearages of the interest or annuity would be divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale, we cite: Bauman\u2019s Appeal, 8 Pa. 475; Mohler\u2019s Appeal, 5 Pa. 418, 47 Am.
