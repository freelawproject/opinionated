Iams and Matthew Garner, executors of the last will and testament of John Huffman, deceased, who was the father of the plaintiff, the amount of three notes. . . . The plaintiff claims that the first note, of October 10, 1878, for $500, was given to him by his father at the date of the note, for the purpose of equalizing the distribution of his property to his children, which he was then contemplating or had been trying to make for some time prior to his death. ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims that the note of April 3, 1879, for $444.96 was given to him by his father for services, or rather for extra services which the plaintiff claims to have rendered his father while he, the plaintiff, was serving as assignee of his father for the benefit of creditors. , . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-10\">\u201cThe consideration of the note of November 29, 1881, the plaintiff claims originated during the time he was acting as one of the assignees of his father. He claims-that James Huffman, the brother of John Huffman, deceased, . . . held a note against his father for over $500; . . . and that he ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>vanced from his own means the sum of $400 . . . and that he afterwards took his father\u2019s note for that $400 and that that is the consideration of the note of November 29, 1881; and for the amount of these notes he claims a verdict at your hands now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">\u201c[The defendants, while not denying by the evidence that John Huffman signed each of these notes, resist or deny a recovery by the plaintiff upon /all of them or upon any of them. The defendants claim that the evidence shows that, on the 23d of March, 1877, John Huffman (becoming involved) was compelled to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and that on that day, by deed of assignment, he appointed James Huffman, the plaintiff, and William P. Peese as his assignees. And it is claimed by the defendants that while the proceedings under this assignment were still pending, each and all of these notes were given by the assignor, John Huffman, to James Huffman, his son and one of the assignees. It is claimed by the defendants that that made James Huffman occupy at that time not only the position of son, but also the position of trustee for his father; and that that being true and there being no dispute about the notes having been taken during the pendency of the proceedings under the assignment \u2014 the defendant occupying the position of son and trustee toward the maker of the notes, \u2014 it is necessary for the plaintiff, before he can recover a verdict at your hands for all or any of these notes, to satisfy the jury from the evidence that the notes were fairly obtained. It is claimed by the defendants that the notes were not fairly obtained by the plaintiff, James Huffman, from his father and assignor, John Huffman. It is claimed that it is the duty of the plaintiff to satisfy the jury by evidence that they were so fairly obtained; and they claim that there is no sufficient evidence offered by the plaintiff to the jury from Avhich they can find that the first two notes \u2014 that of October 10, 1878, calling for $500, and that of April 3, 1879, calling for $444.96 \u2014 it is claimed by the defendants that there is no evidence, or no sufficient evidence, offered by the plaintiff to the jury from which they could find that cither of those notes had been fairly obtained by the plaintiff. Under the view we take of the law as applied to the evidence in this case we agree with the defendants\u2019 counsel that far, and we instruct you that there is no evidence from which you can find for the plaintiff upon either of those notes, and you will direct your attention to the note of November 29, 1881.] [5] As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>we have stated, it is claimed by the plaintiff that that note was .given to him for a balance which he had paid to his uncle, James Huffman, on a judgment which he held against his father, John Huffman, who was also his assignor. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-4\">\u201cOn the part of the defendants it is claimed that the testimony shows that John Huffman, the father of the plaintiff, was bail for the plaintiff to Abner Tharp on a judgment for $900 \u25a0or $1,000; that the testimony is that John Huffman had to pay that note or judgment; that after the date of this note of November 29, 1881, John Huffman and his son James, the plaintiff \u2022in this suit, had a conversation in which John Huffman was asking him about the Tharp judgment which he had been compelled to pay for him, and that in that conversation James Huffman, the plaintiff here, stated for the father not to give, himself any trouble about that; that he, his father, had paid it for him, and that he would pay it when he obtained the money, or when he became able, or something to that effect; and it is claimed by the defendants that this testimony goes to show that the note of November 29, 1881, was not fairly obtained from John Huffman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">\u201cIf yon should find from the evidence that that note was fairly obtained by the plaintiff in the way he claims to have obtained it, then he would be entitled to a verdict at your hands for the amount of the note with its interest from its date down to the present time. If, on the other hand, you should find that it was not fairly obtained as claimed by the plaintiff, then he would not have a right to recover and your verdict should be for the defendants. [But whatever your verdict may be as to the note of November 29, 1881, the plaintiff would not have a right to recover on the other two notes; and as to them your verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">The jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $543.33, being the amount of the $400 note of November 29, 1881, with interest, and judgment having been entered thereon plaintiff took this writ, specifying the following assignments of error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">1.

Are notes given by a <em>cestui que trust </em>to his trustee, during the existence of the trust relation, to be treated as constructive frauds, and the burden of proof cast upon the trustee that the notes were fairly obtained, that the trustee, in obtaining them, made no improper use of the confidence reposed in him, and that his <em>cestui que trust </em>was fully informed when he gave the notes of all the facts necessary to enable him to act intelligently ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-10\">2. Was there sufficient evidence adduced upon the trial of the case to warrant the court in submitting to the jury whether the state of facts required by the foregoing rule of law existed at the time either of the notes in controversy was given ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-11\">3. Was the evidence contained in plaintiff\u2019s offers, and rejected by the court, sufficient within itself, or in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>with the evidence admitted upon trial, to establish the facts required by the foregoing rule of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">That all the facts contained in our first proposition must be affirmatively proved by the trustee before he can recover against his <em>cestui que trust </em>upon notes given during the existence of the trust relation is so abundantly established by the authorities, both English and American, as to render reference to them almost useless.

Jr. 277.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">Even though the trust relation had not existed between James Huffman and his father, at the times the notes in suit were given, the relation of son and father, taken with the fact that I he father was a very aged man, and the son in the prime of life, would have been sufficient to cast the burden of proof as to the fairness of the transaction upon the son. See Bispham, Eq. 296.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">In view of the authorities cited, we submit that the first question must be answered in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-8\">We confidently assert that the second question must be answered in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-9\">The facts developed by the admitted evidence amounted to much more than mere proof that the signatures were genuine, and were sufficient to carry the excluded notes to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-10\">We confidently claim that the third question must also be determined in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-11\">Now, we submit that if the plaintiff had succeeded in establishing the state of facts set forth in the first offer, he would have fallen far short of showing a consideration for the note for $444.96; that it was fairly obtained from John Huffman; that in obtaining it James Huffman, the plaintiff, had made no improper use of the confidence reposed in him by his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-12\">The second offer and purpose are both insufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover upon the note referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-13\">The third offer of evidence on the part of the plaintiff was clearly not admissible, because it consisted of the declarations of the plaintiff, not made in the presence of John Huffman or afterwards communicated to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The fourth and. last offer of evidence on the part of the plaintiff does not tend to establish its alleged purpose. The fact that John Huffman .during his lifetime was possessed of a large estate in lands and other property \u2014 that from time tc time he made gifts and advancements of lands, stock, and money, and paid debts \u2014 could not and does not show what the consideration for the $500 note was.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-4\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">This case is ruled by Darlington\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 518, 27 Am. Pep. 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">' There was undoubtedly such a confidential relation between James Huffman and his father, John Huffman, not only as \u25a0father and son, but as one of the assignees of his father, as threw upon him the burden of proof of showing the consideration of the notes in question; and the court was right in so instructing the jury. Nor ean we see in the offers of evidence .anything which tended to show such consideration; hence, the court did well in rejecting them. It follows that the third point of the defendants was properly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
