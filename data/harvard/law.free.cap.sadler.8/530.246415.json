E. Mills, who testified as follows:'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-8\">I knew Emily Wolff. She is dead.

It is admitted that she'is one of the children of Charles Erederiek Wolff, deceased, and that she has been dead for over twenty years. Defendant\u2019s counsel objects to the offer for the reason that the attesting witness was at the time of the execution of these notes an interested party, and the attesting witness being now dead would, if living, be an interested party, and would be an incompetent witness upon tbe trial of this case, and that the notes therefore cannot be proved by proving her handwriting.

The question therefore is, Was there sufficient evidence to admit the notes in evidence?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-19\">The notes were signed by marks. There was no evidence as to the execution of the notes, and no sufficient testimony of any acknowledgment by Mackrell. The testimony of the witness, Pilgrim, was all there was that could possibly justify admitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the notes in evidence. He could not, and did not, identify the notes. Some of his testimony might be corroborative of an indebtedness, but that amounts to nothing without an identification of the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\">Motion to take off nonsuit refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">Plaintiffs thereupon took this writ, assigning for error the action of the court: (1) In sustaining defendant\u2019s objections to the offers of the notes; and (2) in granting the motion for a compulsory nonsuit and refusing the motion to take off the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-6\"><em>8. A. </em>McOlung, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adz\">The notes in suit, it was pi\u2019oven, were in existence as early as 1862, for the party whose handwriting they are in died in that year. They purported to be the notes of James Mackrell to Mrs. Wolff and the Wolff heirs. The second note was payable to Mrs. Wolff during her lifetime. It is shown clearly that in the year 1866 Mrs. WTlff went to James Mackrell with two notes of his; the witness says that there were two of them and Mr. Mackrell called them notes; acknowledged that they were his; said that they were all right and gave reasons why he would not pay them. It is true that the jury might not have found that these were the notes admitted by Mackrell to be his notes, but we submit that there was much more than a scintilla of evidence of their identity. J ames Mackrell undoubtedly had money belonging to plaintiffs; it was secured by notes which had the general appearance of those sued on; wTere signed by a cross. All these things accord with the assertion of plaintiffs, that the notes examined and admitted by Mackrell were the notes in suit, whose existence dates back, as was shown, several years prior to 1866, and which, so far as appears, are the only papers that ever existed to which Mackrell\u2019s admission could apply.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-7\">J. <em>JErastus McKelvy, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_O\">It will be perceived that these notes are very peculiar instruments. They were not due at tire time of this alleged visit of Pilgrim\u2019s. They were not in Mackrell\u2019s handwriting, and were executed by a mark. There is nothing in the notes themselves to distinguish them or in any way to connect them with the party charged; and the rule in such case requires stricter proof showing connection and identification of the party charged with the mark.
