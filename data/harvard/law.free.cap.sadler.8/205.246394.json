E. Robbins, Esq., auditor, before whom the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-9\">Letters of administration upon the estate of A. A. Johnston, deceased, were granted to his widow, Caroline Johnston, April 16, 1885, her bond for $200,000 being signed by all the heirs who were of age, and S. H. Baker and Reuben Baker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">S. H. Baker testified that the bond was filed in violation of an agreement that other sureties were to sign it; and that he and his brother were unwilling to remain on the bond if the settlement of the estate should be given to the Barclay Brothers, who had refused to sign as sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-11\">The Messrs. Baker notified the administratrix that they would apply to be released from the bond, but consented to remain if a power of attorney should be given them to settle the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-12\">April 24, 1885, a power of attorney from the administratrix to S. II. Baker and Reuben Baker, empowering them to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>sole and complete charge and control of the estate, was made and recorded; and after the death of Beuben Baker a similar power of attorney to S. H. Baker was made and recorded May 23, 1885. Neither of these letters of attorney provide for the payment of any compensation to the attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-3\">Two of the heirs, appellants, testified that Mr. Baker stated he would make no charge for his services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\">It appeared that the collections for the estate were made by Mr. Baker or by the officers of the Citizens Bank, and that the commission usually charged by the bank in making bank collections was % of 1 per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">The accountant claimed credit in her account for time, trouble, and expense for herself and S. H. Baker, her attorney in fact, 4 per cent on $84,439.53, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">Accountant $1,688.79</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnX\">S.

Baker $1,688.79</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">\u2014to the allowance of which appellants objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">The auditor allowed the commission charged, finding that the collections consisted of $53,094.30, money on deposit, and $51,-100 in judgments, mortgages, and notes; that their collection required the closest kind of attention; that nothing had been lost for lack of attention, and cited as authority: Pusey v. Clemson, 9 Serg. &amp; B. 209; Eshleman\u2019s Appeal, 74 Pa. 45; Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 234; <em>Be </em>Harland, 5 Bawle, 323; Mc-Causeland\u2019s Appeal, 38 Pa. 466; Gable\u2019s Appeal, 36 Pa. 396; Bhone, Orphans\u2019 Court Pr. p. 303.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-9\">It appeared that decedent had $46,000 on deposit at 3 per cent interest in the Barclay Bank, which S. H. Baker drew out and deposited in the Citizens Bank, of which he was a half owner; that all the other moneys of the estate were deposited in the latter bank; that no profit was derived therefrom by the administratrix ; and that the Citizens Bank derived a profit by loaning balances on deposit at from 2% to 3 per cent interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-10\">The accountant charged herself with $125,619.93 and claimed credits, $37,275.24.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-11\">The auditor found that during the year the administratrix paid her checks to the heirs amounting to $49,382.86. The auditor refused to surcharge accountant with interest, citing: Act of March 29, 1832, 1 Purdon\u2019s Digest, 50, pi. 207; act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>March 15, 1832, 1 Purdon\u2019s Digest, 517, pi. 53; Norris\u2019s Appeal, 71 Pa. 125; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 97; Long\u2019s Estate, C Watts, 46; Charlton\u2019s Appeal, 34 Pa. 475, 75 Am. Dec. 673; Ploopes v. Brinton, 8 Watts, 73; Dietterich v. Heft, 5 Pa. 94; Wither\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. 151.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az8\">After the administratrix had filed her account, two of the .appellants presented a petition for the removal of the administratrix because she had given the settlement of the estate to S. H. Baker, a debtor thereto, which the court, Hunter, P. J., dismissed with the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">\u201cThere is no doubt that the orphans\u2019 court has power to remove executors or administrators, as proposed by counsel for the rule; but the causes for which they may be removed are designated in the statutes, and the orphans\u2019 court is but the \u25a0creature of statutory law and derives its powers entirely therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">\u201cThe acts of March 20, 1832, and May 1, 1861, authorize the orphans\u2019 court, for causes therein set forth, to discharge executors and administrators, but there is nothing in the petition that brings the respondent within the terms of these acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">\u201cThe record shows that letters of administration were granted by the register to the widow. She had the first right under the act of March 15, 1832. And from,this decree of the register there has been no appeal. Now the application is to revoke the letters; but what authority has this court to revoke letters upon petition simply and without appeal or any application had to the register to reconsider his decree if improvidently made? But we must also remember that the administratrix has filed her account, and that exceptions have been filed thereto by the parties here complaining. If injured, ample redress can be had in this way, which is the most direct way. These exceptions are now before an auditor, appointed for the purpose of hearing the parties in interest. We need only add that the bond is ample; and I can see no danger to the rights of the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">\u201cAnd now, August 30, 1886, rule discharged at the cost of petitioners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-9\">The appellants excepted to the allowance of charges for commissions and the refusal to surcharge the administratrix with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The court, Hunter, P. J., discharged the exceptions and confirmed the.auditor\u2019s report, with the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-4\">\u201cThe widow was entitled to administration; so far as the estate is concerned, the power of attorney to S. H. Baker amounts <em>to nothing; she </em>and her bondsmen are responsible. To removing a portion of the funds from the bank in Greensburg to a bank in Latrobe, I see no objection. Latrobe was the nearest point for persons to whom checks may have been granted. The accountant was not required to put the money at interest; but if there was proof that the accountant profited from a deposit of the money, she would be chargeable with such profit; but there is no such proof here. Large sums of money, from time to time, are paid into court and deposited in a bank and the practice is the same elsewhere. This was especially true in the court of bankruptcy. That such banks may profit thereby may be true, but that is an advantage peculiar to the business. They have risks to run, while it is always safer to have money in a solid bank than to keep it in a bureau drawer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">\u201cThe cost of closing the estate was but 4 per cent, and by the weight of the authorities 4 per cent is not extravagant. The whole trouble here is that the accountant and her agent divided the compensation in stating her account, and without this the matter would have been stripped of question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">\u201cThe closing up of so large an estate in so short a time shows the hand of a business man, and I do not think there is any cause for complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">\u201cAnri now, February 19, 1887, the exceptions are dismissed and the auditor\u2019s report confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-8\">Thereupon the appellants took this appeal, assigning as error the refusal of the court to revoke the letters of administration and to surcharge the accountant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-9\"><em>Welty McOullogh, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQx\">Committing the sole management of the estate to a debtor was equivalent to a renunciation and cause for removal of the administratrix.
