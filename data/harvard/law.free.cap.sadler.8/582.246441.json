S. Young, Esq.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-11\">The contention in this case, as appears from the bill and answer and other pleadings filed therein, is as to the right of the Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society to occupy (with permanent buildings and other improvements) a portion, of Hie wharf of the city of Pittsburgh lying along the Allegheny river <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>between Duqnesne way and the low-water line of said river, the Union Bridge, and Third street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-4\">It is set forth in complainants\u2019 bill that they are lessees of certain lots of ground fronting on Duquesne way, upon which is erected a large building occupied by them in their business \u2022of boiler malting and the construction of iron and steel vessels; that the proposed buildings of the defendant will shut out the .light from their works, their business requiring plenty of sunlight; that also, by reason of said proposed buildings and improvements, they will be deprived of the facilities of shipping \u2022their manufactured products by the river, as they have heretofore and for a long time done, and will be prevented from using the wharf for other purposes in connection with their business of boat building; that the city of Pittsburgh is only entitled-&gt;by virtue of the act of March 31, 1836, which grants to it the right to use said land for wharf purposes, and therefore cannot permit or grant to any person or corporation the right to use it for any other purpose. The complainants, therefore, pray for an injunction restraining said society from occupying said \u2022wharf with buildings and improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">The answer of said respondents denies all the principal allegations of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-6\">This ease was carefully and fully heard by His Honor, Judge \u25a0Stowe, upon a motion for a preliminary injunction, and an opinion filed therein by him sustaining the complainants\u2019 bill, \u25a0and granting a preliminary injunction as prayed for; and as the whole case turned upon the right of the city of Pittsburgh to permit the wharf to be used for the purpose proposed by the \u2022society, or to grant to it the right to use it for any such purpose as proposed by it, and did not require an examination of the \u25a0other facts stated in the bill, were it not for subsequent legislation (which, it is claimed, enlarges the power of the city of Pittsburgh so as to allow it to make the grant to the said society, \u2022and gives to the society and similar corporations the right to \u2022occupy the wharf for the purposes and in the manner proposed) the work of the master would be at an end, not only because \u2022the master is of the opinion that it is not within his province \u25a0to attempt to reverse the court appointing him, but also because, in the opinion of the master, the opinion of the court filed in this case rests in the soundest law and most correct construction \u2022of the act of 1836, upon which the whole question turned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>But. in order that the whole matter may be understood by the court, and every advantage given to the parties upon final hearing, without further delay and a re-reference to the master, and because some of the facts are necessary in view of the subsequent legislation, the master finds the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-4\">First The complainants are the lessees of certain lots of ground abutting on Duquesne way, opposite the proposed buildings and improvements of the Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society, upon the wharf, upon which lots are erected the buildings of complainants used by them in manufacturing boilers and constructing iron and steel boats and other work used in the building, fitting out, and repair of steamboats;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-5\">Second. That the said exposition society has prepared elaborate plans and proceeded to make excavations on the wharf, and to a large extent to build a retaining wall along the said wharf at or near the low-water line, and made other preparations looking to the erection of large buildings and other permanent improvements on said wharf; and that said buildings and permanent improvements will occupy the space almost from the line of Duquesne way to low-water mark, and from the Union bridge to Third street, and immediately in front of complainants\u2019 works;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-6\">Third. That said complainants, by reason of said buildings and improvements, will not enjoy the same facilities for shipping their manufactured products by river, nor for fitting out boats and constructing iron and steel boats, and of receiving heavy material used in their business by river, and generally in carrying on their business, which they now have; and said complainants will be put to greater expense in carrying on their business, and their profits consequently much reduced;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-7\">Fourth. The erection of the buildings and improvements proposed by said society will not interfere with the light to complainants\u2019 buildings;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-8\">Fifth. The city of Pittsburgh, by an ordinance approved the third day of March, 1886, granted to tire Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society a lease, free of rent and taxes, for fifty years, of all that portion of the Allegheny wharf lying between Duquesne way low-water lines, the Union bridge, and Third street, with the right to erect buildings and make permanent improvements thereon, said buildings and improvements to be forfeited to the city, with the lease, upon certain defaults being made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>said society, and to revert to the city at the termination of the lease;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-4\">Sixth. That said society was incorporated under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania upon the 31st day of October, 1885;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">Seventh. That said society duly surrendered its charter in pursuance to the act of June 14, 1887, upon the 17th day of June, 1887, having upon that day duly accepted the provisions of said act;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-6\">Eighth. That new letters patents were duly granted to said society under the provisions of the aet of June 14, 1887;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-7\">Ninth. That said society by resolution duly passed upon the 24th day of June, 1887, appropriated the premises of said city between Duquesne way, the Allegheny river, the Union bridge, and Third street, for the purposes set forth in its charter,\u2019 which resolution is as follows: Meeting of the board of directors of the Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society. Resolved, That this society by virtue of the powers conferred by the act of assembly of Pennsylvania, approved June 14, 1887, and in accordance with the consent of the city of Pittsburgh, granted by ordinance duly passed March 3, 1886, does'hereby appropriate for its use the premises belonging to the city of Pittsburgh, lying east of the Union bridge, and extending eastwardly\u2019 along Duquesne way to Third street, and from the line of Duquesne Avay to low-Avater mark on the Allegheny river; such premises being necessary for the purpose and use of this society;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-8\">Tenth. That said wharf has never been graded and paved by the city of Pittsburgh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-9\">Erom the above findings of fact it will be observed that since the reference of this ease to the master, the legislature has passed the aet of June 14, 1887, and that it is, by virtue of this legislation, that the said society now claims the right to occupy the wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-10\">The pleadings in the case have been amended so as to'bring the whole matter properly before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-11\">It is claimed by counsel for complainants that this act is unconstitutional :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-12\">1. Because it takes away private property without providing for compensation therefor, or without designating any manner of assessing damages for such taking;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-13\">2. Because it delegates to municipal corporations the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>to confer upon certain corporations the right of eminent domain ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">3. Because the purposes of such corporations do not warrant the conclusion that the taking of private property by them is a taking for public use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">As to the first reason, it is urged that the title to the fee in the land occupied as a wharf is in the heirs of the proprietors of Pennsylvania, the title to said land not having been devested by the act of November 27, 1779; that the city of Pittsburgh, by virtue of the act of March 31, 18.36, has only an easement on said land, and that the granting to the said society of said land by the act of June 11, 1887, for a different purpose, is a new taking, and therefore a taking of private property; and that the act of June 11, 1887, does not provide compensation for such taking, and is not therefore constitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">It is impossible to determine whether or not the land in question was not included in the devesting act of 1779, with the information accessible. It might be determined by an examination of the plots laid out by the proprietors, and the returns to the land office prior to July 1, 1776, as on file at Harrisburg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-7\">It is impossible also to determine in whom the title is. It is certain that it is not in the abutting lot holders, as that question has been decided in numerous cases, commencing probably with Com. v. M\u2019Donald, 16 Serg. &amp; R. 397, and ending with Schenley v. Pittsburgh, 101 Pa. 172.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-8\">But, in the view the master takes of this case, it is not necessary to determine these facts. Although the act of June 11, 1887, does not provide compensation, and although the title in fee for said land were in certain persons definitely determined, the act is not unconstitutional, for the reason first laid down, because the Constitution of 1871 provides for just compensation being made for property taken, injured, or destroyed; and although the act granting the right to take does not provide compensation, or designate a method of determining the damages suffered, the party has still his common-law remedy. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Duncan, 111 Pa. 352, 5 Atl. 712, is authority upon this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-9\">The first reason must, therefore, fall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-10\">As to the second reason, it is urged that the power to grant the right of eminent domain pertains to the commonwealth only in right of its sovereignty, and this power cannot be delegated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to another; and that the act of June 14, 1887, pretends, in this and similar cases, to delegate to the city of Pittsburgh the power to grant the right of eminent domain to the society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-4\">This proposition is not sound. It appears to the master that the act of June 14, 1887, simply enlarges the right of the city to consent to the use of the wharf for purposes not before allowed by' the act of 1836; and that the act grants to t-he society and similar corporations the right of eminent domain as to certain lands, and in the case of wharves, only with the consent of the city \u2014 and this in order to prevent the city from being despoiled of its necessary landing places, and must be considered just such a limitation on its right to occupy all property as we find in the case of other corporations, which are prevented from taking burying grounds and other specified property. If the reason urged were sound, every act which provides for the taking of property for public use would fail, because it did not confer on the person or corporation invested with the right the power to take any and all land in the commonwealth, which would be manifestly absurd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">The second reason must, therefore, fall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-6\">The third reason suggested is that the purposes of such corporations as are provided for in the act of June 14, 1887, do not warrant the conclusion that the taking is for public use. The question of public use is one difficult to determine. But it may be assumed as sound that wherever tire taking is a public necessity, as in the case of highways, or is for the welfare of the people, it is taking for public use, or, as is said in the case of Edgewood K,. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 79 Pa. 269: \u201cThe commonwealth transfers to her citizens her power of eminent domain, only when some existing public need is to be supplied, or some present public advantage is to be gained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-7\">And Judge Cooley in his valuable work, Const. Lim. 533, says: \u201cA public use is where government is supplying its own need or furnishing facilities for its citizens, as to matters of public necessity, convenience, or welfare, which from their peculiar character, or the difficulty of providing for them otherwise, it is useful for the government to provide.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-8\">The purpose for which such corporations can be created, as provided by the act of June 14, 1887, is for \u201cthe educating of the public by exhibiting artistic, mechanical, agricultural, and horticultural products, and providing public instruction in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>arts and sciences.\u201d The preamble of the act sets forth the necessity of such societies or expositions. It need not now in this day be argued that the education of the citizens of the commonwealth is a necessity, or that education conduces to the welfare of the public. And in view of the above authorities, and of the fact that the purpose of such corporations is the education of the public, and that education is both necessary and the public welfare demands it, the conclusion irresistibly follows that the taking of private or other projoerty by such corporations, for the purposes set forth in the act creating such corporations, is a taking for public use. And while the question of what is a public use is finally a judicial question, yet, it has been aptly said in the case of Edgewood R. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 79 Pa. 257: \u201cThat the control of the right of eminent domain rests with the legislature (Cooley, Const. Lim. 538); and that the degree of the public necessity for the exercise of that right is exclusively for their ascertainment (Smedley v. Erwin, 51 Pa. 445), is undoubted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-4\">The legislature, by the act of June 14, 1887, not only has ascertained that necessity and granted the right of eminent domain in set terms, but it has declared the taking of such public lands for the purposes named in the act to be a taking of said land for public use. Act of June 14, 1887, \u00a7 4 (P. L. 385).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">The master, therefore, concludes that none of said reasons are well founded, and that the said act of June 14, 1887, is constitutional and empowers the Western Pennsylvania .Exposition Society to occupy the land described in the ordinance of the city of Pittsburgh of March 3, 1886, with its buildings and improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-6\">The master, therefore, recommends that the bill in this case be dismissed, and the injunction dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-7\">In view of the fact that this bill is dismissed, solely by reason of the legislation obtained after the cause had been so proceeded in that all the testimony had been taken, and that nothing j&gt;ractically remained to be done, except to prepare the report of the master, the master is of the opinion that the costs of this proceeding to the present time, including the master\u2019s fee, should be borne by the Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-8\">The court entered a decree in accordance with this opinion; whereupon, complainants took this appeal, assigning for error this action' of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>John S. </em>Ferguson, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A72\">The title to the act is in these words: \u201cAn Act to Provide for the Incorporation and Regulation of Companies, Not for Profit, Organized for the Encouragement of the Arts and Sciences, and of Agriculture and Horticulture, and to Confer Upon Such Companies the Right of Eminent Domain.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-5\">Eminent domain is the right remaining in the state to take private property for public use.

Cooley, Const. Lim. p. 524.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-7\">An analysis of the act seems to us to amount to a demonstration that it is unconstitutional by reason of the provisions of article 3, \u00a7 3, of the Constitution. The title does not clearly indicate its subject-matter, and it is therefore unconstitutional. Ruth\u2019s Appeal, 10 W. N. 0. 498.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-8\">The title tends to mislead as to the power granted. It conveys, for instance, the belief that eminent domain as ordinarily understood is intended to be granted; and no one would infer that streets, highways, and wharves were to be given up, and past ordinances, giving them up, ratified, and solemn acts ,of assembly, preventing such ordinances, repealed. It is therefore unconstitutional. Union Pass. R. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 81 *Pa. 91.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-9\">But even if we did not question the constitutionality of the act, we might fairly contend that the society, under its provisions, takes no right to the wharf in question. It claims by virtue of nothing done by it or by the councils of the city since the passage of the act, except the surrender of its former charter, and the acceptance of the provisions of the act of 1887. It stands upon the ordinance of councils passed in 1886. That ordinance was an illegal attempt to nullify the acts of 1836 and 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-10\">To operate as claimed by appellees the acts of 1836 and 1867 must be taken as repealed under the general repealing clause. But there is no such repugnancy as to demand the implication of such repeal. If the two acts can stand together, there is no repeal by implication. Williamsport v.

Lewis\u2019s Appeal, 67 Pa. 153.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-4\">In many states it has been held that land belonging to the state and devoted to public use may be taken for another public use under authority, without compensation. But the general tenor of the Constitution of 1874, and particularly the provisions of article 3, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18, and article 9, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6, 7, seems to raise a strong implication that no such power resides in our legislature. At all events \u201can intent to alienate . . . [public] lands without any consideration will not, in the absence of a formal grant in express words, be implied except upon the clearest necessity to effectuate the purpose of the legislature in investing the grantee with public franchises.\u201d Stevens v.

Payne, 2 Smith, Lead. Cas. \"pp. 218, 219.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-4\">It would seem to follow, therefore, that the owners of the fee of the lots occupied by the appellants have a property in this wharf, to wit, the right at least of having it kept open, and that the appellants during the term of their lease have the same right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-5\">These suggestions are in no way weakened by the act of 1836. That act operated only in so much of the private right as was inconsistent with the public use of the property for a street and wharf, and only to that extent provided for compensation. Pittsburgh v. Scott, 1 Pa. St. 309; Bailey v. Miltenberger, 31 Pa. 39.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-6\"><em>W. F. McCoolc, </em>for appellee,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU-R\">Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society. \u2014 Sehenley v. Pittsburgh, 104 Pa. 472, sets at rest any claim of the plaintiffs to having any private property or right to the wharf. They never owned either the freehold or riparian rights to it. The title of the state, or of the city, its local agent, is absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-7\">As bearing upon cases cited by appellants, it will be necessary to notice that the act of 1836 also authorized the city to appropriate land not owned by the city, lying up the river and above the Sehenley property, so as to extend Duquesne way to the eastern city line. To this latter part of the wharf she has but an easement; hence Bailey v. Miltenberger, 31 Pa. 39, and Pittsburgh v. Scott, 1 Pa. St. 309, do not apply to the part in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-8\">The appellants\u2019 argument is entirely founded on the proposition that the exposition society is exercising the right of eminent domain as to their private property, otherwise their case falls. Our answer to this proposition is twofold:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-9\">First. They have no title to, or property in, or easement on, the wharf opposite their premises, to be appropriated. Schenley v. Pittsburgh, 104 Pa. 472.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-10\">Second. The society is not in possession of the wharf under any exercise of eminent domain, nor can it be; hence appellants\u2019 property is not \u201cinjured or destroyed\u201d by the exercise of eminent domain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-11\">Here the property occupied is public in its use and ownership; and the taking is by the consent of the legislature of the state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and the councils of the city. Without that consent, it could not have been taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-4\">Therefore, the private property of appellants is not \u201ctaken, injured, or destroyed\u201d by a corporation \u201cvested with the power of eminent-domain,\u201d and article XVI., \u00a7 8, of the Constitution has no application to this case. See Pennsylvania E. Co. v. Lippincott, 116 Pa. 472, 2 Am. St. Eep. 618, 9 Atl. 871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-5\">See also Edmundson v. Pittsburgh, 1VI. &amp; Y. E. Co. Ill Pa. 316, 2 Atl. 404; Pennsylvania E. Co. v.
