The western-most portion of the property was immediately opposite and within a few feet from the track of the railroad, which, at this point, was built on iron piers. One of the pillars on which the track of the railroad rested was also situated so near to the property of the plaintiffs that their right of way was somewhat impeded. At the trial, April 21, 1887, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs of $15,874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-10\">The property is situated in the same locality, and only a few squares east of the property, the question of damage to which was considered in the case of Pennsylvania R.

The same character of injury was inflicted on the plaintiffs\u2019 property as upon the property in that case; and the plaintiff in error admits the fact of its liability if the decision in that ease is correct.
