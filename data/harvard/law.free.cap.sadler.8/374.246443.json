Hazelbaker, afterward Margaret J. Guffey, and Sarah A. Hazelbaker, now Sarah A. Cummins, were the daughters of George Hazelbaker, deceased, late of Washington county. February 7, 1865, George Hazelbaker made his note, under seal, for Hie sum of $131 payable six months after date to the order of Margaret and Sarah Ann Hazelbaker. George Hazelbaker, the father, having died, his estate was administered by his executor, Dr. J. S. Van Voorhis, whose accounts having been settled were referred to an auditor for distribution. Margaret J. Guffey died after the date of her father\u2019s death; and letters of administration were granted upon her estate to Isaac S. Van Voorhis, by the register of wills of Westmoreland county. Among the papers of Mrs. Guffey her administrator found the note in controversy, and before the auditor, appointed to report a schedule of distribution of the estate of the father, presented the note as a debt of the estate. The auditor\u2019s notes attached to his report show that the claim was presented by the administrator alone. Subsequently the other payee in the note, Mrs. Cummins, appeared by counsel before the auditor, while testimony in support of the claim was being taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">The claim was allowed by the auditor who, in his schedule of distribution referred to it as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">I. S. Van Voorhis, administrator, Margaret Guffey and Sarah A. Cummins. | $252.32.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASP\">The amount of this note, as ascertained by the auditor, was demanded by Mrs. Guffey\u2019s administrator and, upon the surren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>der of the note and giving of a receipt, was paid to him by the executor of George Hazelbaker. The executor having made answer to this effect, when cited to show cause why he should not pay to Mrs. Cummins the half of the sum awarded, his answer was demurred to as \u201cnot sufficient in law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">No testimony was taken by either side, but upon the argument of the case the following facts were admitted and considered as proved:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">1. That the note was made payable to the two daughters and was found in the possession of Mrs. Guffey at the time of her death;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">2. That Mrs. Guffey held at the time of her death an evidence of indebtedness against her sister, Mrs. Cummins, which remains unpaid;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">3. That Mrs. Cummins claims to have a full defense against said indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">The court, sustaining the demurrer, made the rule upon the executor absolute, making the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">\u201cAnd now, December 31, 1886, the rule heretofore granted, on the petition of Sarah Ann Cummins, on Dr. J. S. Van Voorhis, executor of George Hazelbaker, deceased, to show cause why he should not pay to the petitioner the sum of $126.16, with interest from September 15, 1882, is made absolute; and it is now ordered and decreed that the said Dr. J. S. Van Voorhis, executor as aforesaid, pay to the said Sarah Ann Cummins the sum of $126.16, with interest thereon from September 15, 1882, and costs of this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\">Thereupon the executor took this appeal, assigning for error: (1) The sustaining of the demurrer to the answer; (2) the refusal to dismiss the petition of Sarah A. Cummins; and (3) the making of the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-11\"><em>John H. </em>Murdoch, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0F\">-Obligees are joint when the obligation is made to two or more; and in that event each is not a creditor for his separate share, unless the nature of the subject or the particularity of the expression in the instrument leads to a different conclusion.

Pigott, 2 Cromp. &amp; M. 384.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-5\">In some aspects joint obligees resemble partners, although of course their right or authority relates only to the receipt of payment or the release of the particular obligation in which they are joined. Upon a dissolution pf the partnership the authority and implied agency of the individual members are in general ended; yet after dissolution either partner may receive a debt due to the firm and discharge the debtor.
