MeCandless of Butler, 'who was engaged in loaning money. MeCandless, after having the records searched, agreed to lend McCall $200 if John Grossman and George K. Baker would go his bail. MeCandless had his lawyer fill out a judgment note for $200 and gave it to McCall. McCall took the note to Grossman who signed it as surety after an agreement with McCall that it was not to be used unless George If. Baker signed it also as surety; and if George K. Baker did not sign it, it was to be void. McCall then forged George K. Baker\u2019s name to it and gave it to MeCandless who, not being familiar with the signatures and relying entirely on McCall\u2019s word and making no inquiry of anyone else whether this was the genuine signature of Baker and whether Grossman had signed the note without stipulations or conditions and whether said note had been given to McCall for delivery, gave his check for $200. McCall committed suicide some time afterwards. The note was entered of record; execution issued thereon; a petition was presented to open the judgment; a rule to show cause was granted and afterward discharged, and this was assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>J.

Crago, 81* Pa. 166, the court held that the creditor, from the information he received from the principal, should have known that two of the sureties had only signed an unfinished instrument; here he could have known it; and a jury should, under the instruction of the court, find whether I. J: MeCandless' in receiving the note from McCall acted as a prudent and careful man, and whether McCall in his negotiation with Grossman was acting as the agent of MeCandless.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-6\"><em>Newton </em>Black, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqTx\">Where a surety to a bond signs upon the assurance that the principal will secure two other persons, specified and known to such surety, to sign the bond before he delivered the same, which the principal fails to do, but this is wholly unknown to the obligee at the time he accepts the bond, the surety is bound to perform the obligation.

It is not material that Grossman signed the note with the expectation that Baker would also sign it as cosecurity. No knowledge of this understanding was brought home to Mc-Candless, who loaned the money. If then Grossman signed the note and intrusted it to McCall to get the additional signature, he put it in the power of the latter to perpetrate a fraud upon McCandless. The latter had agreed to loan the money to McCall in case both Grossman and Baker became sureties. Mc-Candless had no reason to suppose that the signature of Baker was a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">It is a familiar rule of law that when one of two innocent persons must suffer a loss, he shall suffer whose negligence was the cause of such loss. The application of this principal to the case in hand affirms the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
