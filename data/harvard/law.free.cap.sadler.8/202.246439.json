That the land sold for $26 an acre, an inadequate price, insufficient to pay Maria\u2019s judgment, and that Maria Jennings did not discover the fraud until July, 1881, shortly before the bringing of the first ejectment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">On the part of defendants it was contended that the evidence failed to disclose a clear understanding that Maria was to have any interest in the land or that any fraud had been practised; that Maria voluntarily joined in the several conveyances and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>made no objection to the assignee\u2019s sale or the confirmation thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-4\">The court refused several requests to charge on behalf of\u2019 plaintiff and directed the jury to find for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">The jury returned a verdict for defendants, and from judgment thereon plaintiff brought this writ, assigning as error the above action of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>Purman &amp; Wyly </em>and <em>Buchanan &amp; Walton, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7Q\">The plaintiff\u2019s action was not barred by the act of April 22, 1856, because, the fraud was not discovered until recently..

The evidence to establish a resulting trust fails of its purpose, and even if such trust were established in Mrs. Jennings she was too late in asserting it. Neither can we see that she was defrauded in the deed of assignment. The principal halt in the matter seems to be that the property did not sell for enough to satisfy her judgment against her husband; had it been otherwise we should doubtless never have heard of this case*</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
