Baily, in whose name this action was brought for the use of the commonwealth, became state treasurer of Pennsylvania in May, 1882. Soon after Mr. Baily\u2019s election Daniel H. Wallace, who was engaged in banking at New Castle, Pennsylvania, in the name of \u201cThe People\u2019s Savings Bank,\u201d requested him to deposit money of the commonwealth in his bank. No agreement was made between them, but after Mr. Baily entered upon his office he received from Mr. Wallace a bond to him as state treasurer, dated May 15, 1882, in the sum of $40,000, conditioned substantially that Mr. Wallace would faithfully and honestly keep, account for, and pay over on demand of Mr. Baily or his successor all money of the commonwealth which should be deposited with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-4\">Subsequently, without any arrangement, agreement, or understanding of any kind, other than that which the law implies from an ordinary deposit in bank, Hr. Baily deposited in this bank $10,000, of which he afterwards drew out $5,000; and still later he made two other deposits of $3,000 and $2,000, respectively, leaving a balance of $10,000, which was there at the suspension of the bank in the summer of 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">William Livsey succeeded Mr. Baily in the office of state treasurer on the first Monday of May, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">During all this time the state treasurer made the regular monthly statements of account, under oath, to the auditor-general, as required by law, giving in detail the different sums which went to make up the amount in the state treasury, including the names of banks, corporations, firms and individuals with whom the money was deposited, with the amount of each, and the securities held by the state for the safe keeping of the same, and that no interest or other consideration was received on such deposits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">In these statements this deposit was regularly included.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">The bank also rendered to the auditor-general, under oath, the statements of account of the money deposited, corresponding to that of the state treasurer, as required by act of February 12, 1816, \u00a7 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-9\">When Mr. Livsey heard of the bank\u2019s embarrassment he demanded payment of the deposit, and that being refused he brought suit upon the bond against D. II. Wallace, who made no defense, and judgment was promptly recovered against him. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>brought this suit at the same time against the defendants who were the sureties on the bond, and they set up as a defense that the money deposited was part of the sinking fund; that under the statutes the deposit was contrary to law; and that the bond was therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\">The charge and the answers of the court to the defendants\u2019 points were to the effect that if the jury found the facts as stated their verdict should be for the plaintiff. Verdict for the plaintiff for $10,822.87, and judgment accordingly. Thereupon the defendants took this writ, and assigned as error the charge and answers of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-5\"><em>B. B.
