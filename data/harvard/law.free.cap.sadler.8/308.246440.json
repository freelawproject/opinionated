Rep. 18, and note thereto.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYl\">The court, McMichael, J., remarking that the clause was somewhat vague and uncertain, charged the jury that if operations were suspended without special agreement indorsed, the policy became void [The purport of the seventh clause is that if the property insured be a manufacturing establishment, and all of the establishment or parts of it be operated over or more than the ordinary or usual time for operating such establishments, if it be operated extra time, or if operations are suspended in it without special agreement indorsed on the policy, permitting such operating, during unusual times or extra times, or permitting such suspension, then the policy shall become void and of no effect. That leaves out of the question the argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>which was made by the defendant\u2019s counsel to the court, that this clause means that suspension in whole or in part of operation in the establishment avoids this policy; but a suspension of operation as to part of that establishment would not be a suspension of operations thereof. They might quit running one machine, or many machines, <em>so </em>long as they continued operating in some other line of their business in the usual and ordinary way of operating a planing mill], \u2014 and submitted to the jury the single question whether there was such suspension as avoided the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-3\">The court affirmed defendant\u2019s second, fourth, sixth, and seventh points, respectively, to the effect- that parol evidence was inadmissible to affect the policy; that it was immaterial whether the risk was decreased by the suspension of operations; that the contract was contained in the policy; and that no agent could waive the terms thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">Defendant\u2019s first point was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">1. That as the plaintiffs had the policy at all times in their possession, the condition of the policy was a continuing engagement, enduring through the life of the policy, and was at all times obligatory on the plaintiffs, and that it is presumed that they knew .that it was necessary to have a special agreement to cease operation in part or in full, indorsed upon the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\"><em>Ans. </em>\u201cThis point is refused; as I understand it, it asks the court to instruct you that the plaintiffs are presumed to have known that it was necessary to have a special agreement indorsed on the policy, giving them permission to cease operating any part of the machinery or business carried on in the planing mill, and if they so ceased to operate any part, without such special agreement being indorsed on the policy, the policy would be void. I do not find any such stipulations in the policy, and hence decline to instruct you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-7\">The court refused defendant\u2019s third, fifth, and eighth points as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-8\">3. That the fact that defendant\u2019s agents knew that the planing mill was used as a storehouse, both before and after the issuing of the policy, and was run irregularly, will not affect the case; but that the warranty or agreement contained in the policy, that if the mill was used as a manufacturing establishment, and operating ceased, in part or in whole, or suspending opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tions entirely, the policy should be null and void, must be complied with as a condition precedent to recovery on the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\">5. That the provision of warranty or agreement in the last clause of \u00a7 7, art. A, that \u201cThis policy shall become void and of no effect, if operating manufacturing establishments, in whole or in part, over or extra time, or suspending operations therein, without special agreement indorsed on the policy,\u201d is a valid and binding contract; and waiver of the same must be indorsed on the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">8. That, under the admissions of plaintiffs and all the evidence in the ease, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">Verdict was returned for plaintiffs; and defendant took this writ, assigning as error the refusal of the first, third, fifth, and eighth points, the portion of the charge inclosed in brackets, and the admission in evidence of a conversation between plaintiffs\u2019 bookkeeper and an insurance agent, to the effect that it was understood that the steam engine should be rim off and on.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-7\"><em>George E.
