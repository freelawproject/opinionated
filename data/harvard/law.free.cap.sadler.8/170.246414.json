Coen refused to accept this and brought this suit to recover $400 (the-full amount of rent due and paid by him to Inghram for the year-beginning April 1, 1882, and ending April 1, 1883), alleging that the whole of said rent was unpaid at the execution of theCoen-Adamson agreement, and that by the terms of their written agreement Adamson had bound himself to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">On the trial plaintiff offered in evidence an article of agreement between Uriah Inghram and Walter C. Coen and Silas Coen, dated January 25, 1882, for the rental of the building-for the year ending April 1, 1883, in which the store sold by the plaintiff to the defendant was kept, for the purpose of showing the amount of rent the plaintiff was to pay to the said Inghram for the said building, this to be followed by evidence that the whole of the rent was unpaid at the time the article of agreement was entered into for the sale of the store by the plaintiff' to the defendant on the 6th day of February, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">Defendant objected to the whole of the offer, except in so far as it was made to show the amount of rent payable from Coen Bros, to Uriah Inghram, and the fact that the same was paid by Coen Bros.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">By the Court: The objection, so far as it goes to anything beyond the amount of the rent due to -Mr. Inghram and by whom it was paid, is overruled; but the objection is sustained as to-the balance of the offer, and an exception sealed for the plaintiff.

This for the purpose of showing that the defendant, when he' signed the article of agreement of February 6, 1883, knew the amount of rent he was agreeing to pay to the said Uriah Inghram; and for the further purpose of showing the consideration for which said defendant agreed to pay all the rents on said building where the goods were for which said Coen was liable for the $400. This in connection with the agreement already in between the plaintiff and defendant of February 6, 1883, given in evidence, wherein the defendant agrees to pay in the following words: 'Said Adamson further agrees to pay all rents on the building where the goods are found for which said Coen is liable.\u2019 This for the purpose of showing the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s claim under this agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">Defendant objected, \"first, that the evidence is incompetent and irrelevant; second, the contract being in writing, the writing is the best evidence, and the plaintiff cannot show anything to contradict or vary such written agreement unless he has first shown that there was fraud, accident, or mistake in the execution of it; third, the court should exclude all parol testimony going to contradict, alter, or vary the terms of the contract from those embraced in the writing, until the plaintiff has produced clear, explicit, and unquestionable evidence of some mistake, fraud, or accident in the execution of said contract; fourth, in attempting to show fraud, accident, or mistake in the execution of the contract, the plaintiff can only show it by proof of what took place at the execution of such contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-6\">By the Court: The objections are sustained and an exception sealed for the plaintiff.

[4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-11\">The court, Inghram, J., charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-12\">\u201cThe defendant, <em>J. </em>H. Adamson, denies the right of the plaintiff to recover the amount he claims under the article of agreement, but does not deny the right of the plaintiff to recover that portion of the rent due from the time of the completion of the invoice to the 1st of April. In other words, he does not deny his liability for the rent due from the time he took possession of the store and occupied the room down to the end of Mr. Coen\u2019s term, which was the 1st of April, 1883. From the time of the completion of the invoice down to the end of Mr. Coen\u2019s term he does not deny his liability, but he does deny the right of the plaintiff to recover any greater amount than that proportion of the amount due Mr. Inghram; and we take the view that the defendant\u2019s claim is the correct view of the agreement entered into on the 6th day of February, 1883, between himself and Coen; and you have heard the agreements read, and we have been requested by both the defendant and the plaintiff to give you certain instructions concerning those agreements, and they will be binding upon you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-13\">\u201cThe par-ties do not disagree about the amounts, and we have been requested to instruct you on the part of the plaintiff: \u2018That under all the evidence in this case the plaintiff is entitled to recover $400, with its interest from the 12th day of September, 1883.\u2019 As we have already said to you, that point is not correct, and will be refused; . . . but we instruct you that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $66.82, that being the amount agreed upon between the parties as due from Coen to Uriah Inghram from the completion of the inventory down to the 1st of April, 1883. There being no dispute about the amount, there will be no question for the jury; and we instruct you that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict at your hands for that amount; and with your consent the prothonotary will take your verdict for $66.82.\u201d [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-4\">The jury thereupon returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $66.82, and judgment having been entered thereon plaintiff took this writ, assigning for errors: 1-3, The action of the court-in sustaining objections to offers of evidence; 4, the refusal of his point; and 5, the portions of the charge above set forth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-5\"><em>A.

Com. 28 Pa 504.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-6\">As far back as 1750 the King\u2019s Bench held, in Jones v. Newman, 1 W. Bl. 60, that- parol objections may be encountered by parol evidence; and this court, in 1835, held, in Ellmaker v. Ellmaker, 4 Watts, 90, that a marriage settlement would not exclude the wife from a share in the personal estate under the statute of distribution. The parol evidence offered in this case is not inconsistent, with the terms of the writing of February 6, 1883. 2 Wharton, Contr. \u00a7\u00a7 660, 661, 910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">This contention is between the original parties; hence, the writing may be helped by averments and parol proof to carry into effect what the parties meant, no matter what are the words they have used. 1 Wharton, Contr. \u00a7 202.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">The parol evidence offered in this case tended to explain and define the subject of the writing of February 6, 1883, <em>i. e., </em>\u201call rents on building where goods are found for which said Coen is liable,\u201d and was therefore admissible.

Gould v. Lee, 55 Pa. 108.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-10\">The court having held that the language of the agreement meant that Adamson was only to pay rent from the completion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of the invoice up until April 1, 1883, to have admitted parol evidence to show that he was to pay rent for the whole year would certainly be an attempt to vary and alter the terms of the writing, or to show that it meant something else than was therein written, and this could not be done. Centenary M. E. Church v. Clime, 116 Pa. 14-6, 9 Atl. 163.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-4\">Not only this, but the plaintiff in his answer does not allege that there was either fraud, accident, or mistake in the execution of the paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-5\">In the case of Bowman v. T'agg, 5 Sad. Rep. 74, it was held that \u201cwhere parties without any fraud or mistake have deliberately put their engagements in writing, the law declares the writing to be, not only the best, but the only evidence of their agreement.\u201d See also Albert v.

Warfflein, 100 Pa. 526.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">But even if the plaintiff had alleged that there was fraud or mistake in the execution of the contract, the offer does not propose to establish what occurred at the execution of the agreement, but what occurred previous thereto: and this he cannot do.

Its terms are plain and obvious. Adamson was to pay the rent on the premises for the time only during which he received rent from Coen\u2019s tenants, \u2014 that is, from the day of the completion of the invoice until April 1, 1883; and as the case depended on the interpretation of an unambiguous written contract, all oral testimony was ploperly excluded.
