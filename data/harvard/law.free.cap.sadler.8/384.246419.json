Afterwards Stephen Mortland, who was in possession of the property, was, upon motion, added as a codefendant in the action. Judgment was entered in favor of defendants for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>fourth of the land upon confession, but defense was made as to the remaining three fourths. The title to the property was admitted to have been in James Mortland, and a deed dated December 28, 1859, was offered in evidence from James and Mary Mortland to Elias A. Mortland. Defendants gave notice that the validity of the deed would be attacked on grounds outside of the deed, and called one Joseph Kerr and offered to prove by bim and other witnesses that James Mortland in his lifetime and nip to within a few* years before his death by reason of grossly intemperate habits was unfit to make a contract or execute a deed; that he was unfit to transact business by reason of unsoundness \u25a0of mind. The court, against plaintiff\u2019s objection, sustained this offer.

Mortland as a witness and permitted him to testify as to any claim Or interest he had in the land at any time, and to prove a. parol trust. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-4\">The court, Brejdin, P. J., charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">Now then, we start out with the fact that the plaintiff has a clear title to this land on the face of the papers, and if that title is to be overthrown it must be by clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence on the part of the defendants, because, as a rule, a paper title, that is, a written instrument \u2014 written evidence \u2014 - ought not to be overthrown by parol or verbal evidence unless that parol evidence is very clear and convincing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-6\">The defendant says that although this title was apparently in Elias A. Mortland, yet that in effect it was held by him in trust for his father and mother, and as a home for them during their lifetime, and after the death of his father would belong' to the children of James Mortland and should be divided equally among them, Elias being entitled to one fourth, and not to the-whole. The principal testimony as to that is by Elias A. Mort-land himself. The plaintiff says to you that Elias A. Mortland; after the deed was delivered to him, went into possession of the land, used it and controlled it as his own for a period of some twenty years; that he leased the land to croppers; that he in every way, so far as we have any evidence, treated the land as-though the deed conveyed to him absolute title. There is evidence here, the jury will recollect, that he sold certain parts of the land in lots and that Stephen Mortland cropped under him, and that has some bearing on the character of the deed that-conveyed the land to Elias, and on his possession under it. Of course you will recollect that sometimes a man\u2019s acts speak much louder than his words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-7\">We do not recollect that there is any evidence of any act of Elias A. Mortland\u2019s that is inconsistent with the fact that this-deed conveyed absolute title, until about 1879, which was after the judgment upon which the land was sold had been entered up against him. Now, the plaintiff relies upon that testimony to show that this partition that is now set up by the defendants-was a mere after-thought-. The plaintiff says that this was never thought of in fact, until after Elias found that this judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>had been entered np against him and he was about to lose the land: that then this scheme was resorted to among the heirs to retain possession of the land against the creditors of Elias and defraud them by giving them one fourth of the land instead of the whole. All this testimony is for you and not for us. It is for you to give it such weight as you think it is entitled to. You start with the fact that the presumption is in favor of the conveyance. The presumption is that the deed conveyed absolute title; and it is the business of the defendants to satisfy you by clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence that the deed, although on its face absolute, in fact, did not convey absolute title to Elias A. Mortland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-3\">Now we will just say to the jury that if they are satisfied, by clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence, that Elias A. Mortland, although the deed is absolute on its face and recites a consideration of $2,500, and although Elias A. Mortland went into possession and did act as though it was his own, yet if you are satisfied by clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence that Elias got it, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of himself and his other brothers and to keep a home for his father and mother during their lifetime; that his father was a man of intemperate habits; that the conveyance was made under that arrangement and agreement, and that it was voluntary on his father\u2019s part; that no consideration was paid by Elias or received by his father, although the deed recites one \u2014 recites a consideration, then although Elias did, after the death of his father, continue to hold the land, and permitted it to be recovered against him, by not enforcing the rules of law as to limitations of actions in cases of trust, and as to parol proof affecting a written instrument, and as to the competency of witnesses, yet he was not bound to do so; and if before the plaintiff sold this land he had admitted and acknowledged the title of the other defendants to this land, in pursuance of the agreement-made by him with his father at the time the deed was made, then the defendants can hold the land, even though the plaintiff\u2019s title may be correct on its face. The jury will understand that, even if now, when Mortland has gone on the stand and said that the deed was intended to pro' vent Speer and others from collecting their claims against his father \u2014 that the $2,500 was put in as consideration to give it the appearance of an absolute deed to keep off these creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\">Now we say to the jury that a deed made in that way would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>be void as against the creditors of James Mortland,' and that-Speer and others could have levied on the land as the property of James Mortland, sold it, and took good title to it; but it would be good as between James and Elias.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-4\">Elias could hold the land against his father; because his father, being a party to the fraud, could not set up that it was a fraud. He was as much bound by it at the same time, he made it, as between himself and Elias, as though it was bona fide; and Elias was guilty of a fraud in taking this deed and could have been indicted and punished for the fraud upon his own evidence, as given in this case. Yet he is not bound to commit another fraud by refusing to let his brothers and sisters have their share in the land. There is no rule of law that requires a man to be dishonest, and no rule requiring him to follow one fraud with another fraud. If this deed was made by James Mortland, although made to defraud his creditors, to secure a home for himself and wife, and to keep the farm there for the benefit of his children, and Elias took the deed under that arrangement, then, although the deed was a fraud on James Mort-land\u2019s creditors, and although when Elias took this deed absolute on its face, he might have held the land against even his brothers, yet we know of no rule of law that would compel Elias to set up such a defense against the other heirs. If he took the deed under that arrangement, although a fraud as to the creditors of James Mortland, and for which James and Elias could have been indicted and punished and the deed set aside as to James Mortland\u2019s creditors, yet we know of no rule of law that compels Elias to set that up as a defense against his brothers and refuse to carry out the arrangement made with his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">We say that if the jury find the evidence to be clear, precise, and satisfactory, and it is for you to be satisfied from clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence that such is the^fact; and if you so find, \u2014 then they would be entitled to hold the land even against the title on part of the plaintiff which is clear and correct on its face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">There has been a great- deal of other evidence in this case \u2014 \u25a0 evidence as to the ejectment and partition. The plaintiff says that was all part of the scheme \u2014 an attempted fraud on part of Elias; that it goes to show that it was all an after-thought; that he was merely scheming and trying to get rid of the position in which he stood, and save a home for himself by means of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>brothers and their children. All this testimony is to be considered by the jury; and unless, after having heard the whole testimony, they are satisfied that it is clear, precise, and satisfactory, and clearly establishes title in the defendants, your verdict should be for the plaintiff; where-as, if the defendants have satisfied you by clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence, as we have just now.said, then your verdict should be for the defendants. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">Plaintiff requested the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\"><em>\u201c1. </em>That the fact of the alleged trust, in this case, rests solely on the evidence of Elias A. Mortland, the debtor in the execution upon which this land was sold, and his avowal of the acquisition of the land for the use of his brothers, John, James,, and Stephen, whether made contemporaneously with or subsequent to the conveyance to him by his father, is not sufficient of itself to support an allegation of trust as against the sheriff\u2019s vendee in this ease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The court refused to do so, and answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">\u201cThe evidence is. submitted to the jury and its sufficiency is for them and not for the court.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">\u201c2. That the evidence of Elias A. Mortland, that at or about the time of the execution of the deed by James Mortland to Elias A. Mortland, he, Elias, agreed with his father to hold the title in trust for the said James Mortland and wife during their lives, being in flat contradiction of the written instrument and introducing an. inconsistent relation, is incompetent and insufficient to establish a trust in Elias A. Mortland-\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjnJ\">The court refused, and answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">\u201cSuch evidence is not in flat contradiction of the written instrument and under the circumstances alleged by defendant is receivable to show that though the deed on its face conveyed an absolute title, such was not the agreement of the parties. If the jury are satisfied, as we have said, by clear, precise, and satisfactory evidence of that fact, it is sufficient to protect the defendants in their possession of the land.\u201d [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">\u201c3. That to establish a trust against a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, under an-execution against the alleged trustee, it is necessary not only to establish clearly the existence of the trust, but also that the sheriff\u2019s vendee of title had knowledge of the trusr at the time of the purchase; and that there is not sufficient proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>in this case that the plaintiff had such knowledge; and therefore the verdict of this jury must be for the plaintiff, for the land described in the writ.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-4\">The court refused, and answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">\u201cThis point is refused. We understand that prior to the sale an ejectment had been brought by Stephen Mortland and the other heirs of James Mortland, against Elias- Mortland and a recovery of three fourths of the land. This ejectment' the law required to be indexed in what is called the \u2018ejectment index.\u2019 This, with the notice proven to have been given at the sheriff\u2019s sale would be, we think, sufficient to put the plaintiff on inquiry; therefore the point is refused.\u201d [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">\u201c4. That a trust, if created at all in this case, arose at the time of the execution of the deed to Elias Mortland in 1859, and that Stephen Mortland and James Mortland, under the evidence in this case, will be debarred from enforcing all alleged trusts by delay for nearly twenty years or more, against the sheriff\u2019s vendee of title of the alleged trustee, Elias A. Mortland, no notice of said trust having been given or brought home to the purchaser, the plaintiff in this case, at the sale, and the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">The court refused, and answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">\u201cWe refuse this point. In regard to the notice given, the answer is as in answer to the third point just read, and as we stated in our general charge. Elias A. Mortland might have set up the rules of law as to limitations of actions in case of trusts, but he was not bound to do so. If, before the sale was made, he acknowledged or admitted the trust, .and permitted the other defendants to recover in ejectment, that would not debar them from setting it up.\u201d [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">\u201c6. That the issue in this case is alone between Ezekiel Dougherty, the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale of the title of Elias A. Mortland \u2014 which is absolute on its face, and which has remained on record for more than twenty years without any attempt on part of Stephen to impeach its validity, by any legal investigation, until now, so far as appears by evidence in the case \u2014 and Elias and Stephen Mortland; and if the jury believe, from the evidence, that Stephen went on and cropped the farm in controversy, under Elias, and continued cropping it, and for his compensation received the one third of the crop, until and after the land was levied and-sold for the debt of Elias and so continues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>them he cannot avail himself of the alleged parol trust in this .action; and the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\">The court refused, and answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">\u201cWe refuse that. How Stephen got there is, of course, for &gt;the jury to decide, along with the other evidence in the case. It did not absolutely debar him.\u201d [12]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">\u201c8. That under all the evidence in this case, the plaintiff is \u25a0entitled to recover possession of the land described in the writ.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">The court refused, and answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">\u201cWe refuse that.\u201d [13]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-9\"><em>L.
