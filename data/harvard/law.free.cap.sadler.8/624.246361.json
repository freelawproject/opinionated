Good, a bedroom set consisting of bureau, bedstead with bedding com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>p\u00edete, wash stand, and three chairs; also sofa, one half dozen hair-cushioned chairs, roclcer, hair-cushioned, and one cane-seat rocker, and my horse, carriage, and harness, and also the interest of $6,000 during her natural life, the above amount to remain in the property, the interest of said amount to be paid to her annually, and at her death the said amount to be divided equally, share and share alike, between my son Dr. J. W. Good and my two daughters L. Fannie Sheeler, wife of H. E. Sheeler, and Laura E. Kurtz, wife of B. F. Kurtz. Providing, should either or both of my daughters die before my beloved wife, their respective shares of the above dower shall go directly to their children at my widow\u2019s death; and also my beloved wife shall have yearly for her support until my estate is settled, one half the net proceeds of the farm, after the expenses of keeping the farm in repairs are paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">9. I also desire that my executors shall settle my estate in two years from my decease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">The children refused to accept the farm at the. valuation put upon it by the testator. The executors accordingly sold it receiving for it $11,000. Six thousand dollars was charged upon it as directed by the decedent. The widow claimed interest on $6,000 from the date of her husband\u2019s death to the date of the sale of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">The auditing judge, Schwartz, reported on this claim as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">The widow\u2019s counsel ask for a construction of the will, so far as her interests under it are concerned. Their construction is that the widow is entitled to the interest on $6,000 from the time of her husband\u2019s demise, and also to the net half of the net income of the farm until disposed of under the direction of the will. Wills are construed from their four corners. A testator\u2019s intent can only be gathered from the context of his will \u2014 every will should be construed in such a way that testator\u2019s intentions might be attained and effected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">The will before me for interpretation was prepared with considerable care and intelligence. Will it bear the construction sought to be put upon it? The testator gave his executors two years for the settlement of his estate. No troubles were connected with its settlement. All was plain and clear sailing. Debts and liabilities were few. His personal estate was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>large. The sale and conversion of his real estate could all have been effected within a year. The only motive which could have possibly induced him to allow them two years was to sell his real estate to advantage. Before such sale and transfer of property there was no $6,000 in hand to pay her said interest. His intent was, however, to provide for her to the time her real estate should pass out of his executors\u2019 hands; hence, he made and provided as follows: \u201cAnd also my beloved wife shall have yearly for her support, until my estate is settled, one half of the net proceeds of the farm after the expense of keeping the farm in repairs are made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">In my opinion he intended to bequeath to his wife one half of the net income of his farm, until the same should be sold and have passed into the possession of the purchaser, and thereafter she should be endowed annually with the interest on said $6,000. . \u2022 . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court, and the widow took this appeal, assigning as error the refusal of the court to allow her interest on $6,000 from the date of the decedent\u2019s death to the date of the sale of the farm.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-7\"><em>J. Frank F. FLause, H. Willis Bland, </em>and <em>R. J ones </em>Monaghan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APgU\">The testator gives his wife, who was the chief object of his bounty: (1) Certain chattels; (2) \u201cand also\u201d the interest of $6,000 during her natural life; (3) \u201cand also\u201d one half of the'net proceeds of the farm, until the estate is settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-8\">Unless the words \u201cand also\u201d are stricken out and rendered of no effect, the widow is clearly entitled to the three gifts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-9\">They cannot be construed \u201cor\u201d in the alternative. The testator does not anywhere say that any of these legacies are in lieu of the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-10\">Unless, therefore, a new .will is written for Owen B. Good, other than the one he wrote, his widow must receive these legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-11\">But we interpret his will, not by what we imagine he may have intended to say, but by the meaning of his words. Hancock\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 532, 5 Atl. 56; Baker\u2019s Appeal, 115 Pa. 590, 8 Atl. 630.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-12\">If there were but the gift of the annuity there would be no ground left on which to hang an argument for the appellee. The legacy -would then read: \u201cI bequeath to.my beloved wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the interest of $6,000 during ber natural life.\u201d It cannot b\u00a9 doubted, if no more were in tbe will, that this \u201cinterest\u201d would commence to run from tbe day of tbe testator\u2019s death. Wins. Exrs. 747; Eyre v. Golding, 5 Binn. 478.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-4\">Tbe clause of tbe same sentence, \u201ctbe interest of said amount to be paid to ber annually,\u201d certainly does not limit or qualify tbe gift itself. It merely prescribes tbe times of tbe payment thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-5\">In both instances tbe phrase is \u201cand also.\u201d And, in both, \u201cand also,\u201d means \u201cand also,\u201d \u201cin addtion to,\u201d \u201cbesides that previously given,\u201d and not \u201cor,\u201d \u201cin lieu of,\u201d or \u201cuntil.\u201d Tb\u00a9 court below has stricken these significant words out of tbe testator\u2019s will and refused to give them any effect. Tbe phrase \u201cfor ber support until my estate is settled,\u201d in tbe third item of legacy to testator\u2019s wife, in no way limits tbe gift itself. She is entitled to it absolutely, whether \u201cfor support\u201d or not. Beck\u2019s Appeal, 46 Pa. 533.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-6\"><em>11. P.

Good by tbe court below is so clear and obvious that we cannot see why anyone should take exception to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Tbe appeal is dismissed and tbe decree affirmed, at tbe costs of tbe appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
