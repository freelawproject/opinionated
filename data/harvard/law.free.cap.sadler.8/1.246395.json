G. Hunter, for Hunter &amp; Crawford, made affidavit and gave bond as required by law, filed a prsecipe in the court of common pleas of Jefferson county, and had a writ of certiorari issued to No. 246 of September Term, 1880, wherein W.

Bell, Esq., which writ was served on Justice Bell, September 7, 1880; the record was. made up and certified and returned to the court of common pleas, September 13, 1880. Exceptions were filed September 14, 1880, the case was put on argument list, and on January 4,, 1881, the court entered a judgment reversing the proceeding of the justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">The constable who made the sale testified that Mrs. Kramer was not present, but Mr. Kramer was there, and a man that represented Mrs. Kramer bid for her; that the property was on the land of one Webber; that witness told Kramer that he gave-the property into his charge \u2014 said \u201cyou can take it away or youi can leave it there just as you please.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">Kramer testified that he nailed up the fence which inclosed the property sold, and was afterwards informed that the defendants had removed the property; that he thereupon demanded the property of defendants, on behalf of Mrs. Kramer before suit brought One Keicher also testified that he demanded the property of defendants on behalf of Mrs. Kramer, but they refused to surrender possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-8\">On motion of the defendants the court granted a compulsory nonsuit, and its refusal to take off the nonsuit was assigned as. error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-9\"><em>H.

The judgment was rendered August 21, 1880, by default. Same day execution issued to the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>constable, who levied upon the property, attached and advertised the same for sale. On August 27, 1880, three days before day of sale, bail was entered for an appeal; no costs were paid or transcript taken. On the next day, the 28th, exceptions were filed to the appeal for want of payment of costs. The justice did not stay the execution or call it in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-3\">Being a judgment by default, the defendants were required to pay the costs on the execution, before they were entitled to an appeal. Section 6, act March 20, 1810; 5 Sm. Laws, 165, made applicable to proceedings by attachment under act of July 12, 1842, see 43 P.

There was acquiescence in the refusal of the justice to stay the execution, for the defendants on the 3rd of September, 1880, appeared, paid costs excepted to on \u25a0execution, and for a transcript and appeal for the purpose of perfecting the appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">If it was the duty of the justice to call in the execution and revoke it, he did not do it, and at most it was but an error of judgment under the law, and would not destroy the power of the constable to sell nor invalidate the sale. A good title would pass to the purchaser. Ease v. Best, 15 Pa. 101, 53 Am.

Herron\u2019s Appeal, 29 Pa. 240.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">There was no evidence in the court below of any appeal. There was, however, evidence that the defendants in that judgment had abandoned their appeal by having a writ of certiorari issued out of the court of common pleas on September 2, 1880, and served on the justice September 7, 1880, and the record made up, certified and returned to the court of common pleas .'September 13, 1880. This writ was issued before a transcript was taken for an appeal or the payment of the costs of execution ; they could not have both an appeal and certiorari.

Justice Stebeett :</author>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">The judgment of the justice, on which execution was immedi- \u25a0 ately issued, was not void by reason of the alleged irregularities or otherwise. At most it was merely voidable; and hence it was sufficient to support the execution on which the property in controversy was sold to the beneficial plaintiff. She must be regarded as a stranger, and cannot be affected by mere irregularities in the proceeding. The constable having rightfully levied on the property, it was his duty to proceed with the execution of his writ until he was notified that it was stayed or superseded, if in fact it ever was superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">As was said in O\u2019Donnell v. Mullin, 27 Pa. 199, 67 Am. Dec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>458, it is the business of the justice, not the constable, to determine in the first instance whether an alleged appeal is regularly taken or not. If it is so taken as to operate as a supersedeas,, it is his duty to notify the constable and revoke the execution. If he erroneously or unjustly refuses to do so the defendant\u2019s remedy is by certiorari to the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">In the case at bar no such notice was, given by the justice or anyone else, and the action of the justice, in that regard, was acquiesced in until after the sale was effected. Under the circumstances disclosed by the uncontradieted evidence of plaintiff, we think the learned judge erred in nonsuiting her on the ground that she acquired no title to the property in controversy by the constable\u2019s sale, and in afterwards refusing to take off the nonsuit. The assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
