Jackson v. Farrell, 6 Pa. Super. Ot. 31; Penn Iron Co. v. Diller, 113 Pa. 635, 6 Atl. 272. If there has been a liquidation of damages, as in Mjxijeb v. Rankin, such penalty controls. But the fact that a penalty is named will not limit the recovery where it does not appear that such sum was a liquidation of damage. Wagle v. Bartley, <em>ante, </em>271. And in Sharpless v, Murphy, 7 Del. Co. Rep. 22, it was held that the liquidated penalty could not be recovered, where disproportionate to the injury sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b527-11\">As to distinction between penalty and liquidated damages, see the presentation of the authorities in editorial note to Condon v.

Brereton, 51 Pa. 175.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-7\">The general and just rule is, to hold a party who violates his contract for the amount of actual damage occasioned by his breach; and to hold him for more, or to allow him to escape with less, it must clearly appear that the parties mutually agreed to close all controversy about the amount of actual damage by fixing upon a definite sum as a substitute therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-8\">The affidavit of defense makes a case for a jury.

Brereton), however, the following language used by Mr. Justice Oressweix in Sainter v. Ferguson, 7 C. B.' 716, was quoted with approval: \u201cIf there be' only one event upon which the money was to become payable,, and there is no adequate means of ascertaining the precise damage that may result to the plaintiff from a breach of the contract,, it is perfectly competent to the parties to fix a given amount of' compensation in order to avoid the difficulty.\u201d White &amp; T.

C. 436.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-8\">Plaintiff in error contends that the lessor had no right to arbitrarily refuse to accept any tenant proposed by him. Had the lease contained a clause whereby lessor expressly covenanted not to arbitrarily withhold his consent, then the position would be^ correct. But the lease contains no such provision, and consequently the lessor\u2019s right to refuse his assent in any case cannot be questioned. Treloar v. Bigge, L. R. 9 Exch. 151; Sear v. House Property &amp; Invest. Soc. L. R. 16 Oh. Div. 387; Taylor, Land. &amp; T. \u00a7 407.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b530-9\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The defendant in this case, who comes before us as plaintiff in' error, has no reason to complain of the judgment of the court below. He has had his own contract enforced against him. He agreed to pay a penalty, or additional rent, of $300, in case he-should sublet the premises; with this in view he did sublet, and it is but just that he should be compelled to abide by the term of his own contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
