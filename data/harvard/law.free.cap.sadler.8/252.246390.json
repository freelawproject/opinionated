J., upon the case stated, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">The determination of the question as to what judgment should be entered in this case upon the facts presented to us in the nature of a special verdict involves the construction of the will of Benedict Eeynolds, deceased. And before entering upon an analysis of this will it would be well to lay down a few general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>rules by which we must be guided and which we must not disregard; and:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">1. No presumption of an intent, on the part of the testator, to die intestate of any part of his property is to be made, when his words, as found in the will, can fairly be construed to dispose of the whole of it;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">2. The law leans against a construction which converts a fee simple into a life estate ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">3. The main intent of the testator is not to be overcome by an ambiguous direction in a subsequent part of the will; the latter will be construed in subordination to the original bequest or devise;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">4. The intent of the testator must be gathered from the four corners of the will, taken as a whole; and to this intent, if lawful, all technical rules of construction must yield.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">In the will before us the testator evidently intended to dispose of all of his property. The introductory clause, \u201cAs to such worldly estate wherewith it hath pleased God to intrust me, I dispose of the same as follows,\u201d as well as the final clause, \u201cIf there is anything omitted relative to my worldly affairs or estate I leave it to be conducted by and at the discretion of my executors,\u201d clearly reinforce the presumption that the testator did not wash to die intestate of any part of his property and antagonizes the construction that would give the daughters a life estate in the land in dispute, with the remainder in fee undisposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">The daughters Mary, Susannah, and Sarah are named by the father as the first beneficiaries under his will, and the farm now in possession of the defendants is devised to them in fee in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-10\">\u201cI give and bequeath unto my three daughters, Mary, Susan-nah, and Sarah, the mansion house and the farm with the appurtenances (with an exception, if necessary, hereafter mentioned) containing 110 acres and 14 perches agreeably to a late survey and plot made by D. Koberts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-11\">Thus far the intention of the testator is clear; but it is claimed that subsequent clauses in his will change the character of the devise to these daughters. These clauses are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-12\">\u201cAt the decease of any of my daughters their portion of the mansion farm is to belong to the surviving sisters or sister during their lives or life. ... If in the dispensation of God\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>providence any of my children should become destitute of house or home they are to have the privilege of making the mansion house and farm their home and residence with those there, upon good behavior; it is intended by me as a home or asylum for my wife, sons and daughters, and not to belong or go into the possession of any other person or persons whilst any of them live and necessity require it, without the consent of those living.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">In order to arrive at the intention of the testator these words must be construed in view of the fact that he has already given to the daughters a fee in this mansion farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">By these words he did not, in our opinion intend to limit the estate or interest of his daughters in this land before devised to them in fee, but rather to restrain them and their heirs from alienating and leaving the place while any of his children might \u201cby necessity\u201d and \u201cin dispensation of God\u2019s providence\u201d become houseless or homeless. As long as either of the daughters lived, the heirs of those deceased were postponed in their enjoyment of the place; and it was to remain in the possession of the survivor until the possibility of any of his children becoming destitute had passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">The three daughters took a fee in the land charged, under certain contingencies, with the support of his wife and of the destitute children of the testator, if any there might be; and this was the \u201cexception, if necessary,\u201d referred to by the testator in making the devise of the .farm to the daughters, as appears in paragraph first of the will hereinbefore quoted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">At all events the clause in the will which provides that \u201cat the decease of any of my daughters their portion of the mansion farm is to belong to the surviving sisters or sister during their lives or life\u201d could in no way affect the devise that Sarah took under the first clause of the will, as she survived all her brothers and sisters; and neither could the last clause in the will, providing that the farm should be a home or asylum for the destitute children \u201cwhilst any of them lived and necessity required it,\u201d any longer stand in the way of her disposing of her interest in said farm by will or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">Any construction of this will other than what we have given it would be in the teeth of the cardinal canons of interpretation already cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that under the will of Benedict Reynolds, deceased, Sarah Reynolds, at the time of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>death, was the owner in fee of an undivided one-third interest in the tract of land in dispute and described in the case stated, and as heir at law of her sisters Mary and Susannah she was the owner in fee of one fifth of two thirds of said tract of land, or in all she was the owner in fee of seven fifteenths thereof, and that the defendants under her will are the owners of her title thereto, and that the other heirs at law of Mary and Susan-nah Reynolds are the owners in fee of eight fifteenths of said tract of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">The plaintiffs representing sixty-three eightieths of this interest are entitled to recover the undivided sixty-three one hundred and fiftieths of said land and $71.40 as their share of the mesne profit thereof since the defendants went into possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">A decree and judgment were entered in accordance with this opinion, and both parties excepted, and the plaintiffs took this writ, assigning as error the decision and decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-6\"><em>A.
