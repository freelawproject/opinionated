Thompson for $100, to whom a sheriff\u2019s deed was made and acknowledged on March 11, 1874. Subsequently, Thompson conveyed the premises to John Critchlow, one of the- defendants, who subsequently made an oil lease thereof to J. J. Leidecker <em>at at., </em>the other defendants. Plaintiff herein resided on the land from 1848 to 1872. Immediately after the sheriff\u2019s sale, or about March 20, 1874, defendant John Critchlow went into possession and so continued at the time this ejectment was brought, the land having been erroneously increased in value by an oil well dug by defendants. Plaintiff herein made no objection to the proceedings above recited, up to the issuing of this ejectment, on October 27, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">The court, Hazen, P. J., instructed the jury that plaintiff\u2019s omission to object to the sheriff\u2019s sale within a reasonable time, and his acquiescence therein estop him from now objecting to its validity, and directed the jury to find for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">The jury found for defendants and plaintiff brought this writ of error, assigning as error: the admission in evidence of the \u25a0sheriff\u2019s deed and proceedings in pursuance of which the same was made, and the refusal to affirm his first, second, third, fourth, and fifth points, respectively, to the effect that the <em>venditioni exponas </em>was void because no notice of extension had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>served upon, defendant therein, and because there was no affidavit of defendant\u2019s refusal to retain the premises at the valued rental, or that defendant had neglected to pay such rent; that the said writ was void on its face; that the sheriff\u2019s deed was therefore void; and that upon the evidence plaintiff should recover.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-4\"><em>E.

Borer, Judicial Sales, \u00a7 315, 2d ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">In Spragg v. Shriver, 25 Pa, 282, 64 Am. Dec. 698, where no inquisition was held, it was said that the objection must be made within a reasonable time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">What is a reasonable time is defined in Crowell v. Meconkey, 5 Pa. 174; Wray v. Miller, 20 Pa. 115; and Mitchell v. Freedley, 10 Pa. 203.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-7\">A sale without inquisition and condemnation or waiver of inquisition will not be avoided unless defendant object within a reasonable time. Wray v. Miller, 20 Pa, 111; Spragg v. Shriver, 25 Pa. 282, 64 Am. Dec. 698; Berg v. McLafi'erty, 17 W. N. C. 75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-8\">Cash v. Tozer, 1 Watts <em>&amp; </em>S. 519, and Dale v. Medcalf, 9 Pa. 108 cited by plaintiff, are irrelevant, being both cases of defective authority.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-9\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">If there were any irregularities in the sheriff\u2019s sale of plaintiff\u2019s land in 1874 he has been a long time in finding it out He allowed the sheriff\u2019s deed to be acknowledged without objection; went out of possession and remained out until the present time; allowed the purchase money to be applied to the payment of his debts; made no objection to the possession of the defendants until he brought this suit in 1876, when the premises had enormously increased in value by reason of a productive oil well thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">His long acquiescence and the changed circumstances forbid us to be astute in discovering technical defects in the defendant\u2019s title. At most they are trivial, mere, irregularities which should have been taken advantage of before the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed. That is a panacea for irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
