In the spring of 1885 he was taken sick in Adams township and became a charge upon such township; whereupon, the overseers of the poor of Adams township sued out an order of removal and removed the pauper to Forward township. The overseers of the poor of Forward township appealed from this order, and their appeal was sustained, and the court ordered the overseers of Adams township to pay the poor distinct of Forward township the amount expended in support of the pauper, together with the costs of the proceedings. The overseers of the poor of Adams township took this writ, assigning, <em>inter alia, </em>as error the action of the court in sustaining the appeal and making such order. Further facts are set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-6\"><em>Lev McQuistion </em>and <em>K.

When he moved into this township, his residence was upon land of his father-in-law, and of which he, the father-in-law, had the possession and control. It is true, Drushel says: \u201cHe was to give my wife and children some land in Forward township, and that was to be a home for me.\u201d But even had this arrangement been consummated it would not have vested a freehold in him, but at most a charge for maintenance. The fact is, however, the father-in-law, Adam Eiehard, never carried out the alleged arrangement, for he willed the land to his wife, with power to dispose of it to his children as she might think proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">It follows that Drushel never had title or interest of any kind in this property, and as it is not contended that he had otherwise a settlement in Forward township, we must conclude that the judgment of the court below was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
