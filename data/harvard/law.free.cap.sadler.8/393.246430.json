The wages due, for which the lien was claimed in Pox\u2019s Appeal, were for work done for the firm, and those claims were therefore not entitled to share. The same ruling was made in Hartman\u2019s Appeal, 107 Pa. 327, and Decker\u2019s Estate, 7 Pa. Dist. R. 141, 20 Pa. Co. Ct. 318, 6 Northampton Co.

Upon sustaining the exceptions disallowing the credit and surcharging the accounts therewith, the auditors reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\">\u201cThe exceptions relating to the allowance of the labor claims in the personal and real estate fund alike have been sustained and the accountants surcharged with the entire amount, except two or three items in the personal estate. The amount with which they have been surcharged on this account is $4,735.62. There are several distinct grounds upon which the exclusion of these claims rests; but it is enough that ho part of the fund now for distribution or in the hands of the assignees at any time belonged to the firm of Fox, Kifer, &amp; Co., against whom these labor claims were. It is all the proceeds of the individual estate of David Fox; and not being sufficient to satisfy his individual debts, these payments on account of the partnership debts cannot be sustained. And further, these claims do not conform to the act. of 1883, P. L. p. 118.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">To this action on the part of the auditors, and to their findings of fact in regard to other claims presented to them, the assignees filed exceptions.

This is sufficient notice to all the world as to the existence of the lien. Eidgway\u2019s Appeal, 15 Pa. 177, 53 Am.

The interest of the assignor, David Pox, in the mines remained undisposed of until sale was made by the assignees. All liens of record against Fox were fully paid and satisfied by the proceeds of his real estate, outside of his interest in the mines, with a large surplus to be distributed to his general unsecured \u25a0creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">The act of April 9, 1872, giving priority to wages for manual labor, is a remedial statute, and should have a fair and' liberal interpretation.
