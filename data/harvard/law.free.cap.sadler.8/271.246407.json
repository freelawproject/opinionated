Allegheny township, Armstrong county, Pa., for a term of three years from the 1st day of April, 1854, on the following conditions, <em>viz., </em>namely hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">The said Wagle binds himself, his heirs or his administrators, to the said Bartley, or his heirs or his administrators, for the use or rent of said farm for the term of three years from the 1st day of April, 1854, to pay to the said David Bartley or his heirs, or executors or administrators, the sum of $60, lawful moneys of the United States; and the said Wagle binds himself to bring to and to pay over the said moneys or rent to the said Bartley without defalcation; and the said Wagle binds himself, his heirs and his executors, to the said Bartley to make use of no timber of the place for any use only for repairs of said place; nor is he to take or make sale of any straw raised on said farm. N. B. The said Wagle has to pay all taxes of said farm during said three years. And for the true performance of the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>agreement the parties bind themselves, their heirs, their executors or their administrators, in the penal sum of $200, as witness our hands and seals this 8th day of February, a. d. 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">David Bartley, [Seal.] Jacob Wagle. [Seal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">Defendant objected to the admission of this agreement, upon the ground that it did not support the declaration and was therefore irrelevant, but the court overruled the objection and admitted the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">The court, Neale, P. J., charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">\u201cIn this case we do not find anything interrupting that relation of landlord and tenant, and we hold that this is simply a case of landlord and tenant, where a man enters into an agreement with the owner of a piece of land, or the alleged owner, and agrees to pay him a certain amount of rent for that land. After the lease expires by its own limitation, if no other lease is entered into and the tenant continues to occupy the land, it is presumed by the law that he continues there by virtue of the lease that he has entered into, or that has been entered into between himself and the landlord, that the relation of landlord and tenant continues until in some legal manner it is disrupted. We have no evidence that it has been done in this case, and therefore it is the instruction of the court under the evidence in the case which shows the relation of landlord and tenant, that Mr. Wagle is the tenant of David Bartley, deceased, and continues so until he gives up the possession of the land, or acquires a new possession under some other and more effectual title than that held by Mr. Bartley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">\u201cThat being the case the question of the presumption of payment arises in this case. We instruct you that up to the time of the bringing of this suit \u2014 or, rather, you can only go back a period of twenty years from the time of the bringing of this suit, in order to ascertain how much rent would be due the landlord. The suit was brought in 1885, and therefore you could not go back further than 1865 to ascertain the amount of rent due from the tenant to the landlord. You have in evidence that in 1869, in 1870, and 1878 there was $20 paid, and in 1863, $25, and in 1877, $30; that 1863 is farther back than you can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u2022go, or than this case would, relate to. The presumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary is that the rent was paid up to 1865. Then you ascertain how much is due between that time and the present.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">The plaintiff submitted the following points, which were refused by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">\u201c1. That the agreement upon which this action is founded, the sum therein mentioned to be paid being secured by a penalty, this action of debt will not lie, as the sum sued for should have been the penalty; but as it is, if the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant has paid the $60 in the agreement stipulated to be paid, with the interest thereon, then the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">\u201c2. That, this action being in debt, and founded on an agreement under seal, and secured by a penalty, there cannot be a recovery on the <em>indebitatus </em>counts in assumpsit; and if the jury-find from the evidence in the case that the defendant has paid! the full amount of $60 with the interest thereon, to David Bartley in his lifetime, then their verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">\u201c3. That, under all the evidence in this case, if the jury believe from the evidence of payment that the $60 stipulated in. the agreement was paid with its interest in the lifetime of David Bartley, their verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs for $290 upon which judgment was entered, and defendant took this writ, assigning for error the admission of the said agreement in evidence, the portion of the charge above set forth, the refusal of his points, and the action of the court in reference to certain questions of evidence. \u2022 \u25a0 - - - \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-9\"><em>Austin Clark </em>and <em>David Barclay, </em>for plaintiff in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK1\">There is nothing in the agreement sued on that will support the first count of the declaration. A \u201cwriting signed by and sealed with the seal of the said Jacob Wagle\u201d is declared on. No such agreement was in evidence as above alleged. The agreement offered and admitted in evidence is that \u201cthe said Jacob Wagle binds himself, his heirs or his administrators, to the said Bartley, or his heirs or administrators, for the use or rent of said farm for the term of three years from the 1st day of April, 1S54, to pay the said David Bartley, his heirs, or executors or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>administrators, tbe sum of $60, lawful money of tbe United States. . . . And for tbe true performance of the above agreement the parties bind themselves, their heirs, their executors or their administrators, in the penal sum of $200, as witness,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">There is nothing in this to support the declaration. There is no such word as demise here, nor occupation. Sixty dollars is to be paid for the use or rent; and that is the sum certain, fixed by tbe parties in writing, and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">Evidence must tend, in some degree at least, to prove the fact in dispute. There could be no facts in dispute, only such as are contained in the agreement. It was, therefore, inadmissible. Wolle v. Brown, 4 Whart. 365; Tams v. Lewis, 42 Pa. 402.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADs\">The second count is a misjoinder; hence, the declaration is bad, and will be reversed on error. Jennings v. Newman, 4 T. B. 347; Cooper v. Bissell, 16 Johns. 146; Pell v. Lovett, 19 Wend. 546.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKX\">The declaration demands the same sum in both counts, but in one count the demand is made on the specialty, in the other it is made in assumpsit, thus joining the two actions, debt on the special contract, and assumpsit for use and occupation in the same action. The one is for a sum certain, the other for an uncertain sum. But the agreement in evidence does not support either count. The declaration is bad. See Buckwalter v. United States, 11 Serg. &amp; B. 193, and Huber v. Burke, 11 Serg. &amp; B. 238; Burkholder v. Lapp, 31 Pa. 322.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">If any recovery could be had in this case, it could only be to tbe extent of the penalty; for under the agreement the defendant is only accountable for that amount. 1 Troubat &amp; H. 5th ed. pi. 455, 458, 459; William III. chap. 2, \u00a7 8; Bob. Dig. 142; Martin v. Taylor, 1 Wash. 1, Eed. Cas. No. 9,166.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">There is nothing in the agreement to continue it for any other or longer term than three years as a specialty; nor is there anything indorsed on it to do so; and therefore the action of debt would not lie to recover after the time mentioned therein. Luciani v. American E. Ins. Co. 2 Whart. 167.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">Debt is founded on a contract express or implied in which the certainty of the sum or duty appears. The sum is to be recovered <em>in numere </em>and not in damages. Weiss v. Mauch Chunk Iron Co. 58' Pa. 295.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-12\">But were it different, a parol agreement cannot be set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>in this action to enlarge the defendant\u2019s liability. The first count in the declaration does enlarge the defendant\u2019s alleged liability. It does not say on a parol agreement, but we must infer it means that; and to sustain that count would require this court to give all claims outside of the $60, or the amount of the penalty, the quality and effect of a specialty. This cannot be done in an action of debt, any more than in an action of covenant. The contract then is no longer the covenant that was sealed, and the remedy must change with the contract. See Le-high Coal &amp; Nav. Co. v. Harlan, 27 Pa. 442.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-4\"><em>H.
