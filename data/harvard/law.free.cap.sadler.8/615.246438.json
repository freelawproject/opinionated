His defense was that when he parted with the note to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>plaintiff, tbe latter agreed not to look to him as indorsee. This was to contradict the legal effect of the indorsement; in other words to reform the instrument. He attempted to do this by his oath alone. This will not do. He was flatly contradicted by the plaintiff; there was only oath against oath, and the note must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">We see no error in the rulings of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Judgment afflrmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
