Upon that I do not think the testimony is quite as strong as upon the other two matters. It seems he went away. Some of the witnesses say the wife did not want him to go. Of course the wife\u2019s duty was to nurse him. It is said she was willing for him to go away. Witnesses who were present at the time say she did hot want him to go; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that she went to see him and never did want him to go. On the other hand, her declarations made at different times would seem to indicate that she could not take care of him, and let him go. If you find for the defendants on the.ground of desertion, you must find that it was wilful and intentional, and not by the wife\u2019s agreement, not a voluntary separation. It is contended on the part of the plaintiff that it was voluntary; that she let him go, wanted him to go, and agreed to the separation. On the other hand, it is contended she did not do anything of the kind, and tried to get him back. You will say how that was. If it was voluntary, this defence would not be sufficient, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.

Trial of Title to Land, \u00a7 270, and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\">After the plaintiff\u2019s death in this case, and before the substitution of the administrator, plaintiff\u2019s counsel served a notice on defendants\u2019 counsel, to wit, on November 20, 1886, that plaintiff would claim mesne profits in said action of ejectment, up to time of death of plaintiff, James McGrew. On the'trial of this case it seemed that* because of this notice, the action was treated by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as an action for mesne profits. But said notice was of no validity, and certainly could not change the form of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-10\">An executor cannot maintain an action for mesne profits. Rents and profits are incident to the ownership of the land, and the remedy for mesne profits belongs exclusively to the person having title to the land. Brown v. McOloud, 3 Head, 280; Means v. Presbyterian Church, 3 Pa. St. 93.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>This was an action of ejectment to recover a life estate. Pending the action plaintiff died. When a plaintiff in ejectment, as tenant by the curtesy, dies before trial, the action of ejectment dies, as no one else could have the right to possession. The action of ejectment is founded on a present right to the possession. If the plaintiff had title when the suit was brought, and had not when the suit is tried, he cannot recover the land. Heffner v. Betz, 32 Pa. 376; Caldwell v. Walters, 22 Pa. 378; Sedgw. &amp; W. Trial of Title to Land, \u00a7 648 \u2014 9 and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-4\">We think the declarations of Mrs. McGrew as to the cause of separation, made long after same, and not in the presence of her husband, were altogether incompetent. Prior to the act of 1869 both interest and policy excluded husband and wife from testifying for and against each other; and when the action is by or against an administrator or executor, the act of 1869 does not apply. Taylor v. Kelly, 80 Pa. 95. See also Peck v. Ward, 18 Pa. 506, and Jones v. McKee, 3 Pa. St. 496, 45 Am.

Boyd v. Cowan, 4 Dali. 138,1 L. ed. 774; Osbourn v. Osbourn, 11 Serg. &amp; B. 56; Cook v. Nicholas, 2 Watts &amp; S. 27; Bayard v. Inglis, 5 Watts &amp; S. 465.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">As this case stood at the date of trial, it was an action by an administrator. Under the proviso to the act of 1879 the common-law disqualification of a party in a civil proceeding to testify applied to the witness proposed, Mrs. Angelina Hart. Act of April 15, 1869, \u00a7 1, Purdon\u2019s Digest, p. 727.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">A woman\u2019s declarations at or about the time she is leaving her husband, that she is going to desert him, or is going away never to return again, or that she will never again live with him, are admissible in a divorce proceeding on behalf of that husband for desertion as explaining the intention of the wife at the time. So the declarations of Mrs. McGrew, at or about the time she sent old Mr. McGrew out to his son John\u2019s to be provided for and taken care of, show that there was no intention on the part of Mr. McGrew to desert or abandon his wife against her will, but that the separation was voluntary and was consented to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>actually procured by Mrs. McGrew, because it was obviously to her advantage and comfort to have it so. Matchin v. Match-in, 6 Pa. 332, 47 Am. Dec. 466.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-4\">The admissions or declarations of Mrs. McGrew were competent evidence in this case against her devisee, because of the privity between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-5\">The temporary inability of the husband to support his wife, by reason of sickness, does not bring her within the protection of the act of May 4, 1855 \u2014 there must be something that involves the wilful nonperformance of a duty on his part. The mere change of residence by the husband does not constitute desertion. It must be absence against the will of the other party, and with wilful intent to desert. Separation is not desertion. Desertion is an actual abandonment of matrimonial cohabitation, with an intent to desert, wilfully and maliciously persisted in without cause. The guilty intent is manifested when, without cause or consent, either party withdraws from the residence of the other. King v. Thompson, 87 Pa. 365, 30 Am. Rep. 364; Bell v. Bell, 11 W. N. 0. 156; Ralston\u2019s Appeal, 93 Pa. 133; Ingersoll v. Ingersoll, 49 Pa. 249, 88 Am. Dec. 500; Little\u2019s Estate, 7 Phila. 495.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-6\">The action for mesne profits survives to the heir of the plaintiff in ejectment for a freehold of inheritance and why the action would not survive to the legal representative of the plaintiff in an action for a life estate with notice of a claim for mesne profits, is not very apparent. The true rule is that plaintiff in ejectment shall recover, according to his title when suit was brought; but if pending the suit his title is devested, he may proceed for damages and costs.

If J ames McGrew wilfully and intentionally deserted his wife, he was certainly not entitled to curtesy in her estate. If, on the other hand, the separation was rendered necessary by the circumstances of the parties, and for their mutual comfort they agreed to live apart, then of course he did not forfeit his right in her estate. The question thus stated was, with proper instructions, submitted to the jury, and they determined it in favor of the plaintiff. Her declarations were rightly admitted for the purpose of disproving the alleged wilful and malicious character of the separation on his part. The exceptions to the admission in evidence of the abstract of title, and notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for mesne profits, cannot be sustained. That the testimony of Mrs. Angelina Hart, one of the defendants, was properly excluded, is a proposition too plain for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
