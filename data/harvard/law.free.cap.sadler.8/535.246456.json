The act passed in 1194 is this: \u201cIf any person or persons shall lose any money or other thing of value at or upon any game of hazard or other play, and shall pay or deliver the same or any part thereof, the person or persons so losing and paying or delivering the same shall have a right within ten days then next thereafter to sue for and recover the money or goods so lost and paid or delivered or any part thereof, from the respective winner or winners thereof, with costs of suit, by action of debt or case, for the value of the money or thing so lost, founded on this act, to be prosecuted in' any court of record, or where the value is under the sum that may be recovered before any justice of the peace within this commonwealth. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\">The act is a plain one; and it is proven on one side and admitted on the other that on the 25th day of July, 1885, Mr. Wilgus, the plaintiff, was engaged in a game of hazard with the defendant, Mr. Newell, and that Mr. Newell won money from him which was taken and paid over. Under the uncontradicted evidence your verdict must be for the plaintiff for some .amount. The only question is as to what the amount is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">The defendant was called as for cross-examination by plaintiff, which he has a right to do under the statute, and he is not bound by his testimony; but it is before you, and is to-be taken with all the other testimony; and you are the judges as to the credibility of the witnesses, and as to their knowledge of what actually occurred. It is alleged that on the afternoon of that day a game of poker was played at Mr. Newell\u2019s place between Mr. Wilgus, Mr. Newell, and two, three, or four others; neither were able to tell exactly how many participated in that game; and in the game it is alleged by Mr. Newell that he lost $460 and Mr. Wilgus says he won $120.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-7\">Just how and from whom that was won does not appear, and you are not permitted to take that into consideration in this action. If Wilgus won money from Newell in that game, Newell had a right to sue and recover it; but that game was ended, and as it was between a number of different parties and not these two alone, you cannot take it into account. We have not the evidence that would enable you to set off anything in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>transaction in this case, and the act of assembly does not provide for a set off of that kind in snch a suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-4\">After supper Wilgus came back and he and Newell alone went into another game, the name of which has been given you. At the beginning of that game the defendant says he had $125, and that during the game he borrowed $250 from some other parties in the room, and says that at the end of the game he had some $1,030; after paying back what he had borrowed there would be $650 won in that game. Mr. Fahnestock says he was present during a considerable part of the game and that he counted part of the money as it was paid out, the bets running from $25 to $140; he does not know the precise amount, but that in his opinion there were bills on the table to the amount of $1,000 when they quit. Mr. Eberhart who was present puts it. at $1,200 to $1,500. Mr. Wilgus says he lost $1,525.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-5\">Now from all the testimony you will determine how much was lost in the game between these two parties alone, and your verdict should be for that amount. The fact that the money belonged to Mrs. Wilgus is a matter of no importance in this suit. If she were the plaintiff, as perhaps she might have been under the evidence, there might be a little difference in the way you would be disposed to look at some equities in the case; but as between these two parties there is not much equity; it is simply a question of law, and the law gives the plaintiff a right to recover the amount he lost there; and that amount you will determine from the testimony as you heard it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">The jury having returned a verdict for plaintiff for $250, the court refused to accept it and made the following supplemental charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">\u201cThe jury having, in a short time, returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $250, the court refused to accept it, stating to the jury that they had plainly ignored the instructions of the court to exclude the game of poker played among several persons in the afternoon, and should confine themselves to the games of the evening or night, between plaintiff and defendant, and that under the defendant\u2019s own testimony the least verdict they could render would be for $630.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">Thereupon the jury, having again retired, rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff; and judgment having been entered thereon, defendant took this writ, assigning as error the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>-court in not accepting the first verdict for $250, and the supplemental charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b554-3\"><em>William Reardon </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b554-4\"><em>George R. Lawrence </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b554-5\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The instructions which the court below gave to the jury in this ease were lawful and correct, and they ought to have been \u2022obeyed. When, therefore, the court refused to accept a verdict which was obviously wrong and contrary to the charge, it was proper to send the jury back to correct that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
