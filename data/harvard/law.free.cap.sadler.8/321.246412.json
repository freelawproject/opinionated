M., Alonzo W., Louisa, and Veturia Clemens. In his will, the testator, after directing that his debts and funeral expenses be paid, devised the rest of his estate to Louisa H. Clemens, the widow, for and during her life. After her death, and after the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>two specific legacies, he devised the remainder of his estate to his five children, above named, share and share alike.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Note. \u2014 The partition proceedings in this case were instituted by the husband, who was entitled to a one-fifth interest in the land for life.

Clemens, the life tenant, died November 30, 1875. After her death, Isaac J. Deeds, defendant, commenced proceedings, in the court of common pleas of Washington county, Pa., to No. 182, August Term, 1876, claiming to be tenant by the curtesy of his wife, of the real estate devised to her in remainder, under the said will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">In pursuance of a judgment rendered by consent March 1, 1877, the proceedings in partition, the said real estate was divided into three purparts. Two of these purparts, A and C, were taken at their appraised valuation, and the other purpart, B, was by a decree made August 20, 1877, directed to be sold, and was purchased by Wm. M. Clemens. The share of each of the above named children was ascertained to be $2,551.19. One of these shares was decreed by said court, by consent of the parties, October 21, 1877, to be charged on purpart B, to protect the curtesy of Deeds, and the interest to be paid to him annually as tenant by the curtesy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">Alonzo W. Clemens, who is now the owner by purchase of the said purpart B, on the 5th day of May, 1881, presented his petition to the said court of common pleas, asking for a rule on the said Deeds, to show cause why the decree made to No. 182, August Term, 1876, and amended and finally made by the court on March 11, 1881, whereby the interest on the sum of $2,551.19 is directed to be paid to him as tenant by the curtesy, should not be rescinded, annulled, and set aside, on the ground that said \u201cVeturia Deeds, the wife of said Isaac J. Deeds, having died on the 25th day of October, 1873, and before the death of Louisa IT. Clemens, the tenant for life of the lands described of the right of curtesy of her said husband, she, the said Yeturia, Deeds in said lands at her death descended to her heirs, divested of the right of curtesy of her said husband, she, the said Yeturia, having had during her lifetime neither the actual nor potential seisin of said real estate to entitle her husband at her death to be tenant by the curtesy' thereof.\u201d To this petition the said Deeds demurred on the grounds: 1, The judgment of March 1, 1877, and decree of August 20, 1877, conclude the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>and bar his way to obtaining the prayed-for relief on the said petition; 2, that petitioner has been guilty of laches in that he waited five years after he had attained his majority, and three years after he was served with a rule obtained March 7, 1881, giving him full notice of said Deeds\u2019s estate in the land described in the declaration under the above judgment and decree before he filed his petition; and he does not give any or sufficient reason for such delay; and 3, that the court has no power, on the said petition, to grant the relief prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-4\">The court hy a decree rendered December 30, 1886, sustained the demurrer and discharged the said rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">From that decree this appeal is taken, the error asigned being the action of the court in sustaining the demurrer and in entering the decree discharging the rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-6\"><em>Henry Gantz </em>and <em>Braden &amp; </em>Miller, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADA\">Deeds\u2019s wife having died during the existence of the life estate, her husband (who survived her) would not he entitled to curtesy in her share of the land.

N. 0. 252.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-8\">The application to the court helow by the appellant was, although perhaps not in strict form, a bill of review. It was an application to the equity of the court to correct a gross error in law, which it had been led into by the claim of the appellee for curtesy, which he was not entitled to, but which was decreed to him because the question of his right was not adjudicated by the court at the time of the decree, for the reason that the facts were not before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-9\">Tn the present case the application was in time, having been made in about three years from the amended or final decree of the court This application is not in the orphans\u2019 court, and therefore the period allowed by the act of 1840 does not apply; but it has been held, even in the orphans\u2019 court, that a plain mistake made by the court in its decrees will be corrected after three years, where no rights have intervened in the meantime.

But the petition, answer, demurrer, and the entire record, are held as forming a part of the decree, so that if the error in law appears in the pleadings it will entitle the party affected to a bill of review even under the strict rules of chancery. 19 Pa. 433; Dennison v. Goehering, 6 Pa. 404.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-4\">The orphans\u2019 court will reverse and correct its decrees when no right has been changed in consequence of it, irrespective of the statute, and although the errors do not appear upon the face of the decree and new matter is not alleged. Mitcheson\u2019s Estate, 11 W. N. G. 240; George\u2019s Appeal, 12 Pa. 260; Bishop\u2019s Appeal, 26 Pa. 470.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">The case of Whelen\u2019s Appeal, 70 Pa. 410, is a case in point, showing the relief that a court of equity will grant when a party has acted in misconception or ignorance of his rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">The court of common pleas has full power over its own records and decrees, and will not refuse to amend or annul them to prevent injustice. It is common practice for this court to open and set aside its decrees where a gross wrong would otherwise be perpetrated, and where the rights of third parties have not intervened. See Beek\u2019s Appeal, 15 Pa. 406.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-7\">A judgment or decree of a court having jurisdiction is only conclusive of the question passed upon in the hearing of the case. No one pretends in this case that the right of Deeds to curtesy was litigated or adjudicated by the court at the time when the decree was made. It cannot be inferred by argument from the decree itself that his right was passed upon by the court. Ilibshman v. Dulleban, 4 Watts, 183; Lentz v. Wallace, 17 Pa. 412, 55 Am. Dec. 569; Martin v.

The fact to be determined in the action was whether that averment was true. The plea filed confessed his right, and the judgment of the court sustained it, and awarded a writ to set apart his share in severalty. This, not only by the words of the act, but by the issue created by the proceeding itself, conclusively established the plaintiff\u2019s title, and is final and conclusive at law on all parties to the record, and on all persons holding under them afterwards, until reversed or set aside.

Billings, 77 Pa. 498.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-4\">Can the appellant, then, be relieved in equity from this judgment on the ground of a mistake in law ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgR\">That ignorance of the law excuses not is a familiar maxim, which holds true in courts of equity as well as of law. Broom, Legal Maxims, 260; 1 Story, Eq. \u00a7 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-6\">Whatever exceptions there may be to the rule will be found few in number, and to have something peculiar in their character (Hunt v. Rhodes, 1 Pet. 15 [see note to 7 L. ed. 33] ; 1 Story, Eq. \u00a7 116) ; and to have been caused by imposition and misrepresentation or undue influence used by the party receiving the advantage (Story, Eq. \u00a7 137).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGya\">In Pennsylvania the rule is adhered to with the greatest strictness. The first case in which the question was fairly raised is Rankin v. Mortimere, 7 Watts, 372.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-8\">The next case in which this principle is treated of is Good v. Herr, 7 Watts &amp; S. 253, 42 Am. Dec. 236.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-9\">The same questions were again raised in McAninch v. Laughlin, 13 Pa. 371.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-10\">The judgment in the case at bar was entered by consent of the appellant, and cannot now be impeached unless such consent was fraudulently obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-11\">In Thompson v. Maxwell Land Grant &amp; R. Co. 95 TJ. S. 391, 24 L. ed. 481, a bill in equity was filed to establish title and for a partition. In the course of the proceeding a decree was entered by consent of all the parties which it was afterwards sought to set aside. In passing upon this question, Bradley, J., says: \u201cIf the bill is to be regarded as a bill of review . . . the proceedings are clearly objectionable, on the following grounds: first, the decree sought to be set aside and reversed was a consent decree. It is a general rule that against such a decree a bill of review will not lie. Webb v. Webb, 3 Swanst. 658.\u201d See also French v. Shotwell, 5 Johns.
