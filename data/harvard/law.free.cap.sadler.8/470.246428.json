It is not the purpose of the court to enter into a discussion of any of the exceptions except the third, which sets forth that the viewers\u2019 report does not state particularly that the road desired is necessary for a public or a private road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">It is an essential requisite that the report shall state that the road is necessary and the omission of the viewers to so find and report is a fatal defect to the proceedings. By the 2d section of the act of June 12; 1836 (Brightley\u2019s Purdon, page 1496, pi. 3) \u25a0it.is provided that the viewers shall make report and state particularly <em>(inter alia) </em>(3) whether the road desired be necessary for a public or private road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEF\">The language of the report on this subject is as follows: \u201cAnd after due consideration and diligent inquiry as to the necessity \u25a0for said road, are of the opinion that the prayer of the petitioners should be granted for the reasons set forth in their petition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">Upon referring to the petition for the \u201creasons set forth\u201d therein we find it stated that the petitioners \u201clabor under great inconvenience for want of a public road,\u201d but find no allegation that it is necessary. In our opinion, the viewers have failed to report the road to be necessary, in conformity to the requirements of law; that the viewers did not intend so to report might, with some force, be contended, in view of the testimony taken upon that point under a rule of court, and filed in the case. The omission may have been accidental, or may have been the full extent to which they were willing to give expression on the subject. However that may be, it requires that the report on that account shall be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkJA\">Exception sustained. Report set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">The assignments of error, <em>inter </em>alia, specified the action of the court in sustaining such exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-10\"><em>Alex.

The viewers are, nay, generally must be, plaih farmers; it never could be supposed mere technical formality was required from such men. The report must state distinctly whether they decide on a public or private road; if that appears plainly in their report,-it is sufficient; no one can mistake this report.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-4\"><em>Morton Hunter, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHd\">The act of assembly requires that the viewers shall state particularly in their report whether the road be necessary for a public or private road, and this court has so held. <em>Be </em>Boad in South Abington Twp. 33-Pittsb..L..

A substantial compliance with its provisions is all that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In this case, the petitioners say they \u201clabor under great inconvenience for want -of a -public road\u201d between the termini designated in their petition; and the viewers report, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cafter due consideration and diligent inquiry as to \u00a1the necessity for. said road,- they are -of opinion that the prayer of the petitioners should be granted, for the reasons set forth in their petition,\u201d and \u201chave therefore located and distinctly marked upon the ground and do recommend for public use the following described road,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">This, as was held in <em>Be </em>Eoad, 114 Pa. 627, 7 At!. 765, is a substantial finding that the road petitioned for is necessary -for a public road. In same case it was also decided that, as artist in road viewers, the county surveyor may be represented by his duly appointed deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">There is no merit in either of the specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Order, sustaining exceptions and setting aside report of viewers, reversed; and it is now ordered that the exceptions be dismissed and report of viewers confirmed absolutely; and it is further ordered that the costs be paid by exceptants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
