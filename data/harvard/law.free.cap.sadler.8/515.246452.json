Powell and Hannah J. Powell (formerly Hannah J. Davis) against Jackson E. Pugh to recover $650 which was alleged to have been improperly paid to the defendant by the guardian of Mrs. Powell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">In 1862 Hannah J. Davis, when two years old, was taken by Jackson E. Pugh into his house. Her father, who was the brother of Pugh\u2019s wife, was a soldier in the service of the United States and died in 1864. In 1871 James Simmers was appointed guardian of Hannah, by the orphans\u2019 court of Butler county, and received from the government $310 as pension money due to her as a soldier\u2019s orphan. She was also entitled to receive from the government $13 per quarter. All of this money Simmers paid to Pugh. Pugh gave to him receipts which recited that the money was received \u201cin full for board, clothing, schooling, and maintenance.\u201d</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-10\">Note. \u2014 The statute of limitations as to actions for personal injuries, act of April 26, 1855, applies to infants as well as to adults. Lanning v. Penn Electric Light Co. 31 W. N. C. 251. And this is true under the act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, there being no exception of infants from its operation. Peterson v. Delaware River Eerry Co. 190 Pa. 364, 42 Atl. 955.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The orphans\u2019 court of Butler county refused to allow the guardian credit for these payments. Simmers stated in his deposition read at the trial that he supposed \u201cthe money ought to go where the child goes, because I thought the government had appropriated the money for to be used for boarding, schooling, clothing,\u201d etc., and that he had paid the money to Pugh to be used for these purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\">Simmers made his last payment to Pugh on March 4, 1876. Hannah attained her majority in 1881, and brought this action on December 30, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">The defendant offered, <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">6. There is no privity of contract between the parties to this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\"><em>Ans. </em>Sufficiently answered in general charge. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-8\">7. The claim of the plaintiff is barred by the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-9\"><em>Ans. </em>Befused. (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-10\">The court, Collier, J\"., charged, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-11\">If you are satisfied that the money was paid without authority, without justification, that it was trust money, then your verdict should be for the plaintiffs, unless the defendant satisfies you that he has a reasonable defense in the one he sets up, and that is, that he has furnished to this child an amount of money expended in clothing and education and raising her, etc., that will equal or exceed the amount claimed by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-12\">If you are satisfied that he is entitled to any deduction for what he has done for the girl, whatever sum you find, that you can deduct; and if it should amount to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, you would allow him to have a verdict. The young lady, the plaintiff, before the law will allow her to recover money due her, must pay, if there is anything to be paid, for what was done for her. That is the main question. On the one hand the learned counsel contends that in raising this child the defendant expended enough money to cover the whole amount of the claim. On the other hand it is contended that there was nothing at all due; that when the money was first paid to the defendant, there was no contract, no expectation of getting any compensation for keeping the child; and that after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>that the child was worth its own keep. You will have to determine between the parties. That comprehends the whole case in my view. It is a question of fact for you to determine. If you find that there is anything coming to Mr. Pugh, deduct it from the amount of the claim. If it be a sum equal to the whole amount claimed, you will allow him it and render a verdict for defendant. If you find there is nothing coming to him, you find for the plaintiffs for the amount claimed, with interest from date of the decree of the orphans\u2019 court of Butler county, the 27th of April, 1885.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">Verdict and judgment were for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-5\"><em>W. S. Nesbit, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6K\">As between Pugh and Hannah &lt;T. Powell there is no contractual relation whatever, and therefore no privity; if this action could be maintained against Pugh at all, under the evidence given, it could be maintained by the guardian only, with whom the contract was made. The guardian is the officer or trustee appointed by law to manage the ward\u2019s estate, and as such, has power to contract; the ward has a full and complete remedy against him, but as against those with whom he contracts is a stranger.

Irwin, 1 Serg. &amp; B. 549.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">The present action is barred by the statute of limitations.

Where, therefore, as to such choses, the guardian is barred by the statute of limitations, the infant, in the absence of collusion, is barred also, as against strangers, and his remedy is against the guardian.\u201d 3 Wait, Act &amp; Def. 561, 3; Miles v. Wheeler, 43 111. 123; Hayden v. Stone, 1 Duv. 396; McClane v. Shepherd, 21 N. <em>J. </em>Eq. 76.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-9\">In the present case Pugh wan not a trustee by construction of law. He had entered into a contract with the guardian concerning a matter about which the guardian was legally capable of contracting; and the funds had been regularly paid over by the guardian and received by him in pursuance of their agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The decree confirming the auditor\u2019s report, and surcharging the guardian the amounts paid to Pugh, has never been passed upon by the supreme court, and we venture would not have been made after publication of Brown\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 18, 5 Atl. 13.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-4\">We would also suggest that both auditor and court overlooked Eyster\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. 372.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">See also Piper v.

Bloodgood, and adopting its doctrines here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-7\">That case is reaffirmed in York\u2019s Appeal, 110 Pa. 69, 1 Atl. 162, 2 Atl. 65, and its doctrines restated, <em>viz., </em>those trusts to which the -statute of limitations does not apply must be: (1) Direct and continuing; (2) exclusively cognizable in equity; and (3) arising between trustee and <em>cestui que trust. Finney </em>v. Cochran, 1 Watts <em>&amp; S. </em>112, 37 Am. Dec. 450; Lyon v. Marclay, 1 Watts, 275; Cooper v. Brockway, 8 Watts, 165; Meanor v. Hamilton, 27 Pa. 143.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-8\">We respectfully submit that this plaintiff in error does not stand in the relation of trustee towards the defendant in error. Simmers, the guardian, sustained that relation, and, we suppose, gave security for the performance of his trust. Whatever he did without an order of court was done at his own risk. <em>Be </em>Killion, 3 Brewst. (Pa.) 235.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-9\"><em>James Bredin </em>and <em>John M. Greer, </em>for defendant in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApAI\">The jury have found that defendant Pugh has money belonging to plaintiff which in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain from her, and that settles the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-10\">Plaintiff in error, however, says there is no privity between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>him and Mrs. Powell, and that therefore the action of assumpsit cannot be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-4\">The action for money had and received is a substitute for a bill in equity, and lies wherever one has money of another in his hands which in equity and good conscience, he ought not to retain. There need be no other privity of contract between the parties to support the action. Mason v. Waite, 17 Mass. 563, \u2022and Hall v. Marston, 17 Mass. 579; Eagle Bank v. Smith, 5 Conn. 17, and 13 Am. Dec. 37; and other cases referred to in note Selwyn\u2019s <em>Nisi </em>Prius, p. 82; Bapalje v. Emory, 2 Dali. 51, 1 L. ed. 286.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">Mrs. Powell\u2019s right to recover is not affected by the statute of limitations. Her right of action accrued in her minority, and her suit is brought within six years after her arrival at full age. There is no succession of disabilities in the ease, and she is clearly within the proviso of the statute.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b535-6\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The objection that there was no privity between the parties was not well taken. The money was paid to the defendant below for the use and benefit of the plaintiff Hannah J. Powell, <em>me </em>Davis. Under such circumstances it is well settled that assumpsit for money had and received will lie in the name of the person for whose benefit it was paid. It was money which the \u25a0defendant in good conscience ought not to retain.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The statute of limitations was no bar. The right of action accrued during the minority of the plaintiff. This suit was brought within six years of her arrival at age.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
