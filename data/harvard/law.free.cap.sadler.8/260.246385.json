The master has performed his labors so carefully and. ably as to bring every question of fact and of law so fully before us as to render our labor comparatively easy; and, while we cannot assent to all the positions of the master, we commend his presentation of the law and the facts to the members of the profession, as raising, in a clear and forcible manner, every question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">\u201cPatrick McCall, the plaintiff, was owner of a house and lot in the village of South Fork, Cambria county, in 1878. In the same year he left Pennsylvania for Kansas, where he remained some three years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">. \u201cBefore he left, suit was instituted against him by one Owen McCall, upon which judgment was obtained July 15, 1878, for $121.46 and costs. Upon a writ of fi. fa. upon this judgment, the real estate was extended; and afterwards, upon a vend, exp., sold to John Eourke, the defendant, for $172, the amount of the execution, with interest and costs. A sheriff\u2019s deed to John Eourke, dated April 2, 1879, duly acknowledged, completed the legal title of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff alleges that the facts connected with the purchase create a trust \u2014 that John Eourke is only a trustee for Patrick McCall \u2014 and prays for a decree to compel the alleged trustee to convey the legal title to Patrick McCall, the <em>cestui que trust.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s bill alleges that John Eourke 'was attending to your orator\u2019s business at the time of said sale by the sheriff to the said Eourke.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u201cIf this were so, it is clear that the legal title of John Rourke would inure to the benefit of Patrick McCall. An agent or attorney may not purchase the property of his principal, and any purchase so made would inure to the benefit of such principal. There is no evidence, however, of any such agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\">\u201cThe bill further asserts \u2018that said Rourke purchased said property for your orator and not for himself.\u2019 Upon this question of fact and the proof1 of tender, testimony has been taken and reported by the examiner, together with his conclusions as master, upon the facts and the law of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">\u201cThe master finds in accordance with the decisions, as matter of law, that a mere parol promise of a purchaser to hold the land for another, without more, does not create a trust enforceable in equity. Under the statute of frauds, more especially the act of 1856, in order to create a resulting trust one of two things must be shown: first, the purchase must te made with the funds of the alleged <em>ceslui que trust; </em>or, second, there must be such fraud in procuring tbe legal title as to raise a resulting trust <em>ex maleficio.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\">\u201cFirst: [In the case before us the defendant purchased with his own money. It is true the judgment upon which the sale was effected was reduced by payments made by the present plaintiff, the then defendant; but these credits were unknown to the purchaser, who bid the full amount of the judgment; and in furnishing the receipts for $65, the amount of payments, the then defendant only reduced the judgment to the proper amount, in case of the purchaser, which created, at most, but a moral obligation of John Rourke to repay.] 4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-8\">\u201cSecond. But was the defendant, John Rourke, guilty of such conduct, or misconduct, as would create him a trustee <em>ex maleficio </em>for Patrick McCall ? Bet us see.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-9\">\u201cThe trust in such case must be co-ordinate with the title; in other words, the bad faith or fraud must be an element of the title. If there was no fraud or bad faith at, or connected with, the act of purchase, no subsequent act of the purchaser could produce it. Let us, then, in this light examine the facts connected with the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-10\">\u201cPatrick McCall, the plaintiff, lived in Kansas and wrote to his brother, Philip McCall, shortly before the sale, as. he swears: \u2018I was in correspondence with my brother Philip during my stay in Kansas. I learned through him that the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>erty was to be sold. I then wrote to him to buy the property and keep it for me until such time as I would want it, and I would never forget him for doing so. Philip\u2019s statement of what the last letter contained, as made in my presence and before the examiner, was correct and full to the best of my recollection, as to what it contained. \u2018 Philip wrote to me after the sale and told me who bought the property.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-4\">\u201cThis is his testimony bearing upon the question, and it will be seen that he authorizes no agent but Philip McCall, and no course but a sale and a purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">\u201cPhilip McCall testifies, after proving loss of letter of Patrick McCall: \u2018At the time I got the letter I read it. It stated for me to go to Sheriff Ryan and get him to knock down the property as cheap as possible, and for me to buy it in and keep it until such time as he could pay me. I went down to South Fork to John Rourke\u2019s. John Rourke is a brother-in-law of mine. We talked over the matter. I told him that I had a mind to pay that debt which was against Patrick McCall. He said I should not do it \u2014 to let it go to sale. I then told him if he wished, to keep it and get his account out of it. I do not remember the exact words used. However, he agreed to it \u2014 to keep the property until such time as he would get what he had against it out of it. He agreed to buy the property at the sale, and keep it until he would get his money out of it. He was to keep the property until such time as Patrick McCall would pay the debt and all that was against the property, including all he owed him, John Rourke.\u2019 Again he swears: \u2018I did not see John Rourke again to speak to him till the day of sale. Between the time when I had the conversation with John Rourke and the day of sale, to malee the matter sure for Patrick I came down to Johnstown, went to a certain party, and made arrangement to borrow money, for fear of any objection at the sale, so as to have enough' to secure it for Patrick, for it was all he had. The day of the sale I met Mr. Rourke in Johnstown at the depot. I asked him if he had money enough to pay on it. He said he thought he had. I said if he didn\u2019t have enough, I would walk up the railroad to where I could get enough to pay on it, to - buy it. He said, \u201cNever mind, I have enough.\u201d I told him I wanted it in hands so that when Patrick would pay all that was against it, he should get his property. He then said, that was all right, when Patrick would pay him what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>against, or lie had against him, he (Rourke) would give him,, Patrick McCall, back his property. This was all said in presence of three of us, <em>viz., </em>John Rourke, Michael McCall, and myself.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">\u201cMichael McCall testifies: 'John Rourke and Philip McCall agreed to buy the property in for Patrick McCall. John Rourke bought the property. Philip McCall did the bidding. John Rourke agreed that he would give the property back to. Patrick McCall when he, Patrick McCall, came back and wrould pay him (Rourke) the money he had paid on it. Philip -McCall asked Rourke if he had money enough to buy the property in, saying if he had not, he (Philip McCall) would get it from Joseph Wiss. John Rourke told him, to the best of my recollection, that he had money enough to pay what was against it.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">\u201cNow, this is all the testimony of the plaintiff as to the facts occurring before and at the time of the purchase. And the defendant on oath denies everything alleged so far as any trust is concerned; while in his subsequent letters there is no acknowledgment such as would make him a trustee <em>ex maleficio. </em>Wo can find nothing in the testimony to impeach the defendant with fraud or bad faith in securing the legal title. He only met the agent twice, and each time the agent sought him, and not he tiie agent. The first time, agent tells him he has received a letter from the plaintiff and suggests a sale and purchase of the property for the plaintiff, or a payment of the judgment. The defendant suggests a sale, the only thing authorized in the letter of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">\u201cThe second meeting was on the day of sale, and he asks defendant if he has money enough to purchase. The defendant tells bim he has, will transfer it to plaintiff when he is paid, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">\u201cNow, in all the plaintiff\u2019s testimony it nowhere appears that Rourke sought by any unfair means the title to this property. No doubt his main purpose was to secure his own $125, and that he then intended to reconvey to plaintiff. But the question is, Bid he obtain the title by fraudulent means, such as to make a trustee <em>ex maleficio? </em>There is no evidence that he obtained the confidence of the plaintiff or of his agent by undue means, the approach being on the other side. Nor is there a scintilla of evidence that he, or anyone else in his interest, sought to depreciate the price of the property in order to ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>quire the title at less than its value. In short the sheriff\u2019s sale seems to be as fair as such sales usually are. And the mere fact that the property sold at less than its cash value would not, \u25a0of itself, aid in creating a trust; and what else have we ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">\u201cThe admissions of a defendant are always evidence against him; the only admissions claimed here are in alleged letters of defendant. Yet it is most unfortunate that some of the letters .are lost, and parol testimony sandwiched between them. Nay, worse than that, portions of letters are lost, or not produced, and we are left to infer the balance of the letter from the portion produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">\u201cPhilip McCall testifies, in his testimony in chief: \u2018In writing to Patrick I wrote him that property had been sold and to John Rourke \u2014 not a word about a trust.\u2019 And Patrick McCall \u00a1testifies: \u2018Philip wrote to me after the sale and told me who</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">bought the property.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">\u201cThen comes this remarkable letter from Patrick McCall to Philip McCall:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">\u201cHartford, March 25, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">\u201cDear Brother:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-10\">\u201cI write to you those fiew lines in return for yours of Mrc. 7, and I am glad to reed of Rourke getting the house iff there is anything to bee maid on it let him have it in welcome and as for the receipts I wrote to Junction two weeks ago to the postmaster I sent money from there twist sow iff they are any good to you I will get them all for you and send them to in your next letter let me know how much the house went for and hoe all bid on it and was it cash down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">\u201cApril 12, he again writes:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-12\">\u25a0\u201cDear Friend John:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-13\">\u201cI received your letter, etc.; and after speaking of the Owen McCall receipts he proceeds to say: \u2018I am well satisfied you have bought the house &amp; keep it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-14\">\u201cNow these letters were directly after the sale to Rourke. Ten days after the second one Rourke writes and speaks of McCall\u2019s receipts, and the payment for the property by himself; but not one word relating to a trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-15\">\u201cThen follow letters or statements, one of which is admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ted to be only a portion of a letter \u2014 the other upon its face is clearly so. The production of a portion of a letter, without the whole, if receivable at all as evidence, is of a very suspicious character. The produced portion commences, 'Now I tel.l you what I will do;\u2019 what went before this is left to conjecture. In this paper Rourke states that he will take $275 for the house and half the lot, but it contains no reference to any trust or promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">\u201cThe next portion of letter from Rourke says: 'I would like to have it settled on the 15th of April; if you wish to redeem it, you can have it. I have neither heart nor eye for it; I would wish you to be as smart as you can and get all things settled.\u2019 The first part of this letter is not produced, and what we have of it shows no evidence of a trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">\u201cTwo years after the sale Patrick McCall returns, pays $100 to Rourke on the repurchase or redemption of the property; and, some time after, receives the same money back; and finally, some four years after the purchase by Rourke, the amount originally demanded is offered and refused by Rourke. Then counsel seems to have been consulted by both parties, and we have the case here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">\u201cNow, it is fairly presumable that the first object of the defendant, in making the purchase, was to secure his own debt; and it is equally probable that he intended to reconvey to the plaintiff as soon as he should be indemnified. The evidence would show that he got the property at half its value, and that since the purchase the property has doubled in value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">\u201cThe statute of frauds and perjuries, including the act of 1856, has been and must be sustained in all its force and integrity by courts of justice.

Whitman, 83 Pa. 244; Wolford v. Herrington, 86 Pa. 39; and Cowperthwaite v. First Nat.

Whitman, the facts never reached the jury. The judgment was taken for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The defendant testified in her affidavit of defense that she had been ensnared into signing a mortgage which she would not have signed but for a parol promise of plaintiff, as to its terms, which he afterwards fraudulently repudiated. The court below rendered judgment against her for want of a sufficient affidavit This the supreme court reversed;. and if, on the new trial awarded her, evidence shall be \u2018clear, explicit, and unequivocal\u2019 as to the facts, she will of course prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">\u201cIn Wolford v. Herrington the action was brought by husband and wife in right of the wife, Rachael Wolford. She had a friend who would take the title and wait a year. Herrington interposed and offered to secure the property in writing and give her two years. The writing was drawn by his order. He was asked at the sale to sign it; he said: \u2018Wait till I bid it off, and then I will sign it\u2019 When again asked to sign it he said: \u2018Wait till I get my deed \u2014 then I will sign it.\u2019 He afterwards refused. The court held this such a fraud as created a trust <em>ex maleficio.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">\u201cIn Cowperthwaite v. First Nat Bank the case was tried upon an offer of testimony. The defendant proposed to show that she claimed a bona fide interest in the property; that the plaintiff\u2019s agent sought her and proposed to bid it off for her, to which she assented; that he induced others to refrain from bidding, whereby the title was secured to plaintiff at an enor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>mous sacrifice. The court held this to be a fraud upon the defendant, and created a trust <em>ex maleficio </em>in her favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">\u201cNow, these cases are all quite different from the one before \u25a0us, and do not impinge on the general rule.

An oral agreement to purchase for another at a bona fide sheriff\u2019s sale will not of itself raise-a trust of any kind. Fraud at the time of the sale, or the payment of the purchase money, is necessary in order to toll the statute (the statute of 1856), neither of which appears to be alleged in the bill. The utmost that can be inferred from its language is that Bourke agreed to purchase the property fo-r McCall, and afterwards refused to perform. This, however, on all authority is insufficient to create a resulting trust. As for the facts of the case, they have been so well disposed of in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the opinion of the learned judge of the court below as to render further comment by us unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
