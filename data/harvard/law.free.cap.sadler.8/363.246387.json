This is tbe question, then, which you are to determine \u2014 whether or not this judgment has been paid. If it has not been paid, your verdict should be in favor of tbe plaintiff for tbe amount of tbe judgment, after allowing such credits as the defendant may be entitled to, and allowing tbe plaintiff, also, interest on tbe balance of bis claim up to tbe present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">For tbe purpose of showing tbat tbe judgment has not been paid, tbe plaintiff relies upon certain facts or circumstances which bave been disclosed by tbe evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">It seems tbat on the 28th of July, 1853, an article of agreement was entered into between Joseph Anderson and Henry J. Portser, by which Anderson agreed to convey bis interest in a saw mill and stave machine to Portser for tbe consideration, if we remember rightly, of $1,300. In payment of this consideration Portser conveyed to Anderson a lot or bouse and lot in Saltsburg, estimated and valued by tbe parties at $700. That-left $600 of tbe consideration money unpaid, and for tbe purpose of securing this $600 Portser executed and delivered to Anderson three single bills, each calling for $200, one of them payable in 1854, tbe other -in 1855, and the third in 1856. Under warrants of attorney in these single bills to confess judgment, judgments were entered upon tbe records of this county on the 20th of August, 1853, tbe judgments having been entered upon each of tbe three single bills. Mr. Anderson receipted to Portser, on tbe article of agreement, for tbe conveyance of the lot, estimated at $700, and also for the three several judgment notes to which we bave just alluded. Thus tbe matter stood between tbe parties, from July, 1853, to February 2, 1857. On tbat day Mr. Anderson receipted to Portser for the sum of $69.45 upon this article (tbe receipt is written upon tbe article itself); and upon tbe same day, to wit: February 2, 1857, Anderson conveyed bis interest in tbe article to James R. Daugherty, who is tbe equitable plaintiff in this suit. Now it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>is contended by tbe plaintiff that the receipt upon the article shows a payment by Portser to Anderson for the consideration money mentioned in that agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">It does not seem to be disputed that the judgment notes which were entered in court here represent the purchase money described in the article of agreement, bearing date the 28th of July, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">It is contended then by the plaintiff that there was a payment by Portser on February 2, 1857, upon his indebtedness to Anderson which indebtedness was the purchase money of the property sold under this article of agreement. If that be so, and the evidence seems to confirm it, then the period of twenty years has not elapsed since the payment of that $69.45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">When a debt is evidenced by an 'instrument under seal, or is in the shape of a judgment, there is no statute of limitations that \u00e1pplies to it. The owner of the claim may bring his suit or institute proceedings for its collection at any time; but the law does raise a presumption after the lapse of twenty years that such debt has been paid, and if the twenty years have expired, the <em>onus </em>of showing non-payment is upon the party seeking to collect the claim; but if that party shows a recognition or acknowledgement of the judgment as a subsisting obligation, or if he shows a payment upon it by the party indebted, within twenty years, then that would be sufficient to remove any presumption against him, and would cast the burden of showing payment upon the other side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">In this case nineteen years and some six months have elapsed since this credit of $69.45 was placed upon the article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">The presumption, therefore, does not arise ;\u25a0 but the time, the twenty years, having nearly expired, it becomes weakened, as such presumptions always do, in proportion to the length of time that has elapsed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">It is contended by the defendant that this payment of $69.45, ought not to be considered as having been made upon the judgment in suit. It seems that many years afterwards, in 1877, this credit was applied to judgment 195 or 196. Which was that?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\">(Counsel for defendant: 196, the preceding one, the first one, due Aug. 1, 1854.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">And it is contended that, inasmuch as it was applied to the previous judgment entered to number 196, it ought not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>regarded as a credit or payment upon the judgment now in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">They allege that the payment would naturally and legally be applied to the indebtedness first falling due, and that it was the judgment entered to No. 196. But by reference to the article, it would appear that this $69.4:5 was paid upon the article; it does not appear to have been applied to any particular judgment. The evidence discloses the fact that the parties were residing in the village of Saltsburg at the time that this credit was entered, in 1857; the single bills had been brought to Indiana and judgments entered upon them upon the record so that they did not, at the moment that the credit was entered, have access to the record; and the receipt would seem, consequently, to have been taken upon the article itself. But as there- is no other indebtedness to which the receipt could be applied than the balance of the purchase money due from Portser to Anderson, it would naturally be regarded as a payment upon that indebtedness. The application of the amount to-the first judgment entered was made under circumstances which would not estop the plaintiff from showing that it was a payment upon the general indebtedness. Mr. 'William S. Daugherty, who made the entries, says that he had no particular directions from his father as to where that credit should be applied; that he applied the $69 to that judgment, and some other items of work with which the defendant was credited, to the other judgments; so that we think this evidence is sufficient to justify and warrant the\u2019 court in submitting the question t-o the jury, as to the payment of this judgment. It was recognition, such a recognition or acknowledgment of an existing indebtedness within the period of twenty years, by the defendant, as entitles the case to go to the jury. But whether the plaintiff can recover or not, must depend upon a consideration of all the evidence and facts and circumstances in the case. More than nineteen years and a half have elapsed since that payment was made; and as we have already remarked to you, while the presumption of nonpayment still continues in favor of the plaintiff, yet it grows weaker in proportion as the time has elapsed. If the jury are satisfied from all the evidence in the case that the debt has been paid, then it would be your duty to find in favor of the defendant, although the twenty years had not expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">The plaintiff contends that it ought not to be regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>paid; first, because the twenty years have not expired; and second, because the defendant was not in embarrassed circumstances, and that it was difficult, if not impossible, to collect debts from him. If this be so, it would be a proper circumstance for the consideration of the jury in determining the question whether the judgment had been paid or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-3\">Upon the other hand the defendant contends that the plaintiff was in embarrassed circumstances, and that he, defendant, at least for a great- many years, was able to pay all his debts; that judgments were entered up against him here and executions issued; but the debts for which they were issued were finally paid. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-4\">This is about all that we deem it necessary to say to you with respect to this case. It is a question, under the evidence, for the determination of the jury. You will take it all into your consideration and say whether this judgment has been paid or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The defendant presented, <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">1. If the jury believe that the plaintiff applied the $69.45 receipt on the article February 2, 1857, to the judgment No. 196, June term, 1853, maturing August 1, 1854, and receipted or credited it on the docket to that judgment, he cannot- now apply it to the payment of No. 197, June term, 1853, on which this scire facias was issued, so as t-o affect the presumption of payment after the lapse of twenty years from the maturity of the latter judgment, and if the jury find that the plaintiff so applied on the docket that receipt for $69.45, their verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\"><em>Ans. </em>\u201cThe application of the credit of $69.45 to judgment No. 196, June term, 1853, at the time and under the circumstances stated in the testimony of William S. Daugherty, would not affect the presumption adversely to plaintiff, or jprevent a recovery of this sum, when it was receipted on the second of February, 1857, and was designed by the parties as a payment upon the whole amount of purchase money mentioned in the written agreement in which the receipt is entered.\u201d (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">4. That a plea of set-off will lie on the trial of a scire facias to revive a judgment, and defendant, under such plea, may give in evidence accounts and cross demands he may individual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ly have against the plaintiff issuing the scire facias, and under such plea the jury may return a verdict for a balance against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\"><em>Ans. </em>\u201cThis point, in so far as applicable to this case, is refused ; any counterclaim defendant may have against Daugherty, as well as the relations of the parties, at one time as partners, would be proper subjects for the consideration of the jury in determining whether the judgment was paid; but such counterclaims cannot, in this proceeding, be made available to the defendant as ground for the recovery of a balance in his favor.\u201d (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">Plaintiff offered in evidence the article between Joseph Anderson and IT. J. Portser dated July 28, 1853, and the receipt on this article from Joseph Anderson, to TL J. Portser for $69.45, balance on book account, dated February 2, 1857, for the purpose of rebutting the presumption of payment. This was objected to because the receipt purporting to be dated in February, 1857, has not been proven in such a way as to make it relevant in the issue trying. Further, this receipt for $69.45 having been appropriated and applied by the plaintiff as a credit on the record of another judgment, No. 196, June term, 1853, cannot be used now to affect the judgment No. 197 in inquiry. The plaintiff having used that credit on judgment 196, June term, 1853, is estopped from applying it now to the judgment in question, or any other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">By the court: \u201cWe will receive this offer for the present, reserving its effect.\u201d (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">Plaintiff offered on evidence the deposition, taken on commission and interrogatories to Marshall county, state of Indiana, of J. D. McClaran.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-9\">The deposition contained, <em>inter alia, </em>the following interrogatories :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-10\">3.

State whether the assignment was written by yourself, and witnessed by you, whether it was done on the second day of February, 1857, the day it bears date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">The answers to these interrogatories were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">8. To the third interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff, he answers as follows: Yes, I hare seen the original article ot</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">agreement between Joseph Anderson and H. J. Portser, bearing-date July 28, 1853, on which there is a receipt signed by Joseph Anderson for $69.45, bearing date February 2, 1857, and also an assignment of the article in my handwriting, by said Anderson to James R. Daugherty, the execution of which assignment was witnessed by me. From an inspection of the article, I learn that the assignment bears the same date the said receipt bears. I saw the said article with the receipt and assignment written thereon, within the last two months, and now have a copy before me of it, with receipt and assignment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">4. To the fourth interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff,' he answers as follows: My best recollection is, after refreshing my memory by an inspection of the original article, that I was present in the office of James R. Daugherty, Esq., in the borough of Saltsburg, in Indiana county, Pennsylvania, when he wrote the receipt for $69.45 on the article, and that-Joseph Anderson and Henry J. Portser were both present in said office while said Daugherty was writing the receipt, and that Henry J. Portser remained present in said office until after Anderson signed the receipt, and that Daugherty, Anderson, and Portser, all remained in said office while I wrote the assignment of the article of agreement from said Anderson to said Daugherty, and' while Anderson- signed the assignment, and I witnessed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-9\">6. To the sixth interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff, he answers as follows: Yes, the assignment of the article of agreement from Anderson to Daugherty was written and witnessed by,me, and if I made no mistake in the day of the month at the time, the assignment was written and signed and witnessed by me on the 2d.day of February, 1857. I have no recollection of the dates, except what I gather from an inspection of the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-10\">paper itself. I recollect that the receipt and assignment were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>both written and signed on the same day, but whether that day was the 2d day of February, 1857, I have no recollection aside from the papers, but I believe they were both written and signed on the day they bear date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">Defendant filed the following exceptions to the deposition:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">1. The testimony appears to have been filed November 21, 1884, at which time there vrere no seals attached to the certificates of the notary public, who appears to have taken the testimony. The testimony appears to have been taken from the office and sent to the notary, and 'is again' filed in the office, November 28, 1884, in a different shape from what it was November 21, 1884 \u2014 so far as seals, at least, are concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">2. The questions asked the witness were too leading in form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\"><em>3. </em>The witness seems to have had a paper before him, shown him by the plaintiff to testify about, at the time he gave his testimony. This was improper, as the only legal method of executing a commission is for the witness to answer the written questions without any interference from either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">4.

The mere belief of a witness as to when certain writings were made, is not proper evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-10\">6. The testimony of the witness about the paper is that he has no recollection of dates except what he gets from the papers themselves \u2014 this not proper evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-11\">7.

Banks </em>and <em>Samuel Guwmng'ham, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQZ\">The credit of $69.45, entered on'the Anderson and Portser agreement, February 2, 1857, was a general credit on the balance of the unpaid money, secured by the three judgments, one of which is the judgment now in controversy. The credit applied as well to this'judgment as to either of the others, and was a recognition of the whole debt for which these judgments were given as security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">The exceptions to the deposition were taken on the trial of the case, after the jury had been sworn, when the deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>was offered in evidence. It was then too late to make objection to the form of the question asked the witness. Notice of the filing of the interrogatories was given the plaintiff in error before they were sent to the commissioner. He had an opportunity to file cross interrogatories or except to those filed; he cannot now complain that the interrogatories were not in proper form ; when he made no objection to them until on the trial of the case.

Gould, 57 Pa. 157, where exception was taken to the rejection of several claims against the plaintiff, offered as a set-off, the court says: \u201cHpon their face they all appeared to be barred by the- statute of limitations, and there was no offer to accompany them with proof that the statute did not bar them. They were, therefore, properly rejected.\u201d See also King v. Coulter, 2 Grant (Pa.) 81; Jacks v. Moore, 1 Yeates, 391, and Milne\u2019s Appeal, 11 W. N.

This question was left to the jury under proper instructions. The sum of $69.15 was paid on account of the articles of agreement and, as an acknowledgment of an indebtedness then existing, was applicable to the entire debt. We-are unable to see any error in the admission of the deposition, of J. D. McClaran, or in the rulings of the learned judge upon the question of set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
