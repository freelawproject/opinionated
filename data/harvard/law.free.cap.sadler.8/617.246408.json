Keim et al., Receivers, etc.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-6\">In an action by a locomotive engineer against a railroad company, for personal injuries due to a collision, it appeared that the accident occurred at H station, where a double-track road ended and a single-track extension began. About a mile south of H on the double-track road there was a crossover switch running from the north-bound to the south-bound track. Plaintiff was engineer of passenger train No. 10 going north. In clear weather it was customary, when there were freight trains detained on the north-bound track between the switch and the station, for signals to be given by whistles from the forward engine at H to the rear engine near the switch, and if the south-bound track was clear, No. 10 would move on to it, pass by the freight trains and proceed on its way on the single-track extension. In foggy weather the forward engine near H would act as a pilot engine, running down on the south-bound track to the switch, while the conductor of the forward freight train would remain at H to signal any train coming south on the single-track extension. When the pilot engine passed beyond the switch, No. 10 would move on to the south-bound track. The morning when the accident occurred was extremely foggy. Engine No. 287 going north was stopped at H and behind it several coal trains. The operator at H telegraphed this to the dispatcher who replied that \u201cNo. 287 should arrange to get No. 10 around.\u201d No. 287 was accordingly run on to the south-bound track and moved down towards the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>oross-over switch. In the meantime No. 10 had arrived at the switch and slowed up. The conductor of the rear coal train, who was at the switch, signaled No. 10 to come on. Plaintiff accordingly ran No. 10 on to the south-bound track and increased his speed to 15 or 20 miles an hour in spite of the fog. Immediately afterwards his train collided with No. 287 and he was severely injured. The rules of the company prohibited running on the south-bound track and also required proper signals to be sent forward in case of detention. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in entering a compulsory nonsuit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Note. \u2014 See the following editorial notes containing a full presentation of the authorities: Contributory negligence in entering or remaining in an employment, note to Limberg v.

Hazard station was situated on this division. November 11, 1885, Charles Wert, the plaintiff, was an engineer upon a passenger train known as No. 10, which leftEaston at 7: 15 a. m. A double track extended from Easton to Hazard station 37% miles, but from Hazard station to Maueh Chunk, 11 miles, there was only a single track. At the north end of the double track was Hazard station. About a mile south of the station toward Easton there was a cross-over switch from the north-bound track to the south-bound track. The track between the station and the cross switch was straight It sometimes happened that freight trains being delayed at Hazard would fill up the north track from the station to the cross-over switch. In such a case when passenger train No-. 10 arrived at the cross-over switch, the conductor and engineer of the train farthest north would guard the north end of the double track by a flag1 so as to keep the south-bound trains out of the way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>.\u25a0and when the weather ww clear, so that men could see from the station to the cross-over switch, the engine of the forward train would sound five whistles and they would be repeated by the engine of each train standing on the north track, and the \u2022conductor of the most southerly train would then give the signal for the switch to be opened and for No. 10 to go on. On a foggy morning, or whenever the track could not be seen from the switch to the station, the engine of the first train to the north would run down as a pilot engine on the south track below the switch, the conductor of the northern-most train remaining at the end of the double track to flag any train coming south. When the pilot engine got beyond the cross-over switch, the signal was then given, and No. 10 would move on to the .south-bound track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\">The morning of November 14, 1885, was extremely foggy. 'The plaintiff and other witnesses testified that the fog was so \u2022dense that it was impossible to see further than the length of a passenger train \u2014 an engine and four cars. Before he reached the cross-over switch, engine No. 287 (called an extra) was .stopped at the end of the double track, as several sections of No. 69 coal were coming south. Behind this train were two sections of No. 54 freight, also stopped from the same cause. The \u2022operator at Hazard, having telegraphed the train dispatcher atMauch Chunk, that train 287 was stopped, then received a tele,gram that \u201cengine 287 should arrange to get No. 10 around.\u201d He at once informed Daniel Raub, the conductor of the train, \u2022of the order, and he directed Daniel Moyer, the engineer of 287, to run down to the cross-over switch to pilot No. 10, and Raub himself took the flag and went up the track with the flag, while engine 287 ran from the north to the south track at the \u2022end of the double track and backed down toward the cross-over switch at the speed of 3 or 4 miles an hour until it met and \u2022collided with No. 10 and the plaintiff was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\">The plaintiff testified that when he came to the cross-over switch he shut off steam and ran slow, but when he was given the signal by a man whom he recognized as Transue, the conductor of the rear coal train, he turned on steam and proceeded \u2022on to the south track at the rate of 15 or 20 miles an hour. He was asked whether the printed rules of the company did not prohibit him from running on the south-bound track. To this \u2022question he answered \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>Q; </em>In the face of this rule, you could, not have passed to the south-bound track, could you ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-4\"><em>A. </em>No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-5\"><em>Q. </em>By what authority did you get over there?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-6\">A.

He said, yes; but further testified that if he had been running 4 or 5 miles an hour, he could have stopped his-train in the length of the train.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-8\">Rule 54 of the company was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-9\">\u201cThe conductor is held responsible to see that his flagman-goes back promptly, and both he and the engineer are responsible for sendiug out proper signals in front when the detention, or obstruction makes it necessary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-10\">Rule 60 was: \u201cRemember in all cases of doubt or uncertainty, take the safe course and run no risks.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-11\">Transue testified: \u201cNo. 10 was due when I opened the-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-12\">switch, and I knew by the schedule the track was clear; I knew nothing of special orders to send a pilot engine down that morning. I supposed it perfectly safe for No. 10 to go up that morning as she had done many times before. This was the custom and that custom imposed upon me the duty of opening the-switch.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-13\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-14\">The assignments of error specified the action of the court in. entering a nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-15\"><em>Wm.
