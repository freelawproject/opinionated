The evidence on both sides shows that the plaintiffs are large and frequent shippers over the defendant\u2019s road. They are shippers to such an extent that they keep blanks on baud of the bills of lading and of what they call \u201cdray tickets,\u201d that they fill up and send to the freight office when they have a shipment to make over that road. The plaintiffs knew that the road of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company terminated at Baltimore, so far as its route to Charleston was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>cerned, and that the goods had to be shipped from there by way of some other road or by vessel. There is no dispute that the contract was that if the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company should deliver the goods in good order at its terminus to the proper carrier for Charleston, then its liability ceased. If accident occurred to them from negligence of the shipper beyond Baltimore, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company would not be responsible to the plaintiffs, but the water transportation company would. That is in the written contract, and there is no cavil in regard to that part of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-4\">Plaintiffs claim, however, that the defendant did not deliver to the right carrier at Baltimore for further shipment to Charleston, and they say that on the day of the shipment (perhaps the day before) they telephoned to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. Railroad Company\u2019s freight office to get an all rail rate to Charleston, and they got an answer of 90 cents. We admitted the testimony because we think that the business of communication by telephone is so well and plainly recognized among business men in this city and in the cities of the country generally that contracts made in that way must be recognized. We think also that if the plaintiffs communicated with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company\u2019s freight office, asking a question and got an answer, the presumptions are it was given by some officer authorized to make it., Mr. Myers said that he had a conversation over the telephone with an officer of the defendant company in which an all rail rate was given. The officers of the Baltimore <em>&amp; </em>Ohio Railroad Company deny that there was any such contract, and say they were simply asked for a rate. If it stood on that alone we would leave it to the jury to say whether or not such a contract was made, that the shipment was to be by all rail, but the testimony on both sides shows that the plaintiffs kept a blank of this kind of the defendant\u2019s (shows dray ticket in evidence), and when they came to ship the bitters they filled up two of these blanks which corresponded, one of them to be signed by the receiving officer at the freight depot and returned to plaintiffs, and the other to be kept by the railroad company. That blank was filled up in the office of Hostetter &amp; Company, not by the railroad company, and it was a receipt for 50 boxes of bitters for Charleston, S. 0.r H. Clatter &amp; Brother, with this provision: \u201cIt is agreed and it shall be transported only on the conditions named in the company\u2019s regular bill of lading.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The bill of lading was filled in by Hostetter &amp; Company and sent there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">Now, under the course of business as testified to on both sides and not in dispute at all, this makes the contract between the parties. If it was to be an all rail route or to be something different from the ordinary bill of lading it should have been on the dray receipt plaintiffs sent up to the depot, and especially when the business that they claim was transacted was by telephone. Even if it had been understood distinctly that the freight was to go by an all rail route I take it that the sending of this ticket without any designation of that kind on it would be a revocation, and it was to go in the ordinary way. So I instruct you that under all the evidence there is not sufficient to make an agreement on the part of the railroad company that these bitters were to go by an all rail route. The action of the plaintiffs afterwards in sending the goods up with the bill of lading and the dray receipts made out to be shipped in the ordinary way is to be taken as the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">This bill of lading, as I understand it and as I instruct you, gives the defendant the option of shipping by any proper, reasonable route from its terminus to Charleston. Plaintiffs say, and defendant also, that the usual route has been to ship by water from Baltimore. Defendant says that the rate fixed was the rail and water rate, and not an all rail rate. I instruct you that if the defendant delivered at Baltimore the goods of the plaintiffs to a responsible carrier by steamer for Charleston, in the way it was accustomed to ship, that is the end of its liability under this contract. The testimony of the last witness who was called, who states he was the transfer shipping clerk at Baltimore, is that he attended to the shipping of these goods, and that they were shipped in good order a few days after the date of their receipt at Pittsburgh, on a certain steamer of the general line of transportation. If that was done that is the end of the defendant\u2019s liability. There is no evidence to contradict that testimony, and I do not see any reason why you should not believe it. If you do believe it, your verdict should be for the defendant. If the plaintiffs have a claim against anybody, it \u00cd3 against the steamboat company running between Baltimore and Charleston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">To which charge counsel for plaintiffs excepts and therefore bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The \u201cdray ticket\u201d in question was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\">Baltimore &amp; Ohio Kailroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">Pittsburgh, Pa., Jan. 21, 1885.
