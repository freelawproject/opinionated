Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.), governs quasi-judicial proceedings, that is, it prescribes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>standards for adjudicatory proceedings undertaken by a governmental agency. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11501, subd. (b).) These include, for example, a written accusation or statement of issues, notice of right to a hearing, testimony under oath, cross-examination, and a written decision. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11503, 11504, 11505, 11509, 11511, 11513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">A different part of the APA, Government Code, title 2, division 3, part 1, chapter 3.5, commencing with section 11340 of the Government Code, governs the rulemaking process of a state agency, that is, it prescribes the \u201cminimum procedural requirements\u201d for adopting substantive regulations to carry out the agency\u2019s statutory authority. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11346.) These include, for example, notice to the public and affected business and industry groups of the proposed regulations, opportunity for oral and written presentations by the public and any interested persons or entities, and notice of the date and time of the proceeding at which the proposed regulations will be considered. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11346.2-11346.9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In this case, the question is whether the reference to the adjudicatory provisions of the APA in section 47605.8 was intentional or erroneous. The State Board of Education (the Board), and amicus curiae California Charter Schools Association contend the reference was a drafting error. They argue that, in directing the Board to \u201cimplement\u201d the statute, the Legislature intended to refer to the provisions of the APA governing the rulemaking process. The California School Boards Association and others argue \u2014 and the trial court agreed \u2014 that the statutory language is plain and can be neither rewritten nor disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We agree with the Board for three reasons: First, the statute in question governs the approval or denial of a charter school application, which is a quasi-legislative function \u2014 requiring consideration of policy questions and the opportunity for public input \u2014 and therefore is fundamentally at odds with the adjudicatory procedures mandated by Government Code section 11500 et seq. Second, legislative directives to adopt regulations for the implementation of a statute invariably call for a rulemaking process pursuant to Government Code section 11340 et seq.; the reference to the APA\u2019s adjudicatory provisions in section 47605.8 is therefore a complete anomaly. Third, the use of an adjudicatory proceeding to approve or deny state charters pursuant to section 47605.8 would be inconsistent with all other like provisions in the Charter Schools Act of 1992 (\u00a7 47600 et seq.), none of which entails quasi-judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND*</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">A. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">For clarity in the published portion of the opinion, we restate here the relevant provisions of section 47605.8: \u201c(a) A petition for the operation of a state charter school may be submitted directly to the state board, and the state board shall have the authority to approve a charter for the operation of a state charter school that may operate at multiple sites throughout the state. The State Board of Education shall adopt regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) for the implementation of this section. Regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall ensure that a charter school approved pursuant to this section meets all requirements otherwise imposed on charter schools pursuant to this part, except that a state charter school approved pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the geographic and site limitations otherwise imposed on charter schools. . . . [\u00b6] (b) The state board shall not approve a petition for the operation of a state charter school pursuant to this section unless the state board makes a finding, based on substantial evidence, that the proposed state charter school will provide instructional services of statewide benefit that cannot be provided by a charter school operating in only one school district, or only in one county. The finding of the state board in this regard shall be made part of the public record of the proceedings of the state board and shall precede the approval of the charter. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (d) The state board shall not be required to approve a petition for the operation of a state charter school, and may deny approval based on any of the reasons set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 47605.6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">B. <em>Is Petitioners\u2019 APA Claim Outside the Pleadings?</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">C. <em>The Merits of Petitioners\u2019 APA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">As we have stated, the question posed is whether the reference to Government Code section 11500 et seq. in the statute was intended by the Legislature or was a scrivener\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>1. <em>The Plain Language of the Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Petitioners\u2019 first-line argument is that the statute means what it says, and its plain meaning cannot be rewritten or ignored by the courts. We, however, disagree with petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Section 47605.8, subdivision (a), provides that the Board \u201cshall adopt regulations, <em>pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section </em>11500). . . <em>of the Government Code) </em>for the implementation of this section.\u201d (Italics added.) Taken literally, these words mean that the Board must adopt regulations using the adjudicatory procedures of the APA. As the Board has argued, this makes no sense. An agency does not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 promulgate administrative regulations using an evidentiary healing process. Regulations must be adopted under the rulemaking procedures of the APA. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Petitioners argue, however, that the statute should be read to mean that the Board must adopt regulations pursuant to the rulemaking process, but the content of the regulations must be quasi-judicial. This interpretation is clearly at odds with the meaning of the phrase \u201cadopt regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d utilized in virtually every other statute \u2014 a phrase which describes not the content of the regulations, but the process for their adoption. (See pt. II.B.4., <em>post.) </em>But even if the statute could be so construed, we conclude this was not what the Legislature intended for the reasons we discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">2. <em>The Approval of a Charter for a School Is a Quasi-legislative Function</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Petitioners argue that the Legislature intended the approval of a state charter (as distinct from local charters) to be a quasi-judicial act, this by virtue of (1) the reference to Government Code section 11500 et seq. in Education Code section 47605.8, and (2) the requirements in the statute that the Board\u2019s decision be supported by \u201cfindings,\u201d based on \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which must be included in the public record of the Board\u2019s proceedings. Petitioners say these factors are \u201chighly suggestive\u201d of a quasi-judicial determination. And, petitioners conclude, because a quasi-judicial determination is one which \u201cinvolves the application of the general statutory criteria to a specific applicant, as well as a required showing of factual support for [the Board\u2019s] ultimate determination,\u201d the approval or denial of a state charter application is a quasi-judicial exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Petitioners\u2019 theory does not persuade us, as it rests on a superficial reading of the statute and ignores both the statutory context and large swaths of precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>We begin with the established principle that the creation and alteration of municipalities and local districts are fundamentally legislative functions. (See, e.g., <em>City of Santa Cruz v. Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 381, 387 [142 Cal.Rptr. 873] <em>(City of Santa </em>Cruz) [\u201cIt has long been held that when a local agency determines the boundaries of a city or whether territory should be annexed to such an entity, it is acting in a quasi-legislative capacity.\u201d (italics omitted)]; <em>Sierra Club v. San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 489, 495 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 981 P.2d 543] [decision whether to approve the annexation of land by city is quasi-legislative]; <em>Wilson v. Hidden Valley Mun. Water Dist. </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 271, 278 [63 Cal.Rptr. 889] <em>(Wilson) </em>[decision whether to exclude a petitioner\u2019s property from a water district and allow it to be annexed to a different water district was a quasi-legislative act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Since the late 19th century, the creation of or alteration to a school district has been recognized as a legislative or quasi-legislative act. \u201cThe power to change the boundaries of the [school] district, as well as to define them in the first instance, is of legislative origin, and, whether exercised immediately by the legislature or mediately by a board of supervisors \u2014 the local legislature-is, whenever exercised, a legislative act.\u201d <em>(Hughes </em>v. <em>Ewing </em>(1892) 93 Cal. 414, 417 [28 P. 1067]; accord, <em>Antelope Val. U. H. S. Dist. v. McClellan </em>(1921) 55 Cal.App. 244, 247 [203 P. 147]; see <em>Worthington S. Dist. v. Eureka S. Dist. </em>(1916) 173 Cal. 154, 156 [159 P. 437] [the Legislature holds plenary power over school districts, and it may delegate to boards of supervisors, under certain conditions, powers of annexation]; <em>Fullerton Joint Union High School Dist. v. State Bd. of Education </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 779, 786, fn. 3 [187 Cal.Rptr. 398, 654 P.2d 168] (plur. opn. of Broussard, L), disapproved on another ground in <em>Board of Supervisors v. Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 903, 917-922 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 838 P.2d 1198] [\u201cSubject only to constitutional limitations, the Legislature has plenary power over the formation, dissolution or change of boundaries of school districts.\u201d]; <em>City of South Gate v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1416, 1421 [229 Cal.Rptr. 568] [district\u2019s boundary adjustment between high schools was quasi-legislative].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">A charter school is \u201cdeemed to be a \u2018school district\u2019 \u201d for purposes of statutory and constitutional funding allocations. (\u00a7 47612, subd. (c).) Consequently, the approval of a charter creates a school district and, like the creation of any other district, is a quasi-legislative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">But we do not rest on this analysis alone. We reach the same result when we approach the issue from a broader perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>3. <em>Quasi-legislative Versus Quasi-judicial Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">\u201cThe courts in the past have devised several general formulations to assist them in differentiating quasi-judicial from quasi-legislative action. One such formulation is as follows: \u2018The one determines what the law is, and what the rights of parties are, with reference to transactions already had; the other prescribes what the law shall be in future cases arising under it.\u2019 [Citations.] Another is that the one determines individual rights, while the other involves the exercise of a discretion governed by considerations of the public welfare. [Citation.] While such formulations may be helpful, they do not provide an answer in every case. The basic inquiry, in our opinion, must be into the nature of <em>th&amp; function </em>performed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at pp. 279-280; see <em>Joint Council of Interns &amp; Residents </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1202, 1209-1210 [258 Cal.Rptr. 762] <em>(Joint Council) </em>[\u201cAt bottom \u2018the distinction between the quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial decision contemplates the function performed rather than the area of performance . . . .\u2019\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">As explained in <em>Wilson, </em>the hallmark of a quasi-legislative decision is that the agency\u2019s determination is informed by public policy, that is, how the decision will affect the interests of the community. In <em>Wilson, </em>a property owner petitioned the water district to exclude her land from the district and allow it to be annexed to another district. \u201cIn passing upon the two petitions the . . . District was not hearing them as a disinterested tribunal deciding merely the question of whether the lands directly and immediately affected . . . [should] be excluded from the District or permitted to be annexed by other local public entities. The board hearing these petitions was the governing board of the District. [Citation.] As such, its dominant concern had to be the effect its actions would have not merely upon the interests of those owning or living upon the land immediately affected by the petitions, but also upon the interests of the people owning or living upon the land within the remainder of the District.\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at p. 280, fn. omitted; see <em>City of Santa Cruz, supra, 16 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 389 [quoting <em>Wilson, </em>a quasi-legislative action \u201c \u2018involves the exercise of a discretion governed by considerations of the public welfare\u2019 \u201d]; <em>20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Garamendi </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 216, 276-277 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 807, 878 P.2d 566] [a decision that involves consideration of factors beyond the mere application of existing rules to existing facts is quasi-legislative].)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Here, the exercise of discretion by the Board in creating \u2014 or not creating \u2014 a state charter school involves consideration of interests beyond those of just the applicant. Indeed, in a different context, petitioners argued as much: \u201cThe approval of a new statewide charter petition potentially impacts the funding and facilities decisions of the local districts in which the charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>schools will be located. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [Statewide charters permit the holder to operate campuses in multiple school districts throughout the state, free from local district governing board oversight. These facts place a premium on public participation in the original review and consideration of the petition, as this may be the only public opportunity to address concerns or request that certain conditions be met before approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Thus, according to petitioners, a decision to approve or deny a state charter should not be limited to a simple application of the law to the facts contained in the charter petition, but should include consideration of the charter\u2019s effects on local school districts and should take into account public concerns regarding the proposed charter and its conditions of approval. This is a quintessentially quasi-legislative action using \u201c \u2018the exercise of a discretion governed by considerations of the public welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 389.) And, the public airing of views that is part and parcel of the Board\u2019s quasi-legislative determination cannot occur in an adjudicatory process contemplated by Government Code section 11500 et seq., which, although open to public view (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.20, subd. (a)), is not open to public comment or participation. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11125.7, subd. (f), 11513, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Petitioners nevertheless maintain that the statute\u2019s directives \u2014 requiring the Board to make a \u201cfinding\u201d based on \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and requiring this finding to be made part of the \u201cpublic record\u201d of the Board\u2019s \u201cproceedings\u201d \u2014 support the proposition that the Legislature intended the Board\u2019s process to be an adjudicatory one. They argue, \u201c[e]ach of the requirements described above are highly suggestive of a quasi-judicial determination, i.e., a determination that \u2018involve[s] the application of rules to specific facts and specific individuals.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">This argument ignores well-settled precedent holding that it is the <em>function </em>and not the process that determines whether an action is judicial or legislative in nature. <em>(20th Century Ins. Co. v. Garamendi, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 275-276.) <em>Wilson </em>provides an early example of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In <em>Wilson, </em>the court held that the water district\u2019s action in denying a request to remove land from the district was quasi-legislative despite the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>that the decision involved hearings and factfinding. The court\u2019s explanation is instructive. \u201c[T]he presence of certain elements usually characteristic of the judicial process [does not] mean that the board\u2019s action was quasi-judicial. In this case the . . . District, in denying petitioners\u2019 requests . . . acted in response to specific petitions, with regard to specific parties and after hearing evidence. In these respects the decisions made by the board and the procedure used in arriving at its decision embodied characteristics of the judicial process. [\u00b6] But these characteristics of the proceedings are not alien to the legislative process. Legislative bodies often act in response to specific petitions and with regard to specific parties. [Citations.] Furthermore, the hearing process is not confined to the courts. The Legislature and administrators exercising quasi-legislative powers commonly resort to the hearing procedure to uncover, at [least] in part, the facts necessary to arrive at a sound and fair legislative decision. [Citations.] Hence the presence of certain characteristics common to the judicial process does not change the basically quasi-legislative nature of the subject proceedings.\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at p. 279, fn. omitted; see <em>City of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at pp. 387-388 [fact that the commission holds public hearings and considers testimony to ascertain facts does not change quasi-legislative nature of action setting municipal boundaries].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The same is true where a \u201cfinding\u201d is required. \u201c[T]he fact that [a statute] required the Board [of Supervisors] to make a \u2018finding\u2019 of cost-effectiveness or feasibility is of no import under the circumstances presented here. Although the statutory obligation to make a \u2018finding\u2019 is a characteristic shared with adjudicatory proceedings, it does not stamp the function with an adjudicative character. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Joint Council, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at p. 1212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Nor does the additional requirement that the Board\u2019s finding be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d (\u00a7 47605.8, subd. (b)) change the analysis. It is not uncommon for this kind of statutory gloss to be applied to the review of quasi-legislative actions. (See, e.g., Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21168.5 [in reviewing an agency\u2019s action for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.), \u201cthe inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence\u201d]; <em>Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 568 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 139, 888 P.2d 1268] [Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21168.5 applies to quasi-legislative actions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Finally, the statute\u2019s requirement that the finding be made part of the \u201cpublic record of the proceedings of the state board\u201d (\u00a7 47605.8, subd. (b)) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>simply echoes the provisions of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11120 et seq.), which prescribes that all state bodies provide public notice of their meetings, publish their agendas, and hold open and public meetings. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11123, 11125, 11125.1.) \u201c[I]t is the intent of the law that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11120.) (7) Read in this context, the statute\u2019s requirement that the Board\u2019s finding be made part of the public record is not \u201chighly suggestive of a quasi-judicial determination.\u201d (See <em>California Radioactive Materials Management Forum </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 841, 858 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 357] [specification in statute that there be a \u201c \u2018hearing on the record\u2019 \u201d is not a term of art referring only to quasi-judicial hearings], disapproved on another ground in <em>Carmel Valley Fire Protection Dist. v. State of California </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 287, 305, fn. 5 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 20 P.3d 533].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In sum, we find no support in the law for petitioners\u2019 position that the Board\u2019s decisionmaking process on a state charter application is a quasi-judicial rather than quasi-legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">4. <em>Petitioners\u2019 Interpretation of the Statute Cannot Be Reconciled with Statutory Schemes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Our conclusion that the Legislature intended to refer to the rulemaking rather than the adjudicatory provisions of the APA in section 47605.8 is also buttressed by the statute\u2019s language and context.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">While the Legislature has the power to require an agency to conduct adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with Government Code section 11500 et seq., and has done so in scores of statutes, it is extremely doubtful it meant to do so here because the plain language of Education Code section 47605.8 shows no such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">In virtually every statute requiring a state agency to conduct adjudicatory proceedings under chapter 5, the Legislature directs the agency to conduct \u201cproceedings\u201d or \u201chearings\u201d or \u201cappeals\u201d \u201cin accordance with\u201d or \u201cpursuant to\u201d Government Code section 11500 et seq.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No such language was included in section 47605.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Conversely, when the Legislature is authorizing or mandating an agency to adopt regulations to implement the provisions of a statute or statutory scheme, it uses language directing a rulemaking process, e.g., \u201c[t]he department shall adopt regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) . . .) to implement this chapter. . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1174.8.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Section 47605.8, however, provides, \u201c[t]he State Board of Education shall adopt regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) ... of the Government Code) for the implementation of this section.\u201d The reference to chapter 5 is thus completely at odds with every other statute in which the Legislature directs the adoption of regulations to implement the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">That this was done in error is not only possible, but has happened before. In 1995, when the APA was amended to add the provisions contained in the current version of Government Code, title 2, division 3, part 1, chapter 4.5, it also made \u201ctechnical, nonsubstantive changes\u201d to various statutes, including former section 232 (now \u00a7 221.1, as amended and renumbered by Stats. 1998, ch. 914, \u00a7 25, p. 6096) of the Education Code. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 523, 5 Stats. 1995 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 405.) That statute had provided, \u201c[t]he State Board . . . shall issue regulations pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) <em>and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) </em>of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedure Act, to implement the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Stats. 1987, ch. 118, \u00a7 1, p. 403, italics added.) The 1995 \u201ccleanup\u201d bill removed the clearly erroneous reference to section 11500 et seq. (Stats. 1995, ch. 938, \u00a7 5, p. 7106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">We observe, additionally, that section 5096.2 of the Business and Professions Code contains the same error, but in reverse. There, the rulemaking provisions of the APA are cited several times in connection with provisions clearly directing an adjudicatory process. For example, it provides: \u201cThe provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act <em>(Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) </em>of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Code), including, but not limited to, the commencement of a disciplinary proceeding by the <em>filing of an accusation </em>by the board, shall apply under this article.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 5096.2, subd. (f), italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">While we have not canvassed all 360-odd volumes of the annotated codes, our focused search revealed no other statute that makes reference to the adjudicatory provisions of the APA in conjunction with a directive to adopt regulations to \u201cimplement\u201d legislation. This leads us to conclude that the reference was not intended by the Legislature but was the result of a drafting error.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Applying a narrower lens, we similarly conclude that a literal reading of the statute would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme of the Charter Schools Act of 1992 (the Act) (\u00a7 47600 et seq.). Pursuant to the Act, a charter school can be created in one of five ways: By application to a school district (\u00a7 47605), by application for a county charter to a county board of education (\u00a7\u00a7 47605.5, 47605.6), by appeal of a denial by a school district to a county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>board of education (\u00a7 47605, subd. (j)(l)), by appeal of a denial by a county board to the Board <em>(ibid.), </em>or by application for a state charter to the Board (\u00a7 47605.8). In each instance, the Act requires that the charter application meet all of the statutory requirements found in section 47605, subdivisions (a) and (b). (\u00a7\u00a7 47605, subd. (j)(l), 47605.8, subd. (a).) Findings are required for the denial of a local charter and for the approval of a state or county charter (\u00a7\u00a7 47605, subds. (b) &amp; (j)(l), 47605.8, subd. (b), 47605.6, subd. (a)(1)), but only section 47605.8 cites to chapter 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">It is not disputed that all decisions on <em>local </em>charter school applications at every level \u2014 district, county and Board \u2014 are quasi-legislative actions, but petitioners urge us to treat the Board\u2019s decision on a state charter school application as an action fundamentally different in nature. Petitioners theorize that the Legislature intended to create an adjudicatory process only for state charter school applications because they are disfavored as compared to local charters. That is, the Board must <em>deny </em>a statewide charter application unless it makes certain findings (\u00a7 47605.8, subd. (b)), while a school district must <em>grant </em>a charter application unless it makes certain findings (\u00a7 47605, subd. (b)). According to petitioners, this \u201cmirror image\u201d presumption in favor of local charters and against state charters supports the notion that the Legislature intended to impose on the Board a more procedurally rigorous factfinding requirement for state charters. This, of course, is pure speculation. Reading the Act as a whole, one could speculate that the opposite conclusion is equally plausible, because the factfinding required before a school district can deny a charter school application is far more detailed and rigorous than the general finding required to be made by the Board before approving a state charter. (Compare \u00a7 47605, subd. (b)(1) \u2014 (5) with \u00a7 47605.8, subd. (b).) Additionally, the same presumption applies to county charters (\u00a7 47605.6, subd. (a)(1)), yet petitioners do not contend an action on a county charter is or should be quasi-judicial. Thus, petitioners\u2019 hypothesis, that the Legislature intended <em>state </em>charter school applications \u2014 but no other charter applications \u2014 to be determined by an adjudicatory process, finds no support in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">5. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The Legislature adopted section 47605.8 to authorize the approval (or denial) of a petition for a state charter school, and directed the Board to \u201cadopt regulations ... for the implementation of [section 47605.8]\u201d and to ensure that a state charter school \u201cmeets all requirements otherwise imposed on charter schools . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 47605.8, subd. (a).) We have concluded that the approval (or denial) of a state charter petition is a quasi-legislative function. We have further concluded that the adoption of regulations for the \u201cimplementation\u201d of a statute is governed by the rulemaking provisions of the APA. These principles lead inexorably to the conclusion that petitioners\u2019 \u201cliteral\u201d reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the reference to Government Code section 11500 et seq. contained in Education Code section 47605.8 as requiring the adoption of <em>adjudicatory </em>procedures for state charter petitions would produce an anomalous and absurd result.

We observe, however, that the statute is unusual, and possibly unique in that it spells out the agency\u2019s duty to adopt both quasi-legislative rules and quasi-judicial procedures to govern the standards to be applied and the process to be followed with respect to grant applications for community services block grants. For example, the regulations are required, at minimum, to define (1) the due process rights of eligible entities and the procedures to guarantee those rights; (2) the obligation of eligible entities to provide a fair procedure for clients who are denied services; and (3) the requirement that community agencies select tripartite boards that include persons who represent the poor; the regulations must also ensure operative democratic procedures which may include criteria for tenure, geographic representation, and elections. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12781, subd. (d).) The statute thus specifically calls for both substantive regulations and adjudicatory procedures. Section 47605.8, in contrast, directs the Board to adopt regulations \u201cfor the implementation of this section,\u201d and to \u201censure that a charter school approved pursuant to this section meets all requirements otherwise imposed on charter schools . . . .\u201d By its terms, the statute directs only the adoption of substantive regulations; it does not direct the adoption of regulations defining \u201cdue process rights,\u201d \u201c[fair procedures] to guarantee those rights,\u201d or any other similar adjudicatory rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 838.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
