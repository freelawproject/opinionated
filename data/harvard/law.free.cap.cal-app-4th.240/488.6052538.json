After his friend Laura Tatarzyn mentioned getting a hit man to kill her boyfriend, defendant started talking to her \u2014 seemingly seriously \u2014 about having the same hit man kill his wife. He said to Tatarzyn, \u201cYou should ask for a two-for-one deal.\u201d Tatarzyn told defendant\u2019s wife, who told the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Juan Anguiano, an undercover officer, contacted defendant and pretended to be the hit man. He asked, \u201c[Y]ou have a job for me[,] right?\u201d Defendant said, \u201cYes.\u201d They agreed to meet at a Walmart in two days. At Anguiano\u2019s request, defendant agreed to bring a photograph, an address, and $300. Meanwhile, however, defendant\u2019s girlfriend learned that he was planning to have his wife killed. She threatened to leave him if he went through with it, and he did not go to the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Nevertheless, defendant was arrested for solicitation of murder. While he was in jail, he phoned his wife, in violation of a restraining order. He also phoned his girlfriend and tried to talk her into recanting her statements incriminating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The charges against defendant and the outcome of those charges were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\">Count Charge Statute Outcome</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIR\">1Solicitation to commit murder 1 Pen.

Accordingly, we will reverse in part and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Defendant and Jane Doe<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were married in 1988. In January 2013, Doe told defendant that she was going to get a divorce. However, they continued to live in the same house. They had various disagreements about property division, spousal support, child support, and child custody. As a result, defendant was angry and \u201cvery unhappy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In April 2013, defendant rented a house on his property to Laura Tatarzyn. They became friends. Defendant discussed his problems with his wife with Tatarzyn \u201c[ejvery day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Meanwhile, Tatarzyn was having problems of her own with Edgar, the father of her child. In June 2013, her friend Yoshi said jokingly, \u201c[You] could always go find somebody in T[ijuana] to go take care of it,\u201d meaning that she could hire someone to kill Edgar.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Tatarzyn told defendant about her conversation with Yoshi. Defendant seemed to find it funny. However, a week or two later, he asked her for Yoshi\u2019s phone number. He explained that \u201che was having a really rough time with his wife . . . .\u201d Tatarzyn claimed she did not have the number.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">On July 12, 2013, defendant asked again for Yoshi\u2019s phone number. He said that he needed someone to \u201ctake care of\u2019 his wife, because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>desperate and there was no other way out. Tatarzyn said that she was going to Tijuana for other reasons, and while she was there, she would \u201ctake care of\u2019 Edgar. Defendant said, \u201cYou should ask for a two-for-one deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">That same day, Tatarzyn contacted Doe. She told Doe that defendant had asked her for the phone number of a hit man and she was in fear for Doe\u2019s life. Later that day, Doe called the police. As a result, Investigator Robert Cornett interviewed Tatarzyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Meanwhile, Tatarzyn went to Tijuana to go to a party. While she was there, she texted defendant that she was buying \u201cpig meat\u201d from a \u201cfarmer\u201d whom Yoshi knew for $1,000. She intended this to be \u201ccode\u201d meaning that the hit man charged $1,000. She thought defendant would understand because he slaughtered pigs. When he did not seem to understand, however, she also texted, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about pigs. Think Scott. Why am I going to Tijuana?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes I understand the menu now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">That night, when Tatarzyn got back, she talked to defendant about the supposed hit man in Tijuana. Unbeknownst to him, she recorded the conversation. The recording was admitted into evidence and played for the jury. Among other things, they said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201cTATARZYN: So I went to TJ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201cNELSON: How\u2019d that go? [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\u201cTATARZYN: ... So I told him that . . . you were interested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">\u201cNELSON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\u201cTATARZYN: So. The, the way it would be pretty nifty too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">\u201cNELSON: Really?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-14\">\u201cTATARZYN: Yeah. It\u2019s a barrel of they, they just, he just does it and then he puts it in a barrel with tar mixed with oil and so I guess the consist... the consistency is, it doesn\u2019t, cause when you go back across the border it doesn\u2019t, they don\u2019t scan. So you\u2019d take it back across the border as like [p]etrol and then from there it\u2019s just, nobody cares.

They don\u2019t, they don\u2019t mess around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\u201cNELSON: Yeah, cause you wouldn\u2019t believe the shit that[\u2019]s . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">\u201cTATARZYN: What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\u201cNELSON: No, it\u2019s just constant. It gets worse and worse you know. It\u2019s just constant attacking me .... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">\u201cNELSON: Blah, blah you\u2019re such an asshole. You, you\u2019re never going to see the kids on Thanksgiving and it\u2019s just like .... It\u2019s just constant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">\u201cTATARZYN: But are you willing to go through with it the whole way, cause . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">\u201cNELSON: Yeah, well how would I, I mean, I\u2019ll, will I have to be somewhere that I will have a witness or ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-15\">\u201cTATARZYN: Don\u2019t you work a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-16\">\u201cNELSON: Well.

How could that be uh, hmm, two hours like he\u2019d have, like he\u2019s want to come here, or?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-19\">\u201cTATARZYN: No, he just needs, I mean he\u2019ll talk to you. I don\u2019t know the details, cause . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-20\">\u201cNELSON: Have to be worked out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-21\">\u201cTATARZYN: Yeah, he\u2019ll have to talk to you.

She let him use her phone. He placed a call, but there was no answer. Tatarzyn texted Investigator Cornett and told him the call had not gone through.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">About an hour later, Anguiano phoned Tatarzyn, and she handed her phone to defendant. A recording of the call was admitted into evidence and played for the jury. In it, there was this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201cUC OFFICER: Ah, who do you wish to talk to ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">\u201cNELSON: Oh, [Tatarzyn] said there\u2019s somebody that ah, who you meet me and ah, discuss some things. Maybe get some tacos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">\u201cUC OFFICER: Oh, I, you are, you, you have ah, you have a job for me right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">\u201cNELSON: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">Defendant and Anguiano agreed to meet on Sunday at noon at the Walmart in Murrieta. Anguiano requested a photograph and an address. Defendant said he understood and added, \u201cNo problem.\u201d Anguiano asked, \u201cUm, you\u2019re going to give me three hundred . . . ?\u201d Defendant said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">On July 20, 2013, defendant told his girlfriend, Vivian Levinson, \u201cI know someone that can get rid of my wife.\u201d He said he had an appointment to meet the person the following day. She cried and \u201cbegged him not to do this.\u201d She added that \u201c[i]f he was to proceed with it, [she] couldn\u2019t be with him anymore.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. . . . I\u2019ll take care of it and stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The next day, July 21, 2013, early in the morning, Levinson heard defendant sending a,text message. That same day, Tatarzyn received a text from defendant saying, \u201cGonna pass on Guido\u2019s services. Thank you.\u201d Later, defendant told Levinson, \u201cYou saved someone\u2019s life today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On July 22, 2013, defendant was arrested. An emergency protective order was issued and served on defendant prohibiting him from contacting Doe or his children. Nevertheless, defendant placed three calls to his home phone from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Meanwhile, Investigator Cornett obtained a statement from Levinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">On August 29, 2013, in a phone call from jail, defendant told Levinson to contact his criminal defense attorney who would \u201ccoach her on her statement.\u201d He claimed her statement was the only reason why he was still in jail. He said she should \u201cmake it right\u201d by \u201creversing [her] statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On September 16, 2014, defendant sent Levinson a letter from jail saying, \u201cI would be free this minute if they had not told you what to say.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t . . . know who threatened you. I trust that you feared . . . .\u201d He continued, \u201cI am not judging you. . . . Please make right the statements made under duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE OF SOLICITATION OF MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence of solicitation of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">With respect to solicitation of Tatarzyn, defendant argues that he only asked her to ask a hit man in Tijuana for \u201ca two-for-one deal.\u201d Thus, he solicited her to solicit someone else to commit murder, which, he argues, is not a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">With respect to solicitation of Anguiano, defendant argues that it was Anguiano who solicited him, by saying, \u201c[Y]ou have a job for me[,] right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">We will hold that there was sufficient evidence that defendant solicited Tatarzyn. Thus, we need not decide whether there was sufficient evidence that he solicited Anguiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cWhen considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence- \u2014 that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value \u2014 from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation.] We determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation.] In so doing, a reviewing court \u201cpresumes in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCurdy </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 1063, 1104 [176 Cal.Rptr.3d 103, 331 P.3d 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u201cEvery person who, with the intent that the crime be committed, solicits another to commit or join in the commission of murder\u201d is guilty of solicitation of murder. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 653f, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u201cThe essence of criminal solicitation is an attempt to <em>induce another to commit </em>a criminal offense. [Citations.] [\u00b6] Consistent with this conception, a defendant can ordinarily be convicted under a general solicitation statute only if, had the solicitation been successful, the person solicited would have been guilty of the underlying offense.\u201d <em>(People v. Herman </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1369, 1381-1382 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 199], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">A person can be guilty of a crime as a perpetrator or as an aider and abettor. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 31.) \u201cAn aider and abettor is one who acts \u2018with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator <em>and </em>with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chiu </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 155, 161 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 438, 325 P.3d 972].) Thus, a person who successfully solicits another person to commit a crime is equally guilty of that crime, as an aider and abettor. It follows that a person who solicits a second person to solicit a third person to commit a crime has essentially solicited the second person to commit the identical crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\u201cIn the usual solicitation case, it is the solicitor\u2019s intention that the criminal result be directly brought about by the person he has solicited; that is, it is his intention that the crime be committed and that, the other commit it as a principal in the first degree, as where A asks B to kill C. However, it would seem sufficient that A requested B to get involved in the scheme to kill C in any way which would establish B\u2019s complicity in the killing of C were that to occur. Thus it would be criminal for one person to solicit another to in turn solicit a third party . . . .\u201d (2 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law (2d ed. 2003) \u00a7 11.1(c), pp. 195-196, italics &amp; fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>While we have not found any California cases on point, out-of-state cases so hold. For example, in <em>Commonwealth v. Wolcott </em>(2010) 77 Mass.App.Ct. 457 [931 N.E.2d 1025], the defendant told her cousin that she wanted her husband to \u201c \u2018just disappear\u2019 \u201d and asked if he knew someone who could help. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 458.) On appeal, she argued \u201cthat without proof of her intent that [her cousin] personally kill her husband, there can be no conviction for solicitation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 466.) The appellate court disagreed. It explained: \u201cThere is no legal distinction between someone who commits a murder as an accessory as opposed to a principal; therefore, an individual who \u2018procures\u2019 a murder also \u2018commits\u2019 murder in the eyes of the law. [Citation.] Thus, if [the cousin] had acceded to the defendant\u2019s request and had found someone else to murder the defendant\u2019s husband, and that person had in turn personally killed her husband, [the cousin] would have been indictable for a felony. Whether the defendant solicited [the cousin] to personally kill her husband or to find another to do so is thus of no consequence. Either act constitutes a felony, and under either fact pattern, the defendant would be guilty of soliciting a felony.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Similarly, in <em>Moss v. State </em>(Okla.Crim.App. 1994) 888 P.2d 509, the defendant argued that the evidence showed that she asked one Mr. Cravens to find someone else who would kill her husband, and that this did not constitute a crime. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 517; see <em>id. </em>at p. 513.) The appellate court held that the Oklahoma solicitation statute \u201ccover[ed] solicitation of another to find a \u2018hit man.\u2019 If we were to hold otherwise, all one would have to do is place a third (or more) person in the chain and escape judgment; this does not make sense. The heart of the crime is the solicitation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 517; accord, <em>Meyer v. State </em>(1981) 47 Md.App. 679, 686 [425 A.2d 664]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Furr </em>(1977) 292 N.C. 711, 720-721 [235 S.E.2d 193]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1983) 650 S.W.2d 784, 787; <em>State v. Yee </em>(1990) 160 Wis.2d 15, 17-18 [465 N.W.2d 260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In his reply brief, defendant argues that he \u201cmerely asked . . . Tatarzyn to inquire about whether it would be possible to get a discount\u201d; he did not ask Tatarzyn to inquire about actually killing his wife. Defendant forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in his opening brief. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bryant, Smith and Wheeler </em>(2014) 60 Cal.4th 335, 408 [178 Cal.Rptr.3d 185, 334 P.3d 573].) We address it anyway, because it is readily disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">A solicitation that is made subject to a condition is criminal, even if the condition is never fulfilled. (2 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11.1(c), pp. 197-198.) \u201cIn all likelihood, most criminal \u2018solicitations,\u2019 as the word is commonly understood, carry conditional offers of various types of compensations and are probably declined by the solicited party, but solicitations they would be nonetheless. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gardner v. State </em>(1979) 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Md.App. 187, 201 [396 A.2d 303].) \u201cThe crime of solicitation ... is completed by the solicitation itself, whether or not ... the person solicited immediately rejects it. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Ryan N. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377-1378 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 620].)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Asking a hit man if you can have a two-for-one deal is, in essence, offering to pay him to commit murder, on the condition that he agree to do so for a discount price. The hit man may decline, but the crime of solicitation has nevertheless been committed. At a minimum, under the deferential substantial evidence standard of review, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was asking Tatarzyn to ask a hit man to murder his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Defendant also argues, albeit briefly, that there was insufficient evidence that he had actually formed the intent that his wife be murdered. \u201cSolicitation consists of the asking of another to commit one of the specified crimes with intent that the crime be committed. The intent may be inferred from the circumstances of the asking. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 465, 472 [120 Cal.Rptr. 840], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Stark v. Superior Court </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 368, 407, fn. 15 [128 Cal.Rptr.3d 611, 257 P.3d 41].)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Here, defendant had a motive to have his wife murdered. Tatarzyn believed that defendant actually meant to harm his wife \u2014 so much so that she contacted Doe. When Tatarzyn returned from Tijuana and told defendant about her supposed conversation with the hit man, he said he was \u201cwilling j\u00a3i_\u2014 go through with it the whole way.\u201d Then when Tatarzyn put him in tduch with Anguiano, defendant confirmed that he had a \u201cjob\u201d for Anguiano. Defendant agreed to meet with Anguiano on Sunday at noon and to bring an address, a photo, and $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Defendant argues that, after Tatarzyn gave him Anguiano\u2019s phone number, he did not call Anguiano for two days, and then only after Tatarzyn supposedly \u201cpressured\u201d him. At the time, however, defendant explained that he needed to figure out how to make the call without it being traced. Defendant also points out that he did not actually go to the meeting with Anguiano. It was abundantly clear, however, that this was only because Levinson had changed his mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Even more to the point, \u201c[i]n deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court resolves neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. [Citation.] Resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of the trier of fact. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1181 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 105 P.3d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>We therefore conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction for solicitation of murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">III-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Defendant\u2019s conviction for dissuading a witness (Count 4) is reversed. If the trial court had realized that it could not sentence defendant on this count, it might have made some of its other discretionary sentencing choices differently. (See generally <em>People v. Burbine </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1256-1259 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 628].) For example, it might have run Count 2 consecutively rather than concurrently. Accordingly, the entire sentence is reversed and the matter is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-9\">Miller, J., and Codrington, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-12\"> Defendant has also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus <em>(In re Nelson </em>(Sept. 15, 2015, E062035), petn. den.). We ordered the writ petition considered with this appeal for the purpose of determining whether an order to show cause should issue. However, the two cases have not been consolidated. Thus, we will rule on the petition by separate order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-13\"> The trial court ordered that defendant\u2019s wife be referred to by this fictitious name. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 293.5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-10\"> Defendant also argues that, because solicitation of Tatarzyn was \u201ca legally inadequate theory,\u201d and because the record does not indicate whether the verdict was based on solicitation of Tatarzyn or solicitation of Anguiano, his conviction for solicitation of murder must be reversed. As just discussed, however, we do not agree that solicitation of Tatarzyn was a legally inadequate theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence of solicitation of Anguiano, but he does not claim that solicitation of Anguiano was a legally inadequate theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\">See footnote, ante, page 488.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
