(Nov. 6, 2012); Proposition 36 or the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Section 1170.126 \u201ccreated a postconviction release proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony <em>and who is not disqualified, </em>may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Yearwood </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 901] italics added <em>(Yearwood).) </em>The trial court concluded defendant was disqualified because two of his prior strike convictions were for assault with intent to commit rape, a \u201c \u2018[s]exually violent offense\u2019 \u201d under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600, subdivision (b). (See \u00a7\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(3), 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)(I), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I).) Defendant argues (1) he is eligible for resentencing under the Act because the crime of assault with intent to commit rape was not listed as a sexually violent offense in 1998 when he was sentenced to serve the present indeterminate life term under the three strikes law; (2) the record is insufficient to establish defendant\u2019s prior strike offenses were sexually violent in nature; and (3) defendant is entitled to a jury trial on the question of whether these strikes qualify as sexually violent offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We disagree and affirm. As we explain in the published portion of this opinion, under section 1170.126, \u201c[a] prisoner is eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender if all of the following are shown; (1) the prisoner is serving an indeterminate life sentence for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony; (2) the life sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C); and (3) the inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses appearing in clause (iv) of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C) or clause (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C).\u201d <em>(Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 170.) In <em>People v. Johnson </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 674 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 794, 352 P.3d 366] <em>(Johnson), </em>our Supreme Court recently held the classification of the current offense as a serious or violent felony is determined as of the date the Act became effective, relying on \u201csection 1170.126\u2019s use of the present verb tense in describing the character of the current offense, the parallel structure of the [Act\u2019s] sentencing and resentencing provisions, and the ballot arguments in support of Proposition 36.\u201d <em>(Johnson, </em>at p. 683.) We similarly conclude the determination of whether or not an inmate is disqualified from resentencing under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3), because he or she has a prior conviction for an offense \u201cappearing\u201d in clause (iv) of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C), is to be determined as of the date the Act became effective. \u201cA \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d appears in clause (iv) of these subdivisions (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)(I), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I)), and so appeared on the date the Act became effective. Moreover, on that determinative date, Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 defined \u201csexually violent offense\u201d to include assault with intent to commit rape. Because defendant has two prior convictions for this crime, the trial court correctly ruled he was disqualified from resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>We also conclude in the nonpublished portion of the opinion that the record is more than sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s prior assault with intent to commit rape convictions are sexually violent in nature. Nor is defendant entitled to a jury trial on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In 1998, defendant was convicted by jury of delivering checks with insufficient funds (\u00a7 476a) and petty theft with a prior (\u00a7 666). Finding true allegations defendant was previously convicted of three strike offenses, the trial court sentenced defendant to serve an indeterminate term of 25 years to life plus a determinate term of one year in state prison. <em>(People v. Nettles </em>(Aug. 28, 2000, C029790) [nonpub. opn.].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two of defendant\u2019s prior strike convictions were for assault with intent to commit rape. (\u00a7 220.) Defendant pled guilty to these crimes in 1985. As we described the crimes in our prior opinion: \u201cIn December 1984 [defendant] attacked a 23-year-old clerk in a convenience store, repeatedly striking her with his fists, feet, bottles and cans in an attempt to rape her. The victim suffered, among other things, a fractured skull and a collapsed lung, was rendered unconscious and had to be hospitalized for 10 days. Also in December 1984, defendant sexually assaulted a 29-year-old woman in a separate convenience store, striking her with his fists, feet and bottles. She suffered a fractured skull, fractured ribs, tom ear lobes, was rendered unconscious and spent four days in the hospital.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nettles, </em>supra, C029790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">On November 6, 2012, California voters approved Proposition 36. \u201cThe Act changes the requirements for sentencing a third strike offender to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life imprisonment\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a7 667, 1170.12) and \u201calso created a postconviction release proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.126.)\u201d <em>(Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at pp. 167-168.) The same month, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence and for resentencing under section 1170.126. The trial court denied the petition, concluding defendant\u2019s prior convictions for assault with intent to commit rape disqualified him from receiving the benefits of section 1170.126.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>Disqualifying Nature of Defendant\u2019s Prior Strikes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Under section 1170.126, \u201c[a] prisoner is eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender if all of the following are shown: (1) the prisoner is serving an indeterminate life sentence for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony; (2) the life sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C); and (3) the inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses appearing in clause (iv) of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C) or clause (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C).\u201d <em>(Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 170, citing \u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">This case involves the third disqualifying circumstance. One category of offense appearing in clause (iv) of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C), is \u201c[a] \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)(I), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I).) Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600, subdivision (b), provides: \u201c \u2018Sexually violent offense\u2019 means the following acts when committed by force, violence, duress, menace, fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person, or threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person, and that are committed on, before, or after the effective date of this article and result in a conviction or a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, as defined in subdivision (a): a felony violation of Section . . . 220 . . . , committed with the intent to commit a violation of Section 261 . . . .\u201d Thus, Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3), disqualifies those three strike offenders who, like defendant herein, have a prior conviction for assault with intent to commit rape that is committed by force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Nevertheless, defendant argues section 1170.126 is ambiguous as to whether disqualification applies in this case because the crime of assault with intent to commit rape was not listed as a sexually violent offense in 1998 when he was sentenced to his present indeterminate life term under the three strikes law. In these circumstances, he argues, the rule of lenity should operate in his favor. We disagree. The rule of lenity generally requires that \u201cambiguity in a criminal statute should be resolved in favor of lenity, giving the defendant the benefit of every reasonable doubt on questions of interpretation. But. . . \u2018that rule applies \u201conly if two reasonable interpretations of the statute stand in relative equipoise.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Soria </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 58, 65 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 780, 224 P.3d 99]; see <em>In re M.M. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 530, 545 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 869, 278 P.3d 1221].) On this issue, there is no ambiguity in the language of section 1170.126. (3) While the crime of assault with intent to commit rape was added to the definition of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d in 2006 (compare Stats. 2000, ch. 643, \u00a7 1, pp. 4192-4194 with Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7 53, pp. 2660-2663), section 1170.126, subdivision (e), clearly states an inmate is ineligible for resentencing if he or she has a prior conviction \u201cfor any of the offenses appearing\u201d in clause (iv) of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C), section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3) (italics added). In construing statutes, the use of verb tense ... is considered significant.\u201d <em>(Hughes v. Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 776 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641].) \u201cAppearing\u201d is the present participle of \u201cappear.\u201d For purposes of resentencing, the \u201cpresent\u201d is the date Proposition 36 became effective, November 7, 2012. (See <em>Johnson, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at pp. 689-690.) On that determinative date, a \u201c \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d appeared in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv)(I), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I), and Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 defined \u201csexually violent offense\u201d to include assault with intent to commit rape. Had the electorate intended this restriction on resentencing under the Act to apply only to offenses that appeared in the definition of sexually violent offense <em>at the time the inmate was sentenced to his or her indeterminate life term under the three strikes law, </em>as defendant asserts, the electorate would have so specified. We cannot, under the guise of statutory interpretation, rewrite the statute. (See, e.g., <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082, 1099 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Eckard </em>(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1248 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 811]; <em>People v. Hill </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 220, 226 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 11].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">This conclusion is bolstered by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th 674. There, one of the defendants argued the classification of the current offense as a serious or violent felony should be determined as of the date that offense was committed, rather than the date Proposition 36 became effective. Our Supreme Court disagreed, explaining, \u201csection 1170.126\u2019s use of the present verb tense in describing the character of the current offense, the parallel structure of the sentencing and resentencing provisions, and the ballot arguments in support of Proposition 36 lead us to conclude that the classification of an offense as serious or violent for purposes of resentencing is based on the law as of November 7, 2012, the effective date of Proposition 36.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As we have already explained, section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3), at issue here, also uses the present verb tense. Moreover, the other factors considered by the court in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th 674 also confirm the same result should obtain in this case. With respect to the parallel structure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the Act\u2019s sentencing and resentencing provisions, the court explained this structure \u201creflects an intent that sentences imposed on individuals with the same criminal history be the same, regardless of whether they are being sentenced or resentenced.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 686.) Had defendant herein committed his current offense on or after the effective date of Proposition 36, and was being sentenced under section 1170.12, rather than seeking resentencing under section 1170.126, there could be no doubt his prior assault with intent to commit rape convictions would disqualify him from the new sentencing scheme. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I) [same disqualification], 1170.125 [\u201cfor all offenses committed on or after November 7, 2012, all references to existing statutes in Sections 1170.12 and 1170.126 are to those sections as they existed on November 7, 2012\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning to this case, because \u201cthe Act is more cautious with respect to resentencing,\u201d containing a safety valve for those seeking resentencing where the trial court \u201c \u2018determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,\u2019 \u201d \u201cit would be incongruous to <em>require </em>a court, absent an unreasonable risk of danger, to resentence an inmate such as [defendant]\u201d where he would be disqualified if he were \u201cbeing sentenced in the first instance\u201d under section 1170.12 with the same prior convictions. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 686.) Finally, our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the ballot arguments in support of Proposition 36 also confirms our conclusion in this case. \u201cThose arguments reflect an intent to \u2018make the punishment fit the crime\u2019 and \u2018make room in prison for dangerous felons.\u2019 [Citation.] Given that [defendant\u2019s prior assault with intent to commit rape convictions] are now considered [disqualifying offenses], the intent reflected in the ballot arguments to \u2018keep violent felons off the streets\u2019 [citation] and \u2018prevent[] dangerous criminals from being released early\u2019 [citation] would not be served by interpreting the Act to authorize a reduction in his [or her] sentence.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We conclude defendant\u2019s prior convictions for assault with intent to commit rape qualify as sexually violent offenses and therefore disqualify him from having his sentence recalled and from being resentenced as a second strike offender under section 1170.126.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">II, III* <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-5\">Hull, Acting P.
