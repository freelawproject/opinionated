Mrs. Barnett\u2019s huband, Robert (hereafter decedent), a member of the Oakland Fire Department since 1924, retired on a disability pension in 1960. After his death in 1964, the Oakland Retirement Board found that his death was industrially caused and granted Mrs. Barnett a monthly retirement allowance pursuant to section 244(3) of the Oakland Charter (discussedbelow).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In November 1964 Mrs. Barnett and Ronald each filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation death benefits. In 1965, her claim was denied as barred by the statute of limitations, but Ronald was granted the maximum statutory death benefit of $20,500 (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4702). Oakland paid this amount by depositing the funds in a special trusteeship account for Ronald and was informed by the city attorney that the pension portion of Mrs. Barnett\u2019s retirement allowance had to be reduced by the amount of Ronald\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation award pursuant to section 249(2) of the Charter. Thereafter, the Oakland Retirement Board by a tie vote failed to pass a resolution making such reduction but the controller refused to pay Mrs. Barnett the full amount of her pension. This action for declaratory relief and a writ of mandate ensued. The parties agreed that the question of the propriety of the deduction would be submitted and determined separately from the issues relating to the correct method of computing the deduction. The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents and issued a writ of mandate directing the pajunent of the full amount of the pension without the deduction for the award to Ronald.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The only question presented by this appeal is whether the trial court, as indicated in its memorandum opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>properly concluded that <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Hoover, </em>41 Cal.2d 145 [258 P.2d 4], precluded the deduction of Ronald\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation award from the pension portion of Mrs. Barnett\u2019s retirement allowance. The facts of Lyons were substantially similar, as there, the widow of a Sacramento fireman challenged that city\u2019s attempt to deduct from her pension the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation death benefits awarded to her three minor children. To determine the issue, our Supreme Court had to construe the provision of the Sacramento City Charter, set forth below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Hoover, supra, </em>at pages 148-149, the court held: \u201cIt is clear that if a widow receives all of a compensation award, the portion of her pension allowances provided by the city\u2019s contributions can be reduced until the sums withheld equal the total amount of the award.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Where, however, a widow receives only part of the award, the critical question is whether the city may take from her pension the amount of compensation payments made to third persons. The charter provides that a pension may be reduced by the amount of any compensation benefits payable on account of the death of an employee and declares that it is the intent that payments under the workmen\u2019s compensation law shall be a deductible credit against any allowance under the retirement system. This provision might be construed as contemplating a deduction from a widow\u2019s pension of the total amount of an award made to her and third persons, but it also may reasonably be construed as authorizing a deduction from her pension of only such compensation payments as she is entitled to receive. The further statement that double payments shall not be permitted may likewise be reasonably construed as prohibiting duplicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>payment of a pension allowance and compensation benefits to the same person, but not as requiring deduction from one person\u2019s pension of compensation benefits awarded to others. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Respondents contend on this appeal that section 249(2) of the Oakland Charter here in question presents a similar ambiguity and must similarly be construed. We agree. The pertinent provision of the Charter provides: \u201cSection 249(2). It is the intention of this section that allowances granted to or on account of members of the System for injury, illness or death incurred in the performance of duty shall not be cumulative with benefits under the Labor Code of California awarded as the result of the same injury, illness or death. If any member of the System or dependent receives compensation under the Labor Code for disability or death arising out of and in the course of the performance of duty, any payment on account thereof shall be applied as a credit and set off \u2022against any payment on account of salary granted to such member under Articles XIV and XV; or retirement allowance or other benefit granted to or on account of such member under the provisions of this Article as follows:....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Although somewhat more specifically worded than the Sacramento Charter, the above provisions are also subject to two interpretations. The word \u201ccumulative,\u201d as used in the first sentence of this section, is ambiguous. The sentence does not spell out whether it is meant to deduct the amount of the benefit from the second source where it was payable to a different dependent, or merely to prevent double or cumulative payments from being made to the same person. It can reasonably be argued that payments made to separate individuals are not \u201ccumulative.\u201d Likewise, the second sentence of the section does not clearly indicate whether the \u201ccredit and set off\u201d is to be applied against any benefit granted to any person or dependent, or merely against benefits granted to the same person or same dependent. Under the rule of liberal construction of pension provisions, these ambiguities must be resolved in favor of Mrs. Barnett. We think the trial court correctly held that <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Hoover supra, </em>precluded the deduction of Ronald\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation award from the pension portion of Mrs. Barnett\u2019s allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u2022 Shoemaker, P.
