J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqW\">In March 1965 the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control ordered a 10-day suspension of the on-sale general license of AVilbur and Katherine Mumford doing business as The Safari Room, Tustin, California, based upon a finding the Mumfords had bought beer for resale from an unlicensed vendor (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23402). The Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board affirmed. A superior court judgment set aside the Department\u2019s suspension order. The Department and the appeals board appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The question presented is: Does the evidence support the Department\u2019s finding (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c) ; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 106, 113 [28 Cal.Rptr. 74] ; <em>Greenblatt </em>v. <em>Marlin, </em>189 Cal.App.2d 787, 789 [11 Cal.Rptr. 669]) ? It does.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">United States Marine Corps sergeant, Charles P. Geier, stationed at El Toro Marine Air Station, California, moonlighted in his spare time in 1964 as a bartender for the Mumfords at their Safari Room. Geier did not have a resale license. On June 25, 1964 Geier bought five cases of beer from the Enlisted Men\u2019s Club at the Air Station. He placed them in the beer refrigerator behind the bar from which the public was served in The Safari Room. The evidence also included Wilbur Mumford\u2019s written admission he bought five cases of beer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>from Geier on June 25, 1965 \u201cfor resale by my business.\u201d The Mumfords offered no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], Mumford contends his admission was inadmissible because the record does not show he had been warned of his constitutional rights to silence and counsel, as required, he claims, by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as their counterpart in the California Constitution, article 1, section 13, apply the personal guarantees claimed by Mumford only to criminal prosecutions.  The introduction in evidence of Mumford\u2019s admission did not deprive him of property without due process of law because his license to sell intoxicants is not a proprietary right within the meaning of due process. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>192 Cal.App.2d 786, 790-791 [14 Cal.Rptr. 59] ; <em>State Board of Equalization </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>5 Cal.App.2d 374, 377 [42 P.2d 1076].)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Mumford\u2019s contention his admission is inadmissible hearsay is unmeritorious. It is admissible as an admission by a party, an exception to the hearsay rule (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (e); Code Civ Proc., \u00a7 1870.2, now Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 5, 1968, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 13,1968.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
