Sperry, domiciled in California, died on September 11, 1963, leaving surviving his spouse, Rose Sperry. At time of death, Mr. Sperry held in joint tenancy with Mrs. Sperry certain real and personal property having an appraised value of $186,850.40. All of this joint tenancy property had derived from Mr. Sperry\u2019s personal earnings during the marriage and during a period that the couple were domiciled outside of California. It is conceded that all of this joint tenancy property is such as is defined in Probate Code, section 201.5<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in Revenue and Taxation Code, section 15300.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">In preparing the Report of Inheritance Tax Appraiser, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>appraiser excluded one-half of the net value of the said joint tenancy property under Revenue and Taxation Code section 13672.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, there was excluded one-half of the remaining one-half of the net value under Revenue and Taxation Code section 13554.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The result is that in the report an inheritance tax was imposed on one-fourth of the net value of the property. Objection by the controller is made to the report, and specifically to the exclusion as made in the report under Revenue and Taxation Code section 13554.5. The probate court approved the report of the inheritance tax appraiser. The appeal is from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Generally, inheritance taxation of joint tenancy property is governed by section 13671,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which bases the tax incidents on the portion of the consideration contributed by each joint tenant. To the extent consideration is provided by <em>the </em>deceased joint tenant, passage <em>to the </em>surviving joint tenant at death is considered a transfer for inheritance tax purposes. There is a qualification of this general statutory rule, however, in the case of joint tenancy property which had as its source what has been referred to as quasi-community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Section 13672 recognizes and imposes an exception, for inheritance tax purposes, upon joint tenancy property created from quasi-community property. The history and constitutionality of section 13672 has been dealt with in considerable detail in <em>Estate of Rogers, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 101 [53 Cal.Rptr. 572], and need not be restated in the instant opinion. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>have noted, by virtue of the general rule (\u00a7 13671), under the facts of this case, the noncontributing joint tenant would have considered as transferred to him, as survivor joint tenant, the entire value of the property so held. Recognizing the community contribution by a spouse who would not otherwise be considered a \u201ccontributing party\u201d in the property placed in joint tenancy, by statutory edict, a presumption of equal contribution is declared where joint tenancy property had its source in quasi-community property. Thus the decedent, though in fact the sole contributing joint tenant, will be considered as having transferred at the time of death but one-half of the whole of such joint tenancy property. The result is to apply a \u201csource of funds\u201d theory through the application of section 13672 to create the identical result as if each spouse contributed equally. Once such theory of contribution is applied, we no longer have \u201csource of funds\u201d for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">It is urged by respondent that the quasi-community nature cf each joint tenant\u2019s interest continues, with the result that under section 13554.5 there is yet a further one-half of decedent\u2019s one-half to be excluded from inheritance taxation. This bootstrap operation cannot be supported. Once the property is recognized as the jointly contributed separate property of each joint tenant, neither spouse\u2019s share can be characterized as quasi-community property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   The result we reach is to view section 13672 as the specific provision of the law dealing with inheritance tax upon joint tenancy property, the source of which was quasi-community property. Section 13554.5, we conclude, is the general section relative to inheritance taxation of Probate Code, section 201.5 type property, where such property is not specifically dealt with elsewhere in the code. The specific statute relating to a particular subject governs as against a general one sufficiently broad to cover the same subject. <em>(County of Placer </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. etc. Co., </em>50 Cal.2d 182, 189 [323 P.2d 753].) This does not mean that section 13554.5 has no purpose, for that is far from the result we reach. Section 13554.5 just does not address its provisions to section 13672, joint tenancy property; it does address itself, and accomplishes the identical result for inheritance tax purposes, to all other transfers of quasi-community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>property between -the spouses other than by will or succession.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">. We conclude that the purpose of the Legislature, through these taxing statutes, is to maintain the principle of equality of contribution to the community\u2019s enhancement, and this is the result we have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Kaus, P.
