On a proper motion and without objection the two informations were consolidated, the counts in information 315196 becoming additional counts in the 315199 information. A jury trial was waived and it was stipulated that the cause might be submitted upon the evidence and testimony taken and received at the two preliminary hearings, subject to the right to produce and offer further evidence. Dennis was found guilty as to each of the eight counts, and the charged prior convictions were found to be true. Dennis was sentenced to the state prison on each count, the terms to run concurrently. A timely notice of appeal was filed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of some of the facts is as follows; As to coxont I, on October 23, 1965, at about 9:30 p.m. appellant approached Wells, an undercover narcotics officer, and asked him for $10.

As to C03int II, on October 25, 1965, at about 8:15 p.m., agent Thompson, of the State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, was given two marijuana cigarettes by appellant.

As to count IV, on November 8, 1965, at about 2 p.m. appellant told agent Thompson where he could find an ounce of heroin inside a cigarette package which was hidden in a parking lot outside of a bowling alley. Thompson retrieved the package which contained the heroin and paid appellant $180 therefor. As to count V, on November 11, 1965, at about 12:45 a.m. appellant gave agent Thompson four condoms containing heroin in exchange for $180. On November 22, 1965, at about 9 a.m. agent Thompson was in appellant\u2019s apartment and while there appellant displayed five condoms of heroin to Thompson.

The recital of the evidence belies the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 4, 1968.
