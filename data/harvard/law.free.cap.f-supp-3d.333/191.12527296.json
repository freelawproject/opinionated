Bus Battery Theft Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 27, 2012, Defendant Francis Bristow, a foreman at the John F. Kennedy Bus Depot (\"JFK Depot\" or \"Depot\"), reported to John McGovern, the Security Director of MTA Bus's internal security department, and John Dhuman, an Assistant General Manager at the Depot, that bus batteries were being stolen by MTA Bus employees, including Plaintiff Eric Trantel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8; Deposition of Francis Bristow (\"Bristow Dep.\"), at 40:9-17, 41:17-19, 42:4-10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bristow told McGovern that he had been notified about the thefts by three MTA Bus employees: Doodnath Seecharan, Maniram Sukhee, and Balmore Hamilton. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 7; Dkt. 57-7, at ECF 26;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bristow Dep., at\n   55:17-23.) MTA Bus's internal security department began an investigation based on Bristow's complaint. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 9.) McGovern told Bristow that, going forward, he should \"[k]eep an eye out for anyone removing batteries from the Depot without authorization.\" (Bristow Dep., at 57:12-17, 58:7-15.) On December 6, 2012, the investigation was reassigned from McGovern to MTA Police Department (\"MTAPD\") Detective Henry Micyk. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 8, 2012, Bristow received a call from his supervisor, Orin Blackman, who told him to go to the Depot fuel station, because \"Eric Trantel is operating a forklift behind truck-[a]n unknown truck\" in the Engine Wash Bay. (Bristow Dep., at 152:12-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Orin Blackman (\"Blackman Dep.\"), Dkt. 60-50, at 87:11-89:4.) Bristow, who was Trantel's supervisor that day, went to the glass window or door in the fuel station office and saw Trantel in a forklift placing a pallet of bus batteries onto an MTA pick-up truck being operated by Defalco. (Dkt. 57-7, at ECF 28; Dkt. 57-15; Bristow Dep., at 156:3-173:3.) According to Bristow, Defalco then left the Depot with the batteries in the truck and later returned to the Depot without them. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 15.) Bristow subsequently submitted a report to Blackman about what he observed and also reported the incident to McGovern. (Dkt. 60-8, at ECF 3; Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 26, 2013, the investigation was transferred from MTAPD Detective Micyk to Defendant MTAPD Detective Brian Longaro. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 25.) Longaro received all of Micyk's case files and spoke with the MTA's Office of the Inspector General's Principal Investigator William McGowan, McGovern, and McGovern's supervisor, Robert Piccarelli, regarding the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26; Dkt. 57-7, at ECF 25-26.) Longaro also spoke with Bristow \"the first day [he] was assigned the investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Longaro] would have asked [Bristow] what -- to go through all the dates of any time [Bristow] saw theft happening, occurring, when it first started, who was involved and any current theft.\" (Deposition of Brian Longaro (\"Longaro Dep.\"), at 126:9-127:24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 11, 2013, Longaro received a report from McGovern that Bristow had informed McGovern that he had seen another MTA Bus employee, Vincent Williams, remove batteries from the Depot on March 9, 2013. Detective Longaro conducted surveillance at the Depot on March 11, 2013, and ultimately arrested Williams, who admitted that he had been stealing batteries from the Depot. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 13, 2013, Longaro arrested Defalco and charged him, via criminal complaint, based on the events of December 8, 2012, with Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree and Criminal Possession of Stolen Property in the Fourth Degree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28; Dkt. 57-34, at ECF 3-5.) On March 14, 2013, Longaro arrested Trantel for Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree and Criminal Possession of Stolen Property in the Fourth Degree and signed the criminal complaint the following day. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 35; Dkt. 57-19.) Defalco and Trantel were arraigned in Queens County criminal court on these charges on April 13 and April 15, 2013, respectively. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) On October 6, 2014, the cases against Defalco and Trantel were dismissed and sealed by the court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Post-Arrest Employment Termination Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs are members of Local 1179 Amalgamated Transit Union (the \"Union\" or \"Local 1179\"). (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 5.) Local 1179 and the MTA Bus Company are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) The CBA states,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he Company shall have the right to discharge or suspend an employee for sufficient cause\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44) and \"[i]f the Company determines that a disciplinary hearing should be held, such hearing shall be held as soon as practicable after the event which prompted the discipline.... In the event the Union disputes the Company's determination, the Union may file a complaint with the arbitrator in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in [the CBA]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46). MTA Bus policy is that \"the decision to terminate an employee is made upon notification that the employee has been arrested for a felony charge.\" (Deposition of Robert Miller, Dkt. 57-23, at 185:4-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, once Defalco and Trantel were arrested, MTA Bus began the process of terminating their employment, and they were suspended without pay. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Anthony Defalco, Dkt. 60-36, at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13; Affidavit of Eric Trantel, Dkt. 60-36, at \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.) On April 26, 2013, Plaintiffs received a MTA Disciplinary Action Report recommending that they be fired and were also notified that a Step 1 hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   would be held on May 3, 2013 regarding MTA Bus's decision to fire them. (Dkts. 57-24, 57-25, 57-26, 57-27.) However, the hearings were stayed pending the outcome of Plaintiffs' criminal cases. (Defs.' 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) On October 10, 2014, four days after Plaintiffs' criminal cases were dismissed, the Union sought Plaintiffs' reinstatement to their positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.) Plaintiffs elected to arbitrate MTA Bus's decision to terminate through their union, and on February 10, 2015, MTA Bus Company reinstated Plaintiffs to their jobs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57, 60-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on December 28, 2015. (Dkt. 1.) On December 14, 2017, Plaintiffs withdrew their claims against Defendants Henry Micyk, John McGovern, Butch Miller, Tom Losito, and the MTA Police Department, as well as their claims for First Amendment retaliation. (Dkt. 47.) Defendants Longaro, Bristow, and MTA Bus's motion for summary\n   judgment on Plaintiffs' remaining claims for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and due process was fully briefed on April 3, 2018. (Dkt. 54.) That same day, Defendants also filed a motion to strike the affidavit of Defalco's supervisor, Vinny Hernandez.

This allegation does not provided \"fair notice\" of Plaintiffs' current claim because it is not predicated on a policy of denying pre-deprivation due process where employees are arrested for felonies; rather, it is focused on whether Plaintiffs were arrested, suspended, and prosecuted pursuant to an MTA policy that permitted these actions in \"the absence of any probable cause for\n   the arrests\", and where there exists \"plainly exculpatory evidence\".
