BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from an antitrust action brought by Pfizer, Inc. (\"Pfizer\") against Johnson &amp; Johnson, along with its wholly\n   owned subsidiary, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, \"J &amp; J\"), for allegedly anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical market for infliximab products. The practices at issue are embodied by exclusive agreements and bundled rebates. Pfizer's principal claim is that J &amp; J violated federal antitrust laws by engaging in anticompetitive behavior to shield Remicade from competition posed by Pfizer's biosimilar, Inflectra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under consideration is J &amp; J's Motion to Dismiss Pfizer's Complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). This Motion is fully briefed and ripe for the Court's adjudication. The Court has considered the parties' submissions and decides this matter without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78 ; Loc. R. Civ. P. 7.1(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ALLEGED FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The subject medications in this litigation are J &amp; J's Remicade and Pfizer's Inflectra. Both are branded forms of infliximab, which is a biologic drug used to treat a range of immune-mediated diseases. Compl. \u00b6 35. Biologics are relatively new medications to the pharmaceutical market, and their unique qualities are relevant to our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Biologic medications, such as infliximab, are complex mixtures derived from living systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Biologics stand in contrast to more common drugs that are chemically synthesized and whose structure is known.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the composition of biologics are not easily identified or characterized.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This makes biologic medications difficult to replicate and produce in generic form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The emergence of biologics prompted Congress to enact the Biologic Price Competition and Innovation Act (\"BPCIA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated regulatory approval pathway for the introduction of drugs that are biosimilar to a biologic, similar to the abbreviated approval process for generic drugs under the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. To prove that an applicant drug is biosimilar to an originator product, the applicant must show that it is \"highly similar to the [originator] notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the [proposed biosimilar] and the [originator] in terms of safety, purity, and potency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One important difference between biosimilars approved under the BPCIA and generic medications approved under the Hatch-Waxman Act is that biosimilars are not automatically substitutable with the originator biologic.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n    \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

J &amp; J's efforts to foreclose Pfizer from the market, as Pfizer has alleged, have led to increased prices for consumers and limited competitive options for end payors, providers, and patients. Pfizer provides detailed allegations regarding J &amp; J's exclusionary terms with many of the nation's largest insurers, the incentive structure that forces end payors and providers into accepting those terms, Pfizer's efforts to compete, including its guarantees that Inflectra would cost less than Remicade, and showed how market participants on many levels are injured from J &amp; J's ability to sell Remicade without having to compete with Inflectra and other biosimilars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Along a similar line of attack, J &amp; J also takes aim at Pfizer's alleged antitrust injury by arguing that Pfizer's inability to gain market share is caused by reasons other than J &amp; J's alleged anticompetitive conduct.

Similar to exclusive dealing agreements, bundled rebate claims are analyzed under a rule of reason framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Focusing on Pfizer's alleged antitrust injury, J &amp; J makes several arguments specific to each aspect of its alleged anticompetitive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, J &amp; J argues that Pfizer's alleged antitrust injury based on J &amp; J's multi-product bundling should be dismissed because Pfizer failed to allege that it offered its own multi-product bundles. According to J &amp; J, Pfizer was either required to plead facts establishing that it offered its own competing bundle or that it\n   was incapable of doing so. J &amp; J Resp. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   J &amp; J relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Eisai\n   </em>\n   , where the Third Circuit stated it previously \"limited the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    LePage's\n   </em>\n   to cases in which a single-product producer is excluded through a bundled rebate program offered by a producer of multiple products, which conditions the rebates on purchases across multiple different product lines.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257461\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/394/\">\n    821 F.3d at 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Eisai\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit reviewed the circuit's prior decisions in bundling cases and noted that bundling can be anticompetitive when it \"forecloses portions of the market to a potential competitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse group of products and who therefore cannot make a comparable offer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257461\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/394/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Pfizer, of course, is not a single-product producer. It admits as much in its Complaint. Compl. \u00b6 18. Moreover, Pfizer has not alleged any facts suggesting that J &amp; J is hindering its ability to compete with J &amp; J's multi-product bundles by offering their own multi-product bundles. J &amp; J's multi-product bundles, on their own, therefore do not present antitrust concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, J &amp; J cites\n   <em>\n    Eisai\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that bundling contestable and incontestable demand, for the same product, cannot constitute an antitrust violation. However, the Third Circuit did not completely shut the door on such a theory, as J &amp; J argues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257461\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/394/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257461\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/394/\">\n    at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, it affirmed summary judgment with the factual support that \"nothing in the record indicates that an equally efficient competitor was unable to compete.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257461\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/394/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Bundling Remicade's incontestable demand could create anticompetitive consequences by foreclosing competition for new infliximab patients -- thereby posing antitrust concern that was lacking in\n   <em>\n    Eisai\n   </em>\n   . Taking Pfizer's allegations as true, new infliximab patients are contestable because they have not yet been anchored to a specific infliximab product. If incontestable demand is truly inelastic, then this could fall into a traditional bundling case where J &amp; J has bundled its power over existing Remicade patients to break the competitive mechanism and deprive new infliximab patients (and their insurers) of the ability to make a meaningful choice between Remicade and its biosimilars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eisai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257461\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/394/\">\n    821 F.3d at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore refuse to dismiss Pfizer's bundling claim as it relates to contestable and incontestable demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Allegations Supporting Pfizer's Efforts to Compete\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Lastly, J &amp; J argues that Pfizer's alleged antitrust injury based on J &amp; J's exclusive contracts should be dismissed because Pfizer failed to plead adequate facts establishing that it attempted to compete. J &amp; J supports this argument by claiming Pfizer's allegations regarding the price of Inflectra and Remicade lack sufficient accuracy to make plausible Pfizer's efforts to compete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   J &amp; J mainly takes issue with Pfizer's reliance on Average Sales Price (\"ASP\") and Wholesale Acquisition Cost (\"WAC\"). According to J &amp; J, Pfizer cannot rely on ASP and WAC to support its efforts to compete with J &amp; J by offering lower prices because both metrics lack sufficient specificity. J &amp; J Corrected Mem. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As noted above, WAC is essentially a metric reflecting list price, whereas ASP is based on an annual average that does account for rebates and discounts off list price. J &amp; J argues that because WAC does not reflect the net price after discounts and rebates, it provides no indication about the price competition between Remicade and Inflectra. The problem with ASP, according to J &amp; J, is that because Remicade's current ASP reflects a yearly net average, and because Inflectra has been on the market for less than a year at\n   the time Pfizer filed its Complaint, Remicade's ASP reflects pricing data from months where Inflectra was not yet on the market. J &amp; J Corrected Mem. at 3-4, 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At this stage, we find that Pfizer's allegations containing ASP data do support the plausibility of its claims. According to Pfizer, it has priced Inflectra lower than J &amp; J's Remicade even accounting for incentives such as bundled discounts and rebates. Pfizer also alleges that Remicade's ASP continues to increase despite Inflectra's entrance to the market at a 24 percent lower per unit cost. Supp. Auth. at 2. These allegations lend plausibility to Pfizer's theory that J &amp; J is engaging in anticompetitive behavior, which is foreclosing biosimilars from competing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We agree with J &amp; J that the WAC provides minimal support for the proposition that Inflectra costs less on a unit-for-unit basis than Remicade. Nevertheless, Pfizer's allegations regarding Remicade's increasing WAC does support Pfizer's theory that J &amp; J's bundled rebate force purchasers into excluding Remicade's biosimilars from the market. Increasing Remicade's WAC in turn increases the penalties for not excluding Inflectra and other biosimilars in the form of lost incentives. Accepting as true Pfizer's allegations that existing Remicade patients will not switch to a biosimilar despite price competition, the increasing penalties that payors may face for exiting patients may effectively force payors into accepting J &amp; J's exclusionary terms for all patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   J &amp; J's arguments against Pfizer's support for its pricing allegations are misplaced -- or rather, mistimed. Discovery will reveal whether Pfizer has offered more competitive pricing for Inflectra, as alleged in its Complaint. If Pfizer's claims about pricing prove true, then the pricing data may indicate that J &amp; J's conduct has prevented Pfizer from competing in violation of the antitrust laws. Ultimately, the legality of J &amp; J's conduct will depend on whether it foreclosed a substantial share of the market such that competition has been harmed.\n   <em>\n    ZF Meritor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865946\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/254/#p270\">\n    696 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   283 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tampa Elec.
