In addition, the Company is completing its closing procedures and preparing interim financial statements for its quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, after which it will work with its independent registered public accounting firm as it reviews the interim financial statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added by Plaintiffs in CAC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged that, on December 14, 2016, \"[d]ue to the potential uncertainty of holding an annual [stockholder] meeting without the ability to solicit proxies, the Board concluded that they did not want to risk losing their seats at an election solely voted on by stockholders in attendance at the meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 20, 2016, the Audit Committee allegedly told the Board that \"it was not practical to complete the Restatement by the March 10 delisting deadline,\" and, on December 28, 2016, the Audit Committee allegedly confirmed that it could not \"conclude with any degree of reliability that the Restatement would be complete by the March 10, 2017 deadline at any reasonable cost.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.

Plaintiffs allege that \"[a]ccording to the Recommendation Statement, it was at this point that the Board noted the potential for an acquisition transaction in the near term may obviate the need to complete a Restatement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that \"[t]he Recommendation Statement also revealed that despite the Company's statements in its November press release that things were 'substantially complete,' Tangoe had not begun to implement the audit plan of its independent registered accounting firm,\" and therefore \"the Board decided to shift focus to producing a quality of earnings report to help execute a potential transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On January 4, 2017, NASDAQ allegedly informed Tangoe that its stock could be delisted for failure to hold an annual stockholder meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Plaintiffs allege that \"[g]iven this additional basis to delist Tangoe, it appears that the decision to shift focus to selling the Company was not the result of the inability to timely complete the Restatement, but a consequence of the Board's selfish decision to avoid being ousted at an annual stockholder meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 10, 2017, Tangoe informed stockholders that NASDAQ had made a final determination to delist the company's\n   common stock, and, four days later, trading of Tangoe's shares ended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"during the course of these efforts, the Company devoted significant internal resources to pursue the Restatement, expended approximately $16 million in costs in 2015 and 2016 for outside assistance on the Restatement, yet failed to ever issue a Restatement or any audited financial statements from the time of the Restatement through the closing of the Transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, on March 23, 2017, undisclosed stockholders owning 7% of Tangoe's common stock threatened a proxy contest to unseat a majority of the Board if the Board did not complete a transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Awards and Benefits to Board Members and Management\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, while the Restatement was still pending, \"SEC rules barred Tangoe from issuing traditional equity awards to the Board or management.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Plaintiffs allege that Tangoe's Board and management avoided those rules by entering \"into Equity Award Replacement Compensation Agreements ('EARCAs') with the Company,\" so that \"Tangoe's officers and directors could still receive equity compensation, but that compensation would only have value upon a 'change in control.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Tangoe and Mr. Foy, who was, at that point, the interim CEO, entered into an employment agreement on June 6, 2016, under which Mr. Foy became the acting CEO and, \"subject to the Company's ability to register the grant of such award on a Form S-8, Mr. Foy [would] be entitled to receive an award of 100,000 restricted stock units (RSUs).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. On June 8, 2016, Mr. Coit, Mr. Golding, Mr. Kaiser, Mr. Kimzey, Mr. Pontin, and Mr. Walley each allegedly received \"EARCAs with respect to 15,142 measurement shares.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On July 28, 2016, the Board allegedly changed Mr. Foy's employment agreement to make him the CEO and to provide him with 100,000 restricted stock units that would vest upon change in control and 100,000 new EARCA shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. That same day, Scott Snyder allegedly received 50,000 EARCA shares and Charles Gamble allegedly received 20,000 EARCA shares, all due to vest and be converted to common shares upon a change in control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On August 15, 2016, the Board allegedly made Mr. Zager, then the interim CFO, the CFO, and paid him $400,000 in cash.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. The Board also allegedly granted Mr. Foy 400,000 EARCA shares and Mr. Zager 100,000 EARCA shares, all to vest upon a change in control of the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that these shares were different from the other EARCA shares, however, because \"25% of the shares would only vest upon a change in control of the Company resulting in consideration payable to holders of common stock of the Company exceeding specified thresholds,\" though Tangoe allegedly \"never stated what those thresholds were.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 11, 2017, the Board allegedly approved a \"Retention Agreement\" for Mr. Foy, under which he would receive severance benefits in the event of termination for reasons other than cause, death, disability, or resignation for good reason.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Plaintiffs allege that \"[a]ssuming a Qualifying Termination followed the Merger, the retention agreement secured Foy an additional $892,140, consisting of $656,250 in salary-based severance and $235,890 in bonus-based severance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On February 2, 2017, the Board allegedly approved amendments to Mr. Foy and Mr. Zager's respective EARCAs, \"lowering the minimum threshold consideration\n   necessary to trigger their respective vesting provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, \"[r]ather than act in the best interest of all stockholders by completing the Restatement and executing the Company's standalone plan, as it had determined to do in the spring of 2016, the Board acted selfishly and disloyally by pushing through an inadequate offer with Marlin and, at the same time, ensuring that millions of dollars in equity award equivalents would vest upon consummating the Transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Plaintiffs further allege that the Individual Defendants \"understood that they were set to collectively receive nearly $5 million in exchange for their measurement shares under the EARCAs\" if they voted for the transaction with Marlin, and \"[i]f the Director Defendants voted against the Transaction and opted to complete the Restatement and proceed as a standalone company, their EARCAs would have been worthless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Sale of the Company\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"accounting failures marred the sales process from the start\" because Tangoe was unable to provide potential bidders with \"any accurate, audited GAAP financial statements,\" and therefore \"many potential bidders were unable to participate in the sales process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, between June 2016 and December 2016, Tangoe had \"preliminary discussions with several parties regarding potential investment in the Company and/or acquisition of the Company,\" including Vector Capital IV., L.P. and its affiliates, which owned 9.9% of Tangoe's outstanding common stock, Clearlake Capital Partners IV GP, L.P. and its affiliates, which, as of June 23, 2016, owned 14.9% of Tangoe's outstanding common stock, and Marlin and its associates, which, as of June 24, 2016, owned 10.4% of Tangoe's outstanding common stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60, 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, in December 2016, Marlin verbally proposed a transaction at $7.00 per share, and Clearlake and Vector proposed a joint transaction at a price ranging between $7.00 and $7.50 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Plaintiffs allege that, on December 29, 2016, Tangoe \"received a revised letter from Marlin substantially similar to the letter of December 27, 2016, but confirming that neither continued listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq nor audited financial statements would be a closing condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Also, on that day, Marlin submitted a second amendment to its Schedule 13D with the SEC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The amendment stated that Marlin wanted to acquire \"all of the outstanding common stock, through a tender offer or otherwise, for $7.50 per share in cash, subject to, among other things, reaching agreement on all material terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On January 3, 2017, Tangoe allegedly issued a press release \"confirming receipt of the proposal from Marlin and the joint proposal from Clearlake and Vector, that the Company had notified Nasdaq that it was unlikely to complete the Restatement by the March 10, 2017 deadline, that the Board would carefully evaluate the proposals and was focused on maximizing stockholder value, and that the Company had retained Stifel as financial advisor to assist in these efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On March 9, 2017, Tangoe allegedly received a letter from Marlin proposing to acquire Tangoe for a cash tender offer of $6.50 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. On March 28, 2017, Mr. Foy and Mr. Kokos spoke with Marlin representatives about integrating the two management teams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. On April 28, 2017, Tangoe and Marlin announced a merger agreement at $6.50 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the $6.50 offer price \"does not represent fair value for Tangoe\n   stockholders,\" and that Tangoe previously had been trading at an average price above $8.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Plaintiffs allege that, since Tangoe went public in 2011, it \"has established itself as a leader in the connection lifecycle management space,\" that it \"holds a significant size advantage to many of its competitors,\" that its clients include established entities such as \"IBM, SAP, American Express, PWC, FedEx, Kraft Foods, CVS, and Comcast,\" and that it has maintained a net cash balance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that analysts project \"a positive outlook for Tangoe,\" including growth and high price targets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. Plaintiffs therefore allege that \"the fluctuations in Tangoe's stock price did not reflect changes in its underlying value, but the lack of information disseminated by the Tangoe Board.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that Tangoe possessed information that it concealed from stockholders and the public related to the Restatement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result, stockholders did not have the means \"to evaluate the choice they were being asked to make-accept the Offer Price that reflected the depressed value caused by the Company's regulatory non-compliance or stay the course in hopes that the Company might return to the good graces of regulators.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.

Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that information that Defendants had adjusted the thresholds for their payouts \"would have informed stockholders how much the failure to complete the Restatement cost them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants manipulated financial projections and omitted material information from statements to \"make the eventual Offer Price appear more attractive to Tangoe stockholders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Plaintiffs allege that when Tangoe published a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, it failed to disclose key components of the analysis that would have been \"material to Tangoe stockholders,\" and their omission rendered the Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (part of the Recommendation Statement) \"incomplete and misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-93. Plaintiffs also allege that two other analyses, Selected Company and Selected Transactions, \"the Recommendation Statement failed to disclose individual multiples for the companies and transactions observed in the analysis,\" leaving stockholders without \"the information to determine how the selected companies and transactions actually compared to\" Tangoe or the Transaction with Marlin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that the analyses failed to include an implied valuation range for the comparable analyses, and the \"only valuation performed, the DCF, was watered down by artificially deflated projections and incompletely disclosed to stockholders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.

They have not alleged that Defendants intentionally or recklessly lied about their ability to complete the Restatement. For example, Plaintiffs allege that Tangoe stated that \"[a]lthough the Company cannot at this time estimate when it will complete the Restatement and file its restated financial statements and its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, it is\n   <em>\n    diligently pursuing completion of the Restatement\n   </em>\n   and intends to file the Form 10-K as soon as reasonably practicable.\" CAC \u00b6 34 (emphasis added by Plaintiffs in CAC).

Plaintiffs, however, have failed to plead with particularity under Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA that Defendants acted with a motive to commit fraud-and not simply that they changed their mind about the best decisions for the company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 6 (\"[I]t makes no sense to require a company to guess about an uncertain future date for restatement completion-something\n   <em>\n    that itself\n   </em>\n   could be challenged as misleading.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Plaintiffs have also failed to link the incentive structure in the EARCAs with a motive to commit fraud. Plaintiffs alleged that \"the Board acted selfishly and disloyally by pushing through an inadequate offer with Marlin and, at the same time, ensuring that millions of dollars in equity award equivalents would vest upon consummating the Transaction.\" CAC \u00b6 56. Plaintiffs further alleged that the Individual Defendants \"understood that they were\n   set to collectively receive nearly $5 million in exchange for their measurement shares under the EARCAs\" if they voted for the transaction with Marlin, and \"[i]f the Director Defendants voted against the Transaction and opted to complete the Restatement and proceed as a standalone company, their EARCAs would have been worthless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As Defendants explained, however, the EARCAs were structured to \"incentivize[ ] them to maximize shareholder value whether through the Restatement or a sale.\" Reply at 3-4. Moreover, Defendants disclosed the details of the EARCAs in the Restatement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 14D-9 at 8-9 (\"The Company is party to retention agreements with each of Messrs.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The Recommendation Statement explains that the Board engaged in an exclusivity agreement with Marlin after other potential financial sponsors withdrew, after they had reviewed Tangoe's financial health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Form 14D-9 at 26. Plaintiffs' argument rests on the notion that, if Tangoe had pursued the Restatement, it would have been in a better position to attract higher offers than Marlin's $6.50 cash offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to Mot. Dismiss at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   But the Recommendation Statement explains that the Board continued to pursue completing the Restatement until the financial and time burden of completing it-and remaining delisted from NASDAQ while in that process-put enough strain on the Company that the Board grew aware that a proxy contest loomed and the best avenue out of its problematic financial statements could be a merger.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Form 14D-9 at 17 (explaining that, beginning in August 2015, Tangoe \"held over 25 meetings concerning the oversight of the Restatement,\" sought an audit of financial statements by an independent audit firm, and spent approximately $16 million in an effort to complete the Restatement);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (explaining that the Company considered \"the fiduciary duties of directors in considering or responding to acquisition proposals, as well as the applicable requirements ... to hold an annual meeting if requested by stockholders to do so and limitations on the Company's ability to solicit proxies should such a meeting be held in light of the pending Restatement\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (explaining that on December 20, 2016, the Board held a meeting and \"heard reports on the status of the Restatement, including preliminary indications that completion of a Restatement by the March 10, 2017 deadline might not be practicable,\" and considered proposed timelines from Marlin and Clearlake and Vector). Moreover, in the Board's explanation of its reasons for its recommendation in the Recommendation Statement, it explicitly considers whether $6.50 is an attractive value, and concludes that Tangoe would have been unlikely to have a higher competitive offer either from another entity or from Marlin.
