(together, \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Golf Village\") move for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"), preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction against Defendants the City of Powell, Ohio (the \"City\"), David Betz in his official capacity as the City's Director of Development (the \"Zoning Administrator\"), and their agents (together, \"Defendants\"). Mot., ECF No. 2 (\"Motion\"). For the following reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Specifically, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction,\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' request for a TRO, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the late 1990s, Plaintiffs acquired more than 900 acres of property in Delaware County to develop a planned community known as the Golf Village Community. Plaintiffs seek to develop a residential hotel on a parcel of that property known as Subarea G (the \"Hotel Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2004, Golf Village prepared a plat (the \"Final Plat\") for the Hotel Property, which the City approved in September 2004. Ver. Compl. \u00b6 29, ECF No. 1. The Final Plat indicates that Lot 3155, a parcel located adjacent to the Hotel Property's east side, would be dedicated to the City for use as a public park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30; Ex. C, ECF No. 1-3. The Final Plat also identifies two private roads-Sheridan and Moreland Streets-that provide ingress and egress from Seldom Seen Road and Sawmill Parkway to the privately-owned lots within the Golf Village Community, including the Hotel Property. Ver. Compl. \u00b6 31; ECF No. 1. The eastern side of Sheridan Street as well as the northern and western sides of Moreland Street were constructed on the Hotel Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2010, Golf Village transferred Lot 3155 to the City through a Limited Warranty Deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. It is undisputed, however, that Golf Village did not then, nor has it ever, granted Defendants an access easement over the Hotel Property or Sheridan and Moreland Streets for Defendants\n   to access the Park Property. Mot. 1-2, ECF No. 2; Tr. 5, (counsel on behalf of Defendants stating \"We admit, all [cards] face up, Your Honor, it was not put in the easement, it was not put in the plat, it was not put in the deed.\"); Tr. 9, ECF No. 25 (counsel on behalf of Defendants stating \"[a]gain, we freely admit there is not an easement referenced in the deed nor the plat....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 22, 2017, Defendant Betz, the City's Zoning Administrator, contacted Golf Village on behalf of the City to request an ingress/egress easement from Seldom Seen Road over Sheridan Street and the Hotel Property to create an entrance to the Park Property. Ver. Compl. at \u00b6 44, ECF No. 1. Golf Village did not grant the request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The City revised and finalized its construction plans for the Park (\"Construction Plans\") in early 2018. The Title Sheet of the Construction Plans states the following in bold, capitalized font: \"Approval of these plans is contingent upon the City securing an access easement to the park from Seldom Seen Road along Sheridan Street from the property owner.\" Ex. A at 1, ECF No. 1-1. The Title Sheet was executed by Defendants on February 9, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is undisputed that the City approved the Construction Plans without securing an access easement from Golf Village to use the Hotel Property or to use Sheridan and Moreland Streets. Tr. 5, 9, ECF No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 14, 2018, despite not having secured an easement, the City informed its contractor that the City had \"made arrangements\" to use Golf Village's Hotel Property and Sheridan Street. Ver. Compl. \u00b6 48, ECF No. 1; Ex. H, ECF No. 1-8. Shortly thereafter, in April 2018, the City and/or its agents destroyed the curb along the east side of Sheridan Street, built a construction entrance, and began using a portion of Golf Village's Hotel Property to access the Park Property. Ver. Compl. \u00b6 52, ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs allege that this was done with no advance notice to Golf Village and without authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the City will continue to enter and use Golf Village's Property if not enjoined. They further insist that the Construction Plans establish that, if not enjoined, the City will also: (1) construct a permanent entrance to the Park over Golf Village's Hotel Property, (2) clear trees and vegetation and fill certain wetlands on the Hotel Property, (3) dig a trench across Golf Village's Hotel Property and through Sheridan Street, and (4) convert Sheridan and Moreland Streets from private roads to public streets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 19, 2018, Golf Village contacted the City and requested that Defendants cease and desist their activities on Golf Village's Hotel Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miller Deck, Exhibit A \u00b6 3, ECF No. 2-1. The City responded, insisting that verbal representations and preliminary planning documents grant authorization allowing entry onto Plaintiffs' Property without an access easement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Plaintiffs then filed this action seeking injunctive relief on April 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 2, 2018, this Court held an initial hearing on Plaintiffs' request for a TRO. Following the hearing, the parties agreed to a consent injunction order to be put in place for sixty days. Order, ECF No. 20; Order, ECF No. 22. Following a telephone status conference held before this Court on July 5, 2018, the parties agreed to extend the consent injunction for an additional thirty days. Order, ECF No. 27. On July 31, 2018, the parties filed a joint status report indicating, at bottom, that the parties have not and will not be able to resolve this dispute. ECF No. 28. Therefore, the Court will proceed to resolve\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for preliminary injunctive relief on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court considers four factors when determining whether to grant a request for a preliminary injunction: (1) whether the movant has established a substantial probability of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) whether an injunction would substantially harm third parties; and (4) whether an injunction would serve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winnett v. Caterpillar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690659\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/404/#p408\">\n    609 F.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (6th Cir. 2010). The factors are not prerequisites; rather, they must be balanced.\n   <em>\n    Capobianco, D.C. v.

For instance, \"a strong showing of irreparable harm, decidedly outweighing harm to the defendant, may justify an injunction even where the movant cannot make a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, as long as the plaintiff can show serious questions going to the merits of the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Worthington Foods, Inc. v.

In this case, Plaintiffs' argument for irreparable harm centers, in part, around their constitutional claims: they insist that irreparable harm is presumed where there is a constitutional deprivation. Mot. 15, ECF No. 2; Reply 12, ECF No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that courts have held \"that a plaintiff can demonstrate that a denial of an injunction will cause irreparable harm if the claim is based upon a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Overstreet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11389338\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/566/#p578\">\n    305 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   578 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

In making this argument, though, Plaintiffs have cited to only one case from this Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Ohio Aug. 27, 2010). Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   as support for the broad proposition that a finding of irreparable harm is appropriate where real property is involved because of the \"willingness of equity courts to treat particular pieces of real property as unique.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203447614\">\n    2010 WL 3447614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. The property at issue in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , however, was the plaintiff's residence, a factor noted in the court's reasoning. Other courts in this Circuit, in contrast, have analyzed irreparable harm differently where the property involved was commercial real estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mount Clemens Inv.

They point to Defendants' Construction Plans to demonstrate that Defendants intend to: (1) construct a permanent entrance to the Park over Golf Village's Hotel Property; (2) clear trees and vegetation and fill certain wetlands on the Hotel Property; (3) dig a trench across Golf Village's Hotel Property and through Sheridan Street; and (4) convert Sheridan and Moreland Streets from private roads to public streets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55-60. In light of the continuing and permanent nature of Defendants' planned use of Plaintiffs' property, and the unique nature of real property, the Court finds that the facts and equities here warrant finding that Plaintiffs' have demonstrated irreparable harm from Defendants' use and possession of their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Harm to Third Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds that the issuance of an injunction will not cause harm to third parties. Defendants argue that the City, its contractors, and its citizens will be harmed by the delay to construction of the park and increased construction costs. However, Defendants have admitted that alternative access to the Park Property exists. Further, there are other mechanisms that would allow Defendants to legally access Plaintiffs' property, which Defendants have also admitted, such as\n   pursuing a quick-take action. For these reasons, the Court finds that this factor weighs in Plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The final question is whether the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction. Plaintiffs' arguments focus on the public's interest in preventing violations of constitutional rights. Such an argument is unavailing here since Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on either of their constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Even if Plaintiffs had argued, for example, that an injunction would serve the public interest in allowing private companies to protect their private property from trespass, at least one court in this district has found that such an interest is private, not public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Easterling v. Cassano's Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-CV-032,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201396462\">\n    2015 WL 1396462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 25, 2015) (\"Defendants assert that the public interest lies in the ability of private companies to protect its private property from trespass by individuals who are verbally abusive to its employees and disruptive to its customers. The Court sees this as a private interest, as opposed to a public interest. Thus, this factor is neutral.\"). On the other hand, courts have recognized that protecting private property rights can be a legitimate state interest, albeit in a different context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lexington H-L Servs., Inc. v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cty.

Ky. July 19, 2018) (\"The City's interest in reducing blight and litter and protecting private property are significant.\"). Moreover, as both parties point out, the Sixth Circuit has held that \"the public interest lies in promoting public confidence in the integrity of local government....\"\n   <em>\n    Overstreet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11389338\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/566/#p578\">\n    305 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, though, where the City seeks to build a park for the public's benefit, but where it is likely that the City has trespassed on private property in order to do so, this public interest arguably cuts both ways. Thus, the Court finds this factor to be neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion on Plaintiffs' Request for a Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the equities weigh in favor of granting Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Permanent Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition to requesting a TRO and preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs also request a permanent injunction against Defendants. However, Plaintiffs have not shown \"actual success\" on the merits for any of their claims, nor could they do so at this stage of the proceedings. Such a showing is necessary to be entitled to permanent injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amoco Prod.

Plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion, ECF No. 2, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Defendants are hereby preliminarily enjoined from further use, occupation, or possession of Plaintiffs' Hotel Property and Sheridan and Moreland Streets until such time as this matter is resolved on the merits, Defendants provide the Court with grounds for relief from this Order, or a permanent injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Given the procedural history of the case, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' request for a TRO is moot, and thus the request is denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Court also notes that courts have found inverse condemnation proceedings to be an adequate state remedy in similar cases under Ohio law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harris v. City of Akron\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515189\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/1396/#p1400\">\n     20 F.3d 1396\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1400 (6th Cir. 1994) ;\n    <em>\n     DeFranco v.

Ohio Nov. 7, 2012).
