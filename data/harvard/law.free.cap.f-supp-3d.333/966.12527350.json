Beyer's allegations arise out of a report by Google Inc.'s team of expert cybersecurity analysts, Project Zero, which detail alleged vulnerabilities in a component of Symantec's software, the AntiVirus Decomposer Engine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 25. Beyer argues that Symantec advertises that the Affected Products \"protects against the latest online threats\" or \"protects against viruses, spyware, hackers, rootkits, identity theft, phishing scams, and fraudulent Web sites\" while knowing that its products suffered from a core decomposer engine defect that exposed entire computer operating systems to various security vulnerabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-24. Beyer further argues that Symantec failed to disclose that it did not implement patches for third-party source code that it used throughout its product line, and various Symantec misrepresentations and omissions form the basis for his causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beyer asserts five causes of action, namely (i) a California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\") claim,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201750\">\n    Cal.

Both the Symantec and Norton products contain a key component called the AntiVirus Decomposer Engine. This component unpacks compressed executable files so that they can be scanned for malicious code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, Beyer alleges this Engine scanned for malicious files by unpacking and examining compressed executable files within the kernel or the root, which resulted from Symantec unnecessarily assigning the highest privilege levels to the file scanning and analysis function.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The exposure of potentially malicious files in this high-privilege environment opened the operating systems up to corruption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, Beyer suggests that Symantec violated a key cybersecurity best practice, the principle of least privilege, which states that software should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the task.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (it appears that Symantec also prescribes the best practice of \"run[ning] the principle of least privilege where possible to limit the impact of exploit by threats\" as far back as 2007.). Beyer further alleges that Symantec exposed users' computers to a \"critical vulnerability\" by failing to implement industry-standard security measures such as \"sandboxing,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , opening files in an isolated virtual environment separate from critical processes and programs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Beyer also alleges that Symantec relied on third party open source code to design this Engine but had failed to update the open source code for at least seven years, resulting in vulnerabilities that caused \"total information disclosure\" and \"total compromise of system integrity\" (\"Outdated Source Code Defect\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, Beyer alleges that Symantec sold software that did not conform to cybersecurity best practices, did not reasonably protect users' computer systems against online threats, and made users' computer systems more susceptible to cyberattacks than they would have otherwise been without the software.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beyer alleges he purchased five Norton Products containing these defects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 20-24. He seeks recovery for the second and third purchases only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 22 (\"Opp\"), at 8 n.3.

Beyer alleges that both Norton Products and Enterprise Products incorporate the AntiVirus Decomposer Engine and were affected by the alleged security flaws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

The UCL claim therefore survives irrespective of knowledge of falsity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As for the other claims, Symantec argues that the complaint does not allege that it knew of the defects. It points out that the earliest specific allegation of knowledge is when Project Zero revealed the defects in 2016, seven years after Beyer's 2009 purchase of the Second Software. The allegations that it knew of the defects at the time of sale, Symantec argues, are conclusory. Symantec singles out \u00b6 40 of the complaint, which alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   As the proprietary owner and licensor of the Affected Products, Symantec knew, or was otherwise reckless or willfully blind in not knowing, that its AntiVirus Decomposer Engine suffered from extremely serious defects, i.e., the High Privilege Defect and the Outdated Source Code Defect. Furthermore, Symantec knew, or was otherwise reckless or willfully blind in not knowing, that its security practices diverged significantly from its own best practices recommendations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Beyer's Opposition merely parrots this paragraph.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 22 (\"Opp.\") at 16. Despite this, the complaint sufficiently alleges knowledge, because it alleges that Symantec designed and produced the software in question. It plausibly follows from this fact that Symantec knew how the Second Software functioned, including that the software unpacked potentially malicious files in a high-privilege environment. It also plausibly follows that Symantec knew it had used third-party code and knew it did not patch that code when updates were released by the third parties. Furthermore, as early as 2007, Symantec published best-practice guidelines advising readers to the principle of least privilege and to keep third-party code updated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 21. Together, this suffices to establish knowledge, which need only be plead generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (\"Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be plead generally.\"). But the allegations suffice at the pleading stage. The CLRA and FAL claims therefore survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice Beyer's fraud claims as to the Third Software.

Defendant could and should have chosen one of many reasonably available alternatives, including not selling antivirus products that contained fundamental defects with the core engine, disclosing the defects to prospective purchasers, and/or not representing that its products were suitable for ordinary consumer or business use.
