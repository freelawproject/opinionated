RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Generally, following the issuance of the Court's Decision and Order of March 7, 2017, two claims of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint survived Defendants' motion for summary judgment: (1) Plaintiff's claim that Defendants were negligent in designing, manufacturing, and selling Risperdal as well as in failing to properly warn the general public of the risks and dangers of Risperdal ; and (2) Plaintiff's claim that Defendants are strictly liable for the injuries caused by (a) Risperdal's defective condition, (b) the failure to give appropriate warnings regarding the drug's dangers and adverse effects, and (c) their misleading representations regarding the risk of gynecomastia and hyperprolactinemia in adolescent patients. (Dkt. No. 108, at 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial on these two claims commenced on September 18, 2017. (Dkt. No. 163.) At the conclusion of the trial on September 27, 2017, the jury reached a verdict against Plaintiff with regard to his negligent design claim but in favor of him with regard to his failure-to-work claim, awarding him $500,000 for past and/or present pain and suffering and $500,000 in future pain and suffering; and Judgment was entered accordingly. (Dkt. Nos. 179, 180.) On October 25, 2017, Defendants filed the current motion for judgment a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 or, in the alternative, for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. (Dkt. No. 199.) Plaintiff has opposed this motion. (Dkt. No. 204, 205.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because this Decision and Order is intended primarily for the review of the parties, who have (in their memoranda of law) demonstrated an accurate understanding of the remainder of the relevant procedural history of this action, the Court will not summarize the remainder of that procedural history in detail in this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Parties' Briefing on Defendants' Motion Generally\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Generally, in their motion, Defendants assert the following arguments: (1) as a threshold matter, Defendant Janssen is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because (a) Plaintiff's failure-to-warn claim is preempted by federal law, (b) Plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence of proximate and medical causation, and (c) Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendant Johnson &amp; Johnson is liable; and (2) in the alternative, Defendant Janssen is entitled to a new trial because (a) the jury's verdict is against the weight of the evidence, (b) the conduct of Plaintiff's counsel warrants a new trial, and (c) Plaintiff's award is excessive (warranting either remittitur or a new trial). (Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Generally, in opposition to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff asserts the following arguments: (1) Defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because (a) their preemption arguments are meritless, unavailing and frivolous, (b) their arguments regarding causation are similarly unavailing and (c) Defendant Johnson &amp; Johnson is liable just as Defendant Janssen is liable; and (2) there is no legal basis warranting a new trial because (a) the verdict is supported by compelling evidence, (b) there is no evidence of prejudice against Defendants created by the actions of Plaintiff's counsel, and (c) Plaintiff's award is not excessive but is comparable to awards in identical cases. (Dkt. No. 205.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Generally, in reply, Defendants repeat the arguments asserted in their memorandum\n   of law-in chief, albeit modified to reply to Plaintiff's responses. (Dkt. No. 206.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. GOVERNING LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard Governing Motions for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made under Rule 50(a), the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment-or if the motion addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict, no later than 28 days after the jury was discharged-the movant may file a\n   <em>\n    renewed\n   </em>\n   motion for judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Fed.

Defendants' Memorandum of Law-in Chief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In their memorandum of law-in chief, Defendants assert three arguments on the subject of preemption: (1) an argument that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (2004) (which governed the content of the \"Warnings\" section on Risperdal's label because it was the regulation in effect at the time Plaintiff started taking Risperdal ) should be interpreted to mean that Defendants were precluded from using the \"Changes Being Effected\" (or \"CBE\") process to update Risperdal's warning label; (2) an argument that, in any event, there is \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have approved the proposed labeling during the relevant time period; and (3) an argument that contrary arguments by Plaintiff are unavailing. (Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   More specifically, Defendants' first argument can be broken down into the following three parts: (a) while\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.70\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(i) permits a manufacturer to \"add or strengthen a ... warning\" without prior FDA approval, during the time in question the content of that warning was governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (2004), which stated that \"[a] specific warning relating to ...

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, Defendants' second argument can be broken down into the following two parts: (a) in any event, there is \"clear evidence\" that FDA would not have approved the proposed labeling during the relevant time period, because (i) despite the fact that Defendant Janssen asked the FDA to include safety information regarding pediatric dosing on Risperdal's label, and the fact that the FDA knew that Risperdal was being used off-label in pediatric patients, the FDA denied Defendant Janssen's request because it believed that adding dosing information for an unapproved population would encourage use of Risperdal for off-label purposes, and (ii) subsequently the FDA repeatedly approved Risperdal's label without requesting any changes regarding pediatric use until October 2006; and (b) rather, a manufacturer of prescription medication may update a label without prior FDA approval only if it acquires\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   information regarding\n   <em>\n    serious\n   </em>\n   hazards associated with the medication, and here the relationship between antipsychotics and hyperprolactinemia was not\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   information because it had been discussed in basic psychiatry textbooks for decades, and the FDA does not consider gynecomastia a\n   <em>\n    serious\n   </em>\n   adverse event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, Defendants' third argument can be broken down into the following three parts: (a) the FDA's statement in the 1979 Federal Register (that a manufacturer of prescription medicine may add warnings to labeling) is merely a general statement paralleling the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), which again,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , requires a\n   <em>\n    serious\n   </em>\n   adverse reaction; (b)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(9)(vi) did not allow Defendants to unilaterally add to the Risperdal labeling information regarding Risperdal use in children because the section required a hazard to be described in the Precautions subsection of the labeling only if it was specific to children and gynecomastia was not specific to children; and (c) the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   conclusion of Plaintiff's regulatory expert, Dr. Laura M. Plunkett, Ph.D., that manufacturers of prescription medicine can unilaterally add safety information regarding off-label is contrary to both the plain language of the regulations and her own concession that Defendants could not unilaterally add safety information relative to unapproved populations.

Analysis of This Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After carefully considering the matter, the Court answers the above-described question (i.e., whether Plaintiff's failure-to-warn claim is preempted by federal law) in the affirmative for the reasons stated by Defendants in their memoranda of law. To those reasons, the Court adds the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court is especially persuaded by the second and third of Defendants' three general arguments described above in Part\n   III.A.1.a. of this Decision and Order (i.e., that clear evidence exists that the FDA would not have approved a change to the drug's label, and that contrary arguments are unavailing). In particular, the Court is persuaded by not only the arguments primarily relied on by Defendants in their memorandum of law-in chief and their reply memorandum of law but an argument more-obliquely relied on by Defendants: that the updated warning must have regarded a hazard that was\n   <em>\n    serious.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While the relevant regulations during the time in question permitted Defendants to \"add or strengthen a ... warning\" without prior FDA approval,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court construes those regulations as requiring, as a threshold matter, that the new warning regard a hazard that was \"serious.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties' regulatory experts appear to have agreed on this interpretation of the relevant regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Rather, Plaintiff spent much time at trial adducing the testimony of experts that, in their opinion, gynecomastia is a \"serious\" adverse event, which Defendant attempted to rebut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the issue is not whether, at the time of trial in September 2017 (or even at the time of Plaintiff's surgery in June 2014), an expert viewed gynecomastia as a \"serious\" adverse event. Rather, the issue is whether, between February or March of 2002 (when Plaintiff started taking Risperdal ) and August 2006 (when Plaintiff stopped taking Risperdal ), gynecomastia was a \"serious\" adverse event under the then-governing law: i.e., that it,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , either (1)\n   <em>\n    resulted\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    inpatient\n   </em>\n   hospitalization or (2)\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   surgical intervention to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   inpatient hospitalization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, regulatory experts\n   appear to have agreed on this definition of seriousness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After scouring the record, the Court has found insufficient evidence upon which a jury could rationally answer that question in the affirmative. For the sake of brevity, the Court will not linger on the fact that there appears to be a dearth of evidence that, when Plaintiff underwent surgery on June 24, 2014, he received\n   <em>\n    inpatient\n   </em>\n   hospitalization at Ellis Hospital. The Court will also set aside the fact that any inpatient hospitalization (at a psychiatric facility) that Plaintiff may still need due to his gynecomastia has (by definition) not been prevented by his 2014 surgery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   making it impossible to conclude that gynecomastia has\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   surgical intervention to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   inpatient hospitalization under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.32\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   More important is the fact that, while a November 2014 letter from a FDA senior official (stating that \"Gynecomastia is a common clinical manifestation of hyperprolactinemia, regardless or cause, and does not represent a serious adverse event as defined in 21 CFR 3l2.32(a)\") was not admitted into evidence because of Fed.

Even if Dr. Plunkett's current personal disagreement were relevant, she did not go so far as to testify that her personal opinion was so free of qualifications that it rose to one that gynecomastia\"\n   <em>\n    results\n   </em>\n   in ...\n   <em>\n    inpatient\n   </em>\n   hospitalization\" or \"require[s] ... surgical intervention to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   [inpatient hospitalization].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did she even testify that she held any such a view between 2002 and 2006, or that her current view regarded the period of 2002 to 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Dr. Plunkett certainly did not testify that the \"investigators\" or \"sponsors\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the clinical studies on which she relied (whose views control the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   definition of seriousness)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   held such a view before 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the contrary, she testified that, before 2006, two investigators (Dr. Robert L. Findling and Dr. Jan Croonenberghs) and a sponsor (Johnson &amp; Johnson)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   of RIS-INT 41 and RIS-INT 70 held the contrary view. For example, Dr. Plunkett testified that, in an article summarizing the RIS-INT 41 and RIS-INT 70 clinical studies, an investigator of those studies (Dr. Findling) expressed a view (specifically, that \"[t]here was no direct correlation between prolactin elevation and [side effects hypothetically attributable to prolactin]\") with which she disagreed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly,\n   Dr. Plunkett testified that, in abstracts of articles regarding the RIS-INT 41 and RIS-INT 70 clinical studies, an investigator (Dr. Croonenberghs) and an employee of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Dr. Reyes) did not even reference gynecomastia but concluded that Risperdal was safe and effective for use in children with conduct disorder over two years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, this testimony by Dr. Plunkett makes sense given that the RIS-INT 41 and RIS-INT 70 clinical studies nowhere contain a view by an investigator or sponsor that gynecomastia either resulted in inpatient hospitalization or required surgical intervention to prevent inpatient hospitalization before 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In short, because it is undisputed that gynecomastia was not a \"serious\" hazard pursuant to the regulations in existence during the time in question, the Court finds that Defendants could not have unilaterally warned of gynecomastia pursuant to those regulations: even if Defendants had tried to do so, Plaintiff's regulatory expert conceded (as described above) that the FDA would not have approved the proposed change.\n   <em>\n    See, supra,\n   </em>\n   note 10 of this Decision and Order.

Having now done so, the Court finds that the issue of preemption has been clarified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court notes also that, in rendering the above-described findings, it does not accept any argument that Defendants could have warned of the risks of gynecomastia on the pre-2006 labeling through other means (such as sales force communica\n   tions, medical education, \"Dear Doctor\" letters, regional advisory committee meetings, its website, or medical literature),\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   because (even assuming that the above-discussed regulations did not also govern those communications)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff adduced no argument (or admissible evidence) in support of such a theory of liability at trial. Nor does the Court accept any argument that, if Defendants were precluded from warning of gynecomastia, then they should not have permitted or encouraged its off-label use at all, because, again, Plaintiff adduced no argument (or admissible evidence) in support of such a theory of liability at trial. Nor does the Court consider any argument that Defendants somehow defrauded the FDA by not disclosing certain information to it, because such an theory of liability is futile in that it is preempted by federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendants' Memorandum of Law-in Chief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In their memorandum of law-in chief, Defendants assert two arguments on the subject of causation: (1) no alternative warning would have affected the prescribing decisions of Plaintiff's treating doctors, because (a) no alternative label would have affected the prescribing decisions of Plaintiff's expert Dr. Suguna C. Reddy, M.D. (b) no alternative label would have affected the prescribing decisions of Plaintiff's expert Dr. Robertson B. Tucker, M.D., and (c) no alternative warning would have affected the prescribing decisions of Plaintiff's other prescribing physicians; and (2) Plaintiff has not established that his alleged gynecomastia is causally related to Risperdal as a matter of law, because (a) Plaintiff has failed to put forward a prima facie case of general or specific causation (given that [i] Plaintiff's general causation expert Dr. Plunkett conceded she is not an expert regarding causation, and the fact that her opinion is contradicted by the literature she cited, [ii] Plaintiff's expert Dr. Matthew Leinung, M.D., merely assumed that general causation had been proven, [iii] Dr. Leinung failed to properly rule out obesity as a potential cause of Plaintiff's gynecomastia, [iv] Dr. Leinung also failed to properly rule out marijuana and puberty as potential causes of Plaintiff's gynecomastia, and [v] there is undisputed testimony that elevated prolactin levels related to Risperdal cannot cause\n   gynecomastia prior to puberty), and (b) Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that any psychological suffering is linked to his use of Risperdal.

Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In his opposition memorandum of law, Plaintiff asserts the following two arguments on the subject of causation: (1) Plaintiff put forward more than sufficient evidence that Defendants' failure to adequately warn of the frequency of the risk of gynecomastia in children/adolescents proximately caused Plaintiff's injuries, because (a) Plaintiff's prescribing physician Dr. Reddy testified that she would have disclosed any frequent risks (e.g., those of gynecomastia ) had they been contained in the\n   <em>\n    Physicians' Desk Reference\n   </em>\n   , (b) Plaintiff's prescribing physician Dr. Tucker testified that he would have disclosed gynecomastia as a risk of Risperdal if the manufacturers had shared information indicating that it was a frequent risk during the relevant time period, and (c) Plaintiff's mother testified that she never would have consented to Plaintiff taking Risperdal had she been told during the relevant time period that there was even a chance he could develop gynecomastia ; and (2) Plaintiff put forward more than sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Defendants' failure to warn proximately caused Plaintiff's injuries, because (a) Dr. Plunkett testified within a reasonable degree of medical/scientific certainty that Risperdal can cause gynecomastia, (b) Dr. Leinung testified within a reasonable degree of medical/scientific certainty that Risperdal caused Plaintiff's bilateral gynecomastia ; and (c) Plaintiff's expert Dr. George S. Glass, M.D., Plaintiff's mother and Plaintiff's sister all testified in a manner that gave the jury more than sufficient evidence from which to reasonably find that Risperdal was a substantial factor in causing/exacerbating Plaintiff's psychological suffering.

Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In their reply memorandum of law, Defendants assert the following two arguments on the subject of causation: (1) Plaintiff has not shown how an alternative label would have affected the prescribing decisions of Plaintiff's treating physicians because (a) Plaintiff does not address Defendants' argument that Plaintiff failed to introduce any evidence that an alternative warning would have affected the prescribing decisions of Plaintiff's physicians who did not testify at trial, (b) Plaintiff's reliance on Dr. Reddy's testimony is insufficient given that, in fact, she testified that she warned Plaintiff and his mother of the risk of gynecomastia, and (c) Plaintiff's reliance on Dr. Tucker's testimony is insufficient given that he testified (and Plaintiff's counsel conceded) that, even with an alternative warning, he would have prescribed Risperdal for Plaintiff; and (2) in his response, Plaintiff addresses none of the numerous flaws identified by Defendants in Plaintiff's arguments regarding the relationship between Risperdal and Plaintiff's injuries, such as (a) the fact that Dr. Plunkett conceded that she was not a causation expert and the fact that her opinion was contradicted by the literature she cited, (b) the fact that Dr. Leinung offered insufficient support for his general causation opinion and filed to properly rule out other likely causes of Plaintiff's gynecomastia, and (c) the fact that undisputed testimony demonstrated that elevated prolactin levels related to Risperdal cannot cause gynecomastia prior to puberty.

Analysis of This Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   After carefully considering the matter, the Court answers the above-described question (i.e., whether Plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence of proximate and medical causation) in the affirmative for the reasons stated by Defendants in their memoranda of law. To those reasons, the Court adds the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court is especially persuaded that Plaintiff has failed to establish general causation for the second reason described above in Part III.B.1.a. of this Decision and Order (that, as a threshold matter, Dr. Plunkett admitted to not being a causation expert, that, in any event, her opinion is unsupported by the literature she cited, and that Dr. Leinung's opinion was unreliable in that it only assumed general causation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With regard to the testimony of Dr. Plunkett, in response to the question, \"[H]ave you come here today to offer opinion to this jury with respect to whether or not Risperdal can cause gynecomastia ?\" Dr. Plunkett responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   I'm not a causation expert, as a physician but certainly as a pharmacologist and a toxicologist, yes, I have done a review of the scientific information, the clinical information and come to an opinion that indeed Risperdal can cause gynecomastia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Dkt. No. 181, at 59 [attaching page \"129\" of Trial Transcript].) Given the importance of causation in light of the facts of this\n   case, Defendants' reliance on Dr. Plunkett's admission to not being a causation expert is well placed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In any event, even if the Court were to look past this significant admission to the review of literature on which Dr. Plunkett's opinion is based, the fact remains that, while scientific literature may certainly constitute the sort of \"sufficient facts or date\" required by Fed. R. Evid. 702(b), the purported expert must demonstrate that the literature in question sufficiently supports her opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Plunkett did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Dr. Plunkett specifically identified only three pieces of scientific literature as the bases for her opinion: (1) Dr. Robert L. Findling's 2003 paper \"Prolactin Levels During Long-Term Risperidone Treatment in Children and Adolescents\"; (2) Dr. Jan Croonenberghs' 2005 paper \"Risperidone in Children With Disruptive Behavior Disorders and Subaverage Intelligence\"; and (3) Dr. Magali Reyes' 2006 paper \"Long-Term Use of Risperidone in Children with Disruptive Behavior Disorders and Subaverage Intelligence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The first piece of literature stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that, although gynecomastia reported in some of the 592 children and adolescents studied, \"[n]o correlation was found between [symptoms hypothetically attributable to prolactin] and prolactin levels, even when male gynecomastia during puberty was included.\" (Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 7, at 8.) The reason that the underlying study did not support such a correlation is that \"[o]ne of the deficiencies of this analysis is that there was no long-term control group to show the incidences of gynecomastia, galactorrhea, or menstrual irregularities that may occur normally in such a population.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, while \"[e]levated prolactin has ... been associated with gynecomastia...\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2), an observed association between Risperdal and gynecomastia is, without more, insufficient to support an opinion that Risperdal is capable of causing gynecomastia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beyer v.

No. 199, Attach. 8, at 6, 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   As in the first piece of the literature, this lack of a control group was expressly acknowledged as a \"limitation\" of the study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The third piece of literature stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that, although gynecomastia reported in some of the 48 children and adolescents studied, \"occurrence of gynecomastia was not related to increases in serum prolactin levels.\" (Dkt.

This is because, \"[a]lthough there were several potentially prolactin-related [adverse events], it should be noted that some of these, such as gynecomastia in boys over the age of 10 years, often also present as a normal part of puberty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) As in the first and second pieces of the literature, this lack of a control group was expressly acknowledged as a \"limitation[ ]\" of the study.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 181, at 59, 61, 63, 71, 87 [attaching pages \"129,\" \"131,\" \"132,\" \"141\" and \"157\" of Trial Transcript, containing testimony of Dr. Plunkett]; Dkt. No. 183, at 40 [attaching page \"350\" of Trial Transcript, containing testimony of Dr. Plunkett].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The closest Dr. Plunkett came to basing her opinion on sufficient facts or data under under Fed. R. Evid. 702(b) was when she relied on data referenced in an unpublished draft of the first piece of scientific literature (i.e., the paper by Dr. Findling). (Dkt. No. 182, at 18-20 [attaching pages \"217\" through \"219\" of Trial Transcript, containing testimony of Dr. Plunkett].) More specifically, Dr. Plunkett relied on data that she characterized as finding a statistically significant association between prolactin levels and adverse events related to prolactin during weeks eight to twelve of the study (which portion she states was omitted from the published paper). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Admittedly, this reliance presents a close question for the Court. However, several problems plague this reliance: (1) Dr. Plunkett did not actually rely on data that was published in a peer-reviewed article but on a\n   <em>\n    table\n   </em>\n   that was not admitted into evidence and that was prepared not by the author of the paper but by a third-party company;\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Dr. Plunkett myopically\n   viewed the data, considering it in a vacuum (e.g., without considering other data showing that prolactin levels subsequently declined to within, or very close to, normal range);\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) Dr. Plunkett relied on the data almost exclusively to draw a conclusion (i.e., an intent by Defendants to mislead physicians) that was within the exclusive province of the jury to decide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most importantly, Dr. Plunkett failed to\n   <em>\n    explain\n   </em>\n   how the (unadmitted) data purportedly showed a correlation between Risperdal and gynecomastia : as explained above, even when data showing an association is considered, a correlation between Risperdal and gynecomastia cannot be drawn without a control group. The jury was essentially left with her bare assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Simply stated, there is so great an analytical gap between the facts and/or data relied on and the general-causation opinion proffered by Dr. Plunkett as to render her opinion not \"based\" on them under Fed.

Those pages indeed reflect no such identification by Dr. Leinung. (Dkt. No. 185, at 81-82 [attaching pages \"625\" and \"626\" of Trial Transcript, containing testimony of Dr. Leinung].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In response, Plaintiff relies on page \"617\" of the trial transcript, wherein Dr. Leinung testified that he previously diagnosed Plaintiff with bilateral gynecomastia\"secondary at least in part to prolonged use of Risperdal.\" However, that page and the prior page of the transcript show that Dr. Leinung merely\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   that the cause of the gynecomastia was Risperdal.

No. 185, at 72-73 [attaching pages \"616\" and \"617\" of Trial Transcript, containing testimony of Dr. Leinung].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on pages \"672\" and \"673\" of the trial transcript, wherein Dr. Leinung testified that Risperdal caused Plaintiff's bilateral gynecomastia. However, those pages of the transcript show only that Dr. Leinung's opinion of causation is based on (1) a differential diagnosis (discussed in the following paragraph), and (2) a \"review of the literature,\" the \"preponderance\n   of [which]\" he asserts \"show[s] that Risperdal has a higher association with gynecomastia.\" (Dkt.

Setting aside the lack of any specificity as to what \"literature\" Dr. Leinung relied on, to the extent he was relying on the literature and/or studies discussed above, that reliance was misplaced: it is insufficient to conclude the existence of causation from evidence of mere association, for the reasons discussed above in this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that Dr. Leinung's opinion of general causation actually relied on a differential diagnosis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on a careful review of Dr. Leinung's trial testimony, the Court finds that Defendants are correct that his general-causation opinion relied on a differential diagnosis.

Defendants' Memorandum of Law-in Chief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In their memorandum of law-in chief, Defendants assert two arguments on the subject of attorney misconduct: (1) an argument that Plaintiff's counsel engaged in\n   improper conduct by (a) eliciting the jury's sympathy through (i) constantly making personal remarks in both his arguments and questions (referring to his lack of professional skills and/or experience, the number of doctors in his family, and the fact that he was bullied as a child, despite the Court's directives not to do so) and (ii) recklessly or intentionally necessitating frequent admonishment from the Court (through disregarding the Court's directives), which placed the Court, in the eyes of the jury, in what amounted to an adversarial position, and (b) continually asserting the truth of Plaintiff's case, vouching for his witnesses (and seeking his witnesses to vouch for each other), offering his personal opinions about the evidence, testifying when he could not otherwise introduce evidence, and seeking to introduce evidence or elicit testimony after sustained objections; and (2) an argument that the cumulative impact of all of this improper conduct prejudiced Defendants in that it resulted an award of damages ($500,000 for past pain and suffering and $500,000 for future pain and suffering) that is excessive as compared to the awards typically given based on mere teasing and lowered self-esteem (especially when the plaintiff would have experienced those things anyway, to a certain extent, given his obesity and separately caused mental health issues). (Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In his opposition memorandum of law, Plaintiff asserts the following two arguments on the subject of attorney misconduct: (1) at most, the conduct of Plaintiff's attorney amounted to zealous advocacy as required by the relevant ethical rules; and (2) when viewed in the context of the entire trial, any such misconduct did not cause unfair prejudice to Defendants because (a) the vast majority of purported misconduct occurred sidebars (when music was playing to ensure that the jury could not hear the content of the discussions), (b) with regard to the purported conduct occurring outside of sidebars, Defendants met the misconduct with frequent objections, which were sustained, (c) on one occasion, the Court gave a curative instruction to the jury, and (d) indeed, an affidavit of one of the jurors confirms that the verdict was based on the evidence, not the conduct of Plaintiff's counsel. (Dkt. No. 205.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In their reply memorandum of law, Defendants assert the following four arguments on the subject of attorney misconduct: (1) the misconduct of Plaintiff's counsel was so repeated that it rose above the level of\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   misconduct; (2) Plaintiff's attempt to distinguish the current case from those cited by Defendants fails because, as do the cases cited by Defendants, the current case involves attorney misrepresentations of evidence; (3) Plaintiff's reliance on verdicts from other cases is inappropriate given that those cases do not apply New York law; and (4) the Court must strike the jury affidavit submitted by Plaintiff because, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1), \"a juror may not testify about ... the effect of anything on that juror's or another juror's vote ... or any juror's mental processes concerning the verdict\" (and, here, Plaintiff introduced a juror affidavit specifically to describe the mental processes of the jury and the motivating forces animating each juror's vote). (Dkt. No. 206.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legal Standard Governing This Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   A court may order a new trial on the basis of attorney misconduct when,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the conduct of counsel in argument causes prejudice to the opposing party\n   and unfairly influences a jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Pappas v.

Analysis of This Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   After carefully considering the matter, the Court answers the above-described question (i.e., whether, in the alternative, the conduct of Plaintiff's counsel warrants a new trial) in the affirmative for the reasons stated by Defendants in their memoranda of law. To those reasons, the Court adds the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiff's suggestion on page 18 of his opposition memorandum of law, each of the 23 acts of misconduct listed by Defendants on pages 21 through 23 of their memorandum of law-in chief occurred\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the presence of the jury (not during a sidebar). (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 1, at 28-30 [attaching pages \"21\" through \"23\" of Defs.' Memo. of Law]\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 3 [attaching relevant portions of Trial Transcripts].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Furthermore, only 12 of those 23 acts met with objections by Defendants. (Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 3, at 18-19, 30-31, 29, 72, 81, 93, 126, 127, 129 [attaching pages \"252,\" \"253,\" \"373,\" \"394,\" \"395,\" \"671,\" \"712,\" \"856,\" \"1298,\" \"1313,\" and \"1313\" of Trial Transcript]; Dkt. No. 182, at 96-97 [attaching pages \"295\" and \"296\" of Trial Transcript]; Dkt. No. 188, at 63-64 [attaching pages \"963\" and \"964\" of Trial Transcript]; Dkt. No. 189, at 94-95 [attaching pages \"1129\" and \"1130\" of Trial Transcript].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court notes that, in addition to relying on the transcript of Plaintiff's counsel's comments, the Court relies on (1) Plaintiff's counsel's self-deprecating tone of voice and posture when referring to his lack of professional skills and/or experience, (2) his helpless tone of voice and posture when referring to the fact that he was bullied as a child, (3) his alternating\n   innocent and defensive tones of voice in response to an admonishment by the Court, (4) the sympathetic facial expressions of the jurors following the aforementioned acts and/or accompanying comments, (5) the credulous facial expressions of the jurors following Plaintiff's counsel's acts of asserting of the truth of Plaintiff's case and/or vouching for his witnesses, and (6) the jurors' reactions following Plaintiff's counsel's acts of offering his personal opinions about the evidence and/or testifying when he could not otherwise introduce evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 186, at 55 [attaching page \"712\" of Trial Transcript, referencing Plaintiff's counsel's \"puzzled\" facial expressions after objections by defense counsel].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Moreover, contrary to Plaintiff's suggestion that the comments and practices in question regarded immaterial issues before the jury, the Court finds that the majority of the above-referenced comments and practices primarily concerned highly relevant issues before the jury: for example, (1) the credibility of Plaintiff's expert witnesses, (2) the competency and credibility as a witness of Plaintiff's counsel himself, (3) whether the verdict should be based on evidence or sympathy, and (4) whether Dr. Findling's decision to (purportedly) omit from final draft of his paper certain data from weeks eight to twelve of the study evidences an intent by Defendants to mislead physicians. (Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 1, at 28-30 [attaching pages \"21\" through \"23\" of Defs.' Memo. of Law]; Dkt. No. 199, Attach. 3 [attaching relevant portions of Trial Transcripts].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Although Plaintiff argues that any errors by his counsel were ameliorated by the curative instruction given by the Court, the instruction to which he apparently refers was given only once (Dkt. No. 204, Attach. 1, at 66-67 [attaching pages \"66\" and \"67\" of Trial Transcript] ), and it clearly did not curb his counsel's misconduct (given the misconduct's continuation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Simply stated, the Court is convinced that, absent the inappropriate conduct of Plaintiff's counsel, the ultimate outcome of the trial would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that Defendants are correct when they argue that the juror affidavit adduced by Plaintiff may not be considered by the Court. The affidavit violated Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1) in the following three ways: (1) it contained testimony about a statement that had been made and/or an incident that had occurred during the jury's deliberations (Dkt. No. 204, Attach. 16, at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9); (2) it contained testimony about the effect of a thing or things on the affiant's vote (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 11); and (3) it contained testimony about a juror's or multiple jurors' mental processes concerning the verdict (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Even if the affidavit were admissible, the Court would give it little weight because (1) it unreliably testifies to other jurors' mental processes concerning the verdict (Dkt. No. 204, Attach. 16, at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10), and (2) it admits to having been prepared with the assistance of Plaintiff's counsel (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munafo v.

Indeed, the affidavit actually supports Defendants' argument that the jurors were driven by feelings of sympathy due to the efforts to Plaintiff's counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 204, Attach. 16, at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court finds that, even if alternative grounds did not exist to grant Defendants' motion for judgment a matter of law, grounds exist to, at the very least, grant Defendants' motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
