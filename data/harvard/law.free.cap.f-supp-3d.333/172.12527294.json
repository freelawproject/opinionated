The first motion concerns evidence obtained from defendant's communication network located on servers in the Netherlands. The second relates to evidence obtained from his FlexiSpy spyware accounts located on servers in the United States. For the reasons given below, defendant's motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the facts and will discuss them below only as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Timeliness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Government argues that the Court should deny defendant's motions to suppress as untimely. Defendant claims that he was unaware of\n   the basis for these motions until he received unredacted versions of related discovery after the April 9, 2018 deadline. After reviewing the discovery, I agree that defendant has put forth a good faith basis for his delay, and will therefore decide the motions on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There, the defendant moved to suppress recorded phone calls for lack of probable cause. The defendant did not assert that the voice on the phone calls was his; instead, he claimed that the Government told his counsel that it was him. The court acknowledged the defendant's predicament - he would either have to admit that it was his voice or forego his motion to suppress. However, the Court concluded that the defendant could not establish his standing by relying on the Government's assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Similarly, defendant has not demonstrated the threshold for a legitimate expectation of privacy by swearing that the information on the Dutch servers or FlexiSpy accounts is his. Instead, defendant uses Special Agent Grey's affidavit as a proxy for his own. However, Special Agent Grey\n   does not have personal knowledge that the Dutch servers and FlexiSpy accounts are defendant's. [redacted] That is too tenuous a link to create standing for a motion to suppress, and impermissibly relies entirely on the Government's theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because defendant has not met his burden to establish standing, defendant's motions to suppress are denied. However, even if defendant could establish standing by relying on Special Agent Grey's affidavit, I would still deny defendant's motions for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Motion to Suppress the Dutch Servers Communications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant challenges the FBI's search of servers that ran his encrypted communication network, including telephone calls, text communications, and information stored on that network. [redacted] At all relevant times, the servers that ran this encrypted communication network were located in the Netherlands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The United States and the Netherlands are parties to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (\"MLAT\"). Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the FBI obtained evidence from the Dutch servers in three ways. First, the FBI made several MLAT requests for Dutch authorities to surveil certain IP addresses connected to defendant's communication network, and the Dutch authorities intercepted and recorded phone calls and provided that surveillance to the FBI on an ongoing basis. Second, the Dutch authorities executed search warrants on the servers and provided the FBI with copies of their contents. [redacted] The Dutch authorities also leased additional servers to house the recorded conversations and created a backup server that automatically received and stored the surveilled data for the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As discussed further in Part IV.A below, the Supreme Court has characterized the Government's \"acquisition\" of collected, recorded data as a search, rather than a seizure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2213\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FBI's receipt of the communications and information stored on the Dutch servers did not interfere with defendant's possessory interests, because it did not impede his ability to use the communication network or access the data on those servers. Instead, the challenged conduct involves a possible invasion of any privacy interest defendant had in their contents - constituting a search under the Fourth Amendment, rather than a seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Several searches occurred in this case. First, the Dutch authorities conducted searches by their surveillance of each IP address, and by providing the FBI with ongoing information from that surveillance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [redacted] Finally, the Dutch\n   authorities conducted searches when they accessed and copied the contents of the Dutch servers pursuant to search warrants, and when they transferred those copies to the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even if this conduct were characterized as a seizure rather than a search, the seizure would still have been reasonable in light of the Government's need to avoid the loss of evidence. \"Where law enforcement authorities have probable cause to believe that a container holds contraband or evidence of a crime, ...

Although a user's account is not a physical location, specifying the username limits the place where information can be searched in the same way a description of an address or room or object would. Even if the third warrant had not been limited to 35 of defendant's FlexiSpy account names, the all-records exception would likely apply here and render a search of all of defendant's FlexiSpy accounts valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   Court distinguished the warrant before it from others the Court had approved that authorized the seizure of \"evidence\" or generic classes of items where a more precise definition was not possible and that \"identified a specific illegal activity to which the items related.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512148\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/72/#p76\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512148\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/72/#p76\">\n    at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor is this the kind of warrant that is \"so facially deficient\" that an officer could not reasonably presume it was valid.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897610\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/551/#p557\">\n    540 U.S. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897610\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/551/#p557\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Any lack of authority by the magistrate judge to issue the warrant has little effect on police misconduct, which is the harm that suppression is designed to disincentivize. Here, suppression is not warranted because it was objectively reasonable for the agents to rely in good faith on the search and tracking warrants in the third warrant application, which were executed by two different magistrate judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Raymonda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074104\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/105/#p118\">\n    780 F.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (2d Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant's other arguments are also meritless. He argues that the tracking warrant does not identify the property to be tracked or the magistrate judge to whom it must be returned, but the warrant states that the property to be tracked is the \"Location Data Contained in the FlexiSpy Accounts Listed in Attachment A,\" which in turn specifies the 35 accounts from which the FBI agents would obtain the location data. As described above, Attachment\n   A is part of the warrant because it was explicitly incorporated by reference and attached to the warrant itself. Furthermore, even though the warrant identified the Clerk of Court, rather than a particular judge, as the person to whom the information should be returned, this technical error is just that. Defendant incurred no prejudice because of this oversight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant argues that the Dutch authorities acted as agents of the Government, triggering Fourth Amendment protection for defendant. The Government nominally contests this point, but states that I do not need to decide the issue in order to dispose of the motion. I agree. For the purpose of the motion to suppress evidence obtained from the Dutch servers, I will assume that the Dutch authorities acted as agents of the Government. However, even assuming the Fourth Amendment applies to their conduct, the searches were reasonable, and the evidence obtained from them need not be suppressed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    [redacted]\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Another district court has recognized that \"in the context of motions to suppress evidence obtained in foreign countries, the Second Circuit has articulated the 'shock the conscience' standard only in reference to the conduct of foreign officials, who are not constrained by the Fourth Amendment.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
