The Defendants' Motions to Dismiss have been fully briefed and are ripe for decision. For the following reasons, Defendants Walker, Csitar, and Moore's Motion to Dismiss (doc. 6) is due to be GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART; Defendant Whitehead's Motion to Dismiss (doc. 9-1) is due to be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is an attorney who practiced in Birmingham, Alabama for over thirty years before returning to his hometown of Haleyville, Alabama in 2013. Part of Plaintiff's practice in Haleyville involved filing federal lawsuits against Defendant Walker and other law enforcement officials for alleged constitutional violations. On January 8, 2016, Plaintiff traveled to Double\n   Springs, Alabama to conduct personal errands and to meet with a work-release inmate at the Winston County jail. The inmate had requested that Plaintiff meet with him to discuss obtaining his release on bond. Plaintiff completed his errands and then entered the jail to meet with the inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon entering the booking area of the jail, Plaintiff spoke with Defendant Csitar, the jail administrator. Plaintiff could not recall the name of the inmate, as he had never spoken with him personally and only had some \"telephone message slips.\" Plaintiff asked Csitar if he could look at the list of current work-release inmates to help him remember the client he was to meet with; Csitar refused to allow Plaintiff to do so. Plaintiff argued with Csitar, and then demanded to see the then-sheriff, Defendant Walker. Because Defendant Walker was not in the jail at the time, Plaintiff waited in the booking area for him to arrive. Csitar then told Plaintiff that if he did not leave the jail he would be arrested, so Plaintiff left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff later encountered Defendant Walker in the parking lot behind the sheriff's office. Defendant Walker likewise refused to allow Plaintiff to visit the inmates. Plaintiff argued that such a refusal was a violation of the inmate's Sixth Amendment rights and threatened to sue Defendant Walker. Both sides continued their \"loud discussion\" with \"profanities ... exchanged by both parties.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 10.) A number of law enforcement and corrections officers gathered in the parking lot to witness the argument. At some point, an officer asked if Plaintiff would take a test to determine if he was on drugs or intoxicated. Plaintiff asked if he was under arrest; the officer informed Plaintiff he was not. Plaintiff then left the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was subsequently pulled over by Double Springs police officers and sheriff's deputies \"miles away\" from Double Springs, arrested, and taken back to the Winston County jail. Plaintiff was searched at the prison, but no contraband was found. After approximately seventy-two hours, Plaintiff was told by officials that he was being charged with possession of marijuana, promoting prison contraband, escape, obstructing governmental operations, and two counts of disorderly conduct. These charges were based on Defendant Csitar's discovery of marijuana in the jail near the area where Plaintiff was searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 9, 2016, while Defendant Whitehead, a jail nurse, was examining Plaintiff. Whitehead brought up Plaintiff's involvement in a suit against law enforcement officers on behalf of an inmate who had died in the Winston County jail. Whitehead allegedly was upset with Plaintiff for this lawsuit and told him that he needed to \"respect the badge.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff told him that \"he did not know how he could 'respect the badge,' given how the jail staff had mistreated and neglected [the inmate] to the point that it caused his death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Whitehead allegedly became upset with Plaintiff for this statement. Whitehead who is much larger than Plaintiff picked up Plaintiff and carried him to his cell where Whitehead threw Plaintiff to the ground. Plaintiff landed on the metal grate, and sustained numerous injuries including a broken rib. Plaintiff subsequently demanded medical treatment; although he was allowed to see a nurse, he never received pain medication or an X-ray. Plaintiff alleged that Defendant Whitehead \"initiated another criminal charge [of harassment] against [Plaintiff]\" on January 10, 2016 for the statements Plaintiff made to Defendant Whitehead in an effort to justify the injuries Plaintiff received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff remained in the jail until January 15, 2016, when he was involuntarily\n   committed to the Walker Baptist Hospital Behavioral Medicine Unit. Although Plaintiff does not state when he was released from the Winston County jail, he does allege that the amount of bail set for his seven criminal offenses was $60,000. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants \"set\" his bail above the statutory maximum allowed for the offenses he was charged with and that Defendants set such bail as \"cash only\" in order to increase the difficulty for Plaintiff to make bail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) After Plaintiff's criminal charges were set for a hearing, the district attorney dismissed all charges against him with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9, 16.) Because Plaintiff filed this action on January 9, 2018, he has facially exceeded the two-year statute of limitations for this claim.

Plaintiff's First Amendment Retaliation claim is due to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It does not, however, appear from the facts alleged in the Complaint that Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment Excessive Bail claim may be dismissed for failure to file within the statute of limitations. Plaintiff states that he was first made aware of the offenses when he was charged \"approximately 72 hours\" after his arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff was arrested on January 8, 2016; thus at the earliest Plaintiff was informed of his charges on January 11, 2016. Although Plaintiff does not specifically state when he was informed of the bail amounts, he obviously would not be able to know that such bail was excessive until he was informed of the charges.

Defendant Whitehead can thus be considered a state actor for the actions he took providing healthcare services to Plaintiff on behalf of Winston County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant Whitehead attempts to circumvent this precedent by arguing that he had no \"connection\" to the government; his only business relationship was to his employer, Correctional Managed Care Consultants, LLC (\"CMCC\"). Whitehead asserts that \"[t]he mere fact that there was a business relationship between [his] employer and Winston County-and that Winston County is involved-is insufficient to establish Whitehead was a state actor.\" (Doc. 9-1 at 6.)

This task is complicated as neither Defendants Walker and Csitar nor Plaintiff have offered any argument as to whether Defendants were acting within the \"line or scope of their employment.\" As stated above, Plaintiff failed to even respond to these Defendants' Motions to Dismiss; while Walker and Csitar\n   raise the defense of absolute immunity, they omitted the fundamental \"line and scope\" inquiry in favor of addressing exceptions to absolute immunity\n   <em>\n    once a defendant has already shown entitlement thereto.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6 at 5-6) (addressing the five exceptions to absolute immunity as collected in\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

On January 8, 2016, Defendant Csitar was working in the jail when he spoke with Plaintiff, as jail administrator this is clearly within the scope of his employment. The only other allegations Plaintiff brings against Csitar concern his supposed \"[bringing] another charge for Disorderly Conduct for the discussion which took place in the jail where he refused to allow [Plaintiff] to visit with the inmate.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In regards to Defendant Walker, Plaintiff alleges that Walker was located in the parking lot behind the sheriff's office when Plaintiff and Walker argued about Plaintiff's ability to enter the jail. Plaintiff also makes allegations that Walker directed the setting of Plaintiff's bail for an amount that exceeded the statutory maximum for the offenses Plaintiff was charged with. Specifically in regards to the Malicious Prosecution claim in the Complaint, Plaintiff's recitation of facts are simple legal conclusions and factual recitations of the elements of a malicious prosecution claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Plaintiff] alleges that Defendants Whitehead, Walker, and Csitar either initiated charges or directed their subordinates to initiate criminal charges without probable cause and with malice against Plaintiff [ ]. [Plaintiff] alleges that the warrants that were sworn out against him contain deliberate falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. [Plaintiff] alleges that the criminal proceedings that give rise to his present causes of action have all been terminated in his favor, as all charges have been dismissed with prejudice. [Plaintiff] asserts that the Defendants lacked even arguable probable cause for the charges, and that his seizure and prosecution under such circumstances violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. [Plaintiff] alleges that he has been injured and damaged as a proximate cause of said malicious prosecution, as previously described in his complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Nothing alleged in the Complaint shows that Defendants Walker and Csitar were not acting in the line and scope of their duties; they are thus entitled to absolute immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the other hand, Defendant Whitehead's arguments for dismissal of Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim against him are unavailing. Defendant Whitehead's sole paragraph addressing Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim argues it should be dismissed because there is \"no chain of causation\" linking Plaintiff's prosecution to him because of the intervening acts of a prosecutor and criminal courts. (Doc. 9-1 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In order to state a claim for malicious prosecution under Alabama law, a plaintiff must show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   1) that a prior judicial proceeding was instigated by the defendant 2) without probable cause and 3) with malice; 4) that that prior proceeding was terminated in the plaintiff's favor; and 5) that the plaintiff suffered damage[ ] as a result of that prior proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Dolgencorp, LLC v.
