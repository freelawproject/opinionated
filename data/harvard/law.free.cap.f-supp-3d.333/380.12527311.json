(D.I. 1) Crystallex has registered the judgment in Delaware. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Venezuela has not appeared in the litigation. However, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\"), an oil company, has intervened. (D.I. 14) This is because Crystallex seeks to collect on its judgment against Venezuela by executing on property nominally owned by PDVSA, specifically shares of common stock PDVSA owns in PDV Holding Inc. (\"PDVH\"), a Delaware corporation. Crystallex's theory is that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela, making PDVSA's property subject to execution for payment of Venezuela's debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Crystallex and PDVSA have each filed a motion. Crystallex moves for a writ of attachment\n   <em>\n    fieri facias\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    fi. fa.\n   </em>\n   \") pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). (D.I. 2) In turn, PDVSA has filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (D.I. 25) Together, the parties'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   motions present numerous complex questions, some of which have been addressed by no previous court, and others on which different courts have reached competing conclusions. The\n   Court's careful consideration of the issues before it has included reviewing numerous briefs (D.I. 3-1, 26, 33), letter briefs (D.I. 51-54, 70-71), submissions of supplemental authority (D.I. 41, 46, 59-60, 63-65), six substantive declarations (D.I. 7-8, 28-29, 35-36), and hundreds of exhibits (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 4-6, 11, 27, 34, 37, 47). The Court also heard oral argument on two separate occasions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Dec. 21, 2017 Hr'g (D.I. 49) (\"Tr.\"); Transcript of Aug. 3, 2018 Hr'g (D.I. 74) (\"Aug. Tr.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having undertaken the required analysis, the Court will grant Crystallex's motion and deny PDVSA's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2002, the Government of Venezuela awarded Crystallex, a Canadian corporation, a Mine Operating Contract (\"Contract\") by which Crystallex was granted the opportunity to develop the Las Cristinas gold mines. (D.I. 3-1 at 1; D.I. 26 at 4-5) Completion of the mining project was dependent on Crystallex obtaining certain permits from Venezuela. (D.I. 26 at 5) Crystallex never obtained such permits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, in 2011, Venezuela seized the Las Cristinas mines. (D.I. 3-1 at 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In accordance with a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between Canada and Venezuela, Crystallex pursued its grievances against Venezuela before an international arbitration tribunal ....\"\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274600\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/244/100/#p105\">\n    244 F.

Specifically, in 2011, Crystallex initiated arbitration proceedings against Venezuela before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") in Washington, D.C. (D.I. 3-1 at 1, 5) On April 4, 2016, an arbitration panel found that Venezuela's actions constituted an indirect expropriation of Crystallex's rights under the Contract. (D.I. 26 at 5) The ICSID awarded Crystallex $1.2 billion plus interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.I. 3-1 at 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Crystallex then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the \"D.C. Court\") seeking to confirm the arbitral award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n   </em>\n   , C.A. No. 16-0661 (RC) D.I. 1 (D.D.C. Apr. 7, 2016). On March 25, 2017, Judge Rudolph Contreras issued an opinion and order confirming the award. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 1; D.I. 26 at 6; D.I. 4-1 Exs. 6, 7) On April 7, 2017, the D.C. Court entered judgment against Venezuela. (D.I. 1; D.I. 26 at 6) Just over two months later, on June 9, 2017, Judge Contreras found that a \"reasonable period\" had elapsed since entry of judgment but Venezuela had not paid its debt.\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n   </em>\n   , C.A. No. 16-0661 (RC) D.I. 36 (D.D.C. June 9, 2017) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.I. 4-1 Ex. 8) (\"\n   <em>\n    Crystallex II\n   </em>\n   \"). Hence, pursuant to Section 1610(c) of the FSIA, the D.C. Court ruled that Crystallex could commence proceedings in aid of execution of the judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274600\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/244/100/#p105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Accordingly, on June 19, 2017, Crystallex registered the D.C. Court's judgment in this Court. (D.I. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing district court in which judgment is registered with same power to enforce it that is possessed by district\n   court which issued judgment) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crystallex filed its pending motion for a writ of attachment on August 14, 2017, seeking to attach shares of PDVH, which are owned by PDVSA, which Crystallex alleges is an alter ego of Venezuela. (D.I. 3-1 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36 (PDVSA stating \"the PDV Holding shares they want to attach belong to PDVSA\") ) Thereafter, PDVSA moved to intervene for the purpose of opposing the attachment motion (D.I. 14), a request the Court granted on August 28, 2017 (D.I. 17), without objection from Crystallex (D.I. 16). Subsequently, on November 3, 2017, PDVSA filed its pending cross-motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (D.I. 25)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties initially completed briefing on the motions on November 22, 2017 (D.I. 3-1, 26, 33) and were scheduled for oral argument on December 5, 2017 (D.I. 23). When they appeared on December 5, Crystallex requested a continuance in light of a recent settlement reached between it and Venezuela. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Dec. 5, 2017 Chambers Conference) The Court continued the argument until December 21, at which point the parties again appeared, indicated that Venezuela had not met a condition precedent to the settlement, and proceeded to present argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 43; Aug. Tr. at 12-13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the ensuing months, the parties have advised the Court of subsequent authorities and developments (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 59-60, 63-65) and responded to the Court's orders for supplemental briefing (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.I. 51-54, 70-71). On July 30, 2018, the Court provided the parties with a list of additional questions on which it sought their input. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 68) Then, on August 3, the Court heard additional oral argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug.

It is undisputed that PDVSA is an \"agency or instrumentality\" of Venezuela within the meaning of the FSIA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 26 at 12 (\"PDVSA indisputably is an 'agency or instrumentality of a foreign state' as defined in the FSIA ....\"); Tr. at 36 (\"Where the plaintiffs and PDVSA agree is that PDVSA is an agency or instrumentality of Venezuela ....\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Where the parties' views first diverge is on the question of whether the Court must have an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction with respect to PDVSA. PDVSA contends that because Crystallex's motion seeks to impose liability on PDVSA for Venezuela's debt, Crystallex is in effect suing PDVSA, and the Court cannot adjudicate such a suit without having a basis to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over PDVSA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 26 at 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36-37) To PDVSA, the effect of Crystallex prevailing on its motion would be the same as if PDVSA were added to the judgment Crystallex holds against Venezuela, rendering PDVSA - a third party, which had no involvement in the events that harmed Crystallex and no involvement in the arbitration\n   giving rise to the judgment against Venezuela - potentially liable for all of Venezuela's debts. Crystallex counters that once it establishes the Court has subject matter jurisdiction with respect to its dispute with Venezuela, and further establishes that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela, it will have met its burden to show that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction with respect to PDVSA as well. To Crystallex, the crucial facts are that Crystallex has not sued PDVSA and does not seek to add PDVSA as a liable party on its judgment against Venezuela. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 70 at 8) (\"Crystallex does not seek to hold PDVSA liable for its judgment but rather seeks a more limited finding, namely that the specific property at issue on this motion - the shares of PDVH - though nominally held in the name of PDVSA, are, at this time, really the property of Venezuela.\") Alternatively, if an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction is necessary with respect to PDVSA, Crystallex argues that it, too, is present. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (\"[T]his Court has an independent basis for jurisdiction against PDVSA under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Section 1605(a)(6) of the FSIA.\") On these points, the Court agrees with Crystallex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   PDVSA's position is based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Peacock v.

Crystallex Has Met Its Burden with Respect to Jurisdictional Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   It is undisputed that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction with respect to Crystallex's claim against Venezuela, given the FSIA's arbitration exception. Nonetheless, PDVSA has moved to dismiss Crystallex's efforts to collect on its judgment against Venezuela by attaching the property in the United States of PDVSA, on the theory that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego. In the Court's view, PDVSA's motion presents both a facial and factual attack on the Court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Below, after setting out the statutory basis for the Court's undisputed jurisdiction with respect to Venezuela, the Court addresses PDVSA's facial and factual challenges. As to the facial challenge to the sufficiency of Crystallex's allegations, the Court determines that Crystallex's burden is to rebut the presumption of separateness between Venezuela and PDVSA by showing probable cause. The Court then explains that, taking Crystallex's allegations as true, Crystallex has met this burden by adequately alleging that Venezuela exerts extensive control over PDVSA, including its day-to-day operations, rendering PDVSA the alter ego of Venezuela. However, Crystallex has not shown probable cause to find that recognizing the separateness of PDVSA and Venezuela would work a fraud or injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Turning next to PDVSA's factual challenge, the Court concludes that Crystallex's burden is to prove its allegations by a preponderance of the evidence - not, as PDVSA contends, by clear and convincing evidence. The Court then summarizes the evidence presented by both sides and finds that Crystallex has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Venezuela extensively controls PDVSA, and has, thus, proven that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego. With respect to the fraud or injustice prong, however, Crystallex has not met its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Court Has Undisputed Jurisdiction With Respect to Venezuela\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   PDVSA does not challenge the Court's subject matter jurisdiction with respect to Venezuela. It is undisputed that Crystallex has gone beyond probable cause and fully proven that Venezuela is not immune from suit due to registration of the confirmed arbitration award against Venezuela. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 3-1 at 5-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As noted previously, \u00a7 1604 of the FSIA renders foreign states like Venezuela \"immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607\" of the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The exception Crystallex relies on to establish subject matter jurisdiction with respect to Venezuela is \u00a7 1605(a)(6), relating to arbitration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (6) in which the action is brought ... to confirm an award made pursuant to ... an agreement to arbitrate, if\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (A) the arbitration takes place or is intended to take place in the United States ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   It is undisputed that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Venezuela under \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(A) due to Crystallex's $1.2 billion arbitral award against Venezuela, which was confirmed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and is now registered in the District of Delaware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2. PDVSA's Facial Attack\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   There is no dispute that this litigation can go forward against Venezuela. But Venezuela has not appeared and Crystallex has not identified any specific property directly owned by Venezuela that can be found in the District of Delaware. Instead, as noted throughout this Opinion, Crystallex seeks to execute its judgment against Venezuela by attaching and executing on property owned by PDVSA and found in Delaware; specifically, the shares of Delaware corporation PDVH, which are indisputably directly owned by PDVSA. Hence, the Court now addresses PDVSA's facial\n   attack on the Court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Crystallex's burden is probable cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As previously noted, when considering PDVSA's facial attack on the sufficiency of Crystallex's allegation that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego, the Court takes as true all of Crystallex's well-pled factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rong v.

Specifically, Crystallex has met this burden with respect to the extensive control prong of\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   , but not with respect to the fraud or injustice prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Crystallex has shown probable cause to rebut the presumption of separateness between the Republic of Venezuela and PDVSA. PDVSA's arguments are weightier (though ultimately unsuccessful) in connection with its factual challenge, where the Court can (and does) consider PDVSA's evidence, and not just Crystallex's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Fraud or injustice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Crystallex contends that it has satisfied both prongs of the disjunctive\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   test: extensive control as well as fraud or injustice. While, as already explained, the Court agrees with the former assertion, it rejects the latter. Even taking Crystallex's well-pled allegations as true, there is not probable cause that giving effect to the separateness of Venezuela and PDVSA would \"work a fraud or injustice\" as that term is used in\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   (i.e., as a stand-alone test that may be satisfied independent of whether there is extensive control).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, as PDVSA contends, Crystallex has not \"show[n] that the Republic abused PDVSA's corporate form to perpetrate a fraud or injustice resulting in harm to Crystallex.\" (D.I. 71 at 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Crystallex alleges that the expropriation of its interest in the Las Cristinas mines \"resulted in a multibillion dollar benefit to state-owned and controlled PDVSA.\" (D.I. 3-1 at 32) Further, Crystallex contends that \"Venezuela reaps enormous benefits from owning and operating an oil refining company under the protection of Delaware law ... in an attempt to protect Venezuela's Delaware assets from execution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) From these premises, Crystallex asks the Court to \"deem PDVSA to be Venezuela's alter ego to avoid the obvious injustice that would result if Venezuela were permitted to violate international law by taking Crystallex's assets, transfer those assets [to] a state-owned and controlled company, PDVSA, for no consideration, and then use U.S. law to avoid paying its lawful obligations in the face of PDVSA's receipt of billions for those stolen assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 33 at 17 (\"Venezuela uses PDVSA to generate billions of dollars in revenue in the United States through its commercial refining and oil industry subsidiaries, while simultaneously using PDVSA to shield those same assets from creditors in the United States.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Crystallex's allegations fail because they do not sufficiently allege that Venezuela used PDVSA as an instrument to defraud Crystallex. Everything Crystallex alleges that Venezuela did to harm Crystallex could have been done - and, indeed, was alleged to have been done - by Venezuela itself, regardless of whether PDVSA even existed. It was Venezuela, not PDVSA, which expropriated Crystallex's interests in the mines. While Venezuela may have subsequently transferred those interests to PDVSA, it did not need to do so as part of its scheme to defraud Crystallex or to engineer an unjust outcome. Crystallex\n   does not even allege that PDVSA participated in or facilitated the expropriation. Nor does Crystallex allege in anything other than an insufficient, conclusory manner that PDVSA was created and/or is being maintained by Venezuela for the purpose of defrauding Crystallex and other creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As PDVSA persuasively explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   PDVSA had nothing to do with the underlying dispute between the parties to the arbitration. And PDVSA is not a newly created sham corporation designed to insulate the Republic from liability. PDVSA was established over 40 years ago and is one of the largest oil companies in the world.... [T]he mere fact that a government instrumentality benefits from the actions of the government does not demonstrate an abuse of the corporate form required to overcome the presumption of separateness under\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   (D.I. 26 at 19-20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that Crystallex cannot meet its burden under\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   fraud or injustice prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    2. PDVSA's Factual Attack\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As previously noted, PDVSA's motion presents both a facial and factual attack on Crystallex's efforts to establish subject matter jurisdiction. In evaluating the factual challenge, the Court does not assume the truth of Crystallex's allegations. Instead, the Court must consider the evidence presented by Crystallex, as well as any competing evidence presented by PDVSA, and determine, under the appropriate burden of proof, whether Crystallex's evidence meets that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   For the reasons set out below, the Court concludes that (1) Crystallex's burden is to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Venezuela extensively controls PDVSA, and (2) Crystallex has met this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Crystallex's burden is preponderance of the evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   While the parties agree that Crystallex bears some burden in order to obtain its requested writ, they disagree as to the nature of that burden. Crystallex argues for the \" 'usual ... rule generally applicable to civil actions in federal courts' \": that the plaintiff must prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence.

Cir. 1995) - approaches which do not suggest that these courts were applying any heightened evidentiary standard. In a case involving alter ego allegations outside the sovereign immunity context, the Third Circuit (applying state law) has applied a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plastipak Packaging, Inc. v. DePasquale\n   </em>\n   , 75 Fed. App'x 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   PDVSA has not cited a single case that applied a clear and convincing evidence standard to an alter ego inquiry in the context of\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   and the FSIA. PDVSA's cases applying state-law alter ego standards (like state-law cases cited by Crystallex) are unhelpful, as the Court is (by the parties' agreement) applying a federal law standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   PDVSA broadly asserts that \"the clear and convincing evidence standard applies any time a party seeks to overcome a legal presumption.\" (D.I. 51 at 2) But this is incorrect, as Crystallex demonstrates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 53 at 2) (\"That ignores decades of decisions holding that a wide range of presumptions across different subject-matter areas could be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\") (citing cases)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court does not agree with PDVSA that \"a preponderance of the evidence standard is inconsistent with\"\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   's \"strong presumption\" of separateness. (D.I. 54 at 1-2) PDVSA does not cite authority to support the view that the strength of the presumption necessarily alters the standard of proof necessary to rebut it. The \"strong\" characterization of the presumption helps explain the justification for it and the importance of the Court enforcing it, unless and until it is overcome by the required amount of evidence. It does not, however, dictate a clear and convincing burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Hence, the Court will now turn to evaluating whether Crystallex has met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Extensive control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Based on the evidence presented by both parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that Crystallex has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that PDVSA is not immune from suit. The record contains sufficient evidence to enable the Court to find - including by resolving disputed issues of fact\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   - that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela. In particular, Crystallex has met its burden to show that Venezuela extensively controls PDVSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   As noted above, while there is no mechanical formula that applies to this inquiry, the Court finds it helpful to organize its discussion based initially on factors that are commonly looked to, in the same order that the Court identified these same factors in connection with PDVSA's facial challenge. The Court then considers some additional evidence further supporting its findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

In November 2017, President Maduro appointed a military general as Oil Minister and also as President of PDVSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29-30) That individual's predecessors, Nelson Martinez, Eulogio del Pino, and Rafael Ramirez Carre\u00f1o, similarly served simultaneously as both Venezuela's Oil Minister and PDVSA's President.

Such programs include PDVSA Agr\u00edcola S.A., which subsidizes Venezuela's agriculture, industrial infrastructure, and produce sectors, and PDVSA Desarrollos Urbanos S.A., which subsidizes Venezuela's housing projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18; D.I. 8 at \u00b6 41) PDVSA's total contributions to the Venezuelan budget between 2010 and 2016 were in excess of $119 billion.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 28 at \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 26 at 7-8) But that does not mean the taxation and regulation of PDVSA is inconsistent with a finding of PDVSA being Venezuela's alter ego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Moreover, the tax and regulatory policies are only some of the Venezuelan policies that cause PDVSA to act directly on behalf of Venezuela, as already noted. Venezuela also uses PDVSA to achieve its foreign policy goals by committing PDVSA to sell oil to certain Caribbean and Latin American nations at substantial discounts, without PDVSA's consent. (D.I. 3-1 at 21) (citing evidence) Even when those oil debts are repaid, the money is given to Venezuela, not PDVSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.I. 5-1 Ex. 77) Venezuela has entered into agreements with China whereby PDVSA acts \"on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\" to repay China.

Additional indications of Venezuela's extensive control over PDVSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The record contains additional evidence of Venezuela's extensive control over PDVSA, evidence that does not neatly fit into one or more of the categories above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   For instance, it is undisputed that PDVSA paid the administrative fees Venezuela incurred in connection with the arbitration with Crystallex, which amounted to around $249,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 40-41; D.I. 6 (Fung Decl.) at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, Exs. 1-2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Also, Venezuela manipulates PDVSA's conversion of U.S. Dollars to Venezuelan Bolivars to leverage PDVSA's revenues for the sole benefit of Venezuela and to the detriment of PDVSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 7 at \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 4-3 Exs. 47-48) PDVSA is required to convert foreign currency into Venezuelan Bolivars at an artificially low U.S. Dollar to Bolivar exchange rate \"(which is approximately 1/500th of the market rate).\" (D.I. 7 at \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   8 at \u00b6 46; D.I. 4-3 Ex, 48) The Republic can then exchange that currency at more favorable rates.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 86-88, 99)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   All of the foregoing is further evidence supporting the Court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    vii. PDVSA's contrary interpretation wrongly fails to account for the totality of the evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   PDVSA recognizes the support in the record for the Court's findings identified above. Indeed, as Crystallex notes, the evidence here is \"largely undisputed,\" as PDVSA has instead \"focus[ed] its challenges on the inferences that may be drawn from the undisputed facts.\" (D.I. 52 at 2) PDVSA's arguments against concluding an alter ego relationship exists rest largely on disputing the relevance of Crystallex's evidence and insisting that none of the above-listed findings individually transforms PDVSA into Venezuela's alter ego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Court disagrees with PDVSA's protestations that all of Crystallex's evidence is irrelevant. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 47 (\"extensive regulation by an oil producing state of its hydrocarbon industry\" is irrelevant);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54 (characterizing as irrelevant whether Venezuela itself benefitted from acts taken by PDVSA);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55 (contending designation of PDVSA as expropriating entity, use by Venezuela of PDVSA property without reimbursement, and sale of oil to other countries at reduced prices are \"totally irrelevant\") ) Based on the caselaw discussed in this Opinion, the Court concludes that all of the considerations on which the Court has relied are relevant to the issue of whether Venezuela so extensively controls PDVSA, including its day-to-day conduct, that it should be treated as Venezuela's alter ego for purposes of application of the FSIA. As has been noted repeatedly in this Opinion,\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   did not establish a mechanical formula for courts to apply. It is appropriate for the Court to consider the totality of circumstances that either side wishes to present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Much of PDVSA's attack on Crystallex's showing consists of dissecting the totality of Crystallex's evidence and arguing that no single piece of evidence renders PDVSA the alter ego of Venezuela. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 26 at 20 (\"mere fact that a government instrumentality benefits from the actions of the government does not demonstrate an abuse of the corporate form\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34 (\"mere fact that PDVSA may have been designated as an expropriating entity in certain other cases is not grounds for disregarding its separate legal personality\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36 (contending that Venezuela's use of PDVSA's planes \"would not support\" veil piercing);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (contending sale of oil to other countries on deferred payment and other favorable terms \"do[es] not support a finding of alter ego liability\") ) Of course, no single piece of evidence in the record is sufficient on its own to enable Crystallex to meet its burden, but of course that also is not what the law requires. Again, the Court must consider all of the evidence in the record. When it does so, the Court finds that it sufficiently proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   PDVSA also characterizes itself as merely a \"typical\" national oil company, the type of creature that\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   compels must retain its separate juridical status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53 (\"[A]ll they have shown is that it is the same as other national oil corporations that are owned by petrol states.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 26 at 2 (arguing PDVSA is \"nothing more than a 'typical government instrumentality' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   ) ) While the Court agrees with PDVSA that it possesses many of the characteristics\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191414\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/611/#p627\">\n    462 U.S. at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191414\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/611/#p627\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ascribed to \"typical\" government instrumentalities - it was created by an enabling statute, is managed by a board selected by the government, has powers to hold and sell property and sue and be sued, and is primarily responsible for its own finances - PDVSA also has numerous other characteristics, which the Court has described above in detail. Considering the totality of the evidence, the Court finds that PDVSA is not merely a \"typical government instrumentality\" but is the alter ego of Venezuela.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    viii. The parties' declarations confirm the Court's findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The Court's findings described above are further supported by the declarations the parties submitted. Together, Crystallex and PDVSA have filed six substantive declarations: two each from Dr. Roberto Rigobon and Professor Jose Ignacio Hernandez, who endorse Crystallex's view that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela; and one each from Professor Luis A. Garcia Montoya and Mr. Alejandro Schmilinsky, supporting PDVSA's view that the two entities are properly viewed as separate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 7, 8, 28, 29, 35, 36)\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   While there are certainly disputes among the various declarations, to the limited extent those disputes are material, the Court resolves them in favor of Crystallex, for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Dr. Rigobon, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, opines on the economic realities of the relationship between PDVSA and Venezuela, specifically concluding that: (1) the Venezuelan Government exercises complete economic control over PDVSA's day-to-day operations; (2) Venezuela relies on PDVSA to sustain its economy; and (3) the Venezuelan Government uses PDVSA for political purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 7 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-9) Dr. Rigobon also explains that PDVSA was created by Presidential Decree and initially behaved \"like an economically-driven company,\" including by setting its own budget, making its own decisions, and promoting, hiring, or firing its own staff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11) Then, however, in 2002 and 2003, the Government began getting involved in PDVSA's affairs, effectively converting the formerly commercial-minded PDVSA into the present State-controlled \"New PDVSA.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   This transformation was accomplished by the Government's appointment of then-President Chavez's \"most trusted allies\" to manage PDVSA, creating \"substantial overlap between the [PDVSA] Board of Directors and senior members of the Government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14) In 2002, the Government began requiring PDVSA to contribute monetarily to Venezuela, directly through oil revenues (totaling $119 billion from 2010 to 2016) and \"extraordinary taxes,\" and indirectly through social programs such as FONDEN (to which, PDVSA contributed more than $34 billion from 2010 to 2016) and other programs created to subsidize consumer housing and gasoline purchases through PDVSA.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-25) He opines as to the Government's formulation of PDVSA's pricing policies and management of PDVSA's employment policies (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-21), the overlap of directors and officers between PDVSA and the Government (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-33), the Government's increased control after the establishment of \"New PDVSA\" (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-38), and the use of PDVSA to achieve Venezuela's social and political objectives (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39-50). Citing the opinions of various \"learned commentators,\" all of whom have concluded that \"PDVSA and its affiliates are considered a state company of a unique nature\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26), Professor Hernandez persuasively concludes that whether PDVSA has its own legal personality \"has no bearing\" on the reality that Venezuela and PDVSA are not, in practice, separate entities (D.I. 35 at \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   On behalf of PDVSA, Professor Montoya, PDVSA's expert in Venezuelan law, opines that \"PDVSA enjoys a legal personality of its own as a corporation separate and distinct from the Republic.\" (D.I. 28 at \u00b6 4) In his view, \"neither the importance of PDVSA in the national economy nor the fact that it is highly regulated changes the fact that PDVSA has all the attributes in law of separate legal personality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Additionally, Professor Montoya asserts that PDVSA is \"financially autonomous from the Republic,\" \"has its own budget, and ... is subject to a budgetary regime distinct from that of the Republic,\" and that various tweets and press reports cited by Crystallex carry no legal significance under Venezuelan law. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Much of Professor Montoya's declaration emphasizes that, according to the PDVSA Bylaws, PDVSA operates as a\n   <em>\n    sociedad an\u00f3nima\n   </em>\n   (\"SA\"), a corporate form having one or more shareholders, which makes it clear PDVSA is not a department of the Government. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11, 18, 24-26) His opinion is echoed by Mr. Schmilinsky, PDVSA's litigation corporate manager, who explains PDVSA's corporate structure - naming the various directors, officers, and corporate managers - and points out that PDVSA is an SA, whose only shareholder has ever been the Republic. (D.I. 29 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8-10)\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither of Crystallex's experts disagrees with this conclusion: Dr. Rigobon and Professor Hernandez acknowledge that PDVSA is an SA with its own legal personality. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 35 at \u00b6 5; D.I. 36 at \u00b6 3) But the important point - which is the opinion of Crystallex's experts, as well as the finding of the Court, after considering the totality of the evidence, including the views of PDVSA's experts - is that, in practice, PDVSA operates as the alter ego of Venezuela.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Professor Montoya further discusses the distinction made in the Public Administration Organic Law between Centralized Administration departments, which do not have their own legal personalities, and the Decentralized Administration, which consists of entities, like PDVSA, which do have their own legal personalities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-19) Professor Montoya cites a decision by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Constitutional Chamber), which recognized \"the legal nature of PDVSA as [an SA] and confirmed that PDVSA is part of the Public Administration, but not part of the Centralized Administration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18) Again, Crystallex's declarants do not challenge the facts of this conclusion, just their significance, and again the Court agrees with Crystallex's view as to their minimal importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    ix. Conclusion as to exclusive control test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Having made the factual findings noted throughout the discussion above by a preponderance of the evidence after considering all of the record evidence cumulatively, the Court finds that Crystallex has rebutted the presumption of separateness and has shown that PDVSA may be deemed the alter ego of Venezuela pursuant to the exclusive control prong of\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. Therefore, Crystallex has proven the applicability of an exception to PDVSA's sovereign immunity. The Court rejects PDVSA's factual challenge to the Court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Crystallex Has Met Its Burden with Respect to Execution Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Having found that Crystallex has met its burden to rebut the presumption of separateness between PDVSA and Venezuela and proven that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela, and therefore no jurisdictional immunity prevents the Court from having authority to resolve the parties' disputes, the Court must next determine whether Crystallex has also overcome the immunities embodied in the FSIA relating to attachment and execution on property held by foreign sovereigns in the United States. On this issue, while again PDVSA's motion\n   can be read as raising both facial and factual attacks, the analysis essentially overlaps and, hence, can be conducted once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Three issues are presented: (i) which statutory provision applies, (ii) has the property Crystallex seeks to attach - the shares of Delaware corporation PDVH - been used for commercial activity, and (iii) even if the shares have been so used, are they currently being used for commercial activity, which requires consideration of certain Executive Orders issued by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\").

Therefore, the property subject to attachment - PDVSA's shares in PDVH - may properly be considered property of Venezuela, implicating \u00a7 1610(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Moreover, Crystallex expressly moves only under \u00a7 1610(a) - and PDVSA appears to agree that only \u00a7 1610(a) applies.

PDVSA retains the ability to use the shares to name directors and approve contracts submitted to shareholders for approval.... PDVSA can still pledge its PDVH shares to secure its own short term debt (a commercial use).\" (D.I. 52 at 5) Moreover, Crystallex contends that the PDVH shares are equity securities, and OFAC has specifically allowed such dealings in equity, notwithstanding the Executive Order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (quoting D.I. 34 Ex. 107)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The Court agrees with Crystallex.

Section 1(b) also does not render the PDVH shares noncommercial property or otherwise pose a bar to the relief Crystallex seeks. Upon attachment, the PDVH shares would not be paid or distributed to Venezuela but, eventually, to Crystallex. In fact, as Crystallex states, \"PDVSA can\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and does\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   continue to engage in a wide array of commercial uses of the shares, such as: naming directors and officers,\n   including, for example, the president of PDVH's indirect subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum, months after sanctions were imposed; running large-scale gas refining and marketing operations in the United States; and directing PDVH (and its subsidiaries) to enter into related-party transactions for PDVSA's benefit, including the sale of PDVSA's (low quality) oil to CITGO Petroleum.\" (D.I. 53 at 3) (citing evidence)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Moreover, the PDVH shares are equity securities and the OFAC has instructed that \"[e]ngaging in transactions related to, providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in any equity issued by, on behalf of, or for the Government of Venezuela is permissible, if the equity was issued prior to the effective date of [the Executive Order].\" (D.I. 34-1 Ex. 107 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C155\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The term\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     equity\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   includes stocks, share issuances, depositary receipts, or any other evidence of title or ownership.\") ) The shares of PDVH that Crystallex seeks to attach were issued before the Executive Order was adopted.

Subsequent to the issuance of E.O. 13835, OFAC received inquiries about how and whether subsection 1(a)(iii) of E.O. 13835 could affect the ability to enforce bondholder rights to the CITGO shares serving as collateral for the PdVSA 2020 8.5 percent bond. Subsection 1(a)(iii) of E.O. 13835 hinders the Maduro regime's ability to dispose of interests in entities owned 50 percent or more by the GOV at terms unfavorable to the Venezuelan people. Authorizing bondholders to enforce rights related to the PdVSA 2020 8.5 percent bond prevents the Maduro regime from using the EO to default on its bond obligations without consequence. In order to provide that authorization, OFAC is issuing General License 5, which removes E.O. 13835 as an obstacle to holders of the PdVSA 2020 8.5 percent bond gaining access to their collateral, and keeps sanctions pressure where it belongs - on the Maduro regime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   According to Crystallex, FAQ 596 specifically allows attachment and execution of Venezuelan assets and while FAQ 595 \"addresses a specific class of creditors, the same reasoning applies to other creditors such as Crystallex.\" (D.I. 64 at 2) Crystallex further contends that while, in response to FAQ 596, \"OFAC did advise - in a non-binding FAQ response - that a license would likely be needed before attachment and execution could be completed, ... that has no impact on the question of whether this Court can or should authorize the relief sought by the Writ Motion in the first instance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The Court agrees with Crystallex.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that Executive Order 13835 does not pose a bar to granting the relief it has granted today.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Additional Issues Raised by PDVSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Although most of PDVSA's arguments against granting Crystallex's requested writ have been addressed in the course of resolving the many issues discussed to this point in this Opinion, several additional contentions merit brief discussion. None, however, alters the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Prejudgment Attachment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   PDVSA warns that granting the relief sought by Crystallex will amount to a prejudgment attachment, which is precluded by \u00a7 1610(d). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 71 at 3 (\"[T]his Court cannot attach or otherwise restrain PDVSA's shares of PDVH unless and until it enters judgment against PDVSA ....\"); Tr. at 64) The Court rejects this view and instead agrees with Crystallex that it has a judgment: the confirmed and registered arbitration judgment against Venezuela. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 78; Aug. Tr. at 30 (\"It's not that we cleverly labeled this as a Rule 69 motion. It is that we cleverly already won our case against the Government of Venezuela and we don't have to file it again and again in every court in the land.\") ) Crystallex is not seeking to add PDVSA to that judgment. Provided that, as the Court has found, any sovereign immunity that would otherwise protect PDVSA and its specified property has been overcome - by the judgment against Venezuela, the finding that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego, and the findings with respect to the \"commercial\" use of the PDVH shares - then the FSIA is no bar to the relief sought by Crystallex. in this context, it is simply incorrect to call what the Court is doing an improper prejudgment attachment on PDVSA's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   <strong>\n    2. PDVSA's Non-Involvement with Expropriation of Crystallex's Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Throughout this litigation, PDVSA has emphasized the lack of allegations and evidence that PDVSA had anything to do with \"the facts and circumstances that gave rise to [Crystallex's] claim for expropriation. It is a stranger to the entire dispute.\" (Tr. at 39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 51 at 3 (\"[I]t is undisputed that PDVSA was a complete stranger to that transaction.\") ) PDVSA is correct. The only connection Crystallex even alleges between PDVSA and the harm Crystallex Has suffered is that, ultimately, Crystallex's expropriated property was given to PDVSA, which then converted part of it into \"billions of dollars.\" (Aug. Tr. at 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 73 (\"[B]asically we had a contract to develop this mine. [Venezuela] took that contract away from us and they gave the mine without the license to PDVSA which went around and sold ... 40 percent of it for $2.4 billion.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 5-1 Exs. 78-82 (showing PDVSA ended up with rights to gold mines) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   But these facts do not undermine the Court's conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   does not require that the alter ego, whose property is being attached and executed, have been involved in the underlying conduct that harmed the judgment creditor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 85-86) (Crystallex noting, \"there was not remotely any claim that\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   had been involved at all in the expropriation of the Citibank assets\") To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   shows that alter ego status is not limited to \"state conduct in which the instrumentality had a key role,\" as there the Cuban bank - which Citibank sought to hold liable for Cuba's seizure of Citibank's assets - played no role whatsoever in Cuba's seizure of those assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191414\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/611/#p627\">\n    462 U.S. at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191414\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/611/#p627\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kensington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201032269\">\n    2007 WL 1032269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 14-16 (finding state oil company liable for nation's default even though company was not involved in underlying loan).\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Although, as already noted, there is \"no mechanical formula\" for assessing whether the extensive control prong of\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   has been satisfied, the factors that have been developed by courts applying\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   have\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   included a requirement that the purportedly \"separate\" entity has been involved in the conduct that harmed the creditor.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 26 at 21-22) Some of the claims being pressed by Crystallex in the Hague evidently were premised on PDVSA's separateness from the Republic. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616888\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/816/#p823\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) PDVSA concludes that \"Crystallex should be precluded from pursuing such fundamentally inconsistent positions in different fora.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 69-70)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The Court disagrees. As an initial matter, it is not clear what law governs the Hague proceedings, and the parties have not provided the Court with evidence of (for example) Dutch law on conspiracy. Therefore, the Court does not have a clear understanding of the basis on which the Hague Court dismissed certain of Crystallex's claims. Moreover, Crystallex explains that it was initially pressing multiple theories in the Hague: some of them premised on PDVSA and Venezuela being separate entities, some premised on a different view. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26-28) The Court has no basis to conclude that maintaining alternative theories, particularly at the outset of a case, is improper in the Hague Court. More importantly, doing so is expressly permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 8. As those rules govern this Court's procedures, it is plain that Crystallex is not judicially estopped from advocating inconsistent theories in this very Court (something it is not even accused of doing). It follows that it is also not (at this point) judicially estopped from taking inconsistent positions in different courts. Finally, as Crystallex observes, estoppel of the type PDVSA urges on the Court does not apply at least until a party is successful in persuading a tribunal of one position and then seeks to persuade another tribunal of a contradictory position. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 80) (citing\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Overbreadth of Crystallex's position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   PDVSA also highlights what it portrays as the vast breadth of Crystallex's position: if Crystallex is correct that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela, then both entities are potentially liable for all of each other's liabilities, even where (as PDVSA contends is true here) one entity had absolutely nothing to do with the facts giving rise to the liability imposed on the other. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 86-87) (Crystallex responding to PDVSA's charge) The Court does not agree that this is the necessary outcome of granting the requested writ. The writ is directed (as it must be) to specifically-identified property, here the shares of PDVH. Were Crystallex (or any other judgment creditor of Venezuela) to wish to attach other property belonging to PDVSA, it would have to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the sovereign immunity otherwise applicable to that property has been overcome - just as Crystallex has done here. That will not always be possible; for instance, the property might not be currently \"used for a commercial activity,\" as required by \u00a7 1610(a)(6). This is an important distinction between adding PDVSA to Crystallex's judgment against Venezuela - which would allow Crystallex to attach any of PDVSA's property to satisfy the judgment, without additional proceedings, if, for example, the proceeds from the sale of the shares it is attaching are less than the full amount of its judgment - and only attaching specific property, which is the result being permitted here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Additionally, the record which has persuaded this Court that PDVSA and Venezuela should be treated as alter egos of one another may not be the same record\n   that is created in some other action. Indeed, even in this case, the record may be supplemented in the next stage of the proceedings (as is further described below), which could potentially lead to different findings. Other factfinders might deem the record before them to justify different findings. Further, the state law and procedures applicable in any other District may well vary from those being applied here, perhaps in material ways. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Aug. Tr, at 36) And the collateral estoppel effect of any ruling from this Court will be a matter to be decided by whatever other court is confronted with these issues at a later time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Finally, even if PDVSA is right about the implications of the Court's holding today (and Crystallex insists it is not\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), the Court cannot be deterred from reaching the right conclusion, based on the facts before it and the applicable law, just because it fears the impact of its rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Next Steps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   By its decision today, the Court is holding that it will, after conferring further with the parties about additional details, direct the Clerk of Court to issue to Crystallex a writ, which Crystallex will then have the opportunity to serve and attach to PDVSA's property in Delaware, i.e., its shares in PDVH. Some aspects of the parties' dispute, however, remain unsettled. These include: (i) how quickly should the Court direct the writ to be issued, how quickly should Crystallex be directed to serve it, and how quickly must Crystallex execute on it; (ii) what is the appropriate commercially reasonable procedure by which to effectuate the sale of the PDVH shares, in order to maximize the likelihood of a fair and reasonable recovery, and how involved (if at all) does the Court need to be in that sale process;\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iii) does Crystallex, or alternatively a purchaser of the PDVH shares, wish to (or need to) seek a license from OFAC to permit the sale and, if so, when will it do so; and (iv) will Venezuela, PDVSA, and/or any other entity appear and seek to supplement the factual record already developed in this litigation and, if so, will such an entity attempt to (and, if so, be permitted to) argue that additional evidence materially alters the Court's findings, and thereby seek to quash the writ?\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hibou, Inc. v.

Is the answer the same for jurisdictional immunity and for execution immunity?\" (D.I. 68 at 1) The parties' responses to these seemingly straightforward questions collectively amount to approximately three pages of single-spaced text. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 70 at 1-2; D.I. 71 at 1-2) The Court's best assessment is that it is presented with both facial and factual challenges. To the extent this is unclear, in an abundance of caution the Court treats PDVSA's motion as if it presents both types of challenges.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-331\">\n    Because this miscellaneous action was initiated not by a complaint but instead by a motion, there is some uncertainty as to what materials the Court should look to for purposes of the facial challenge. The Court concludes it is appropriate to take as true all \"well-pled\" factual allegations contained in Crystallex's motion, briefs, letters, declarations, expert reports, exhibits, or during any hearing or teleconference with the Court. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 70 at 3) There is no doubt PDVSA has had fair notice of each of these allegations and a full opportunity to rebut them. In any event, even were the Court to take a more restrictive approach - for instance, limiting its consideration to only those factual allegations contained in Crystallex's opening brief in support of its motion - the Court would still find that Crystallex had met its burden to show probable cause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    Relatedly, both sides fault the other for purportedly fatal procedural failings. PDVSA complains that \"Crystallex should have commenced a plenary action against PDVSA by filing a complaint and serving PDVSA in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FSIA.\" (D.I. 71 at 2) Crystallex counters that PDVSA should have \"move[d] to quash the writ after issuance, as is the ordinary course,\" rather than intervening and \"preemptively\" moving to dismiss. (D.I. 70 at 3 n.5) In the Court's view, both parties had options as to how to proceed, and there is nothing deficient in how they chose to do so. Certainly, neither party can credibly contend that it has been denied due process or had an inadequate opportunity to be heard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-333\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , D.I. 3-1 at 7-23; D.I. 33 at 10-12 (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnotes omitted).
