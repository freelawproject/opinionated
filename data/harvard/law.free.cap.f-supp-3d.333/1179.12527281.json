BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendants' Brief in Support of Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), filed September 29, 2017 (Doc. 19)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on June 4, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the forum selection clause in the Microtel Inns and Suites Franchising, Inc. License Agreement, filed September 27, 2017 (Doc. 15-1)(\"Franchise Agreement\"), is contractually valid; (ii) whether the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey would have personal jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs if the Court transferred the case; (iii) whether the forum selection clause in the Franchise Agreement and incorporated in the Amendment Assignment and Assumption Agreement, filed September 27, 2017 (Doc. 15-2)(\"Assignment Agreement\"), is void under New Mexico law, as those agreements are construction contracts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -28A-1 ; and (iv) whether the Court should transfer this matter to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey so that it can be consolidated with\n   <em>\n    Microtel Inns and Suites Franchising, Inc. v. Presidential Hospitality, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-5637 (D.N.J.)(Wigenton, J.)(\"New Jersey Action\"). The Court concludes that: (i) the forum selection clause is contractually valid; (ii) New Jersey has personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff Presidential Hospitality and Plaintiff Sam Blue, but not over Plaintiff Ace Development, Inc.; (iii) the Court may not consider New Mexico public policy when it sits in diversity and considers a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) motion, but, even if it could, the Franchise Agreement and the Assignment Agreement are not construction contracts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -28A-1, so the forum selection clause at issue would not be void as against public policy; and (iv) the Court will transfer Presidential Hospitality's and Blue's claims. The Court may not transfer Ace Development's claims, because New Jersey does not appear to have personal jurisdiction\n   over that Plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion in part and denies it in part. The Court severs Ace Development's claims under rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and transfers the remaining parties and claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court draws its facts from the First Amended Complaint for Violation of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act; Fraudulent Inducement; Negligent Misrepresentation; and Jury Demand, filed September 25, 2017 (Eleventh Judicial District Court, County of San Juan, State of New Mexico), filed in federal court on September 26, 2017 (Doc. 1-5)(\"FAC\") and from various attachments to the parties' briefing. The Court uses and accepts those facts as true only for the purposes of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. The Court's acceptance and use of those facts here does not mean that those facts are true or that later litigation on those facts is foreclosed. The Court also notes that the case is at an uncommon posture on a motion to transfer in that the Court has already adjudicated a motion for a temporary restraining order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202604831\">\n    2018 WL 2604831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed June 2018 (Doc. 37)(\" MOO\"), so it has a greater grasp on the facts than it would have on a typical motion to transfer. The Court summarizes the facts relevant to the transfer issue and then states its more detailed factual findings from the MOO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Summary of Facts\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC, through its affiliates, Defendants Baymont Inn and Suites Franchise Systems Inc., and Microtel Inn and Suites Franchising, Inc., offers, sells, owns, and operates hotels and hotel chains throughout the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 1, at 2. In March, 2011, Plaintiff Sam Blue, a managing member of Plaintiff Presidential Hospitality, LLC, entered the Franchise Agreement with Microtel Inn, purchasing the rights to a Microtel Inn franchise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franchise Agreement at 1. In exchange for the right to build and operate a Microtel Inn hotel in Durango, Colorado, Blue agreed, among other things, to pay monthly fees to Microtel Inn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franchise Agreement at 1, 6, 33. The Franchise Agreement includes a forum selection clause, which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Venue\n   </em>\n   . Any litigation arising out of or related to this Agreement including, without limitation, any breach of this Agreement and any and all disputes between the parties, regardless of the form of action, shall be instituted exclusively at our discretion in the state or federal court of general jurisdiction closest to our then-current principal business address. You expressly agree that you are subject to the jurisdiction and venue of those courts for purposes of such litigation. You hereby waive and covenant not to assert any claim that you are not subject to personal jurisdiction in those courts or that venue in those courts is for any reason improper, inconvenient, prejudicial or otherwise inappropriate (including, without limitation, any claim under the judicial doctrine of forum non conveniens). The provisions of this Paragraph 13N shall be self-executing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franchise Agreement at 29. In May, 2013, Blue, Presidential Hospitality, and Microtel Inn, entered into the Assignment Agreement, which transferred Blue's rights and obligations under the Franchise Agreement to Presidential Hospitality, and allowed Presidential Hospitality to build and operate the hotel in Aztec, New Mexico, instead of in Durango.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agreement at 1, 4. Blue remained secondarily liable for payment and performance of the Franchise Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agreement at 1. The Assignment Agreement incorporates the Franchise Agreement, including the Franchise\n   Agreement's forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agreement at 2; Response at 2 n.1 (admitting that the forum selection clause is incorporated into the Assignment Agreement by reference). Related to the Assignment Agreement, Blue signed a Guaranty that Presidential Hospitality will punctually pay and perform its obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty at 1, filed September 27, 2017 (Doc. 15-3)(\"Guaranty\"). Blue acknowledged in the Guaranty that the Franchise Agreement's forum selection clause applies to the Guaranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Assignment Agreement also stipulates that a Development Incentive Note, filed September 29, 2017 (Doc. 19-2)(\"Dev. Incentive Note\") amends the Franchise Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agreement at 4. In the Dev. Incentive Note, Microtel Inn agrees to loan $105,000.00 to Presidential Hospitality, at no interest, on the conditions that Presidential Hospitality passes a credit review, pays an application fee, completes the hotel in compliance with the standards set forth in the Franchise Agreement, and opens the hotel no later than April 5, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dev. Incentive Note at 1. Under the Dev. Incentive Note, one-fifteenth of the loan amount will be forgiven on each anniversary of the hotel's opening date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dev. Incentive Note at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March, 2015, Presidential Hospitality and Blue defaulted on their fee payments to Microtel Inn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC to Presidential Hospitality, LLC and Sam Blue, at 1 (dated March 10, 2015), filed September 26, 2017 (Doc. 1-3). In August, 2015, Presidential Hospitality and Microtel Inn entered a payment plan to pay off the past amount Presidential Hospitality and Blue owed as a result of the March, 2015 default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Payment Plan Relating to the License Agreement between Microtel Inn &amp; Suites and Presidential Hospitality, LLC, for the Facility Designated as Unit # 47176-03078-01-MTL, Located in Aztec, New Mexico at 1 (dated August 3, 2015), filed September 26, 2017 (Doc. 1-4)(\"Payment Plan\"). Presidential Hospitality did not make the required payments under the Payment Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC to Sam Blue and Presidential Hospitality, LLC at 1 (dated October 8, 2015), filed September 26, 2017 (Doc. 1-4)(\"October Default Notice\"). In July, 2017, Wyndham Hotel sent Presidential Hospitality and Blue another default notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC to Sam Blue and Presidential Hospitality, LLC at 1 (dated July 12, 2017), filed September 26, 2017 (Doc. 1-4)(\"July Default Notice\"). Presidential Hospitality and Blue never cured that default, so Wyndham Hotel and Microtel Inn terminated the Franchise Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC to Sam Blue and Presidential Hospitality, LLC at 1 (dated September 12, 2017), filed September 27, 2017 (Doc. 15-5)(\"Termination Notice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 1, 2017, Microtel Inn sued Presidential Hospitality and Blue in New Jersey for the fees owed under the Franchise Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Microtel Inns and Suites Franchising, Inc. v.

In the NJ FAC, Microtel Inn alleges that Presidential Hospitality and Blue: (i) have violated the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), by continuing to use the Microtel registered mark after the Franchise Agreement's termination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   NJ FAC \u00b6\u00b6 45-55, at 10-12; (ii) owe damages for breach of the Franchise Agreement, NJ FAC \u00b6\u00b6 56-81, at 12-16; and (iii) owe damages for breach of the\n   Dev.

Plaintiff Sam Blue is a New Mexico citizen, who is a managing member of Plaintiff Presidential Hospitality, LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceedings at 10:7-17 (taken September 28, 2017)(Court, Enriquez)(\"Sept.

In March, 2011, Blue entered the Franchise Agreement, purchasing the rights to a Microtel Inn franchise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franchise Agreement at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   5. In May, 2013, Blue assigned his rights and obligations under the Contract to Presidential Hospitality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agreement at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   6. According to the Plaintiffs, \"through various representations, promises, omissions,\" of which many were \"false, incomplete, and misleading,\" in addition to \"high-pressure-sales tactics,\" the Wyndham Hotel and Microtel Inn induced Blue to purchase that Microtel Inn franchise. FAC \u00b6 2, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   7. Again, according to the Plaintiffs, that inducement resulted from a relationship formed among Blue and an agent of the Wyndham Hotel, Gregg Koffler.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 12-49, 65-70, at 4-11, 14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   8. Blue first met Koffler in June, 2010, because Koffler had contacted Blue to tell him that the Wyndham Hotel was interested in property that Blue owned in Aztec, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 15-19, at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   9. Blue believed that the Wyndham Hotel wanted to buy his land.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 18, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   10. At his meeting with Koffler, however, instead of discussing the Wyndham Hotel's interest in buying Blue's property, Koffler solicited Blue to purchase a Baymont Inn franchise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 19, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   11. Koffler told Blue that, if Blue purchased the franchise, Blue would be able to quickly flip the property for a profit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 21, at 5 (\"Mr. Koffler told Mr. Blue that there would be a line of people interested in purchasing the hotel and he guaranteed a buyer by the time the hotel was built.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    \u00b6 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   12. Blue was initially uninterested, because he wanted to sell his property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 13, 20, at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   13. To further persuade Blue that purchasing the franchise was a solid investment, Koffler told Blue that the Wyndham Hotel \"would most likely want to invest in the construction of the hotel,\" FAC \u00b6 22, at 5, and that Blue, who had no experience in running a hotel, would not have to operate it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21, 27 at 2, 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   14. After speaking briefly with a Wyndham Hotel executive, Koffler represented to Blue that the Wyndham Hotel would invest $150,000.00 in the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 23, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   15. Koffler did not tell Blue that the Wyndham Hotel's investment would be a loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 23, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   16. Upon Koffler's representations, in particular the representation that the Wyndham Hotel would invest $150,000.00 of its own money in the property's development, Blue agreed to apply for a Baymont Inn franchise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 25, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   17. About a month later, and after Blue received preliminary approval to buy the franchise, Blue had second thoughts and told Koffler that he did not think anyone would want to buy the hotel from him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 26, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   18. Koffler again told Blue that the Wyndham Hotel \"was going to have buyers 'lined up,' \" FAC \u00b6 28, at 7, and also that, if Blue did not agree to purchase the franchise, Koffler would probably lose his job,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 29, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   19. Blue subsequently agreed to the purchase and entered into the Baymont Franchise Systems Inc., Franchise Agreement (\"Baymont Contract\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   20. Baymont Inn did not provide Blue \"a complete and timely copy of its Franchise Disclosure Document\" (\"FDD\"). FAC \u00b6 36, at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   21. According to Blue, as a result of the Baymont Contract, he and Koffler became friends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 37-38 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   22. \"Mr. Koffler often told Mr. Blue what a great person he was and that he bragged to his family about him.\" FAC \u00b6 38, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   23. Accordingly, \"Mr. Blue felt compelled to help Mr. Koffler who referred to Mr. Blue as his 'friend.' \" FAC \u00b6 38, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   24. Shortly after entering the Baymont Contract, Koffler asked Blue to accompany him on a potential deal to sell another franchise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 37, at 8 (\"Mr. Koffler asked Mr. Blue to vouch for him and Wyndham.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   25. Koffler told Blue that his job had been stressful lately, straining relations with his family, so \"he needed to make this sale.\" FAC \u00b6 37, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   26. When the potential deal did not happen, Koffler confessed to Blue that he needed to sell another franchise or the Wyndham Hotel would fire him, and he would lose both his house and his family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 39, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   27. Koffler also told Blue that he \"owed people money\" and that those people \"would hurt his family\" if he did not pay them back. FAC \u00b6 40, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   28. As Koffler later recounted, the threats against him were \"either you pay me or I'll come knock on your door; I know where you live and I am going to tell your wife exactly what's going on here and you know, who knows what else was going to happen.\" FAC \u00b6 65, at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   29. In the following weeks, Koffler frequently solicited Blue to buy a Microtel Inn franchise for a property in Durango, Colorado.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 41, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   30. Koffler again aggressively pitched the deal to Blue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 41, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   31. Koffler told Blue that Blue could easily re-sell the property for profit and that \"Wyndham would have several buyers ready to purchase the hotel.\" FAC \u00b6 42, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   32. Koffler added that the Microtel Inn franchise would be an even better deal than the Baymont franchise, because Microtel Inn was a \"new brand\" that would\n   be Wyndham Hotel's \"top money maker.\" FAC \u00b6 41, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   33. Koffler also told Blue that \"it was hard to get a Microtel franchise,\" but he could get Blue a special price. FAC \u00b6 41, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   34. To further induce the sale, Koffler provided Blue a Smith Travel Research Report (\"Smith Report\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 43, at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   35. The Smith Report contained information about hotels in Durango from 2005 to 2011, including: occupancy percentage, average daily rate, revenue per available room, supply, demand, and revenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 43, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   36. Koffler represented that any Microtel Inn hotel would \"perform as well or better than the hotels in the S[mith] report.\" FAC \u00b6 43, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   37. Relying on Koffler's representations, Blue entered the Contract for a Microtel Inn franchise and paid a $30,000.00 initial franchise fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 44-46, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   38.

The Defendants admit that, should the Court transfer this action, a New Jersey court will be required to interpret two New Mexico UPA claims and two New Mexico tort claims, but they argue that transfer is still proper, because the \"majority of claims will still be governed by New Jersey law and the outcome will depend on facts rather than novel or difficult legal issues.\" Motion at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Defendants argue that many of the remaining factors favor transfer.

Finally, the Defendants contend that the interests-of-justice factor favors transfer \"primarily due to the first filed rule,\" as it would \"waste judicial resources\" for two federal courts to adjudicate separate cases with \"the same nucleus of operative facts.\" Motion at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Plaintiffs respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' Brief in Support of Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), filed October 13, 2017 (Doc. 23)(\"Response\").

The Plaintiffs also argue that one of their fraudulent inducement theories relates to the Dev.

The basis underlying this contention is his perception that recovery will be more difficult under English law than under American law. Riley will not be deprived of his day in court. He may, though, have to structure his case differently than if proceeding in federal district court. The fact that an international transaction may be subject to laws and remedies different or less favorable than those of the United States is not a valid basis to deny enforcement, provided that the law of the chosen forum is not inherently unfair. English law does not preclude Riley from pursuing an action for fraud and we agree with the Defendants that the Lloyd's Act does not grant statutory immunity for such claims. We have been shown nothing to suggest than an English court would not be fair, and in fact, our courts have long recognized that the courts of England are fair and neutral forums.

It notes, however, that should it adhere to its previous holding, it appears at first glance that judicial inefficiency would result. The New Jersey Action and this action arise from a common nexus of fact. The Defendants assert that the Plaintiffs owe damages under the Franchise Agreement; the Plaintiffs assert that they do not owe damages, because the Franchise Agreement was induced by fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1196. Accordingly, two courts' work could be reduced to one court's work should the Court transfer all of the Plaintiffs' claims. That efficiency is seemingly stymied if the Court sticks with its previous ruling, because that holding results in the Court keeping Ace Development's claims and thus two courts would adjudicate nearly identical cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   A curious aberration results if the Court scraps its previous holding, however: the Court would conclude that New Jersey has personal jurisdiction over Ace Development by virtue of the forum selection clause, but the New Jersey court would be forced to conclude that it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have personal jurisdiction over Ace Development, because the Third Circuit-which includes the District of New Jersey-has rejected the theory that forum selection clauses can bind non-signatories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Howmedica Osteonics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275273\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/390/#p407\">\n    867 F.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, after transfer to\n   New Jersey, the Defendants could likely secure a dismissal of Ace Development's claims. The ultimate result is that Ace Development would likely re-file its claims here. Thus, transferring Ace Development would not produce judicial efficiency. The Court, therefore, sees no reason to depart from its previous determination that forum selection clauses do not bind non-signatories, and the Court will not transfer Ace Development and its claims to the District of New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Although the Court concludes that it cannot transfer Ace Development and its claims to New Jersey, the Court contemplates severing Ace Development's claims and transferring Presidential Hospitality's and Blue's claims to New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Presbyterian Healthcare Serv. v.

This normal efficiency principle, however, has little bearing on the Court's decisionmaking here. No matter what the Court does, two courts will decide highly similar issues. If the Court severs and transfers Presidential Hospitality's and Blue's claims, both New Jersey and the Court will have to adjudicate facts surrounding the parties' various agreements; if the Court declines to sever, both New Jersey and the Court will still have to adjudicate facts surrounding the parties' various agreements. Some efficiency might result from severing Ace Development from the rest, as Ace Development is not a party in the New Jersey Action.

Given the budget restraints under which most construction projects operate, much of the work is performed by local subcontractors.

Many subcontractors believe this practice puts them at a distinct disadvantage, as it costs them more to pursue or defend claims. State legislatures have been receptive to subcontractor concerns on this score, and generally are in favor of local courts resolving in-state construction disputes.

As explained above, a typical contractor-subcontract contract is an agreement that the subcontractor will carry out some subset of a project's construction to which the contractor has agreed with a third party to carry out the project's entire construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1231. The relationship between Microtel Inn and Blue, as embodied in the Franchise Agreement, is not one of Blue agreeing to build a hotel so that Microtel Inn can fulfill some larger construction obligation to a third party. Instead, it is one of Microtel Inn granting Blue the right to use Microtel Inn's intellectual property in operating a hotel. Although the Franchise Agreement also requires Blue to build a hotel in compliance with certain Microtel Inn specifications, that reality does not change the fundamental agreement between the two parties to such a degree that it becomes a contractor-subcontractor agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   The Assignment Agreement is also not a contractor-subcontractor agreement. Based on its language, the Assignment Agreement is meant to transfer Blue's rights and obligations under the Franchise Agreement to Presidential Hospitality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agreement at 1 (\"Assignor assigns, transfers, bargains, sells, and delegates to Assignee all of its rights ...\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (\"Assignee accepts and assumes the rights, benefits and obligations of the Licensee ...\"). Again, that there are references to the hotel that needs to be completed, does not make this assignment a contractor-subcontractor relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, even if the Court could consider\n   <extracted-citation index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057\">\n    N.M.

The Court independently does not see why a New Jersey judgment would be more difficult to enforce than a New Mexico judgment, nor does it see how New Mexico would provide a fairer trial than New Jersey. Accordingly, those factors do not counsel either way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Concerning the congested-dockets factor, the Plaintiffs argue that the New Jersey civil docket is, on average, more congested than the New Mexico docket, so a New Mexico forum is favorable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 14. The Court stands by its observation at the hearing that the \"civil statistics\" do not \"tell the full story, given the tremendous criminal load we have out here.\" Tr. at 7:15-17 (Court). Indeed, examining the same document to which the Plaintiffs cite to support that New Jersey district judges have more civil cases than New Mexico district judges, the Court notes that New Jersey district judges have 26 criminal felony filings per judge, whereas New Mexico district judges have 639 criminal felony filings per judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States District Courts-National Judicial Caseload Profile, June 2017 Federal Court Management Statistics, at 15, 81\n   <em>\n    http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/data_tables/fcms_na_distprofile0331.2017.pdf\n   </em>\n   .

Moreover, the District of New Mexico has had or will have at least two district judges take senior status this year, and their replacements will take some time to be nominated and confirmed. The Court expects a concomitant rise in all of the remaining district judges' caseloads until new judges can take their places. The Court does suggest in any way that New Jersey district judges\n   are not busy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, given the above realities in this border state, the Court concludes that the congested-docket factor does not weigh for transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Conflicts of law issues and the advantage of having a local court determine questions of local law counsels only mildly against transfer.

One of the Plaintiffs' theories of liability under the UPA, however, is that the Defendants violated federal law, which also happens to be a violation of the UPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 84-85, at 19 (\"A violation of Section 436.1(a) of the Franchise Rule and section 5(a) of the FTC Act constitutes a violation of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act.\").;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 103-04, at 22.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which holds that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight, and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there at least to be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit-or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves-would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point-regardless whether it accurately reflects state law-at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination-the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants-if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion-have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-299\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments-developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Court, for example, gets the New Mexico Bar Bulletin and at least glances at every published Supreme Court of New Mexico case and some of the published Court of Appeals of New Mexico cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-300\">\n    The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560510\" index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/518/#p525\">\n     787 F.2d 518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525 (10th Cir. 1986) ;\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v. Sears, Roebuck, &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    , 822 F.2d at 908.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 923 (McKay, J., dissenting)(noting that the majority had abandoned the \"sanctified\" clearly erroneous standard or, the \"so-called local-judge rule\" in its analysis). The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-301\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding-what the state law was on the day the opinion was published-but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-302\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x.\n    </em>\n    Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive-interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law-in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-303\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3], at 90 n.7.3 (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

Ill. 1983) (noting that the approach of predicting the state supreme court's holdings will often lead to litigants obtaining a different result in federal court than they would in state court, where only the law of the circuit in which they filed-and certainly not nonexistent, speculative state supreme court law-governs)-but it is a workable solution that has achieved consensus.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allstate Ins.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, the\n    <em>\n     Restatements of Law\n    </em>\n    , and personnel changes on the court-considerations that would not remotely inform a federal court's analysis of federal law-may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-304\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time-forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous)-federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases-even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law-alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-305\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree. In\n    <em>\n     Wankier v. Crown Equipment Corp.\n    </em>\n    , the Tenth Circuit said that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n    [w]here no controlling state decision exists, the federal court must attempt to predict what the state's highest court would do. In performing this ventriloquial function, however, the federal court is bound by ordinary principles of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis.\n    </em>\n    Thus, when a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, and on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state's highest court has resolved the issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-307\">\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

From this passage, it seems clear the Tenth Circuit permits a district court to deviate from its view of state law only on the basis of a subsequent case \"of the state's highest court.\"\n    <em>\n     The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    1402 (William Morris ed., New College ed. 1976)(defining \"unless\" as \"[e]xcept on the condition that; except under the circumstances that\"). A more aggressive reading of the passage-namely the requirement that the intervening case \"resolv[e] the issue\"-might additionally compel the determination that any intervening case law must definitively and directly contradict the Tenth Circuit interpretation in order to be considered \"intervening.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-308\">\n    It is difficult to know whether Judge McConnell's limitation of \"intervening decision\" to cases from the highest state court was an oversight or intentional. Most of the Tenth Circuit's previous formulations of this rule have defined intervening decisions inclusively as all subsequent decisions of \"that state's courts,\" a term which seems to include trial and intermediate appellate courts.
