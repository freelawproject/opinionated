Crabtree, United States District Judge\n   In recent years, a variety of factors have generated a new market for something called wellness services. In simple form, the market theorized that a healthier workforce would produce lower health insurance costs for business owners and operators. And employees would benefit, in turn, because their share of health insurance costs would reduce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In one form of a typical wellness program, the employer selects a wellness provider. This provider offers employees the chance to participate in on-site biometric screenings. These screenings provide each participating employee with individualized data about that employee's current health profile. The wellness provider also supplies participating employees with information and programs designed to improve-or, at least, maintain-their health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the case currently before the court, two wellness companies contracted so that one of them-defendant Wellness Corporate Solutions, LLC-would perform on-site biometric screenings for plaintiff Accountable Health Solutions, LLC. Accountable Health then would coordinate and operate wellness plans with employers and the employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Things got more complicated in 2015. Plaintiff Hooper Holmes, Inc. bought Accountable Health and the relationship with Wellness soured. A few months after Hooper Holmes acquired Accountable Health, they fell behind on the payments owed to Wellness for services it had rendered. Payment against the outstanding invoices continued to linger into 2016. And in May 2016, Wellness contracted to provide wellness services directly to one of plaintiffs' largest clients. When Accountable Health and Hooper Holmes learned about this contract, they objected to it and stopped paying down the debt they owed Wellness. They also filed this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their Complaint, plaintiffs Accountable Health and Hooper Holmes asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing and good faith, tortious interference with contract, and tortious interference with prospective business expectancies or relationships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1. Generally, they alleged that Wellness was liable under those theories because it had entered into a contract directly with plaintiffs' former client. Accountable Health and Hooper Holmes also brought a declaratory judgment claim. This claim asked the court to declare that they did not have to pay the amounts they owed to defendant Wellness on the outstanding invoices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Wellness answered and asserted a Counterclaim, alleging that Accountable Health and Hooper Holmes had breached the parties' contract by failing to pay the overdue invoices. Doc. 35. On Wellness's motions for summary judgment, the court granted summary judgment in Wellness's favor against Accountable Health and Hooper Holmes's claims for breach of an implied covenant, tortious interference with contract, tortious interference with prospective business expectancy, and the declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 140. This left, for trial, the Complaint's breach of contract claim and the claim for breach of contract asserted in Wellness's Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court conducted a bench trial in February 2018. Having reflected on the evidence and the arguments, the court now is ready to rule on the claims made by both parties. The court finds for plaintiffs Accountable Health and Hooper Holmes on their breach of contract claims and awards them $2.00 in nominal damages. And the court finds for Wellness on its breach of contract Counterclaim, awarding it $235,156.58 plus $111,069.52 in interest. The court does not award Wellness its attorneys' fees. The court explains the rationale for these holdings after making its findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The story that brings these disputes to court involves two parallel series of events. So the court cannot present the relevant facts in a strictly linear way. Instead, the court first addresses who the parties are and how they came to know one another. The court then discusses the facts attendant to Wellness's demands for payment. And last, the court recounts the facts that led Hooper Holmes and Accountable Health's customer to leave them for Wellness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties first encountered one another in 2014 when plaintiff Accountable Health Solutions bought a company known as Principal Wellness. Accountable Health and Principal Wellness both had provided wellness services to employers. For instance, Accountable Health contracted with employers to provide their employees with health coaching, a website portal for employees to track their health status, and on-site biometric screenings, among other things. The on-site biometric screenings were performed at the employer's office, usually during the spring and summer months. These screenings provided employees with Lipid profiles, blood pressure readings, and data about their height, weight, glucose, and Body Mass Index. Employees who could not attend on-site screenings received a primary care physician (\"PCP\") form that their doctor could complete. The PCP form asked the doctor for the same information provided by on-site screeners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Originally, Principal Wellness had performed the on-site screenings for its clients. But when Accountable Health bought it in 2014, Accountable Health delegated this work to defendant Wellness Corporate Solutions under the terms of a contract known as the Master Services Agreement (\"MSA\"). This MSA took effect on February 15, 2014, and ran for a term of 36 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 25 (\"the MSA\") \u00b6 8. Generally, the MSA required Wellness to provide on-site screening services to Accountable Health's clients. In return, Accountable Health promised to pay Wellness for those services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7. For instance, under the MSA, Wellness charged $39.50 per participant for each finger prick screening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B \u00a7 F. For\n   each PCP form an employee completed under the MSA, Wellness charged $7.50.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And the MSA specified that Wellness would charge $50 to process at-home test kits and $15 if an employee ordered such a kit but never had it processed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Other services governed by the MSA included cheek swab tests, reports about an employee's overall health, and venipuncture tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The MSA also contained provisions that governed the work needed to prepare the screening sites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When Wellness performed services under the MSA, it incurred the costs attendant to the screenings and later, it billed Accountable Health. These expenses included things like charges for the screeners' time, purchasing supplies they needed, and travel expenses. Once Accountable Health received Wellness's bill, the MSA gave it 14 days to dispute the bill and 45 days to pay it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. If Accountable Health failed to pay any undisputed bill within 45 days, the MSA permitted Wellness to charge interest \"on past due accounts\" at a rate of 1.5% per month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The duty to pay Wellness's statements did not depend on Accountable Health receiving payment from its clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Five other provisions of the MSA matter to this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the MSA allows a party to recover attorneys' fees in certain situations. Specifically, the MSA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party ... from and against any and all third party claims, demands, damages or any other financial demands (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) arising from or related to the indemnifying Party's breach of this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   MSA \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the MSA provides that neither party would be liable to the other \"for loss of profits, loss of business, or special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the performance or nonperformance of this agreement, or any acts or omissions associated therewith.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the MSA prohibits Wellness from competing with Accountable Health. Specifically, it says that Wellness cannot \"encourage any [client of Accountable Health], either directly or indirectly, to terminate its relationship with [Accountable Health]\" or \"solicit or market [Wellness's] Services [directly] to [a client] of [Accountable Health] in any way to compete with [Accountable Health].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23(i). Also, the MSA provides that Wellness cannot \"use any confidential information, intellectual property, or any other data or information provided by [Accountable Health], or gained pursuant to [the MSA], to compete in any way with [Accountable Health]....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23(ii).\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the MSA incorporates by reference a Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement (\"NDA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. This NDA, as relevant here, requires both parties to \"use and disclose Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating the [business opportunity presented by the MSA].\" MSA App. B (\"NDA\") \u00b6 3. The NDA also defines \"Confidential Information\" as:\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    [A]ll oral, written, electronic[,] or documentary information disclosed prior to or after execution of this Agreement, either furnished or made available (a) by [Accountable Health] or its Agents ... to [Wellness]; or (b) by [Wellness] or its Agents to [Accountable Health], in connection with the [business opportunity presented by the MSA], including, but not limited to, marketing philosophy, techniques, and objectives; advertising and promotional copy; competitive advantages and disadvantages; financial results; technological developments; loan evaluation programs; customer lists; account information, profiles, demographics and Non-Public Personal Information ...; credit scoring criteria, formulas and programs; research and development efforts;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    any investor, financial, commercial, technical or scientific information ... and any and all other business information....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 2. And\n    <em>\n     last\n    </em>\n    , both the MSA and NDA provide that Delaware law governs all disputes involving these contracts. MSA \u00b6 13; NSA \u00b6 11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In May 2015, plaintiff Hooper Holmes, Inc.-a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Kansas-bought Accountable Health and it became a wholly owned subsidiary. Hooper Holmes already competing in the biometric screening business, was looking to expand into the wellness coaching market. Even though it already was providing on-site screenings, Hooper Holmes agreed to continue honoring the MSA and use Wellness as an on-site screener. The MSA thus became binding on it and Accountable Health-the plaintiffs here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Before turning to the events that led the parties' dispute to their current disagreements, the court pauses to explain the naming convention used by the rest of this Order. Parties on both sides of the caption have asserted claims against the other, so simply calling the parties \"plaintiffs\" and \"defendant\" isn't always helpful. So, the court has decided to refer to the parties by their short form names-plaintiff Hooper Holmes, Inc. is simply \"Hooper Holmes\" and defendant Wellness Corporate Solutions is simply \"Wellness.\" Because Accountable Health is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hooper Holmes, the court typically does not distinguish between Hooper Holmes and Accountable Health unless, in a particular context, that distinction matters to the analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Payment Issues\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    In May 2015, when Hooper Holmes bought Accountable Health, Accountable Health had accumulated an $8,000 debt to Wellness. By July 2015, that debt had ballooned to more than $600,000-and $300,000 of that balance was overdue by July 31, 2015. Hooper Holmes's debt increased so dramatically in such a short period because most of the screenings services occurred in the spring and summer months. At the same time, Hooper Holmes was waiting for its clients to pay it for the screenings and so, they lacked the cash to pay Wellness as promised.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    On July 31, 2015, Wellness emailed Hooper Holmes about the debt and Hooper Holmes offered to pay $64,000. Wellness accepted this partial payment but also demanded full payment of the entire outstanding debt. Hooper Holmes acknowledged Wellness's request and replied that its CFO was aware of the issue and looking for solutions. In September-after hearing nothing from Hooper Holmes since August-Wellness asked again for full payment. Hooper Holmes repeatedly promised that full payment would come but, when prompted by Wellness, merely offered partial payments. In mid-October, with Hooper Holmes's debt amounting to some $575,000-$114,000 of which was overdue-Wellness's CEO Fiona Gathright personally emailed Arielle Band about the unpaid debt. Ms. Band was one of Hooper Holmes's Vice Presidents. Ms. Band responded that Steven Balthazor-Hooper Holmes's new CFO-would respond shortly to Wellness's inquiry and present a plan to pay the outstanding debt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    But after a few more weeks of silence, on October 31, 2015, Wellness's CFO, Jeffrey Taylor, directly contacted Mr. Balthazor about the outstanding debt. The next day, Mr. Balthazor responded with a plan to pay down the full debt. Mr. Balthazor offered to pay $10,000 each week until Hooper Holmes's cash flow had improved. Once that improvement occurred, Hooper Holmes would increase its weekly payments to pay the remainder of the debt as quickly as possible. Mr. Taylor acknowledged\n    Mr. Balthazor's proposal but he explicitly invoked Wellness's contractual right to recover interest on all overdue amounts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Later, Mr. Balthazor offered to make a $50,000 good faith payment. Hooper Holmes never made that payment, however. On November 15, 2015, Hooper Holmes began paying $10,000 each week and in February 2016, Hooper Holmes increased its weekly payments to $20,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    While Wellness was trying to persuade Hooper Holmes to pay its outstanding bills, it continued sending invoices to Hooper Holmes for its services, including screenings and PCP forms. It appears that some employees who had missed Wellness's health screenings mistakenly sent the PCP forms to Wellness instead of sending them to Hooper Holmes. Ms. Gathright testified that Wellness debated whether to forward the forms because Wellness was unsure: (1) whether the MSA was still binding; and (2) whether the MSA-assuming it was still binding-required Wellness to forward the PCP forms. Trial Tr. 181:14-21. Ultimately, Wellness elected to send the forms to Hooper Holmes and bill it $7.50 for each one-the price set by the MSA for this service.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    On June 6, 2016, Hooper Holmes made a $20,000 payment to Wellness. It was Hooper Holmes's last payment. But Wellness continued billing Hooper Holmes for PCP forms that employees of Hooper Holmes's clients sent through September 6, 2016. Hooper Holmes's unpaid balance topped out at $235,167.63 on September 6, 2016.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    At trial, Wellness produced an aging summary of the remaining outstanding balance. Def.'s Ex. 411. The outstanding bills and the interest accrued on them are described in detail in Appendix A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    On June 9, 2016-three days after Hooper Holmes sent its final $20,000 payment-Hooper Holmes informed Wellness that it would make no more payments against its outstanding debt. It explained that Hooper Holmes had made this decision because it recently had learned that one of its long-time customers, Building Materials Corporation of America, doing business as GAF (\"GAF\"), had decided not to renew its contract and, instead, begin contracting directly with Wellness for GAF's wellness services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      GAF\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    GAF is one of the largest roofing material producers in the country. It was also one of Hooper Holmes's largest clients. In 2012, GAF signed a two-year contract with Principal Wellness-one of Hooper Holmes's predecessors-to provide wellness services. This contract provided that it would renew automatically each year after the initial two-year term ended. The contract included wellness coaching, on-site biometric screenings, and an online portal where GAF employees could track their health status. At first, Principal Wellness performed the screenings. After Accountable Health bought Principal Wellness\n    in 2014, Wellness performed GAF's screenings under the MSA. It did so in 2014 and 2015. To prepare for these screenings, Hooper Holmes provided Wellness with a company overview of GAF.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Ex. 42. This overview included information about GAF's business, where its offices were located, and the date range when GAF's screenings would take place. As the screenings approached, Wellness created a checklist of tasks that it needed to complete to perform the screenings. During the screenings, Wellness collected data about where it performed GAF's screenings, how many GAF employees had participated at each screening site, when Wellness had performed each screening, and the number of screeners that Wellness had dispatched to GAF's various offices.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Ex. 41.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In February 2015, GAF hired Jeanine Love as its Senior Benefits Manager. In that role, Ms. Love led a team of people who managed GAF's wellness program. In summer 2015, Ms. Love and her team started evaluating GAF's wellness program. Specifically, they wanted to cut costs. By this time, the original contract between Hooper Holmes and GAF already had renewed under the automatic renewal provision, but Hooper Holmes aspired to form a new contract with GAF before its employees received their 2015 biometric screenings. In short, Hooper Holmes hoped to lock GAF into a new three-year contract that charged higher prices. GAF, on the other hand, wanted to maintain the same prices and sign a one-year contract. In the summer of 2015, the parties came to an agreement whereby Hooper Holmes agreed to maintain existing prices and GAF agreed to a two-year contract. The effective date of the contract was retroactive to August 1, 2014. This contract also contained a provision that automatically extended the contract for a one-year period after the initial term expired unless one of the parties gave 60 days' notice that it would not renew.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    After the 2015 screenings were completed, GAF continued debating-internally-whether it should retain Hooper Holmes to administer its wellness program. By February 2016, Ms. Love and her team had decided that GAF was not receiving good value from Hooper Holmes's wellness program. Love Dep. 27:18-21. Ms. Love particularly disliked the online portal because very few GAF employees used it.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13:12-20. But still, Ms. Love testified, the screenings benefited the company.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13:4-6. So, GAF reached out to Aon Hewitt-a wellness broker\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    -and commanded Aon to look for a suitable replacement provider of wellness services. Aon first contacted a company called Catapult, but Catapult failed to impress GAF because Catapult's screening service provided employees, in effect, with an annual physical. GAF believed that Catapult's model provided more services than it desired to buy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    GAF then turned its attention to Wellness. Ms. Love testified that she and her team believed Wellness would fit well with GAF's goals because Wellness already had performed screenings for GAF and the two had developed a good working relationship.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15:1-3. So, Ms. Love asked Aon to reach out to Wellness. At no point during this process did GAF consider renewing its contract with Hooper Holmes.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19:20-20:3. While Ms. Love knew that Hooper Holmes had returned to the screening business when it acquired Accountable Health, she distrusted Hooper Holmes because it was too new to the screening enterprise.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18:1-15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    On March 7, 2016, Aon contacted Wellness about GAF's wellness work. Kelly Geppi-Wellness's sole salesperson at the time-took charge of formulating a sales pitch to GAF and she set up a meeting with Aon. To prepare for its sales pitch with GAF, Ms. Geppi asked Emily Kolakowski-Wellness's chief operations officer-what Hooper Holmes had charged GAF for the screening services that Wellness performed under the MSA. Pls.' Ex. 37 at 6; Trial Tr. 428:11-21. Ms. Kolakowski replied that she believed Hooper Holmes charged 20% more than Wellness's pricing for the biometric screenings. Ex. 37 at 5. Ms. Geppi testified that 20% is the standard mark-up in the wellness industry. Trial Tr. 428:14-21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    At the sales meeting, Wellness presented a slide show it had prepared for GAF. It showcased Wellness's capabilities and included information about an online health tracking portal licensed through a company called Cerner. Ms. Love quickly informed Wellness that GAF was not considering online portal services. After the meeting, Ms. Geppi used a workbook of information that it had collected while screening GAF employees under the MSA to advise the broker how much GAF likely would spend on screenings. Ari Klenicki-Wellness's Director of Screening Services-also used a workbook Wellness had created in 2015. This workbook described GAF generally, how many employee locations had participated in screenings, the date ranges the screening events took place, and a timeline when Wellness had completed the tasks necessary to conduct the screenings. Pls.' Ex. 42.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Though Ms. Geppi was Wellness's only salesperson at the time, she did not attend the April 27 sales meeting because she was far along in her pregnancy and could not make the airplane trip to GAF's headquarters. Wellness sent two other employees in her place. One was Ms. Torroella and the other was Jennifer Silverman-Wellness's Senior Program Manager. As Senior Program Manager, Ms. Silverman worked with Wellness's clients who used its online wellness portal. She was not in sales. But she had become involved with Wellness's sales pitch to GAF through a chance encounter at a birthday party a few months earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In late February 2016, Ms. Silverman attended a birthday party for her sister-in-law. At that party, she struck up a conversation with Jennifer Millstone. Ms. Millstone asked Ms. Silverman what she did for a living and she explained that she worked for Wellness. She also described what Wellness did in the wellness marketplace. Ms. Millstone then informed Ms. Silverman that her husband's company-GAF-was looking for a new wellness provider and asked if she could connect Ms. Silverman with someone at GAF. Before Ms. Silverman accepted Ms. Millstone's offer, she emailed Ms. Gathright on March 3, 2016. Ms. Silverman's email asked if anything in the MSA precluded Ms. Silverman from speaking with GAF about Wellness's services. Ms. Gathright replied that she saw no problem. Ms. Millstone then put Ms. Silverman in touch with Scott Carroll-Ms. Love's boss. Mr. Carroll, in turn, directed Ms. Silverman to Ms. Love.

Doing so, Ms. Geppi testified,\n    would violate industry norms. Trial Tr. 426:18-427:8. Even though Ms. Silverman had entered the situation in an unusual fashion, Wellness decided to let her continue working with GAF because Ms. Geppi was nearing her delivery date and thus couldn't travel to the April 27 sales meeting at GAF. But despite Ms. Silverman's personal connection to GAF and her direct contact with GAF, Ms. Love testified that Ms. Silverman's involvement did not affect GAF's decision to select Wellness for its new wellness contract.

Hooper Holmes claims that Wellness's breach cost it to lose $710,436 in profits it would have earned but for Wellness's breach.

The parties agree that the MSA is a binding contract. But the parties dispute\n    whether Hooper Holmes has established the last two elements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Wellness argues that Hooper Holmes cannot prevail on this breach of contract claim for four reasons. First, Wellness argues that Hooper Holmes's earlier material breach discharged any duty Wellness otherwise would have owed under the MSA. Second, Wellness contends that it never breached the MSA-materially or otherwise. Third, Wellness argues that Hooper Holmes failed to prove that Wellness's breach caused Hooper Holmes to lose any lost profits. And last, the MSA's limitation of liability clause, Wellness argues, bars Hooper Holmes from recovering anything. The court discusses these arguments in the following four subsections.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

Hooper Holmes responds, arguing that it did not materially breach the MSA and, even if it did, Wellness waived its right to declare that breach a material one because Wellness continued to accept the benefits of the MSA-specifically, by continuing to bill Hooper Holmes for PCP forms that Hooper Holmes's clients sent to Wellness. The court concludes that Hooper Holmes materially breached the MSA before Wellness did, but that Wellness waived its right to declare that this breach was material. The court first explains why Hooper Holmes's breach was material. It then explains why Wellness waived its right to declare it was no longer bound by the MSA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     1.

In July 2015, over $300,000 of Hooper Holmes's $600,000 debt was overdue. While Hooper Holmes made efforts to reduce the overdue payments-lowering it to just $114,000 by mid-October 2015-it never fully eliminated that debt. Indeed, shortly after mid-October, several more bills became past-due, pushing Hooper Holmes's overdue debt to over $200,000. These amounts-particularly given how long Hooper Holmes has owed the debt-represents a substantial benefit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth Const. Co. v.

Indeed, on the summary judgment facts, the court held that a reasonable factfinder could conclude as much. Doc. 140 at 12. But after hearing and weighing all the evidence, the court is not persuaded by Hooper Holmes's position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The parties specifically negotiated for and explicitly agreed to a 45-day pay schedule. They also agreed that Hooper Holmes must pay Wellness even if Hooper Holmes's customers failed to pay it. MSA \u00b6 7. And if Hooper Holmes failed to pay its debt on time, Wellness could charge 1.5% interest per month on any overdue amount.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202567916\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It's easy to understand why Wellness would insert this provision into the MSA: it had to front the cost of performing the screenings. When Hooper Holmes scheduled a screening for an employer and had Wellness do much of the work that screening required, Wellness paid the screeners who had worked the screening event, paid for any supplies they needed, and covered travel expenses to the screening site. Then, when billed, Hooper Holmes was supposed to reimburse Wellness for these expenses. So, when Hooper Holmes failed to pay on time, Wellness had to continue carrying the debt-this included borrowing money to cover those expenses. This burden makes timely payment an essential and reasonably expected benefit of the MSA. This factor favors a finding that Hooper Holmes materially breached the MSA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The second factor-the extent to which Hooper Holmes can compensate Wellness adequately for the overdue debt-favors a finding that the breach was not material. When a court cannot calculate damages resulting from the breach with ease and certainty, this factor favors\n    a finding that the breach is a material one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Norfolk\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n     512 F.3d at 94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . For example, when the injured party's damages are lost profits, the breach is more likely a material one because lost profits are difficult to calculate with certainty and ease.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Here, Wellness's damages are certain and one can calculate them with ease. Indeed, Wellness kept track of Hooper Holmes's unpaid balances.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Ex. 411.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The third factor favors a materiality finding. This factor considers the hardship that the breaching party-for purposes of this section, Hooper Holmes-will sustain if the court concludes that Hooper Holmes's breach discharged the parties from their obligations under the MSA.\n    <em>\n     Norfolk\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n     512 F.3d at 94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In short, if Hooper Holmes's breach leaves it up the proverbial creek, this favors a finding that the breach was immaterial. To conclude that Hooper Holmes's breach discharged Wellness from the MSA's obligations would deprive Hooper Holmes the primary benefit it derived from the MSA: Wellness's on-site screening services. Indeed, at trial, the evidence showed that Hooper Holmes itself could provide screening services to its clients.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    To be sure, discharging Wellness from the MSA's obligations allows Wellness to compete against Hooper Holmes. And that competition constitutes a hardship. But Hooper Holmes's own conduct freed Wellness to impose this hardship because Hooper Holmes failed to pay its bills.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n     at 94-95\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (explaining that this hardship factor should not favor a finding that a breach is immaterial when the breaching party caused its own hardship). Hooper Holmes's CFO, Mr. Balthazor, testified that Hooper Holmes lacked the necessary cash to pay its bills because its customers hadn't paid it when Wellness's bills came due. Trial Tr. 25:1-18. The MSA, however, explicitly precludes Hooper Holmes from using nonpayment by its customers as an excuse for its payment obligation to Wellness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MSA \u00b6 7 (\"Payment to [Wellness] by [Hooper Holmes] is not contingent upon payment from any third party.\"). In sum, this third factor favors a materiality finding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The fourth factor-likelihood that Hooper Holmes would cure its failure-favors a materiality finding. At first glance, this factor would seem to favor finding that no material breach occurred. After all, Hooper Holmes gave Wellness many assurances that it would fulfill its obligation to pay. But these assurances proved hollow. Hooper Holmes never paid Wellness what it fully owed. While Hooper Holmes proposed a payment plan in November 2015, this payment plan called for weekly payments of $10,000 on a nearly $600,000 debt. Such a small installment can hardly be considered a proper assurance. The court concludes that this fourth factor favors a materiality finding\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Last, the fifth factor-whether Hooper Holmes acted in good faith-favors a non-materiality finding. One sign that a party has acted in good faith is conduct displaying that the breaching party was willing to work with its contract partner to satisfy its obligations.\n    <em>\n     Carey v. Estate of Myers\n    </em>\n    , C.A. No. S11C-10-029 MJB,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204087056\">\n     2015 WL 4087056\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *22 (Del. Super. Ct. July 1, 2015). Here, the evidence established that Hooper Holmes made verbal commitments to work with Wellness and pay its debt beginning in July 2015. Hooper Holmes did not make good on its promises to pay the entire debt, and, arguably, Hooper Holmes nullified its good intentions by renouncing its promises when a substantial obligation still was unpaid.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 205 cmt. d (\"Subterfuges and evasions violate the obligation of good faith in performance even though the actor believes his conduct to be justified.\"). In short, the evidence about Hooper Holmes's real intentions\n    is mixed. Some of it suggests they were working to extricate themselves from a difficult cash position. A skeptic might view these statements as placeholders, designed to buy more time. While both views find some support, the evidence favors, on balance, the conclusion that Hooper Holmes acted in good faith. This factor thus favors a finding that Hooper Holmes's breach of the MSA was not a material one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Summarizing the \u00a7 241 analysis, the factors are mixed. The first (the extent to which Hooper Holmes deprived Wellness of a reasonably expected benefit), third (the hardship to Hooper Holmes if its breach is deemed a material one), and fourth (the likelihood that Hooper Holmes would cure its breach) factors favor a materiality finding. But the second (the extent to which Hooper Holmes can compensate Wellness adequately for its breach) and the fifth factors (the extent to which Hooper Holmes acted in good faith) favor a non-materiality finding. In sum, three of them favor a materiality conclusion and two do not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    But the court's conclusion does not rely merely on a majority of factors. Instead, the court's conclusion considers the guiding principle of the materiality analysis: \" 'the consequences in the light of the actual custom of [people] in the performance of contracts similar to the one that is involved in the specific case.' \"\n    <em>\n     BioLife Sols., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297072\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/838/268/#p278\">\n     838 A.2d at 278\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     E.

Here, the consequences of Hooper Holmes not paying Wellness are dire because payment is the only benefit Wellness receives under the MSA. Similar placed service providers-namely subcontracting screeners-would view payment for their work an important part of the contract. This consideration moves the balance to favor the finding that Hooper Holmes materially breached the MSA when it failed to pay its outstanding debt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

Wellness knew that Hooper Holmes was well behind on its payments. It sent Hooper Holmes multiple emails in 2015 about its debt under the MSA. Nevertheless, Wellness continued supplying PCP forms to Hooper Holmes and billing it for them at the contract rate. By forwarding the PCP forms to Hooper Holmes, Wellness acted as if the MSA was a binding contract that permitted Wellness to bill Hooper Holmes. Wellness thus cannot \" 'on the one hand, ... accept the benefits of a contract, while on the other hand, assert that contract is void and unenforceable.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     DeMarie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%2089403\">\n     2005 WL 89403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Thus, while Hooper Holmes materially breached the MSA first, Wellness cannot assert that Hooper Holmes's prior material breach frees it from the MSA's obligations because Wellness continued to accept the benefits of the MSA. The court rejects Wellness's first argument that Hooper Holmes cannot recover a breach of the MSA because Hooper Holmes materially breached the MSA first.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Wellness materially breached the MSA by giving a sales presentation to GAF and using information it gathered about GAF while working for Hooper Holmes.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The court now turns to Wellness's second defense to Hooper Holmes's contract claim. Wellness argues that it never committed a breach. Wellness argues that it never breached the MSA's non-compete provisions because Aon-GAF's wellness broker-reached out to it and so, according to Wellness, it never competed with Hooper Holmes. Wellness also contends that even if it breached the MSA, the breach was not material because it only took one customer from Hooper Holmes's larger stable of clients.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Starting with Wellness's first argument, the court concludes that Wellness breached the MSA's non-compete clause. First, Wellness breached the non-compete clause when Ms. Silverman contacted GAF about Wellness's services in March 2016 and then, the next month, made a sales pitch to GAF. The MSA prohibited Wellness from (i) \"encourage[ing] any [client of Hooper Holmes], either directly or indirectly, to terminate its relationship with [Hooper Holmes]\" and (ii) \"directly solicit[ing] or market[ing] [Wellness's] Services to a[ ] [client of Hooper Holmes] in any way to compete with [Hooper Holmes].\" MSA\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \u00b6 23(i)(i), (i)(ii). When it made the sales pitch to GAF, Wellness indirectly encouraged GAF to terminate its relationship with Hooper Holmes. This action violated \u00b6 23(i)(i) of the MSA. Wellness's participation in this sales meeting also amounted to a direct solicitation of Hooper Holmes's customer because Wellness's goal for the meeting was to advertise its capabilities to GAF in a way that competes with Hooper Holmes. This conduct violated \u00b6 23(i)(ii). Similarly, Ms. Silverman's contact with GAF also constitutes solicitation because Ms. Silverman contacted GAF to advertise Wellness's services to GAF.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Wellness also breached the part of the MSA's non-compete clause prohibiting Wellness from \"us[ing] any confidential information, intellectual property, or any other data or information provided by [Hooper Holmes],\n    <em>\n     or gained pursuant to this Agreement\n    </em>\n    , to compete ... with [Hooper Holmes]....\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 23(ii) (emphasis added). The workbooks Wellness used before and after the sales meeting contained employee information about GAF's employees and qualified as \"information ... gained pursuant to this Agreement,\" MSA \u00b6 23(ii), because Wellness gained access to it while screening GAF's employees for Hooper Holmes under the MSA. Wellness's use of this information violated \u00b6 23(ii) because Wellness used this information to land a contract with GAF. These acts are garden variety forms of competition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Wellness argues that even if it breached the MSA, the breach was not material. As noted above, Delaware uses the factors listed in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts to evaluate if a breach is material.\n    <em>\n     BioLife\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297072\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/838/268/#p278\">\n     838 A.2d at 278\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These factors are: (1) the extent to which the breach deprived Hooper Holmes of a reasonably expected benefit; (2) the extent to which Wellness could compensate Hooper Holmes adequately for the breach; (3) the extent to which Wellness will suffer forfeiture if its breach is deemed a material one; (4) the likelihood that Wellness will cure its breach; and (5) the extent to which Wellness acted in good faith.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297072\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/838/268/#p278\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    These factors, when applied to the evidence here, strongly favor a finding that Wellness's breach was material.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The first factor favors finding that the breach was material. Here, Hooper Holmes bargained for-and procured-language in the MSA that prevented Wellness from competing with it. The value of this non-competition agreement to Hooper Holmes was a reasonably expected benefit of the contract.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Norfolk\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n     512 F.3d at 93-94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the first Restatement factor favors finding that a breach is material when the breach causes a party to lose a benefit it specifically sought to secure through the contract). Hooper Holmes lost that reasonably expected benefit when Wellness solicited GAF and GAF left for Wellness. Also, while GAF was just one of Hooper Holmes's 77 clients, this breach prejudiced Hooper Holmes significantly because GAF was a top tier client.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The second factor also favors finding that Wellness's breach was material. When a court cannot calculate the damages caused by a breach with ease and certainty, this factor favors a finding that the breach is a material one.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n     at 94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This third factor asks whether Wellness would sustain a \"forfeiture if [Hooper Holmes] is permitted not to perform\" its obligations in the MSA.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071090\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/86/#p93\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    To be sure, declaring Wellness's competition a material\n    breach of the MSA could lead to it forfeiting its right to collect on its outstanding invoices.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hudson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8069052\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/252/166/#p170\">\n     252 A.2d at 170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that a party who materially breaches a contract first cannot recover under a breach of contract theory for a later material breach). But Wellness still could recover payment from Hooper Holmes under a restitution theory.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Preferred Inv. Servs., Inc. v. T &amp; H Bail Bonds, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , C.A.

July 24, 2013) (\" 'The party in breach is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred by way of part performance.' \" (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 374 ) );\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 241 cmt. d (\"[T]he potential forfeiture may be mitigated if the [breaching party] has a claim in restitution....\"). And Wellness certainly should recover for any performance it completed before the competitive actions qualified as a material breach. Wellness will not suffer a forfeiture if the court discharges the parties' obligations because it can recover Hooper Holmes's unpaid bills through restitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The fourth factor-likelihood that Wellness will cure its failure-also favors finding that Wellness's breach was material. The likelihood that Wellness will cure its breach is low because Wellness signed a contract with GAF. And no evidence suggested that Wellness would terminate its contract with GAF so that GAF could resume contracting with Hooper Holmes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Last, the fifth factor-extent to which Wellness acted in good faith-favors a materiality finding. Evidence that a party was justified in its breach or did not realize it made a mistake can establish good faith. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 241 cmt. f. Here, Ms. Gathright plainly expressed her delight over the prospect of Hooper Holmes losing GAF's business. Wellness plainly understood the effect of its conduct. And while Hooper Holmes's delinquency irked Wellness, it does not provide sufficient justification to poach one of Hooper Holmes's largest clients. Because all five Restatement factors favor the conclusion that Wellness's breach of the MSA was a material one, the court concludes that Wellness materially breached the MSA by violating its non-compete obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Wellness's conduct did not cause Hooper Holmes to sustain lost profit damages.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Having concluded that Wellness materially breached the MSA, the court must determine the damages, if any, Hooper Holmes should recover for that breach. Hooper Holmes claims that Wellness's material breach caused it to lose more than $700,000 in lost profits because Wellness cost Hooper Holmes the opportunity to continue contracting with GAF. Wellness responds that GAF would have moved its wellness business to another vendor even if Wellness never had contacted GAF.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Delaware follows the familiar contract principle that Hooper Holmes is entitled to recover its expectation damages.\n    <em>\n     Siga Techs., Inc. v.

But the evidence presented at trial won't support this proposition. Ms. Love, GAF's Senior Benefits Manager, testified that before the April sales meeting with Wellness and Ms. Silverman's interaction at the February birthday party, GAF had decided to end its wellness relationship with Hooper Holmes. Love Dep. 24:11-22. She testified that GAF did not see any benefit from using Hooper Holmes's comprehensive wellness services and simply wanted to continue with biometric screenings for its employees.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12:19-13:8. By February 2016, Ms. Love testified that GAF had no intention to renew its contract with Hooper Holmes.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 27:18-21. Ms. Love acknowledged that Hooper Holmes recently had entered the biometric screening business when it bought Accountable Health, but she was skeptical of its capabilities because it was so new to the screening endeavor.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18:1-9. And, despite Hooper Holmes's assertions to the contrary, Ms. Silverman played no role in GAF's decision to contract with Wellness.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24:23-25. So, if Ms. Silverman never had contacted Ms. Love, and even if Wellness never made a sales presentation to GAF, Hooper Holmes has not carried its damages burden. It has failed to show \"with reasonable certainty\" that it would have continued to earn profits from a relationship with GAF.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Even if Wellness's breach caused Hooper Holmes's damages, the MSA's limitation of liability clause precludes it from recovering lost profits.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    But even if Hooper Holmes had proved lost profits, the MSA precludes it from recovering lost profits. In relevant part, the MSA provides, \"[N]either party to this agreement shall be liable to the other party for loss of profits, loss of business, or special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the performance or nonperformance of this agreement, or any acts or omissions associated therewith.\" MSA \u00b6 11. Hooper Holmes claims only just one form of damages-lost profits-and the simple language to which the parties agreed precludes Hooper Holmes from recovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Hooper Holmes makes three arguments trying to avert this damages limitation clause. First, it argues that the lost profit damages it seeks are direct damages, and thus the limitation clause does not apply. Second, Hooper Holmes argues that the UCC would not enforce the MSA's limitation of liability clause. And last, it contends that Delaware common law does not enforce limitation of liability clauses when the breaching party breaches the contract in bad faith. None of these arguments persuade the court. The next three sections explain why.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Even though Hooper Holmes's lost profit damages are direct damages, the limitation of liability clause still bars their recovery.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Hooper Holmes argues that its lost profits damages are direct damages and the limitation of liability thus does not apply. Hooper Holmes notes that in\n    <em>\n     eCommerce\n    </em>\n    , the Delaware Chancery Court allowed the plaintiff to recover lost profit damages for breach of contract even though the contract contained a limitation of liability clause. But the limitation of liability clause\n    in\n    <em>\n     eCommerce\n    </em>\n    differs substantially from the one in the MSA here. In\n    <em>\n     eCommerce\n    </em>\n    , the contract at issue precluded recovery for \" 'special, incidental, indirect, statutory or consequential damages (\n    <em>\n     including lost revenue or profits\n    </em>\n    )' arising out of or related to that party's breach of the Agreement.\"\n    <em>\n     eCommerce\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205621678\">\n     2013 WL 5621678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *47 (emphasis added) (quoting the contract). When plaintiff sued defendants for breaching the contract's non-compete provision and sought to recover lost profit damages for that breach, defendants argued that plaintiff could not recover lost profits because the contract prohibited recovery of consequential damages.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *47.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Chancery Court disagreed.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    It concluded that profits lost because of impermissible competition are the direct and natural consequence of a breach of a non-compete clause.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Since consequential damages are damages that \" 'do not flow directly and immediately from an injurious act but that result indirectly from the act,' \" these lost profit damages did not constitute consequential damages.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Consequential Damages\n    </em>\n    , Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) ). The contract's limitation of liability clause thus did not bar plaintiff's recovery because it only covered lost-profit damages not flowing directly and immediately from the breach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Here, the MSA's limitation of liability clause is different. It uses different words. The MSA-unlike the contract at issue in\n    <em>\n     eCommerce\n    </em>\n    -does not categorize \"loss of profits\" as a type of \"consequential damages.\" Instead, the MSA lists \"loss of profit\" damages separately from \"consequential\" damages and prohibits recovery of both forms of damages.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MSA \u00b6 11 (\"Neither party to this agreement shall be liable to the other party for loss of profits ...\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    ... consequential ... damages arising from the performance or non-performance of this agreement....\" (emphasis added) ). The MSA bars loss of profit damages that result directly from a breach-the type of damages Hooper Holmes seeks here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Delaware common law-not the UCC as adopted by Delaware-governs the entire MSA.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Next, Hooper Holmes argues that the MSA is a mixed goods and services contract, partially governed by the UCC and the UCC would not enforce the MSA's limitation of liability clause. The court agrees with Hooper Holmes, in part. The MSA is a mixed goods and services contract because the MSA involves the service of selling wellness screenings and it also involves selling at-home test kits-which are goods.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Del. Code Ann. tit. 6 \u00a7 2-105(1) (\" 'Goods' means all things ... which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale....\"). Because the MSA covers both goods and services, the court must decide whether Delaware common law or the UCC-as adopted in Delaware-governs the limitation of liability clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Article Two of the Uniform Commercial Code applies to \"transactions in goods.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2-102.

The evidence adduced at trial establishes that the fundamental goals of the parties when they entered into the MSA called for Wellness to provide health screening services previously provided by Principal-Hooper Holmes's predecessor. The evidence established that biometric screenings easily was the primary benefit of the MSA and thus it dominated the essence of the contract. It is true that the MSA also called for Wellness to provide some goods to Hooper Holmes-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , at-home testing kits. But both in scale and purpose, the MSA centered on services. The MSA required Wellness to perform basic fingerstick blood screenings, conduct cheek swab tests, create reports about employees' overall health, perform venipuncture screenings, set up screenings, and provide a registered dietician-among other services. MSA Ex. B \u00a7 F. Only a discrete and isolated portion of the MSA's performance involved goods (health education booklets, PCP forms, and at-home test kits).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888511\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/1172/#p1174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And the price of simply giving an at-home testing kit to an employee was merely $15.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888511\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/1172/#p1174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The price to process a kit was $50.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888511\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/524/1172/#p1174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    So, the balance of the price even for the sale of at-home test kits represented the services needed to process the kit-not the kit itself.

But Wellness contends that it is not liable for breaching the NDA for two distinct reasons. First, Wellness argues, it never breached the NDA. And second, even if it did, Hooper Holmes has not proved that Wellness's alleged NDA breach caused any damages. The court addresses each argument, separately, below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Wellness breached the NDA.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Wellness argues that it never breached the NDA. To evaluate this argument, the court must begin with the terms of the contract. The NDA required both parties to \"keep Confidential Information confidential and secure\" and to \"use and disclose Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating the [business opportunity presented by the MSA].\" NDA \u00b6 3. It defined \"Confidential Information\" as:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n    [A]ll ... information disclosed prior to or after the execution of this agreement, either furnished or made available (a) by [Hooper Holmes] or [its] Agents ... to [Wellness] or (b) by [Wellness] or its Agents to [Hooper Holmes], in connection with the Opportunity, including, but not limited to, marketing philosophy, techniques, and objectives; advertising and promotional copy; competitive advantages and disadvantages; financial results; technological developments; loan evaluation programs; customer lists; account information, profiles, demographics and Non-Public Personal Information ...; credit scoring criteria, formulas and programs; research and development efforts; any investor, financial, commercial, technical or scientific information ... and any and all other business information....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 2. Hooper Holmes claims Wellness impermissibly used three sources of such information: its pricing data,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Ex. 37, and two workbooks containing information about GAF that Wellness had collected during its 2015 screenings,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Exs. 41, 42. Hooper Holmes's pricing data is confidential information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In plaintiffs' Exhibit 37, Ms. Geppi emailed Ms. Kolakowski, asking what Hooper Holmes charged GAF for screening services. Pls.' Ex. 37 at 5. Ms. Kolakowski replied that Hooper Holmes charged GAF 20% more than Wellness had charged Hooper Holmes for the screenings.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Ms. Geppi testified that 20% is a common mark-up in the wellness industry. Trial Tr. 428:14-21. Wellness argues that Ms. Kolakowski arrived at this number by taking the industry standard for up-charging employers-20%-and adding it to the $39 the MSA charged. The court views the evidence differently.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    When Ms. Kolakowski responded, she answered in definitive fashion-implying that she\n    <em>\n     knew\n    </em>\n    that Hooper Holmes followed industry norms and was not simply\n    <em>\n     guessing\n    </em>\n    that it followed industry norms. And this information must have come from Hooper Holmes because this email was sent shortly after Aon-GAF's wellness broker-first contacted Wellness about the potential opportunity with GAF. This inquiry occurred long before GAF could have shared information with Wellness about the prices that Hooper Holmes was charging. And this information easily fell within the scope of the NDA's protection because it is \"account information\" about GAF,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , information about what prices Hooper Holmes charges GAF.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <strong>\n     B.
