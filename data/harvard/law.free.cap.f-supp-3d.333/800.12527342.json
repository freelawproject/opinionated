(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-26.) Defendants move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. ( R. 12, Mot.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Chicago. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6 4.) Weingart was, at all relevant times, a Chicago police officer employed by the City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) In the early morning hours of December 29, 2015, Plaintiff was visiting friends at a house on the 3000 block of North Clybourn Avenue in Chicago. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Upon leaving, Plaintiff was unable to dislodge his vehicle from a snowbank along the side of the street and requested the help of other guests at the house to push the vehicle out of the snowbank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) At the same time, unrelated to Plaintiff's activities, several Chicago police officers including Weingart were responding to a 911 call reporting \"shots fired\" or a \"person with a gun\" near 3028 North Clybourn Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff\n   alleges that Weingart and at least one other officer began to approach Plaintiff at the moment his vehicle became dislodged and he began to drive away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) As Plaintiff drove past where the officers were standing, Weingart and/or other unknown police officers allegedly drew their weapons and began firing indiscriminately at Plaintiff's vehicle, despite the fact that none of the officers were in any danger of bodily harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff alleges that he was terrified of being pursued and killed by the police and fled the scene as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) He was pursued by other officers and apprehended a few minutes later at the intersection of Western and Leland Avenues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was subsequently charged with several criminal offenses, including aggravated assault, based on his actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Less than a month after the arrest, however, all charges were dismissed by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In Count I, Plaintiff brings a claim under Section 1983 against Weingart \"and/or UNKNOWN Defendant Officers,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that their actions of firing upon his vehicle were objectively unreasonable and constituted excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff claims that, as a result of being fired upon by the officers, he suffered harm including \"great mental anguish, humiliation, degradation, loss of reputation and anxiety.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Count II, Plaintiff brings a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City, alleging that his injuries were proximately caused by inadequate policies, procedures, and practices of the City, whose indifference to officers shooting at moving vehicles has allowed them to routinely violate the constitutional rights of citizens without fear of meaningful investigation or punishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff alleges that, as a result of the City's deliberate indifference to the problem of officers shooting at moving vehicles, this type of misconduct has become so widespread that it constitutes a de facto policy within the Chicago Police Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed his complaint on December 22, 2017. (R. 1, Compl.) On February 7, 2018, Defendants filed their present motion to dismiss. ( R. 12, Mot.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of excessive force because he was not \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) Defendants argue that the shots did not impair or restrain Plaintiff's movements because, according to Plaintiff's own allegations, neither Plaintiff nor his car was struck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Defendants also point out that Plaintiff did not voluntarily stop as a result of the officers' shots. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants compare Plaintiff's allegations to other cases where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and other U.S. Courts of Appeals have found that no seizure took place when officers fired at, but did not hit, the plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim must also be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed to allege any predicate constitutional violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that he has adequately stated a Fourth Amendment claim. (R. 22, Resp. at 2.) Plaintiff does not\n   directly address whether the complaint plausibly alleges a Fourth Amendment seizure. Instead, Plaintiff insists that the officers' use of deadly force was reckless and unjustified and argues that whether or not the shots actually struck him or his vehicle should not be dispositive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Plaintiff also contends that he has plausibly alleged that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him when he was later stopped and apprehended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Last, Plaintiff argues that since he has adequately alleged an underlying constitutional violation, his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City is viable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has entirely skirted the premise of their motion-namely, that Plaintiff fails to allege any Fourth Amendment seizure. (R. 24, Reply at 1-3.) Defendants also contend that Plaintiff's argument concerning probable cause for his arrest improperly attempts to introduce a separate claim of false arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 4-5.) Defendants argue that the complaint cannot be fairly read to assert such a claim and that, in any event, any claim for false arrest would have to be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim must be dismissed even if it is premised on the \"new\" claim of false arrest, because Plaintiff has not alleged any City policies related to arresting citizens without probable cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A complaint must set forth a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED.
