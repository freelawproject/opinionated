(hereinafter \"UHSC\") and unknown driver John Doe (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Defendants\") in the Court of Common Pleas for Charleston County, South Carolina. Case No. 2017-CP10-1382. Plaintiff alleges that on October 13, 2016, she collided with an unoccupied U-Haul rental truck parked along Interstate 26 in Charleston County, South Carolina.

Therefore, to prevail, UHNC must show that Plaintiff has no possibility of recovery against UHSC for negligence. To establish a cause of action for negligence, \"a plaintiff must show that the (1) defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) defendant's breach was the actual and proximate cause of plaintiff's injury; and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

UHNC's Vice President, Bradley Pruitt, attests that prior to the accident, \"the subject U-Haul rental truck was last documented as present on the lot of U-Haul Moving &amp; Storage of Uptown Charlotte, located at 1224 N. Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28206.\" Aff. of Bradley Pruitt, \u00b6 10, ECF No. 1-4, 9. Pruitt further states that \"[o]n September 27, 2016, Todd Haygood, the general manager of U-Haul Moving &amp; Storage of Uptown Charlotte, reported that the truck was missing from the lot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Pursuant to UHNC protocols, an investigation was commenced to determine the whereabouts of the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. According to Pruitt, \"[o]n October 18, 2016, Herndon [a UHNC employee] reported the subject U-Haul rental truck to UHNC as 'Stolen Off Lot.' Herndon also filed a stolen report with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Pruitt notes that the missing truck was located in Charlotte, North Carolina, the same day, along with a former employee, Shawn Smith. UHNC was contacted by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department to recover the\n   truck, and Smith was taken into custody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. UHNC confirmed that Smith had stolen the truck on or about September 25, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, it appears that the U-Haul truck in question was owned by UHNC and that Smith had driven it to South Carolina, where it was involved in the collision with Plaintiff on October 13, 2016. It appears law enforcement released the truck back into Smith's possession, and he was apprehended in North Carolina several days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, Jennifer Settles, Secretary of UHSC, reviewed and research the facts and documents relating to UHSC's business, including whether UHSC leased the subject U-Haul rental truck. She avers that \"the subject rental U-Haul rental truck was not in the possession of, or leased by, an U-Haul Center or authorized dealer operating in the State of South Carolina in the months of September and October of 2016.\" Settles Affidavit \u00b6 7, ECF No. 7-1, 17. Settles also attests that Smith has never been employed by UHSC nor any other U-Haul Center or authorized dealer operating under the control of UHSC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff argues that removal was based on \"Defendants' unverified representations that have not been subject to discovery and deposition.\" ECF No. 10 at 2. As an example of Defendants' alleged misrepresentations, Plaintiff cites to the notice of removal in which UHNC asserts that the subject U-Haul rental truck was unoccupied at the time of the collision and to the deposition of Christine Jettie to show that \"she saw a man exit the U-Haul truck following the collision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The court finds this factual inconsistency to be irrelevant to the question of whether UHSC possessed any ownership, possession, control, or custody of the U-Haul truck at issue, either directly or through an employment relationship with Smith. Plaintiff does not dispute the affidavits, or allege facts to contradict Pruitt's or Settles' statements. \"When the Defendants' affidavits are undisputed by the Plaintiffs, the court cannot resolve the facts in Plaintiff's favor based solely on the unsupported allegations in the Plaintiff's complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boss v.
