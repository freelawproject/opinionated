FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 18, 2015, Kristie Seale was shopping at the Target store in Homewood,\n   Alabama. After she had completed her shopping and was walking toward the register, her foot slipped out from under her and she fell. The incident was captured on Target's surveillance video, which also captured everything which occurred in that area approximately 30 minutes before and after the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The video shows that during the approximately thirty minutes leading up to Seale's fall, many people walked near and through the area where the fall occurred. Approximately twelve minutes prior to Seale's fall, a female shopper is observed on the surveillance video apparently dropping a bottle of some kind in the area where Seale fell. (Doc. 20-4 at 1:47:49). The video does not show whether any liquid actually spilled from the bottle. The female shopper stops and appears to pick up the bottle and then the lid, then appears to walk down a nearby aisle and place the bottle on a low shelf. (Doc. 20-4 at 1:47:50-1:48:31). There is no evidence that the female shopper or any other Target customer alerted any Target employee of any liquid on the floor in that area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Approximately ten minutes later, Target employee Eric Kidd is seen on the video walking through the area near where Seale fell. (Doc. 20-4 at 1:48:50). He can be seen in the video turning his head towards the area of the floor where the female shopper dropped the bottle, but he continues walking. In his deposition, Kidd testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. And when you were walking, sir, did you see something on the ground or do you recall seeing something on the ground?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. I don't recall seeing anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Let's go back a little bit. When we just watched that, would you agree with me that it appears that you look down at the ground?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. I can't say that I was looking at the ground. I might have been looking at production location here on this end cap. I could have been turning looking towards a guest or heard something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. Okay. Is it possible that you did see some kind of liquid on the ground and just don't remember it right now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. If I had seen a liquid on the ground, I would have taken action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Okay. And then there is the slip and fall that we are here about. And then-let's look at this one more time. Would you agree with me that it looks like you do somewhat of a double take of whatever you looked at?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. I don't know that I would call it a double take. You could rewind it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Once right there and-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. I wouldn't call it a double take.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. All right. And so today you don't recall seeing any kind of substance or liquid or anything else when you walked past during that sequence of the video?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. It's not that I don't recall, there was nothing there. Otherwise I would have taken action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. Are you aware that there was some kind of liquid on the ground in that vicinity that my client slipped on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. There was no liquid in any area that I observed-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. -in that video.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Doc. 20-5 at 6(18-20) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Seale testified in her deposition that the floor was wet. The following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. ... Did you ever look down at the floor to see what you fell in?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Yeah. If you'll notice, I'm doing my hand (demonstrating) to the man, I said my-it's wet, yeah, and even my coat was wet on the back (indicating).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. Did you smell your hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. I did. Because I was afraid it was something gross, but it didn't have a smell really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. So it was like water?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. That would be my best guess is it was water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. So it didn't have any smell or like greasy feel or anything to it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. I did not take note if it had any kind of texture or anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. All you knew was it was wet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. It was wet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. But it didn't smell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. I did not smell anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. In your opinion-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. In my opinion, I believe it was water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. Okay. Do you have a-and I know you were embarrassed and you wanted to get out of there real quickly and got up and left, did you look around to see how much of an area of water there was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. No, I did not. I know that there was water on both sides of me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. So at least it carried two feet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. At least, yeah-well, maybe three. Does that (indicating) not look like a yard? Maybe a yard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Doc. 20-3 at 9(30-31) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The video shows that after Seale fell, multiple Target employees responded to the location of the fall and, after Seale had been helped up, the employees began cleaning up the substance on the floor with paper towels and putting out caution cones. (Doc. 20-4 at 1:59:24-2:03:08). During this time, one of the responding Target employees reaches down and touches the substance on the floor, smells the substance, and then flicks her hand several times to try and get the substance off. (Doc. 20-4 at 1:59:43-1:59:52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A Target employee named Lance Self was the first employee to respond to the accident scene. In his written \"Team Member Witness Statement,\" Self wrote that there was \"a big pool of water present,\" \"probably a gallon.\" (Doc. 26-5 at 2). Similarly, Target employee Adrianna Warren completed a \"LOD Investigation Report,\" in which she states that she observed \"water, 5-6 inches in length.\" (Doc. 26-6 at 2). Warren also completed a \"Guest Incident Report,\" in which she noted that there was \"water, [a] pretty big puddle.\" (Doc. 26-7 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Kidd testified that Target requires all employees to be aware of potential spills or other hazards in their area and to take immediate action if a spill or other hazard is detected. Target employee Eric Kidd testified regarding Target's standard procedure for responding to spills,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   If a team member, an employee, notes a hazard such as a spill, they are responsible for blocking off that area, calling for additional assistance to assist in blocking off that area. Because the individual that spots that is going to stop and stand in that area to try to keep any other guests or team member from walking through it, risking a slip or a fall, or tracking it somewhere else that it could cause a greater risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   That initial team member waits until they have someone else there to help them or that that person who comes to\n   help them has brought the proper materials to clean up what the spill may be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Doc. 20-5 at 4(11-12) ). Mr. Kidd further testified that an employee will direct customers in the area away from the spill until it is cleaned up. (Doc. 20-5 at 4(12) ). The employees will also place a caution cone or sign in the area to warn customers. (Doc. 20-5 at 4(12)-5(13) ). The following exchange also occurred in Kidd's deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. And then in terms of regularly inspecting certain areas of the store, is there any kind of guideline or rule that y'all follow in terms of specifying certain areas or trying to make sure there is no hazardous material or condition on the ground?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. It's not a regular inspection, and it's not anything that I'm aware of that's a formal procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Not to say that it's always spotted simply because you have got one person covering an area of-well, several thousand square feet. It's impossible for them to have eyes on something all the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. ... So you have got a very small group of employees who are covering a very large area, and it's pretty much eyes only to be able to spot these things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Doc. 20-5 at 5(14-16) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In Alabama, in order to prove negligence in a slip and fall case, the Plaintiff must show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   that the alleged substance that caused her to fall had been on the floor for such a length of time that constructive notice of its presence could be imputed to the defendants; that the defendants had actual notice that the substance was on the floor; or that the defendants were delinquent in not discovering and removing the substance....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9401377\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/806/1247/#p1249\">\n    806 So.2d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249 (Ala. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Defendant argues that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   There is no evidence by which Mrs. Seale could prove that Target had actual knowledge of the presence of any liquid on the floor at the time of Plaintiff's fall. There is no testimony from any witness-not from the Plaintiff, any employee, or any other customer or guest in the area at the time of the incident-that demonstrates that Target had knowledge of the presence of liquid on the floor. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot prove actual notice to Target in order to support her claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Doc. 20-1 at 9). However, there is evidence that a large amount of water, up to a gallon, spread out over a three foot area, was present where the Plaintiff fell. Furthermore, a reasonable jury could conclude, based on the video evidence, that Kidd, a Target employee, looked directly at all of this water and did nothing. Although Kidd testified that there was no liquid, the facts, cast in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, demonstrate that there was a large amount of liquid there. A reasonable jury could determine that Kidd must have seen it. If that is so, Target had actual knowledge of the spill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Defendant also argues that it did not have constructive notice of the spill, citing\n   <em>\n    Tidd v.

Ala. 1991) (Guin, S.J.), where Judge Guin granted summary judgment, writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [H]ere is no evidence that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the spill. The record is devoid of evidence regarding the length of time the spill had been on the floor. Plaintiff contends that the size of the spill is sufficient in itself to raise a question of fact regarding\n   the length of time the spill had been down. The court finds that this fact without more is not sufficient to create a question of fact. A large spill can be as young as a small spill. A large spill can be as sudden as a small spill. Anyone who has held a burping baby knows that a large spill can occur with lightning speed. A large, sudden spill gives an invitor no additional notice merely because of its size. Were there evidence of a seeping container or an overturned container dripping onto a shelf and thence onto the floor, a reasonable inference could be drawn that a large spill had been there long enough to raise a duty on the part of the defendant to discover and remove it. The case at bar presents no such evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   In the case at bar, the record is devoid of evidence that the defendant had any knowledge or that it should have had any knowledge of a hazardous condition on its premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Tidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4096609\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/757/1322/\">\n    757 F.Supp. at 1323-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The instant case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Tidd\n   </em>\n   , as there is video evidence showing not only the possible cause of the spill but also that the spill may have been present for 12 minutes before the Plaintiff fell\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and evidence regarding the size and amount of the spill. There is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the spill had been there long enough for Target to have constructive knowledge. Summary judgment will be denied as to that issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Furthermore, based on the facts of this case, the Court determines that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether, assuming Target did not have actual or constructive notice, it was delinquent in discovering and removing the substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Summary judgment will be denied as to that issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

To the extent that a party has proffered a fact which is not disputed, it has been included herein exactly as it was proffered, without citation. To the extent that a fact proffered by a party was disputed by another party, the Court first examined the proffered fact to determine whether the evidence cited in support of that fact actually supported the fact as stated. If it did not, the fact was not included. If it did, the Court then looked to whether the evidence cited in support of the dispute actually established a dispute. If it did not, the Court presented the fact as proffered, with citation to the evidence supporting the fact as proffered. If the cited evidence was disputed by contrary evidence, the evidence was viewed, as this Court must, in the light most favorable to the non-movant, with citation to such supporting evidence. If more explanation was needed, the Court included that information in an appropriate footnote. Some facts proffered by the parties, which the Court deemed irrelevant and/or immaterial, may have been omitted. Further, as necessary, the Court may have included additional facts cast in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In its reply, the Defendant cites the following cases:\n    <em>\n     Ryles v.
