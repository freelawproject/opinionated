The conspiracy charge in Count I further alleges that the illegal conduct involved one hundred grams or more of a detectable amount of heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 21, 2018, Defendant filed two pre-trial motions which are presently pending before the court. In her first motion, she seeks dismissal of Count I pursuant to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution on the grounds that Count I charges her with engaging in the same conspiracy for which she has already pled guilty in another pending case. In the second motion, Defendant contends that the government violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by tracking a cell phone in the possession of her co-defendant while he was a passenger in her vehicle and by subsequently performing a warrantless search of her vehicle after it was impounded. She seeks suppression of all evidence seized as a result. The government opposes both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 30, 2018, the court held a non-evidentiary hearing and thereafter took the pending motions under advisement. Assistant United States Attorney Wendy L. Fuller represents the government. Defendant is represented by Michael J. Straub, Esq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The government asserts that, beginning in 2015, Vermont Drug Task Force (\"VDTF\") officers and agents from Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") began an investigation into the importation and sale of controlled substances in the Newport, Vermont area (\"the Newport conspiracy\"). In connection with this investigation, the government maintains, Defendant was arrested after selling two hundred bags of heroin to an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency agent, but was not prosecuted in light of her status as a juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The government proffers that, by the fall of 2015, Defendant and others involved in the Newport conspiracy were regularly traveling to destinations outside of Vermont to purchase controlled substances for re-sale. In December 2015, eight individuals died by drug overdose in Newport, each having consumed drugs which the government alleges were linked to Defendant and her associates. In March 2016,\n   HSI agents from the Derby Line, Vermont field office opened an investigation into a drug distribution ring headed by Defendant's brother, Justin Peters. HSI received information from the VDTF officers that Justin Peters and others were engaged in large scale sales of heroin, cocaine, and cocaine base in and around Orleans County, Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2017, a federal grand jury returned a series of indictments charging Defendant and others for their roles in the Newport conspiracy during the period from early 2015 to February 2017. The indictment charges Defendant as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Count 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Grand Jury charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about July 11, 2016, in the District of Vermont, defendant MICKAYLA PETERS knowingly and intentionally distributed fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Count 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Grand Jury further charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about September 1, 2016, in the District of Vermont, defendant MICKAYLA PETERS knowingly and intentionally distributed heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance and fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Count 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Grand Jury further charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   On or about September 7, 2016, in the District of Vermont, defendant MICKAYLA PETERS knowingly and intentionally distributed heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Count 4\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Grand Jury further charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   On or about October 4, 2016, in the District of Vermont, defendant MICKAYLA PETERS knowingly and intentionally distributed heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Count 5\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Grand Jury further charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   On or about October 25, 2016, in the District of Vermont, defendant MICKAYLA PETERS knowingly and intentionally distributed heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Doc. 1, Case No. 17-cr-00017, Feb. 9, 2017.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to the government, Defendant attended a proffer session with prosecutors in connection with this indictment, and confirmed that she worked with several other individuals to distribute drugs in the Newport area during the alleged period.

The Superseding Information pursuant to which Defendant pled guilty states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    SUPERSEDING INFORMATION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The United States Attorney charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   From in or about 2015, to in or about February 2017, in the District of Vermont and elsewhere, defendant MICKAYLA PETERS, knowingly and willfully conspired with others known and unknown to distribute heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance, fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance, cocaine base, a Schedule II controlled substance, and cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ( 21 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Doc. 67-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant was in the community on conditions of release awaiting sentencing when the government alleges she engaged in the further criminal activity that gave rise to a second conspiracy charge. More specifically, at some point during the summer of 2017, the government obtained information that an individual with the alias \"G\" began distributing heroin and cocaine in the Newport area from Defendant's residence. The government eventually identified \"G\" as Kenneth Seales, who was familiar to agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (\"ATF\") from prior controlled drug purchases. ATF agents allegedly confirmed that Mr. Seales formerly lived in New York City and that he obtained drugs there for re-sale in Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   According to HSI's Report of Investigation (\"ROI\"), federal agents and VDTF officers obtained federal search warrants for Mr. Seales's real-time cell phone location information beginning on August 24, 2017. The ROI states that Mr. Seales used the subject phone to arrange multiple drug transactions with a confidential informant (\"CI\") throughout the summer and early fall of 2017. During these transactions, law enforcement allegedly visually confirmed that Mr. Seales's physical location matched the cell location information obtained via the warrant. The government renewed the search warrant on September 22, 2017. Throughout the period of monitoring, Mr. Seales's phone was allegedly determined to be located exclusively in the northeastern portion of the state of Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the evening of October 2, 2017, law enforcement ceased receiving real-time location information for Mr. Seales's phone, indicating that it was either off or did not have cellular reception. As a result, law enforcement officers could only obtain historical data which they continued to receive overnight and into the morning of October 3, 2017, when they began efforts to locate Mr. Seales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At approximately 6:00 p.m. on October 4, 2017, an HSI agent reviewing surveillance footage observed a man matching Mr. Seales's description get into a white Mazda in Newport, Vermont at approximately the same time that real-time information from Mr. Seales's phone was lost. Contemporaneously with this observation, agents resumed receiving real-time location information from Mr. Seales's phone, which indicated that the phone was near White River Junction, Vermont. Noting that this was the first time that location data placed Mr. Seales's phone anywhere outside of northern Vermont, HSI agents alerted VDTF agents who began traveling towards the phone's last known location while HSI provided continuous updates based on incoming location information. As VDTF agents proceeded to the White River Junction area, location information indicated that Mr. Seales's phone was moving north on Interstate 91, until it stopped for several minutes near Wells River, Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Using this information, VDTF agents responded to a truck stop along the Interstate 91 corridor in Wells River, where they observed a white Mazda with Vermont plate number HCA403. This license plate matched Defendant's registration. When the vehicle exited the truck stop, VDTF agents followed it northbound on Interstate 91 and an agent observed Defendant riding in the front passenger seat. Thereafter, a Vermont State Police (\"VSP\") trooper initiated a traffic stop on the side of the highway in Barnet, Vermont after observing a traffic violation. VDTF agents informed the VSP trooper that Mr. Seales and Defendant were subject to immediate arrest. Law enforcement discovered five occupants in the vehicle:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Seales, who gave a false name and date of birth; Defendant; a third adult who was driving; and two juveniles. Neither the operator nor Defendant possessed a valid driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   VSP arrested Mr. Seales and Defendant and transported them to the VSP barracks located in Saint Johnsbury, Vermont. VSP also impounded the white Mazda and towed it to the Saint Johnsbury barracks. At the barracks, VSP troopers read Defendant her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, which she waived prior to providing an audio and video recorded statement to HSI investigators in which she implicated Mr. Seales and the vehicle's operator in drug possession and distribution. Defendant explained that everyone in the vehicle was returning from New York City and that during the trip, she observed Mr. Seales smoking marijuana and in possession of a small amount of cocaine. She further acknowledged that she was aware that Mr. Seales was involved in drug distribution and that the vehicle's operator had made trips to New York City to transport drugs in the past. She denied that she had observed any drugs in the vehicle, but reported that she had observed Mr. Seales meeting with an unknown person prior to their return. Mr. Seales then returned with a Macy's shopping bag which contained a coat, and placed the bag and its contents in the trunk of her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Following Defendant's interview, VSP troopers performed a walk-around of the white Mazda using a drug detection canine. The canine alerted to the trunk of the vehicle, and \"based on the totality of the circumstances,\" HSI agents determined that probable cause existed to perform a warrantless search of the trunk of the vehicle. The search produced 104 grams of heroin, two grams of fentanyl, and 304 grams of cocaine, in addition to two cell phones. The controlled substances were recovered from a jacket pocket of the coat in the Macy's bag. Mr. Seales declined to give a formal interview, but the ROI indicates that he made an unsolicited incriminatory statement that the drugs in the car belonged to him. On October 12, 2017, after her arrest and initial appearance, the grand jury returned the pending Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, courts examining successive conspiracy prosecutions for compliance with the Fifth Amendment ask \" 'whether the second prosecution is for a conspiracy distinct from that previously prosecuted.

The Second Circuit employs a burden shifting framework with regard to Double Jeopardy Clause challenges to successive conspiracy prosecutions. First, the defendant must make \"a non-frivolous showing that two indictments in fact charge only one conspiracy[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785355\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/463/#p467\">\n    356 F.3d at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the defendant succeeds in this showing, \"the burden shifts to the prosecution to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the defendant is not being placed in jeopardy twice for the same crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785355\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/463/#p467\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Comparing the language of the Superseding Information for the Newport conspiracy to which she pled guilty and the Indictment in this case, Defendant contends that \"[e]xcept for the nominal gap of 6 months between the two charged conspiracies, the Indictments each charge Defendant with the identical conspiracy.\" (Doc. 67 at 2.) In support of this argument, she attaches ROIs prepared in relation to this case and notes that both sets of charges stem from law enforcement's investigation of Justin Peters. She further observes that both the Newport conspiracy and the present case involve allegations that she permitted drug sales from her home that Justin Peters was present in when Mr. Seales is alleged to have conducted drug sales, connecting the two conspiracies. Another ROI states that a confidential informant went to Justin Peters's home looking for Mr. Seales, because he believed Mr. Seales was staying there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The government counters that Defendant was arrested, charged, and pled guilty to her conduct in the Newport conspiracy before she was allegedly involved in an entirely new conspiracy with a different drug supplier, Mr. Seales. None of the indicted Newport co-conspirators are named in the pending case, and the six-month gap between the end of the Newport conspiracy and Defendant's involvement with Mr. Seales establishes Defendant began a new, distinct criminal enterprise after she pled guilty to the Superseding Information. The government further proffered that the first conspiracy involved firearms and suppliers\n   who seldom, if ever, traveled to Vermont, while the pending charges involve a supplier from New York City who traveled to Vermont without a firearm. Finally, the government argues that it could not have charged Defendant with the conduct alleged in the Indictment when it charged her in the Superseding Information because the alleged offense conduct had not yet occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Abbamonte\n   </em>\n   , evidence demonstrated that two charged conspiracies occurred within the same year, with at least two common participants, in the same geographic region, both for the purpose of heroin distribution. The Second Circuit held this evidence sufficient to require the government to prove that the conspiracies were distinct and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbamonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388321\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/1065/#p1068\">\n    759 F.2d at 1069-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the evidence thus far presented of similar times, places, and personnel suffices to make the jeopardy claim of Abbamonte and DelVecchio more than a matter of speculation.\").

Although the type of offense conduct is essentially the same, the charged conduct in the present case is comprised of different overt acts. For example, the alleged use of New York City as the source of the controlled substances and Mr. Seales as the primary supplier are materially different from the modus operandi of the Newport conspiracy which consisted of an array of Vermonters traveling to out-of-state locations and obtaining drugs for re-sale. None of the occupants in Defendant's vehicle at the time of her arrest were alleged to have participated in the conspiracy charged in the Superseding Information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The parties dispute \"the extent to which the success or failure of one conspiracy is independent of a corresponding success or failure by the other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527618\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/662/#p667\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527618\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/662/#p667\">\n    at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant contends that Justin Peters was the leader of a distribution organization in Newport that simply turned to Mr. Seales as a new source of supply following the Newport conspiracy arrests and indictments.

It did not introduce any evidence to support this conclusion so the court accords it no weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On balance, the court concludes the government has proffered a preponderance of the evidence \"that the two schemes involved distinct agreements\" sufficient to render them factually separate crimes for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, it was pure happenstance that Mr. Seales entered Defendant's vehicle as opposed to her home or the vehicle or home of some other individual.

First, she contends that the traffic stop was the fruit of what she argues was the government's illegal tracking of Seales's phone while it was in her vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun v.

Second, she argues that even if law enforcement had probable cause to search her vehicle after it was impounded, a drug detection canine alerted to the trunk of the white Mazda only after the vehicle could no longer readily be moved, rendering the \"automobile exception\" inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant's first argument is easily disposed of in light of the court's conclusion that Defendant's arrest was the product of lawful cell phone tracking of a cell phone in her vehicle. Defendant's second argument is similarly unavailing. Although the \"first cases establishing the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement were based on the automobile's ready mobility,\" \"recent cases provide a further justification: the individual's reduced expectation of privacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasive regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.
