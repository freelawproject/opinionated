This case arises out of SCE &amp; G's abandonment of the construction of two nuclear reactors known as V.C.

On May 30, 2008, SCE &amp; G filed a Combined Application for Certificate of Environmental Compatibility, Public Convenience and Necessity\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Application\") with the PSC, pursuant to the BLRA. (ECF No. 68 at 14 \u00b6 65.) SCE &amp; G sought approval for construction of the Project based on a projected cost of $6.3 billion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) SCE &amp; G initially projected that it would complete V.C. Summer Unit 2 by April 1, 2016, and Unit 3 by January 1, 2019. (ECF No. 68-2 at 17.) In order to avail itself of tax credits and to get the revised rates under the BLRA, SCE &amp; G needed to complete the Project by 2020. (ECF No. 99 at 58:20-23.) SCE &amp; G later amended the scheduling dates to convey that it would not complete Unit 2 until 2022 and Unit 3 until 2024.

SCE &amp; G began construction on the Project. (ECF No. 68 at 20 \u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   10. On nine occasions between 2008 and 2016, the PSC approved SCE &amp; G's revised-rate requests, permitting it to recover for the capital costs of the Project amounting to $445 million annually.

As of September 30, 2017, SCE &amp; G has invested approximately $5 billion on the Project and $316 million in transmission costs related to delivery facilities.

(ECF No. 99 at 61:10-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   13. On July 31, 2017, SCE &amp; G \"announced that it would cease construction of the [Project's] Units and request recovery of its abandoned costs, an outcome expressly contemplated by the BLRA.\" (ECF No. 68 at 31-32 \u00b6 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   14. On August 1, 2017, SCE &amp; G filed a Petition for Prudency Determination Regarding Abandonment, Amendments to the Construction Schedule, Capital Cost Schedule and Other Terms of the BLRA Orders for the V.C. Summer Units 2 &amp; 3 and Related Matters (the \"Petition\") with the PSC to abandon construction of the Project. (ECF No. 68 at 32 \u00b6 159.) In the Petition, SCE &amp; G alleges that it asked the PSC to \"enter an order finding that SCE &amp; G's decision to abandon the construction of the [V.C. Summer] Units was reasonable and prudent\" and \"sought authorization to calculate revised rates reflecting SCE &amp; G's incurred construction costs and costs of abandonment, pursuant to the BLRA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 160-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   15.

SCE &amp; G contends that it voluntarily withdrew its Petition on August 15, 2017, \"after legislative leadership demanded more time for legislators to review the project and threatened to bring the South Carolina General Assembly back into a special session for the specific purpose of preventing SCE &amp; G from recovering its abandoned costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 164-165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   17.

(ECF No. 31-1.) In the Joint Petition, SCE &amp; G requested that the PSC permit SCE &amp; G to recover up to $5 billion from ratepayers over the next 20 years for the abandoned Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   18. SCE &amp; G alleges that in response to the Project's abandonment, the South Carolina General Assembly passed Act 287 and Resolution 285. (ECF No. 68 at 36 \u00b6 177.) Act 287 became law on June 28, 2018, and Resolution 285 became law on July 2, 2018. Act 287 instructs the PSC to set utility rates for SCE &amp; G at a level equal to their current rates less the increases previously granted under the BLRA within five (5) days of the passage of the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20S.C.%20Acts%20258\">\n    2018 S.C.

SCE &amp; G seeks relief from the alleged unconstitutional legislative enactment of Act 287 and Resolution 285. More specifically, SCE &amp; G seeks to enjoin Defendants from future implementation of Act 287 and Resolution 285. SCE &amp; G does not seek to enjoin any PSC orders regarding SCE &amp; G's project construction, capital cost schedules, or rate increases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   24.

(ECF No. 94-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   25. On July 2, 2018, the PSC issued Order No. 2018-459 (ordered by Defendants Elam, Ervin, Hamilton, Howard, Randall, and Whitfield) directing SCE &amp; G to calculate a reduction in its retail electric rates and tariffs by approximately 15% and to submit full tariff sheet summaries.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-4.) The PSC's July 3, 2018 Order directs SCE &amp; G to begin implementing the experimental rate in the first billing cycle in August, which begins on August 7, 2018. (ECF No. 33-4; ECF No. 9 at 2.)
