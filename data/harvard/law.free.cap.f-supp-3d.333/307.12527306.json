PAUL OETKEN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Fuller Landau Advisory Services Inc. brings this action against Defendant Gerber Finance Inc. for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and an accounting. Defendant moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the Court converted that motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d) into one for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Fuller Landau Advisory Services Inc. (\"Fuller\") provides, among other things, investment banking advisory services relating to corporate transactions. (Dkt. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 7.) Defendant\n   Gerber Finance Inc. (\"Gerber\") is a financial services firm. (Compl. \u00b6 8.) During the relevant time period, Gerber was owned by five shareholders: Investec 1 Limited, Juge Holdings Inc., Catnap Properties Inc., Justin Wessels, and Gerald Joseph, who also served as Gerber's Chief Executive Officer. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gerber's shareholders wanted to sell the company, and around June 2016, Gerber retained Fuller to provide financial advisory services in connection with Gerber's potential sale. (Dkt. No. 21, Ex. 1 (\"Fee Agreement\") at 1; Compl. \u00b6 12.) The parties agreed that if Gerber sold its business, Gerber would compensate Fuller for its services by paying a \"Success Fee.\" (Fee Agreement \u00b6 6.) The Success Fee would be equal to 2% of the \"minimum value\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the \"Transaction Amount\" plus 1% of any Transaction Amount above the minimum value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In relevant part, the Fee Agreement defines the Transaction Amount as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [T]he aggregate value of all voting and non-voting common equity of the Company, calculated on a fully diluted basis and based upon the purchase price at which the Transaction takes place, plus the aggregate amount of: (i) any indebtedness, preferred shares and other securities outstanding at the time of the Transaction assumed by the buyer....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Fee Agreement \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the Fee Agreement, Fuller introduced a potential buyer, Trade Finance Solutions (TFS Canada Bond Series, Inc.) (\"TFS\" or \"Buyer\"), to Gerber. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) In January 2017, Global Fund Holdings Corp., an affiliate of TFS, purchased all of the outstanding shares of Gerber stock form the former shareholders. (Compl. \u00b6 30; Dkt. No. 26, Ex. B at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to the sale, Gerber owed a debt to a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (\"the Lenders\"). (Compl. \u00b6 15; Dkt. No. 21, Ex. 2 at 1.) Gerber's credit agreement with the Lenders had a \"change of control\" clause, under which a sale of 51% or more of Gerber's stock would trigger a default. (Dkt. No. 21 \u00b6 13; Dkt. No. 21, Ex. 2 at 4, 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that when TFS purchased Gerber, TFS also convinced the Lenders to allow the change in control to occur without triggering a default of Gerber's loan obligations. (Compl. \u00b6 30.) According to Plaintiff, the Lenders agreed to waive enforcement of the change-in-control clause because all of Gerber's outstanding indebtedness to the Lenders \"was assumed by and transferred to\" TFS and its affiliates. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) The parties dispute whether TFS actually \"assumed\" Gerber's indebtedness to the Lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is undisputed, however, that TFS's affiliate entered into a limited guaranty with Bank of America (on behalf of all of the Lenders). (Dkt. No. 21, Ex. 4 at 1.) According to Plaintiff, TFS \"guaranteed to the Lenders the due and timely payment\" of Gerber's indebtedness as of the closing date of Gerber's sale. (Dkt. No. 21 \u00b6 20.) As collateral securing its guaranty, TFS granted the Lenders a security interest in all of the Gerber shares it acquired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 21, Ex. 5.) Plaintiffs also contend that TFS \"became a party to various agreements\" with the Lenders \"pursuant to an amendment to [Gerber's] credit agreement.\" (Dkt. No. 22 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the TFS purchase, Gerber paid Fuller a Success Fee based on the purchase\n   price of the shares. (Compl. \u00b6 35.) Fuller contends, however, that it is also entitled to a Success Fee based on the value of the debt that Gerber owed to the Lenders at the time of the TFS purchase. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35, 37.) Gerber has refused to pay a Success Fee based on that debt. (Compl. \u00b6 36.) Gerber has also allegedly refused to provide Fuller with relevant information and documents relating to TFS's guaranty agreement with the Lenders. (Compl. \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August 2017, Fuller brought this suit against Gerber for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and an accounting. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-60.) Defendant moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Dkt. No. 15.) In its opposition brief, Plaintiff argued that because Defendant's motion relied on matters outside the pleadings, the motion should be converted into a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 12(d). (Dkt. No. 22 at 12-14.) On May 15, 2018, the Court gave the parties notice that the motion would be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56 and permitted the parties an opportunity to file any relevant supplementary materials. (Dkt. No. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Under the Fee Agreement, Gerber was obligated to include the debt only if it was part of the \"Transaction Amount,\" which is defined to include \"any indebtedness, preferred shares and other securities outstanding at the time of the Transaction assumed by the buyer.\" (Fee Agreement \u00b6 7.)

The two key words, \"indebtedness\" and \"assumed,\" each have a definite and precise meaning when considered in the context of the entire agreement\n   and the usages and terminology of the trade. First, \"indebtedness\" simply means \"[t]he quality, state, or condition of owing money.\"\n   <em>\n    Indebtedness\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Similarly, in the specific context of transactions involving indebtedness, \"assume\" also has a definite and precise meaning: to \"tak[e] (esp. someone else's debt or other obligation) for or on oneself.\"\n   <em>\n    Assumption\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In other words, when a party \"assumes\" the \"indebtedness\" of another, he becomes directly liable for the debt himself.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Novon Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 98 Civ. 677,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20432848\">\n    2000 WL 432848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2000) (explaining that \"to assume [a] license agreement\" is to \"to step into [the licensor's] shoes\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Having resolved the threshold question of ambiguity, the Court must now apply the contractual language to answer the legal question of whether the Buyer assumed any of Gerber's indebtedness. Plaintiff alleges that \"all outstanding indebtedness owed by Gerber to the Lenders ... was assumed by and transferred to the Buyer and to [its] affiliates.\" (Compl. \u00b6 31.) The undisputed facts, however, reveal that these allegations are based on a faulty legal premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to an affidavit from Plaintiff's managing director, in the course of purchasing Gerber, the Buyer entered into a guaranty with Lenders which guaranteed timely payment of all debt outstanding at the time of the sale. (Dkt. No. 21 \u00b6 20.) The Buyer secured this guaranty by granting the Lenders a security interest in all of Buyer's Gerber shares and subordinating Gerber's other indebtedness to its debt to Lenders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the operative provision of the guaranty, the Buyer guaranteed \"punctual payment\" of any indebtedness owed by Gerber to Lenders under their credit agreement. (Dkt. No. 21, Ex. 4 \u00a7 1.) Notably, the stock purchase agreement between Gerber and the Buyer does not mention Gerber's indebtedness to the Lenders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Contrary to Defendant's argument, and as explained above, indebtedness is a broad term meaning simply \"debt owed\" and is not limited to debts \"akin to securities, like notes, bonds or debentures.\" (Dkt.

The Court will not give the term \"indebtedness\" the unnaturally narrow reading suggested by Defendant based on the fact that \"indebtedness\" appears adjacent to the terms \"preferred shares\" and \"other securities outstanding\" in the Fee Agreement.
