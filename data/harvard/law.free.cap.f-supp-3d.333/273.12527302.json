Scott (\"Plaintiff\") asserts various claims against Defendant Rochester Gas &amp; Electric (\"Defendant\") arising out of his employment relationship. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-6). Plaintiff alleges Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") and the New York State Human Rights Law, Executive Law \u00a7 290\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"NYSHRL\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims as time-barred pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Dkt. 3) and Plaintiff's request for sanctions (Dkt. 12). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion to dismiss and Plaintiff's request for sanctions are both denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the complaint and from documents integral thereto\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -namely, the parties' submissions\n   regarding the timeliness of Plaintiff's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") charge. As required on a motion to dismiss, the Court treats Plaintiff's factual allegations as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff has worked for Defendant's Field Collections Department since June 2009. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 7). On March 16, 2015, Plaintiff began an apprentice program for a position in the Line Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). All the foremen supervising Plaintiff during his apprenticeship were Caucasian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). One of these supervisors informed Plaintiff and his co-workers that \"blacks\" are not allowed as lineman and made it clear Plaintiff would not pass the apprentice program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). The foremen spoke derogatorily about and to Plaintiff, excluded him from activities, and refused to supervise him when he worked on dangerous equipment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15-16). Plaintiff and another minority coworker complained to Department Supervisor Mary Jo Klemmer on various occasions about this behavior, but she never took remedial action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Despite this treatment, Plaintiff's work was rated above-average throughout the course of the apprenticeship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Defendant's regional operations director informed Plaintiff that he had advanced in the apprenticeship program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). However, on September 11, 2015, two nights before Plaintiff was scheduled to begin his next assignment, Klemmer informed Plaintiff that he was being removed from the program because the supervising foremen had instructed her to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). Plaintiff was terminated from the program and removed to his previous position at the collections department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). Plaintiff contends that his termination from the apprenticeship program was based on unlawful racial animus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he filed charges of discrimination against Defendant with the EEOC and the New York State Division of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). On April 6, 2016, the EEOC received an intake questionnaire form (\"Questionnaire\") submitted by Plaintiff. (Dkt. 11 at 11-19, 25-29). The Questionnaire asks the applicant to provide certain information, such as the applicant's name, the name of the offending organization, what happened to the applicant, and why the applicant thought the action was discriminatory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). The Questionnaire also asks the applicant to check a box indicating what the applicant would like the EEOC to do with the information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Box 1 states, \"I want to talk to an EEOC employee before deciding whether to file a charge. I understand that by checking this box, I have not filed a charge with the EEOC.\n   <strong>\n    I also understand that I could lose my rights if I do not file a charge in time\n   </strong>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Box 2 reads, \"I want to file a charge of discrimination, and I authorize the EEOC to look into the discrimination I described above. I understand that\n   <strong>\n    the EEOC must give the employer ... that I accuse of discrimination information about the charge, including my name.\n   </strong>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In Plaintiff's submission to the EEOC, he named Defendant as the offending\n   organization, he detailed his experience during Defendant's apprentice program, and he checked Box 2. (Dkt. 11 at 11-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 8, 2016, the EEOC filed a form titled \"Charge of Discrimination\" that Plaintiff had filled out and submitted to it. (Dkt. 3-3 at 7-8). On that form, Plaintiff signed a line indicating he wanted the charge filed with the \"EEOC and the State or local agency ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Defendant was notified of the charge on November 29, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4). On April 21, 2017, the EEOC issued a dismissal and notice of rights to Plaintiff. (Dkt. 3-4 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on July 17, 2017. (Dkt. 1). Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss on September 21, 2017. (Dkt. 3). On October 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion and in support of his request for sanctions. (Dkt. 12). Defendant replied in support of the motion to dismiss on October 31, 2017. (Dkt. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court generally may only consider \"facts stated in the complaint or documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated by reference.\"\n   <em>\n    Nechis v.

(Dkt. 3-4 at 3). Defendant asserts the controlling period for filing a claim with the EEOC in this case was 180 days because \"there is no evidence that the Plaintiff filed a charge with any local or state agency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant further asserts that the only charge filed by Plaintiff in this case was the Charge of Discrimination the EEOC received from Plaintiff on September 8, 2016, and that because the alleged discrimination occurred on September 11, 2015, Plaintiff's charge was not timely filed and his complaint should be dismissed.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11). Plaintiff further contends the Questionnaire he submitted to the EEOC on April 5, 2016 (well before the 300-day limitation period), qualifies as a charge, and therefore his charge was timely filed and his claim should be allowed to proceed.

In both of the cases relied upon by Defendant, the Second Circuit did not reach the issue of which limitations period was relevant because the parties agreed that the 300-day period applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Zant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639930\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/708/#p712\">\n    80 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   712 n.1 (\"[S]ince the parties agree that the 300-day period applies in this case, we will accept this as a stipulated fact.\");\n   <em>\n    Sanderson v.

Defendant's arguments also do not consider the workshare agreement between the EEOC and the NYSDHR or the caselaw surrounding this agreement that addresses the issue of the timeliness of the charges. Consequently, and for the other reasons stated above, the Court finds the 300-day limitations period applies in this case, not the 180-day limitations period, and that the last day Plaintiff could have filed his charge was July 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Questionnaire Is Considered a \"Charge\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court now addresses whether the Questionnaire submitted by Plaintiff to the EEOC qualifies as a charge.
