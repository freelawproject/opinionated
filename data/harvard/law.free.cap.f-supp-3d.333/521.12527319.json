MESSITTE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2015, Redemption Community Church (the \"Church\"), a non-denominational Christian church with currently between 15 and 20 congregants, purchased a property at 385 Main Street in Laurel, Maryland (the \"Property\") with the intention of operating a coffee shop during the week and a house of worship on Sunday mornings. The Property is located inside the City of Laurel's Commercial Village Zone (\"C-V Zone\"), which since the date of the purchase has required houses of worship located on less than one acre of land to apply for and receive a special exception in order to obtain a Use &amp; Occupancy (\"U &amp; O\") permit. On April 3, 2017, after renovating the Property, the Church received a U &amp; O permit for a for-profit coffee shop. The Church never applied for and never received such a permit to host worship services. On April 5, 2017, the coffee shop opened its doors, and on Sunday, April 9, 2017, the Church held its first worship service there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 26, 2018, the Church received a cease and desist letter from the City of Laurel (\"Laurel\" or the \"City of Laurel\") directing it to stop holding worship services or else be subject to a $250 fine per day. The Church immediately ceased holding services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 9, 2018, the Church filed a Complaint in this Court, alleging that Laurel's zoning provision requiring houses of worship located on less than one acre to obtain a special exception violates various provisions of the United States Constitution and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   On February 12, 2018, the Church filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, still pending, asking the Court to enjoin Laurel from enforcing the relevant provision of its zoning code. ECF No. 7. Laurel has filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 22. Oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss was heard on June 5, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the following reasons, the Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . The Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Redemption Community Church is a non-denominational Christian church currently with a congregation of between 15 to 20 worshipers. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, ECF No. 1. It was incorporated in 1969 in Montgomery County, Maryland as a nonprofit corporation and was initially named the Covenant Orthodox Presbyterian Church.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 20. Church members purport to have \"sincerely-held religious beliefs that they are to regularly assemble with others to pray, study the Bible, sing religious songs, and share biblical insight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. A \"particular calling\" of the Church is to \"bring the Gospel to the homeless and underprivileged in its community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to fulfil its religious mission, in the summer of 2014 the Church began searching for a property that it could operate both as a non-profit coffee shop and house of worship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. The thought was to operate a non-profit coffee shop on\n   Mondays through Saturdays (the proceeds of which would be donated to local community organizations) and serve as a house of worship on Sundays.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between late 2014 and early 2015, the Church located a property that it believed met its desired specifications. The Property was located at 385 Main Street, Laurel, Maryland 20707.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The Property was a three-story structure situated on a 5,115 square-foot lot, which was less than one acre, and had approximately 4,500 square feet of usable space.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. The Property was advertised as a \"Structure Type\" for \"Retail, Church/School, Office, [or] Office Building\" uses. Complaint Ex. 1, ECF No. 1-3. The Property was \"centrally located in the area in which the Church desire[d] to minister\", namely, the heart of Laurel's Commercial Village zone. Complaint \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about February 6, 2015, Trustees of the Church visited the Property, accompanied by the Fire Marshal of the City, and allegedly communicated to him their desire to use the location both as a non-profit coffee shop and house of worship. Complaint \u00b6 32. Very soon thereafter, on February 17, 2015, the Church signed a Purchase Agreement for the Property, and on March 18, 2015, it closed on the Property for approximately $470,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In preparation for its purchase of the Property, on February 12, 2015, the Church applied for a parking waiver pursuant to Section 20-16.6 of Laurel's Unified Land Development Code (the \"Code\"), since the number of parking spaces available at the Property was less than that mandated by the Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38. The Church asserts that such parking waivers are normally required for institutions in the C-V zone due to the limited available parking on Main Street and the surrounding properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. On March 10, 2015, Church representatives testified at a Planning Commission meeting, after which their application for the parking waiver was approved for both the proposed coffee shop and church services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Complaint Ex. 2, ECF No. 1-4. However, on April 14, 2015, City officials revoked their approval of the waiver on the grounds that Church representatives had purportedly submitted evidence at the hearing that contradicted representations it had made in the waiver application. Complaint \u00b6 50; Complaint Ex. 3, ECF No. 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An additional hurdle to the Church's plans came as a result of changes to Laurel's zoning regulations. On February 9, 2015, three days after Church Trustees had visited the Property along with the City Fire Marshal, the Laurel City Council proposed Text Amendment 237 to the City Code, which would exclude non-profit businesses from operating within the C-V zone. Complaint \u00b6 42. On March 9, 2015, Amendment 237 passed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Then, on March 23, 2015, the City Council proposed Text Amendment 238, which would amend the Code's \"Table of Commercial Uses\" (the \"Table\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44; Motion to Dismiss (\"MTD\") Ex. I, ECF No. 22-11. The Table references various types of commercial uses in Laurel's six commercial zones, indicating as to each use whether it is \"permitted\" or not permitted in a given zone; \"permitted, subject to the approval of a special exception\"; \"permitted as an accessory building\"; or \"prohibited.\" Complaint \u00b6 90; Complaint Ex. 11, ECF No. 13. Amendment 238 proposed changing \"house[s] of worship\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[l]ocated on a\n   lot less than 1 acre in size\" from a \"permitted\" use to a \"permitted [use], subject to the approval of a special exception.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 92-95; Complaint Ex. 11, ECF No. 1-13. The Special Exception application requires an applicant to fill out a two-page application and attach: a Statement of Justification, an Existing Conditions Site Plan or Survey, a Proposed Site Plan or Survey (created by a professional engineer or surveyor), and a non-refundable $2,000.00 filing fee. Complaint \u00b6 46; ECF No. 39-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 27, 2015, Amendment 238 passed. Complaint \u00b6 47. The Amended Code not only incorporated the special exception requirement for houses of worship but also provided that the following institutions would be deemed \"permitted\"\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   a special exception: art and cultural centers; cinemas and \"legitimate theater[s]\"; open microphone venues; \"Disc Jockeys\"; karaoke; poetry or dramatic readings; theatres or halls for the performing arts, symphony, or community theatre; health clubs or spas; libraries, museums, and similar \"noncommercial institutions\"; \"standard\" restaurants; and schools for \"business, art, music and similar uses.\" Complaint \u00b6 91; Complaint Ex. 11, ECF No. 1-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 14, 2015, Church representatives \"informally met\" with two City Planning Commissioners, Bill Wellford and Mitzi Betman, who allegedly told the representatives that a parking waiver and U &amp; O permit were only required with respect to \"the preponderance of use of a given property.\" Complaint \u00b6 51. Based on this understanding, and because of the passage of Text Amendment 237, the Church submitted a second application for a parking waiver based on the Property being used primarily as a for-profit coffee shop,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, and on December 8, 2015, the Church was granted the waiver. The Church then undertook what became a sixteen-month renovation of the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. In October, 2016, when renovation was substantially complete, the Church applied for a U &amp; O permit for a for-profit coffee shop, which it received on April 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63. The Church did not file for a parking waiver or U &amp; O permit to operate as a house of worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 5, 2017, the Property began operating as a for-profit coffee shop Mondays through Saturdays, and on Sunday, April 9, 2017, the Church held its first worship service there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 11, 2017, a Church representative visited the Laurel Municipal Center to request a revised U &amp; O permit, since the one granted to the Church on April 3, 2017 contained multiple typographical errors (for example, it misstated the building's square footage).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 68. On July 27, 2017, while coming in to pick up the revised U &amp; O, a Church representative was purportedly asked by City Planner Monta Burrough, \"Are you doing church at the Property?\" and \"Are you having worship at the Property?\", to which the Church representative allegedly responded that indeed \"It held some worship gatherings on Sundays.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-71. That same day, the City sent a letter to the Church ordering that it cease and desist from holding worship services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 2, 2017, Church representatives met with City Planner Burrough to discuss the cease and desist letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. During the meeting, Burrough reportedly asked the representatives if \"people raise hands for worship at the Property?\" [suggesting concern over an unusual form of worship?] and \"Can you meet somewhere else until this blows over?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite the cease and desist letter and the meeting with Burrough, the Church continued to conduct worship services at the Property on Sundays until January 26, 2018, when it received a second cease and\n   desist letter from the City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-81. This letter noted that the Church had been \"operating as a House of Worship and hosting live entertainment without a City of Laurel Special Exception approval, which is in violation of the City of Laurel Unified Land Development Code Section\n   <em>\n    Sec. 20-22 and\n   </em>\n   is in violation of your Use and Occupancy permit.\" Complaint Ex. 9, ECF No. 1-11 (emphasis in original). The letter directed the Church to \"cease immediately operating as a House of Worship and hosting live entertainment or the property owner will accumulate fines of $250 a day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following receipt of this second cease and desist letter, the Church stopped conducting worship services at the Property. Complaint \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 9, 2018, the Church filed suit against Laurel in this Court, asserting violations of the United States Constitution and RLUIPA. Specifically, the Church has alleged that the City's amended Code impermissibly discriminates against houses of worship by requiring those located on less than one acre located within the C-V Zone to obtain a special exception while not requiring the filing of a special exception for similarly situated secular assemblies and institutions. The Church argues that the Code, both on its face and as applied to its operation within the C-V zone, violates RLUIPA's \"Equal Terms\" provision, \"Nondiscrimination\" provision, and \"Substantial Burden\" provision, as well as the Free Exercise Clause, the Free Speech Clause, the Right to Peaceable Assembly, the Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Soon after filing its Complaint, the Church filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, asking the Court to enjoin Laurel from enforcing the special exception requirement of its zoning code. ECF No. 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 20, 2018, Laurel filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, arguing first that the Church's claims are not ripe because it has never applied for a special exception, ECF No. 22, and, second, that the Church has failed to state a claim under RLUIPA and the Constitution because it has not shown that houses of worship are subject to unequal treatment under the zoning laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court heard oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss on June 5, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Nor is the Church claiming that the denial of a special exception has injured them; rather, the Church posits that it is injured just by having to apply for a special exception when similar secular institutions do not have to do so; i.e., the mere imposition of the special exception requirement is the alleged injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Furthermore, since\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has clarified that the finality requirement is \"a prudential rather than a jurisdictional rule....

The law specified that teachers could not suggest \"views on whether students should use the time to pray\", \"use the time to pray aloud in front of other students\", or \"permit any other student ... to pray aloud.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11081036\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/265/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In doing so, the Fourth Circuit found that the regulation did not \"excessively entangle[e]\" the state because teachers were given no discretion to promote religion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11081036\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/265/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11081036\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/265/\">\n    at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , in the present case, the Code is not structured in a way that minimizes the discretion of City officials reviewing special exception applications. Nor does the Court as of now have adequate information with respect to how special exception applications are reviewed, the basis on which such applications are granted or denied, and how City officials are trained or monitored to prevent bias. In short, while it cannot definitely be said that the special exception process encourages entanglement, it may fairly be argued that the process could result in inappropriate entanglement. The\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   factors, just described, would permit this inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss Count VII will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Laurel's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 22) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 22) is\n   <strong>\n    MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A separate Order will\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Code defines \"house of worship\" as a \"church, temple, synagogue, mosque, or other building specifically used for organized worship.\" The Code also provides that it \"shall be unlawful as an accessory, ancillary or secondary to other uses on the same premise.\" Sec. 20-1.7 of the Code, Complaint Ex. 12, ECF No. 1-14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    This Motion is still pending.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    At oral argument, the Court asked the City a number of questions regarding what the special exception process consists of. On June 8, 2018, the City asked permission of the Court to supplement the record regarding the special exception application process, which the Court interpreted as a Motion to Supplement the Record. ECF No. 35. On June 13, 2018, Counsel for the Church replied that she had no objection to the Motion. ECF No. 37. On June 14, 2018, therefore, the Court granted the Motion and provided Defendant fourteen (14) days \"to supplement the record with information regarding the Special Exception process.\" ECF No. 38.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    However, on June 26, 2018, the City filed a supplement that was far more extensive than a straightforward explanation of the special exception process, wading as it did into arguments regarding the reasons for the special exception requirement and how it does not, in the City's view, discriminate on religious grounds. ECF No. 39. On June 28, 2018, the Church filed an Objection to the scope of the City's submission. ECF No. 40.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The Court recognizes that the City's Motion is filed as a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment. The Court's rationale for denying the Motion to Dismiss is discussed herein. The Motion for Summary Judgment, while technically in order, comes at an early stage in the case, before discovery has taken place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Church indicates, for example, that at different times it had discussions with the City Fire Marshal, two City Planning Commissioners, and City Planner Burrough, none of which has been reduced to hard evidence by deposition or otherwise. Discovery should help inform a Motion for Summary Judgment filed at a later stage of the proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Further, the proximity in time between the signing of the Purchase Agreement for the Property, the visit with the Fire Marshal and the enactment of Amendment 238 suffice to raise a question as to the potential existence of actual discriminatory intent. Among other matters of interest would be whether, at the time of the Church's involvement in the C-V zone, there were any other houses of worship in the same zone, including houses of worship on less than 1 acre, and why (so it appears, a house of worship on more than 1 acre would\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    be required to pursue the special exception process).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The following secular establishments require a special exception to operate in the C-V zone: bed and breakfast facilities (on at least 10,000 square feet); brewer or pub; live performance by a band or performance group with dancing; performances associated with meetings, wedding receptions, as well as bar and bat mitzvahs; rental halls; restaurants (fast food); restaurants (specialty); restaurants (standard with dancing and live entertainment); and video stores.
