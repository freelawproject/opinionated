In the context of a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts Plaintiff's statement of facts regarding Maxim's operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Maxim provides in-home personal care, management, and/or treatment of a variety of conditions by nurses, therapists, medical social works, and Home Health Aides (\"HHAs\"). (Doc. 1, \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff worked for Maxim as an HHA, allegedly from approximately July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.) As an HHA, Plaintiff provided companionship services \"in the homes of [Maxim's] clients to whom she was assigned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 18.) Consequently, she was classified as an exempt employee under the FLSA, pursuant to the companionship services exemption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19.) During Plaintiff's employment, she worked more than 40 hours in some workweeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 18.) Because Plaintiff was an exempt companionship services employee, however, Maxim paid her straight time for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In mid-October 2015, Maxim began paying \"full and complete overtime compensation\" to all HHAs nationwide, including Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33.) Plaintiff filed this lawsuit more than two years later, on November 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

Plaintiff's FLSA claim is premised entirely on her contention that the DOL's Home Care Final Rule became effective on January 1, 2015, the original effective date. If January 1, 2015 is in fact the effective date, then Plaintiff and other similarly-situated HHA's are owed overtime between that date and mid-October, 2015, when Maxim began paying overtime. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff's FLSA claim fails if this Court concludes that the third-party-employer regulation did not become effective on January 1, 2015, but instead became effective on October 13, 2015, when the D.C. Circuit issued its mandate overturning the district court's 2014 order vacating the rule. Thus, the issue before the Court pursuant to Maxim's Motion to Dismiss is whether recovery for unpaid overtime under the third-party-employer regulation should begin with alleged violations occurring on January 1, 2015, or should be limited to the period after October 13, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has not addressed this issue, and federal courts across the country have come to conflicting conclusions.

Or. 1999) ). Again, this Court disagrees. In the Court's view, the distinction between judicial decisions reversing a rule's vacatur prior to the rule's effective date, and those decisions advancing a new or contrary interpretation of a rule already in effect, does not have any consequence for the application of\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   instead requires a finding that a court decision that an agency had authority to promulgate a rule means that the agency \" 'always had such [authority] and that the rule[ ] appl[ies] as of the effective date originally scheduled.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brittmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522877\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1033/#p1039\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    GTE S., Inc. v.

Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   is inequitable because it requires employers to choose whether to comply with a regulation that has been vacated, or risk having to go back in time to comply with the regulation if and when the vacatur is overturned. This argument, while not entirely without merit, is unpersuasive. There was always a foreseeable possibility that the trial court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   would be reversed on appeal as a natural consequence of the appellate process. Moreover, the Court finds it far more inequitable to permit Maxim to avoid liability for months of overtime pay based on a district court decision that ultimately was deemed to be erroneous. To hold otherwise would penalize HHAs like Plaintiff for the trial court's error. It could also create incentive under certain circumstances for employers to drag out litigation as long as possible, and thereby save a considerable amount of money in wages, even if ultimately unsuccessful on appeal. A more fair and equitable holding than the one Maxim favors is that any party involved in continuing litigation should be\n   prepared for the implications of retroactive application of an adverse ruling on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Maxim also makes much of the fact that the D.C. Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   that third-party employers such as Maxim were permitted to \"make use of the companionship-services exemption\" following the district court's vacatur of the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173194,4340423\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1084/\">\n    799 F.3d at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Maxim, \"[t]hat statement directly disproves Plaintiff's assertion that Maxim should now be held retroactively liable for lawfully relying on the companionship services exemption following the district court's vacatur of the third-party-employer regulation.\" (Doc. 9, p. 8.) Maxim attributes far too much significance to this statement, however. The D.C. Circuit's observation - that third-party employers could make use of the companionship-services exemption following the vacatur but prior to reversal of the district court by the court of appeals - is not controversial. However, neither this statement, nor anything else in\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   , addresses the consequences of the reversal in terms of retroactive application of the appellate court's decision, or the implications of retroactive application for the effective date of the Final Rule. On the other hand,\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   compels a conclusion that, after the D.C. Circuit's reversal of the district court's vacatur of the Home Care Final Rule, the Final Rule became effective on January 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For all of the reasons stated, the Court holds that the effective date of the Home Care Final Rule is January 1, 2015. The Court rejects the contention that the effective date was October 13, 2015, when the D.C. Circuit issued its mandate, or at a later date when the DOL commenced enforcement of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having determined that the Home Care Final Rule should be retroactively applied to January 1, 2015, the Court now looks to the statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff's FLSA claims. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiff's FLSA claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Thus, Plaintiff's claims are limited to the two years prior to the filing of the Complaint, and not the three years Plaintiff proposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the FLSA, claims are bound by two-year statute of limitations, unless a plaintiff can demonstrate that a defendant committed a \"willful violation\" of the Act. If a plaintiff shows willfulness, a three-year limitations period applies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). For an FLSA violation to be considered willful, a plaintiff must show \"that the employer knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211503\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/128/#p130\">\n    486 U.S. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211503\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/128/#p130\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211503\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/128/#p130\">\n    100 L.Ed.2d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).

Feb. 27, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, Plaintiff does not allege facts that amount to willful conduct. Plaintiff alleges only that from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015: (1) Maxim \"was aware\" of its obligation to pay overtime to HHAs; (2) Maxim \"did not act in good faith or reliance upon any of the following in formulating its pay practices: (a) case law; (b) the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. ; (c) Department of Labor Wage &amp; Hour Opinion Letters; or (d) the Code of Federal Rule;\" and (3) Maxim acted \"willfully\" in not paying overtime compensation to its HHAs. (Doc. # 1, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.) However, none of these statements arise above wrote and conclusory legal allegations, or amount to \"facts\" about the defendant's\n   mental state. \"Although conditions of a [defendant's] mind may be alleged generally,\" it remains true that \"the plaintiff still must plead facts about the defendant's mental state which, accepted as true, make the state-of-mind allegation 'plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Katoula v.

App'x 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (6th Cir. 2014). Because Plaintiff has pled nothing more than conclusory assertions about Maxim's willfulness, and because Plaintiff has failed to plead any state-of-mind allegations that are plausible on their face, the Complaint's allegations of willfulness are insufficient to meet the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   pleading standard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stout v.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's FLSA claims are limited to a two-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, the above-described judicial landscape concerning the Home Care Final Rule makes it impossible as a matter of law for Maxim to have committed a willful violation of the FLSA in this instance. The D.C. District Court's vacatur of the Final Rule, the split of authority over the question of when the third-party-employer regulation became effective, and the Department of Labor's decision to delay enforcement until November 12, 2015 all establish that Maxim had an objectively reasonable basis to believe that it was not required to pay Plaintiff overtime wages until at least October 13, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guerrero v.

Fla. 2017) (finding a lack of \"willfulness\" in failure to pay overtime wages due to the procedural history of the Home Care Final Rule). Additionally, Maxim's decision not to pay HHAs overtime from January 1, 2015 to mid-October 2015 was in harmony with a District of Maryland decision specifically informing Maxim - the defendant in that case - that the third-party-employer regulation should not be retroactively applied to January 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flamer v. Maxim Healthcare Servs. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15CV02070,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012762067\">\n    2015 WL 12762067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. Oct. 26, 2015). Given that Maxim's specific conduct challenged by Plaintiff here was approved as to Maxim by another federal district court, Maxim cannot have acted willfully to violate the FLSA as a matter of law. There is no amount of additional discovery requested by Plaintiff that will alter the judicial landscape concerning the Home Care Final rule, or the ruling of the\n   <em>\n    Flamer\n   </em>\n   court. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim of \"willfulness\" regarding Maxim's violation of the FLSA fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Absent a viable claim that Maxim willfully violated the FLSA, the statute of limitations governing Plaintiff's FLSA claims is two years. Plaintiff's FLSA claims are limited to the two years prior to the filing of the Complaint, and not the three years Plaintiff proposes. Any of Plaintiff's FLSA claims falling outside of the two years must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to Plaintiff's claims under the FLSA, Plaintiff has brought Ohio law claims under R.C. \u00a7 4111.01 (\"OMFWSA\") (Count II), and R.C. \u00a7 4113.15 (the \"Ohio Prompt Pay Act\") (Count III). Plaintiff has dismissed her claim under the OMFWSA, without prejudice. (Doc. 12, p. 14, n. 9.) Maxim contends that Plaintiff's remaining Ohio law claims under the Prompt Pay Act are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. In contrast to the FLSA, \"Ohio law provides for a two-year\n   statute of limitations for claims based upon unpaid overtime compensation, but does not provide for an extension in the case of a willful violation by the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Claeys v. Gandalf, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9289464\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/303/890/#p893\">\n    303 F.Supp.2d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 893 (S.D. Ohio 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

Ohio June 22, 2016). Thus, Plaintiff has no timely claim under the Prompt Pay Act because she filed her Complaint on November 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff argues as to her Prompt Pay Act claim only, that it is the date of the D.C. Circuit's mandate - October 13, 2015, and not January 1, 2015 - that should be used as the operative date for purposes of calculating the statute of limitations for all Prompt Pay Act claims that accrued between January 1, 2015 and October 13, 2015. This is an improper attempt for Plaintiff to have her cake and eat it too. Plaintiff's entire theory of this case hinges on her contention that the effective date of the Home Care Final Rule is January 1, 2015. The Court has agreed. Plaintiff cannot credibly change course for one claim only in order to assert timely Prompt Pay Act claims. Under the January 1, 2015 effective date, Plaintiff's Prompt Pay Act claims are limited to the two years prior to the filing of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's Prompt Pay Act claims are also time-barred under her argument that all liability is based on an October 13, 2015 effective date. Plaintiff's statute of limitations argument is contingent upon her contention that the Prompt Pay Act provides a cause of action when wages remain unpaid \"for sixty days beyond the date of the agreement, award, or other act making wages payable.\" (Doc. 12, p. 14.) Based on that contention, Plaintiff argues that her Prompt Pay Act claim was timely filed because: (1) Defendant refused to pay her owed overtime by December 15, 2015 (60 days after the October 13, 2015 mandate in\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   ); and (2) she filed her Complaint within two years of December 15, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's theory fails, however, because the plain text of the Prompt Pay Act specifies that a 30-day deadline, and not a 60-day deadline, applies in this case. In particular, because Plaintiff apparently had a \"regularly-scheduled payday,\" a 30-day deadline applies. R.C. \u00a7 4113.15(B) (applying a 30-day deadline unless there is no regularly-scheduled payday, in which case a 60-day deadline applies). Using the applicable 30-day deadline, Plaintiff's own theory results in the statute of limitations period starting on November 12, 2015 (30 days after the October 13, 2015 proposed mandate-driven effective date of\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   ), and ending on November 12, 2017. Because Plaintiff filed her Complaint on November 27, 2017, two weeks after the statute of limitations period ended, her Prompt Pay Act claim is time-barred, and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons stated, Maxim's Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Doc. 9) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Although the Court holds that the effective date for the Home Care Final Rule is January 1, 2015, the Court also finds that Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim for \"willful\" violations of the FLSA. Accordingly, Plaintiff's FLSA claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, and are limited to the two years prior to the filing of the Complaint. The Court further holds that Plaintiff's claims under Ohio's Prompt Pay Act are barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
