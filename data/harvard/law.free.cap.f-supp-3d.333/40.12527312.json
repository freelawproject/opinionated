As the following analysis will showcase, the court need not reach the merits of Petitioner's void-for-vagueness challenge regarding \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause because Hobbs Act robbery categorically qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s \"force clause\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Furthermore, \u00a7 924(c)'s force clause defines a \"crime of violence\" as a felony that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A).

Fear of Injury to a Person\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Cancel-Marrero argues that Hobbs Act robbery cannot qualify as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s force clause because the felony can be committed by putting someone in \"fear of injury\" to his person, which allegedly does not require violent physical force, as defined in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the categorical approach, if the least violent conduct penalized by a statute fails to constitute a \"crime of violence,\" then the statute categorically fails\n   to qualify as a \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Hence, Petitioner contends that if Hobbs Act robbery can be committed by putting someone in \"fear of injury\" to his person, and doing so does not require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, then said statute fails to categorically qualify as a \"crime of violence\" under the force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of his argument, Petitioner relies heavily on the Fourth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Specifically, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Torres-Miguel\n   </em>\n   held that \"[a]n offense that results in physical bodily injury, but does not involve the use or threatened use of force, simply does not meet the Guidelines definition of crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710583\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/165/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710583\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/165/#p167\">\n    at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As an example, the Fourth Circuit mentions that a defendant could cause injury or death to someone by poisoning him, which does not require the use of physical force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710583\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/165/#p167\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710583\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/165/#p167\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Petitioner concludes that an individual could place another in \"fear of injury\" to his person by threatening to poison him, expose him to hazardous chemicals, or lock him up inside a car on a hot day, none of which, he argues, require the use or threat to use physical force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cancel-Marrero's argument that it is possible to commit Hobbs Act robbery by placing someone in \"fear of injury\" to his person without using or threatening to use physical force holds no water. The Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Torres-Miguel\n   </em>\n   that the phrase \"use of physical force\" does not include \"indirect applications\" of force, such as in the case of poisoning, was abrogated by\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Threatening to poison someone would still constitute a threat to use physical force because the use of force is not \"the act of 'sprink[ling]' the poison; it is the act of employing poison knowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the harm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick or punch), does not matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/157/\">\n    572 U.S. at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988,12579095\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1405/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, for purposes of the Hobbs Act robbery statute, \"[a] 'fear of injury' means fearing injury that will be produced by violent force, that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Finally, the \"fear of injury\" in Hobbs Act robbery \"encompasses a fear of injury produced by physical force that is one step removed from, but caused by, the physical force of the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170929\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/179/141/#p152\">\n    179 F.Supp.3d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, a person that commits Hobbs Act robbery by instilling onto his victim the fear of being poisoned, exposed to chemicals, or locked in a hot car is necessarily threatening to use physical force. It does not matter if the injury feared by the victim is to be the direct or indirect result of the perpetrator's use of physical force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This court cannot imagine a reasonably realistic scenario in which an individual could commit a Hobbs Act robbery by instilling onto someone a \"fear of injury\" to his person, where said injury is not to be caused by physical force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/#p38\">\n    866 F.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (1st Cir. 2017) (holding that \"we are not supposed to imagine 'fanciful, hypothetical scenarios' in assessing what the least serious conduct is that the statute covers\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, he who commits a Hobbs Act robbery by instilling onto his victim a \"fear of injury\" to his person has threatened to use physical force, regardless of whether the injury is the direct or indirect result of said physical force. This court thus concludes that a Hobbs Act robbery committed by causing a \"fear of injury\" to someone's person qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), and Petitioner's motion to correct sentence on the present ground is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    2. Fear of Injury to a Person's Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Alternatively, Cancel-Marrero argues that it is possible to commit Hobbs Act robbery by placing someone in \"fear of injury\" to his property, which can supposedly be accomplished by many means short of strong physical force. For example, Petitioner posits that one could theoretically commit a Hobbs Act robbery by threatening to throw paint at someone's house, pour paint on someone's passport, or spray-paint someone's car. Petitioner believes that these hypothetical threats do not constitute threats to use physical force pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Petitioner also asserts that one could commit a Hobbs Act robbery by threatening to cause a devaluation of some intangible asset, such as a stock holding. According to him, such threats to economic interests do not require the use or threat to use physical force.
