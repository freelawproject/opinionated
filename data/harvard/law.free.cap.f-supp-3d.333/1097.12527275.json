BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Broadly speaking, this case centers around technology that attempts to sort, and usually succeeds in sorting, non-human mammalian semen based on whether a sperm cell carries an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. Such \"sexed semen\" is useful in artificial insemination to ensure the\n   gender of the offspring. One patent related to this technology is U.S. Patent No. RE46,559 (\"559 Patent\"). Count XII of XY's Fourth Amended Complaint accuses Trans Ova of infringing \"at least claim 1\" of the 559 Patent. (ECF No. 74 \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The 559 Patent discloses a method that improves the accuracy of systems designed to detect the differences between \"particles\" of \"at least two populations\" during flow cytometry. 559 Patent at Abstract. When the \"particles\" are sperm cells and the \"populations\" are X-chromosome cells and Y-chromosome cells, a typical way to distinguish them under the current state of the art is to: (1) apply a special dye that bonds to the chromosomes and will fluoresce when struck with a laser beam; (2) \"entrain\" each dyed sperm cell in a fluid droplet that moves through a laser beam, causing the dye to fluoresce; (3) use a light-detecting mechanism to judge whether the cell contains an X chromosome or a Y chromosome (X chromosomes contain more DNA and so fluoresce more); (4) apply a charge to the droplet based on whether the light detector has detected an X chromosome or a Y chromosome; and (5) use charged plates to pull the droplet toward the collecting vial for X-chromosome cells or Y-chromosome cells, as the case may be.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 1:53-61, 3:4-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sometimes the difference in fluorescence between X and Y chromosomes \"may be so small\" that \"it may be difficult to categorize the data points into a population.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 3:67-4:4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the supposedly innovative portion of the patent was the discovery that \"[w]hen an artery is damaged or inflamed, the body releases the enzyme myeloperoxidase, or MPO, in response.

However, all of the testing methods were previously known in the art (including, for example, flow cytometry ).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276672\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1352/#p1360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276672\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1352/#p1360\">\n    at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the patent's only real advance over the prior art was the correlation between MPO and cardiovascular disease.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276672\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1352/#p1360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276672\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1352/#p1360\">\n    at 1360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The patent was therefore directed to a patent-ineligible natural law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276672\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1352/#p1360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Taking all of these decisions together, the Court finds that Claim 1 of the 559 Patent is directed to patent-ineligible subject matter, specifically, the mathematical equation that permits rotating multi-dimensional data. Although this equation may help to discriminate between particles of varying populations, thereby increasing a flow cytometer's overall effectiveness, the innovation still reduces to nothing more than applying a mathematical concept. This is materially no different from\n   <em>\n    Flook\n   </em>\n   , where the proposed patent's only innovation was an algorithm that supposedly produced more useful data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182949\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/584/\">\n    437 U.S. at 585-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182949\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/584/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is also similar to\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Clinic\n   </em>\n   , given that the equation is applied in the context of hardware that is already well-known in the art. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276672\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1352/#p1360\">\n    859 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    EPG\n   </em>\n   , moreover, emphasizes that gathering, processing, and displaying data is considered an abstract mental process (or ancillary to it).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n    830 F.3d at 1353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And\n   <em>\n    Flook\n   </em>\n   , again, forecloses any argument that Claim 1's abstractness may be overlooked because it teaches a way of using a mathematical equation specifically in flow cytometry, rather than claiming a patent on the equation generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182949\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/584/\">\n    437 U.S. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182949\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/584/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Claim 1 is directed to a patent-ineligible concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    , Step Two: Are the Claims Nonetheless Sufficiently Inventive?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Given the foregoing, the Court proceeds to\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   's second inquiry: whether \"the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2354\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this regard, Trans Ova argues that everything in Claim 1 of the 559 Patent save for the mathematical equation was disclosed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C145%2C590\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,145,590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"590 Patent\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is specifically listed in the 559 Patent as relevant prior art. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 138 at 10-11.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   559 Patent at 13:64. XY does not respond to this argument. Instead, it asserts that fact questions prevent disposition under the second\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   inquiry, particularly whether the added element of mathematical analysis was more than a well-understood, routine, or conventional addition to the pre-existing process. (ECF No. 143 at 15-17.) XY's argument implicitly admits that there is nothing of note in Claim 1 beyond the application of math, which is a patent-ineligible abstract concept. By definition, then, the patent cannot amount to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself. And the 559 Patent's\n   dependent claims fare no better-again, they offer nothing beyond the prior art but a direction to apply additional mathematical concepts, like scaling equations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, the 559 Patent presents nothing that rises to the level of a patentable invention, and so should not have been issued. Trans Ova's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. XY's Proposed Fifth Amended Complaint &amp; Trans Ova's Proposed Second Amended Answer and Counterclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This disposition affects two other pending motions. The first is XY's Motion to Amend Complaint. (ECF No. 137.) This motion seeks leave to file a fifth amended complaint, which would add: (1) a new cause of action for infringement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C625%2C367\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,625,367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"367 Patent\"), (2) a new cause of action for infringement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C835%2C541\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,835,541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"541 Patent\"), and (3) Plaintiff Inguran as a named plaintiff on the current cause of action for infringement of the 559 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) However, the third item of relief is moot given that the Court will grant Trans Ova's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the 559 Patent. As for the 367 and 541 Patents, the Court finds that amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foman v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    371 U.S. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    9 L.Ed.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962) (\"futility of amendment\" is a proper ground to deny leave to amend).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Both the 367 and 541 Patents derive from the 559 Patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Specification is the same for each of the three patents. The only material difference between the 367 Patent and the 559 Patent is that the 367 Patent takes the method described in the 559 Patent and maps it onto an apparatus-or in other words, instead of describing a method for sorting particles, as claimed in the 559 Patent, the 367 Patent describes a flow cytometer configured to carry out the 559 Patent's method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   367 Patent at 17:28-18:39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As for the 541 Patent, it presents nearly the same method claims as the 559 Patent, with the only material difference being that it does not claim multiple \"detectors\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , light detectors for measuring fluorescence). It instead only requires the\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to detect \"a plurality of signals\" from a single particle. 541 Patent at 17:21. The method of the 541 Patent could thus be implemented in a flow cytometer with a single detector capable of discerning more than one signal. But the 541 Patent does not claim that a single multitasking detector is innovative; the claimed innovation continues to be the application of multi-dimensional mathematical equations to the data gathered by the detector. Accordingly, the 367 and 541 Patents would fail an\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   patentability analysis for the same reasons as the 559 Patent, making XY's proposed amendment futile.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gohier v. Enright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857688\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/1216/#p1218\">\n    186 F.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1218 (10th Cir. 1999) (\"The futility question is functionally equivalent to the question whether a complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, just last week, Trans Ova filed its Motion to Amend Counterclaims. (ECF No. 259.) Trans Ova seeks leave to \"add one new counterclaim against all Plaintiffs for unenforceability of [the 559 Patent ] due to inequitable conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) This motion will be denied as moot given the Court's conclusion that the 559 Patent should not have issued in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
