Despite Plaintiffs' several requests that the FMCSA weigh in on this dispute, it has declined to do so. Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves emphasize that the FMCSA is understaffed and that FMCSA enforcement against drivers is unheard of.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC at 40:11-17 (\"Has anyone ever heard of a FMCSA Inspector questioning a livery or taxi vehicle on the street ... didn't think so....\")\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The mere existence of a federal regulation without some credible threat that it will be prosecuted against Plaintiffs is insufficient to meet Article III's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anchorage Equal Rights Comm'n\n   </em>\n   , 220 F.3d at 1139 (\"[N]either the mere existence of a proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution satisfies the 'case or controversy' requirement.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Susan B.

Indeed, any threat of prosecution seems particularly remote here because Plaintiffs (a) concede that they do not provide services through their independent TCP business that would subject them to FMCA jurisdiction; and (b) out of the thousands of rides they have been directed by Uber to provide in their capacity as TNC drivers, Plaintiffs have only identified a handful of examples of rides that they contend is within the FMCA's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, even assuming that Plaintiffs could allege a credible threat of prosecution by the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   government based on\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   law, Plaintiffs cannot show that the CPUC is responsible for that harm. The CPUC does not enforce federal law and Plaintiffs made no allegations that prove the CPUC rules make it more likely that the federal government will take enforcement action against them. Nor have Plaintiffs shown that \"it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law,\"\n   <em>\n    Puente Ariz. v. Arpaio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259075\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1098/#p1103\">\n    821 F.3d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1103 (9th Cir. 2016), such that a risk of prosecution under federal law arises from mere compliance with state law. Indeed, California law\n   does not preclude a TNC driver from applying for and obtaining FMCA registration; drivers are free to comply fully with both regimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued for the first time that federal motor carriers must own or lease their vehicle, and thus the CPUC's TNC authorization for entities that do not own the vehicles conflicts with federal law. This argument fails for several reasons. As a preliminary matter, the federal statute cited by Plaintiffs does not require motor carriers to own or lease their vehicles. Rather, it merely provides that \"[t]he Secretary may require a motor carrier providing transportation ... that uses motor vehicles not owned by it to transport\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   under an arrangement with another party to-(1) make the arrangement in writing signed by the parties specifying its duration and the compensation to be paid by the motor carrier; [and] (2) carry a copy of the arrangement in each motor vehicle to which it applies during the period the arrangement is in effect[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The purpose of these \"truth-in-leasing regulations [is to] protect independent truckers from motor carriers' abusive leasing practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox v. Transam Leasing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177515\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1209/#p1211\">\n    839 F.3d 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1211 (10th Cir. 2016). Section 14102 has no relevance here because it applies only to motor carriers transporting property (not passengers), and it does not contain an ownership requirement. It merely provides that when a vehicle that is not owned is used to transport property, certain documentation must exist and be carried in the vehicle. Nor do other provisions of the FMCA appear to contain an ownership or leasing requirement as Plaintiffs purport. Section 13902 merely requires motor carriers who \"own[ ], rent[ ], or lease[ ]\" their vehicles to register with the Secretary, but does not generally require all motor carriers to own, rent, or lease their vehicles.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013902\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). In any case, even assuming that the FMCA required all motor carriers to own or lease their vehicles, California does not force any entity to violate federal law: rather, as the CPUC pointed out at the hearing, an entity that owns or leases its vehicles would merely be regulated as a TCP rather than a TNC. The CPUC regulatory scheme does not interfere with or impede enforcement of the FMCA. There is no basis for conflict preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the relief they seek-invalidation of the TNC statute-would redress their alleged harm. They must allege that it is \"likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Whether or not California administers a TNC program, the federal licensing requirements would still exist. Thus, even if California is enjoined from administering a TNC licensing scheme, Plaintiffs would still be required to comply with federal law by obtaining an operating license from the federal government (if the law in fact requires them to do so), and would thus still face a threat of enforcement by their failure to do so. To the extent Plaintiffs argue that the TNC licensing scheme enables Uber to operate and expose its drivers to the risk of violating the FMCA,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by transporting passengers across state lines, Plaintiffs are not compelled by state law to do so. They do not have to driver for Uber. They can refuse a ride that requires crossing state lines. Or they can register under the FMCA as a motor carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to raise a federal preemption challenge to the TNC statute based on their unfounded fear that federal authorities will prosecute them. Further, their pre-emption argument is meritless. The pre-emption theory is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice, because amendment would be\n   futile; in their proposed Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), Plaintiffs merely confirm that enforcement by the FMCSA is not credibly imminent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 180 (\"Apparently it is the official policy of the FMCSA NOT to themselves enforce the federal registration requirements for 'clear' violations ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Federal Preemption Based on PUCTRA Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the hearing, Plaintiffs proposed another theory of preemption for the first time. They claimed that California's PUCTRA fees taken from TCP drivers are preempted by the FMCA because TCP drivers engage in interstate commerce. The FMCA provides that \"[a] State or political subdivision thereof may not collect or levy a tax, fee, head charge, or other change on-(1) a passenger traveling in interstate commerce by motor carrier; (2) the transportation of a passenger traveling in interstate commerce by motor carrier; (3) the sale of passenger transportation in interstate commerce by motor carrier; or (4) the gross receipts derived from such transportation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014905\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Plaintiffs, because Uber or its drivers provide transportation services for which the FMCA requires registration and Uber or its drivers do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   obtain that registration, their business costs are reduced, thus enabling them to charge lower fares. Those business costs include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , lower insurance liability limits. As a result, Uber allegedly obtains an unfair competitive advantage over Plaintiffs in their TCP business due to Uber's non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Although the theory seems hypothetically possible, Plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to support a plausible inference that they have suffered such competitive harm traceable to Uber's alleged non-compliance with the FMCA requirements in the market in which Plaintiffs participate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs concede that, in their independent TCP business, they do not provide rides that would subject them to FMCA registration requirements. Thus, Plaintiffs do not willingly compete, or seek to compete, in any market subject to the FMCA's jurisdiction (and Plaintiffs admit that they themselves lack FMCA authorization). Uber's alleged illegitimate activity, under Plaintiffs' theory, however, would only occur in markets subject to the FMCA's jurisdiction. Because Plaintiffs and Uber are competing in different markets (at least with respect to the FMCA licensing issue), Plaintiffs would have to plausibly allege that Uber's illegitimate operations in the FMCA markets allow Uber to be unfairly competitive in non-FMCA markets. Plaintiffs have not done so in their current complaint nor have they advanced a plausible theory showing an interrelationship between the two markets at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs' assertion that Uber gained an unfair competitive advantage by not registering as a motor carrier under the FMCA is highly speculative. The main consequence of FMCA registration is the payment of an application fee, minimum insurance liability limits, and required compliance with certain safety educational requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013902\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) (requirements for registered motor carriers);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013904\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(2) (requirements for registered brokers).

The asserted theory is somewhat unintelligible but the Court construes this as claiming that Uber interfered either with Plaintiffs' contractual relations with the CPUC, or with Plaintiffs' clients. However, the pleadings are vague and conclusory and it is not clear whether a contract even exists, what Uber specifically did to interfere with the contract(s), and whether there has been any harm to Plaintiffs.

Once again, the underlying theory of interference is unclear. To the extent Plaintiffs allege that Uber induced the CPUC to temporarily suspend their TCP licenses for failure to pay PUCTRA fees, Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that Uber played any role whatsoever in the CPUC's enforcement action against Plaintiffs. To the extent Plaintiffs allege that Uber has interfered with Plaintiffs' relationship with their clients/passengers, they have not specifically pled how that happened. Plaintiffs have not proposed a cure in their proposed SAC. Thus, these claims are also\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Further Amendment Is Not Warranted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs' proposed Second Amended Complaint also includes additional claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the Uber defendants for violating the commerce clause and 14th Amendment, but the claims would not be viable so amendment is futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsch v.
