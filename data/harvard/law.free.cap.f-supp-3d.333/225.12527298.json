(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 4, 2016. (Dkt. 33). The case was referred to United States Magistrate Judge H.

While that motion was pending, this Court adopted the Report and Recommendation of Judge Schroeder (Dkt. 68) recommending the granting of Sechrist's previously-filed motion to dismiss (Dkt. 41), but the Court also granted Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint to assert a First Amendment retaliation claim (Dkt. 78). Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on August 10, 2017. (Dkt. 82). On November 16, 2017, Sechrist filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) or alternatively for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, directed to Plaintiff's second amended complaint. (Dkt. 87).

Exhaustion of Remedies with Respect to Assault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants contend that the Report and Recommendation, in effect, recommended granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff on the issue of whether he exhausted his administrative remedies, even though Plaintiff did not move for summary judgment on that issue. (Dkt. 102 at 3-5). In support of their argument, Defendants rely on the portion of the Report and Recommendation discussing the grievance given by Plaintiff to Sechrist about the alleged assault:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds that the DOCCS' grievance procedures that were technically available to plaintiff at ERC were 'so opaque and confusing' that they were, 'practically speaking, incapable of use.'\n   <em>\n    Ross[ v. Blake\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----], 136 S.Ct. [1850,] at 1859[,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597464\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1850/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ] ;\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , 829 F.3d at 126. And that, in giving his grievance alleging his assault to CO Sechrist, plaintiff exhausted all administrative remedies that were available to him. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Dkt. 101 at 14). Plaintiff replies that he is not trained in the law, and that based on the facts and case law he cites, the administrative remedies were, in fact, not available to him. (Dkt. 107 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The language cited from the Report and Recommendation by Defendants, when viewed in isolation, could be interpreted as concluding as a matter of law that the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to the assault will not be available to Defendants at the time of trial. However, this Court does not view the Report and Recommendation as reaching that conclusion. Indeed, before coming to the conclusion cited above, the Report and Recommendation states that \"the question remains\" whether the grievance process was \"available\" to Plaintiff, and \"[d]rawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor ... I find that CO Sechrist never filed plaintiff's grievance.\" (Dkt. 101 at 12-13). If, in fact, Sechrist never filed Plaintiff's grievance, then as indicated by the Report and Recommendation, and consistent with the Second Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Priatno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340054\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/118/\">\n    829 F.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2016), \"the process to appeal an unfiled and unanswered grievance is prohibitively opaque, such that no inmate could actually make use of it\" and its \"obscurity was compounded\" by Plaintiff's transfer within weeks after unsuccessfully attempting to file a grievance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340054\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340054\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/118/\">\n    at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, factual issues remain concerning Plaintiff's attempt to file a grievance concerning the assault that will need to be resolved by the trier of fact. Thus, Defendants' affirmative defense of failure to exhaust remains available, but the jury will be instructed in accordance with Second Circuit case law on this issue. Accordingly, Defendants' Objections in this regard are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Actions Alleged Against McGrain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants also object to the Report and Recommendation to the extent it rejected the argument that the allegations against McGrain, that he threw water on Plaintiff and left him in damp clothing overnight in a cold cell the night before the alleged assault, were a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   use of force. (Dkt. 102 at 5-8). While acknowledging that McGrain is also alleged to have been present during the assault the following day (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6), Defendants attempt to treat Plaintiff's allegations as two separate claims against McGrain, and seek dismissal of any allegations based upon his purported actions the day before the alleged assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants misconstrue the Report and Recommendation and Plaintiff's claim. As aptly put by Plaintiff in his Reply to Defendants' Objections, McGrain's actions must be viewed \"as a whole\" and the alleged assault on August 31 cannot be appropriately understood without considering McGrain's alleged threats and actions the evening before the assault. (Dkt. 107 at 4). The Report and Recommendation did not recognize an entirely separate cause of action based upon McGrain's activity the evening prior to the assault, but rather appropriately viewed the allegations as a continuum of alleged activity by McGrain, ultimately resulting in significant injuries to Plaintiff. (Dkt. 101 at 20). Thus, Defendants' Objections are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Objections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the conclusion in the Report and Recommendation that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies against DOCCS physician Braselman. (Dkt. 105). The Report and Recommendation concluded that it was undisputed that Plaintiff failed to file a grievance against Braselman because he believed a claim\n   against Braselman was non-grievable, when in fact it was. (Dkt. 101 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his Objections, Plaintiff attempts to offer various explanations as to why he failed to file a grievance against Braselman. (Dkt. 105). However, these were not the explanations provided by Plaintiff at his deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793366\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/614/#p619\">\n    84 F.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"[A] party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion that, by omission or addition, contradicts the affiant's previous deposition testimony.... [F]actual issues created solely by an affidavit crafted to oppose a summary judgment motion are not 'genuine' issues for trial.\" (quotation marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When testifying under oath, Plaintiff stated that he did not file a grievance against Braselman \"[b]ecause medical is not a grievable entity.\" (Dkt. 65-6 at 87). In other words, unlike the failure to file a grievance concerning the assault, at his deposition Plaintiff plainly testified that the reason he failed to file a grievance concerning the medical indifference claim was because of his belief that a grievance could not be filed concerning a medical issue. Indeed, Plaintiff testified that, because of this understanding, he had never filed a medical grievance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But Plaintiff's understanding was mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In fact, as recognized in the Report and Recommendation, \"only claims against persons or agencies outside of the DOCCS system, such as medical contractors, are excluded from the requirements of the [Inmate Grievance Program].\" (Dkt. 101 at 14). As set forth in Defendants' Reply to Plaintiff's Objections (Dkt. 106 at 3-4), Plaintiff cannot now attempt to alter his deposition testimony and contend that, in fact, he attempted to file a grievance concerning Braselman but was unable to do so,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flaherty v. Filardi\n   </em>\n   , No. 03 CIV. 2167(LTS)(HBP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202734633\">\n    2007 WL 2734633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 2007) (\"To the extent Plaintiff's affirmations conflict with her prior deposition testimony, they will be disregarded.\"). Thus, the Court agrees with the conclusion in the Report and Recommendation that the undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff failed to file a grievance against Braselman because of his mistaken belief that his claim was non-grievable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Alternatively, while not addressed by the Report and Recommendation, even if the Court excused Plaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies as they relate to Braselman, Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Braselman's alleged deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Dkt. 101 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-18; Dkt. 82 at \u00b6 36). Plaintiff was permitted to seek treatment at the infirmary, presumably several hours later, sometime after 3:00 p.m. (Dkt. 101 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-2 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. 82 at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40), and was examined by Nurse Talada at about 5:00 p.m. (Dkt. 65-2 at \u00b6 20; Dkt. 65-3 at \u00b6 5; Dkt. 82 at \u00b6 44). At that point in time, Nurse Talada cleaned, treated, and bandaged Plaintiff's wound, and she provided him with pain medication. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-3 at \u00b6 5; Dkt. 65-6 at 38-40, 74). Plaintiff was then examined by Braselman at about 2:00 p.m. the next day. (Dkt. 65-2 at \u00b6 37; Dkt. 65-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Dkt. 82 at \u00b6 57). Considering Nurse Talada's initial treatment and care, and the fact that Braselman's examination took place by mid-afternoon the following day, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's wound was addressed with \"sufficient speed\" for constitutional purposes.\n   <em>\n    Wandell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201036030\">\n    2000 WL 1036030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding that the \"defendants attended to [the plaintiff] with 'sufficient speed' \" where the plaintiff alleged that \"he received medical attention from a nurse within half-an-hour of his injury, he was examined by a physician assistant in the prison hospital within six hours, and he received medical attention from a doctor at the prison hospital and a doctor at Saint Agnes Hospital within 24 hours of his injury\" (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNulty v.

Feb. 25, 2013) (finding that the defendant's \"determination that Plaintiff did not require medical attention in light of his recent examination by [a registered nurse] and ongoing treatment does not rise to the level of criminal recklessness,\" but, \"[a]t most,\" constituted \"mere negligence or malpractice, and therefore cannot form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation\");\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

However, Plaintiff's speculative assertions describing what a contagion\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   done are insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnow v.

Braselman averred that he scheduled regular medical monitoring, beginning on September 1, 2011, and that \"[n]o signs of infections were noted\" before Plaintiff was discharged to his prison cell On September 6th. (Dkt. 65-3 at 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Consistent with Braselman's averments, Plaintiff testified that Nurse Talada reexamined his injury several times during his monitoring period to redress his wound and to ensure that the laceration was healing and was not infected. (Dkt. 65-6 at 79-80). After Plaintiff was released to his prison cell, his leg began to swell, and he returned to the infirmary a couple days later where he was diagnosed with an infection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, 81). The infection never showed signs of any odor or any discharge of puss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82). Plaintiff testified that Braselman wrote a prescription for Keflex, an antibiotic, which resolved the infection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53, 83-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Instead of noting any signs of infection that were evident during his medical monitoring period, Plaintiff's own testimony confirms that Braselman took the risk of infection seriously as he undertook various actions to prevent the onset of further medical complications. Indeed, Plaintiff points to no medical evidence in the record demonstrating that Braselman was indifferent to any risk of infection while Plaintiff was housed in the infirmary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Feb. 29, 2016) (\"[T]he fact that [the plaintiff] was diagnosed with MRSA and isolated on April 13, three days after leaving Mid-State for admission at St. Elizabeth's[,] does not demonstrate that the one-day delay or interruption in treatment allegedly caused by John Does # 11-13 constitutes deliberate indifference.\"),\n   <em>\n    report and recommendation adopted\n   </em>\n   , No. 9:14-CV-1351 (DNH/CFH),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201261125\">\n    2016 WL 1261125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, there is no evidence that Braselman actually became aware of any symptoms associated with an infection to Plaintiff's leg. It was only after Plaintiff was discharged to his prison cell that any signs of infection began to manifest themselves. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff returned to the infirmary where Braselman prescribed an antibiotic that effectively cured the infection.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hines v.

Therefore, even assuming that Plaintiff is excused from his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, Plaintiff's claim for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need against Braselman fails on the merits.

As a result, Sechrist's motion for summary judgment or for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 87) is granted, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 65) is granted in part and denied in part.
