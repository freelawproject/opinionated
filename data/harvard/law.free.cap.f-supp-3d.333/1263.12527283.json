Plaintiffs Victory Processing, LLC and Dave Dishaw (collectively referred\n   to as Victory Processing) filed\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 56(a)\n   </em>\n   (Victory Processing's Motion). ECF No. 22. Defendant Peter K. Michael in his official capacity as Attorney General for the State of Wyoming (Attorney General), filed a response in opposition (Attorney General's Response), ECF No. 26, to which Victory Processing replied (Victory Processing's Reply). ECF No. 28. The Attorney General filed\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   </em>\n   (Attorney General's Motion) ECF No. 24. Victory Processing filed a response in opposition (Victory Processing's Response), ECF No. 27, to which the Attorney General replied (Attorney General's Reply). ECF No. 29. Having considered both motions, the applicable law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court FINDS and ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Victory Processing is a company engaged in data gathering, political consulting and message dissemination projects. Doc. 23, p. 2. Victory Processing primarily achieves its work through reaching out to residents in various states using automated telephone systems or \"robocalls\" and conducting surveys. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. They allege that potential clients have reached out to them, requesting their services and have inquired about conducting robocalls in the State of Wyoming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. However, Victory Processing has had to decline work with those clients because Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 prohibits commercial and political robocalls. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.The company has also had to refrain from conducting robocalls to improve their own database and consulting capabilities because Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 prohibits commercial and political robocalls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although they are currently prohibited from robocalling, Victory Processing has expressed the desire to engage in future political speech and information gathering operations for themselves and on behalf of third parties through the use of robocalls. Doc. 23-1, \u00b6\u00b6 9 -10, 13-14; Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10. As a result of the current ban on robocalls, Victory Processing claims to have suffered lost individual and business opportunities. Doc. 1, \u00b6 11. Consequently, Victory Processing has requested summary judgment in their favor, as well as, prospective injunctive relief from enforcement under Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute of fact is genuine if a reasonable juror could resolve the disputed fact in favor of either side.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The moving party can satisfy this burden by either (1) offering affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim, or (2) demonstrating that the nonmoving party's evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Once the moving party satisfies this initial burden, the nonmoving party must\n   support its contention that a genuine dispute of material fact exists either by (1) citing to particular materials in the record, or (2) showing that the materials cited by the moving party do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869818\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1153/#p1158\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The nonmoving party must \"do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

Rather, to survive a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party must \"make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of [every] element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Further, when opposing summary judgment, the nonmoving party cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine dispute of material fact for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travis v.

First, does Victory Processing have standing to bring a First Amendment claim? Second, does Wyoming's robocall statute, Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104, violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution? The Court will address standing first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There are two aspects of standing relevant to this case which must be satisfied, Article Three standing and the prudential standing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Article Three Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury in fact, a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and that it is likely the court can provide redress.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). A plaintiff may demonstrate injury in fact by alleging \"an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366996\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/1263/#p1267\">\n    321 F.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1267 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Phelps v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302478\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1309/#p1326\">\n    122 F.3d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1326 (10th Cir. 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Victory Processing can establish an injury in fact, because the conduct of making political robocalls arguably affects a constitutional interest, is proscribed by Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 and there exists a credible threat that Victory Processing will be prosecuted if it begins making robocalls. This threat of prosecution also provides the causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of. Finally, if the Court concludes that the \u00a7 6-6-104 is unconstitutional and strikes it down, that action will provide redress for Victory Processing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Prudential Limits on Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Attorney General rightfully points out that Victory Processing must also get beyond the requirement that litigants are generally prohibited from brining claims on behalf of a third party.\n   <em>\n    Powers v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p410\">\n    499 U.S. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p410\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p410\">\n    113 L.Ed.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). This doctrine\n   is known as third party standing and in general the Supreme Court allows it if the plaintiff has an injury in fact sufficient to create a concrete interest in the outcome, a close relation to the third party, and that the third party is in some way hindered from being the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p410\">\n    499 U.S. at 410-411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p410\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). The Attorney General is incorrect whoever, when he applies the\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   factors to a third party standing question in a First Amendment overbreadth case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A plaintiff whose own speech is not threatened may challenge a statute as overly broad in violation of the First Amendment under a different standard than that set out in\n   <em>\n    Powers.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/#p957\">\n    467 U.S. 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 957,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/#p957\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/#p957\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The Supreme Court explained that standing is allowed in these cases\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   for the benefit of society-to prevent the statute from chilling the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the Court. Munson's ability to serve that function has nothing to do with whether or not its own First Amendment rights are at stake. The crucial issues are whether Munson satisfies the requirement of 'injury-in-fact,' and whether it can be expected satisfactorily to frame the issues in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 958. Munson, therefore, articulates a different two element test for third party standing in a First Amendment overbreadth case, whether the plaintiff can demonstrate an injury in fact and satisfactorily frame the issues of the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/#p957\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This principle is reinforced in\n   <em>\n    Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600890\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/383/#p392\">\n    484 U.S. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392-93,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600890\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/383/#p392\">\n    108 S.Ct. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600890\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/383/#p392\">\n    98 L.Ed.2d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) (holding that a \"judicial assumption that the statutes very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech\" allows a plaintiff to proceed regardless of whether their own expression has been restricted). Finally, the Tenth Circuit has discussed this different treatment in First Amendment overbreadth cases, although it has not had the opportunity to decide a third party standing question in such a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Initiative and Referendum Institute v.

The Court concludes that, in this case, the correct standard is spelled out in\n   <em>\n    Munson.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, in order to satisfy to bring this case on behalf of a third party, Victory Processing must demonstrate an injury in fact and be able to satisfactorily frame the issues of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the previous analysis of Article Three standing, the court concluded that Victory Processing has shown an injury in fact. Turning to the next element, the Court can see no reason why Victory Processing would struggle to frame the issues satisfactorily. Because Victory Processing would place the robocalls, it is well positioned to frame the First Amendment challenge to the statute which forbids using robocalls for political purposes. Additionally, Victory Processing is currently litigating a very similar case in Montana without such difficulty.\n   <em>\n    Victory Processing, LLC v. Fox\n   </em>\n   , CV 17-27-H-CCL,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524898\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1109/\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2018 WL811232, at *14 (D. Mont. Feb. 9, 2018). Therefore, the Court concludes that Victory Processing can satisfactorily frame the issues in this case. Having determined that Victory Processing has standing, the Court will analyze Victory Processing's First Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Content-Neutral or Content-Based\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Victory Processing claims that Wyo.

Doc. 25, p. 16. If some residents wished to receive these calls, the Attorney General suggests that the statute provides exceptions to allow otherwise banned robocalls to willing recipients in Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 40-12-303. However, this is where the Montana statute and the Wyoming Statute differ. Montana provides that any robocall falling\n   into the five restricted categories is allowed if a live operator introduces the message.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2045-8-216\">\n    Mont.

In determining whether the statute is clear and unambiguous, the Court looks to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in the statutes,\n   <em>\n    Horse Creek Conservation District v. State ex rel. Wyoming Attorney General\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994480\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/306/\">\n    2009 WY 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994480\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/306/\">\n    221 P.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312 (Wyo. 2009). The Wyoming statute prohibits\n   <em>\n    telephonic sales calls.\n   </em>\n   Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 40-12-303(a). The statute goes on to provide exceptions to subsection (a) and states that subsection (a) does not prohibit calls if introduced by a live message or live operator and (i) the calls are initiated by the person receiving the call, (ii) the numbers called are not on the national do-not-call list or an unlisted number, or (iii) the call is to a consumer with whom a business relationship exists. Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 40-12-303(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The use of the term \"telephonic sales calls\" in Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 40-12-303(a) makes it unclear if any of the exceptions in subsection (b) apply to political robocalls. The Attorney General claims that political robocalls fitting one of the exceptions would be allowed. Doc. 29, pp. 5, 11. However, Victory Processing argues that the statutes are unclear as to whether this would be legal. Doc. 27, p. 13. As Victory Processing points out, the use of the term \"telephonic sales calls\" suggests that the exemptions found in Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 40-12-303(b) only apply to commercial calls, leaving no channels for political speech to reach residents of Wyoming through the stated exceptions to the robocall ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Therefore, Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 is over inclusive in that it completely prohibits political speech through robocalls while allowing commercial speech under certain circumstances. Accordingly, Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 is not be narrowly tailored. The Court concludes Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 is a content-based restriction which does not pass strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, it is ordered that Victory Processing does have Article III standing. Additionally, Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-6-104 as written, does not survive strict scrutiny and is therefore unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   ORDERED that Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgement\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 24) is DENIED. It is further,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   ORDERED that\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgement\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 22) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
