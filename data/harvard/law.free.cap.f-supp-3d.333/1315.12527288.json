Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration focuses on four aspects of this Court's analysis of scienter in its Order dated March 29, 2018 [Doc. 43] (the \"March 29 Order\"). In the event the Court denies or otherwise declines to rule on Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration, Defendants also have moved the Court to certify this case for interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE MARCH 29 ORDER\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the March 29 Order, this Court granted in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, finding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that eleven of the thirty-seven statements upon which Plaintiffs' claims are based (Statement Nos. 1-2, 4, 7, 13, 21-22, 27, 32, 34, and 36) are forward-looking statements accompanied by sufficient cautionary language so that they are protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\") safe harbor provision and not actionable as a matter of law. March 29 Order at 15-50 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c) ). With regard to the remaining twenty-six statements identified in the Complaint, Defendants made the following six discrete arguments attacking the sufficiency of elements of Plaintiffs' allegations of scienter: (1) Plaintiffs' motive allegations are implausible, (2) the absence of insider stock sales allegations undercuts an inference of scienter, (3) Plaintiffs' \"positions and responsibilities\" allegations do not support scienter, (4) Plaintiffs' witness allegations are not credible or sufficient to support scienter, (5) Plaintiffs' allegations of Defendants' directives regarding public communications did not support scienter, and (6) allegations related to post-class events did not\n   support scienter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

With regard to Defendants' argument that the absence of insider trading allegations undercuts an inference of scienter, the Court found that the absence of such allegations in this case, considering the facts alleged collectively, was not dispositive and did not preclude an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-66. The Court thoroughly examined Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the individual defendants' positions, responsibilities, and access to information allegations and found that, accepting the allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the allegations supported an inference of scienter as to Defendants Day, Anderson, and Huggins, but did not support an inference of scienter as to Defendants Holland, Fanning, and Beattie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-81. The Court rejected Defendants' argument that the witness accounts alleged in the Complaint were not credible and considered them as a part of the cumulative view of all of the allegations and inferences in its analysis of scienter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-83. Accepting Plaintiffs' allegations as true and drawing reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the Court also found that the evidence that Defendant Day gave directives limiting public communication supported an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court then summarized its findings with regard to scienter as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court concludes that the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint create a strong inference (i.e. a cogent and compelling one) that the certain individual Defendants orchestrated the fraud, knew about it, or were severely reckless in not knowing about it. Taking the well-pleaded allegations and reasonable inferences drawn from those allegations as true, and viewing them collectively, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a strong inference of scienter as to Defendants Day, Huggins, and Anderson. The allegations in the Complaint do not support a strong inference of scienter as to Defendants Fanning, Beattie, and Holland, who are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   as individual Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84-85.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court viewed all of the allegations and reasonable inferences drawn from those inferences collectively in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs. No one factor was dispositive and the Court was careful to weigh the fact that there was an absence of insider trading allegations (the only adverse inference Defendants referenced in their briefing) against a finding of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is this Court's analysis of scienter that is the subject of Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration. Specifically, Defendants contend that the Court erred in its application of the scienter standard in the following four respects:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) The Court erred in failing to require a strong inference of scienter with regard to each statement as to each defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) The Court's Defendant-by-Defendant analysis erred in holding that Day's, Anderson's, and Huggins's positions, responsibilities and access to information\n   established severe recklessness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) The Court erred in finding that allegations of motive were probative of scienter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (4) Plaintiffs failed to meet the pleading requirements for alleging scienter against Southern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. of Law in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. for Recons. [Doc. 51-1] (\"Defs.' Recons. Br.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Alternatively, if the Court decides against Defendants on their Motion for Reconsideration, Defendants have moved for a certification for interlocutory appeal on the following two questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) Whether this Circuit's requirement that a \"complaint allege facts supporting a strong inference of scienter 'for each defendant with respect to each violation' \" requires a plaintiff to plead scienter as to each allegedly false or misleading statement.\n   <em>\n    Mizzaro v.

Second, the\n   <em>\n    Mogensen\n   </em>\n   court did not hold that \"specific details of first-hand interactions\" must be pled in order to sufficiently allege scienter; instead the language cited was just an example of evidence that could establish scienter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222381\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/15/1191/#p1220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Mogensen\n   </em>\n   court expressed the skepticism with which it and other courts view confidential witness allegations \"who, from behind the veil of anonymity, provide only non-specific descriptions of meetings and internal documents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222381\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/15/1191/#p1220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court then provided examples of how this skepticism of confidential witness allegations can be overcome and the language cited by Defendants was provided as one of the examples.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222381\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/15/1191/#p1220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Similarly, courts will find a strong inference of scienter when confidential witnesses point to the specific details of first-hand interactions with a defendant in which they advised him that existing facts contradicted his public disclosures-especially when the defendant admits as much in his responses to the witnesses.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants argue further that, regardless of whether Defendants Day, Anderson and Huggins observed the Kemper Plant and knew generally that there were delays, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they \"understood (or were severely reckless in not understanding) that those issues rendered the May 2014 COD unachievable at the time of each challenged statement.\" Defs.' Recons. Br. at 6. Essentially, Defendants argue that, even accepting the fact that they may have known generally about construction delays and a lack of progress, the allegations are insufficient to show a strong inference of scienter because there is no accompanying allegation\n   that the impact of the delays was explained to defendants (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the May 2014 COD was unachievable). This argument was not made by Defendants in their briefing of their Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Notwithstanding Defendants' failure to raise this argument in their Motion to Dismiss, the Court finds the argument to be unavailing. First, a logical inference to draw from the delays would be that the project was not \"on schedule\" which, of course, is inconsistent with many of the statements made by Defendants at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Statements Nos. 5-6, 10, 25-26, 29-31 (\"Project is on schedule.\"). Moreover, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs as is required on a motion to dismiss, the most logical conclusion one can draw from the allegations of observations of delays and a general lack of progress is that the ultimate deadline (May 2014 COD) would not be met. But one need not rely on inferences as the Complaint specifically alleges that Defendants were made aware of the consequences of all of the delays. The Complaint alleges that in the June 2012 time-frame during monthly meetings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This gasifier delay lasted from February 2012 until approximately August 2012. Wingo said that as soon as he learned in February 2012 that there were refractory failures on the gasifier, he knew that there was \"no way in hell\" that Southern Company could meet the May 2014 deadline. During 2012, Wingo expressed this view to his supervisor, Brett Wingard, and to other engineers. According to Wingo, Coy Graham, an Assistant Construction Site Manager over the gasifier, wrote a June 2012 email chain including his supervisor, David Empfield, advising that the gasifier component delivery was so critical to the schedule the gasifier delays they were facing would ultimately amount to a six-month delay to the total project schedule.\n   <em>\n    Wingo said that the gasifier delays and their impact on the overall schedule were discussed during this time during monthly production meetings, which Wingo usually attended. John Huggins, who was in charge of Startup at the time, attended these production meetings and would have been aware of the gasifier delays.\n   </em>\n   Ashley Baker (Southern Company) and Aaron Abramowitz (Mississippi Power) also regularly attended these meetings,\n   <em>\n    Wingo said that Mississippi Power Vice President Tommy Anderson occasionally attended these monthly production meetings. Wingo also spoke with Anderson on an almost weekly basis, either over the phone or in person, because Anderson needed to approve all procurement purchases during the late 2011 through 2012 timeframe. Therefore, Anderson would have been well aware of the implications of the gasifier delay.\n   </em>\n   Wingo concluded: \"[W]e lost somewhere between three and six months on the overall schedule and yet even through 2012 when we had a three to six month delay on the gasifier, we did not report a slip in our May 1, 2014 COD. That's when I was pretty certain that we had something terribly wrong with our scheduling.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 61 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration based on the argument that the Court failed to require Plaintiffs to establish scienter with respect to each statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In reaching the conclusion that Plaintiffs pled the requisite level of scienter as to Defendants Day, Anderson and Huggins, the Court viewed all of the allegations and reasonable inferences drawn from those inferences collectively in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, not just the allegations concerning positions, responsibilities, and access to information. No one factor was dispositive and the Court was careful to weigh the fact that there was an absence of insider trading allegations against a finding of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To the extent Defendants are arguing based on the erroneous presumption that the Court relied exclusively on the positions, responsibilities, and access to information allegations, Defendants' argument fails. To the extent Defendants are arguing that the Court found that the positions, responsibilities, and access to information allegations against Defendants Day, Anderson and Huggins are not probative of scienter, this is simply an attempt to restate an argument that Defendants previously made and this Court rejected. Defendants have not shown any clear error of law. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration based on the argument that the Court erred in holding that the positions, responsibilities, and access to information allegations established scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Allegations of Motive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court erred in finding that Plaintiffs' allegations of financial motive were probative of scienter because these allegations are too generalized to establish scienter as to any Defendant and are insufficient without an additional allegation showing a \"concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants.\" Defs.' Recons. Br. at 21-23. This argument was not raised in Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brogdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11219002\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/103/1322/#p1338\">\n    103 F.Supp.2d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
