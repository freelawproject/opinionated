Conclusion...474\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At its core, this case concerns a breakdown in business relations between a large, private university and its dining services vendor, with which it had a multimillion-dollar, long-term contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The case began with Plaintiff SodexoMAGIC, LLC (\"Sodexo\") filing a four-count complaint alleging: (1) fraudulent inducement; (2) breach of contract; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) punitive damages. Since then, Defendant Drexel University (\"Drexel\") asserted two counterclaims against Sodexo for, (1) fraud, and (2) breach of contract, and Sodexo added one supplemental claim to its original allegations (\"Count V\") for breach of contract. Accordingly, there are now five claims alleged against Drexel and two counterclaims alleged against Sodexo. The case has featured various motions to dismiss, motions to compel, attorney-client privilege disputes, and motions for sanctions-among many other motions-which have been extensively litigated and decided by this Court in prior opinions (or held in abeyance pending further developments), and will not be restated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Presently before the Court are four motions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (1) Drexel's Motion to Strike seeks to strike four declarations submitted by Sodexo in support of its Response to Drexel's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. (ECF 208).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (2) Sodexo's Motion to Strike seeks to strike Drexel's Appendix to its Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF 221).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (3) Sodexo's Motion for Summary Judgment seeks a ruling that, as a matter of law, dismisses Counts I and II of Drexel's Counterclaim for fraud and breach of contract, and enters judgment in favor of Sodexo as to Sodexo's Count V. (ECF 200).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (4) Drexel's Motion for Summary Judgment seeks to dismiss all five Counts brought by Sodexo. (ECF 220).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    (A) The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff SodexoMAGIC is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Maryland. (ECF 211 \u00b6 1). SodexoMAGIC is a joint venture between Sodexo Operations, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sodexo, Inc., and Magic Food Provisions, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Magic Johnson Enterprises. (ECF 213, at 1 n. 1). Defendant Drexel University is a Pennsylvania non-profit institution based in Philadelphia. (ECF 211 \u00b6 2). Marriott Management Services Corp., which was subsequently acquired by Sodexo Management, Inc., began providing dining services at Drexel in 1995. (ECF 11 \u00b6 5; ECF 213 \u00b6 18). Dining services generally consisted of managing and operating student and faculty dining halls and retail locations and catering University meetings, events, and functions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (B) The Bid Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On April 18, 2014, Aramark Corp. (\"Aramark\"), a dining services competitor of Sodexo Management, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 211 \u00b6 4), approached Drexel with an unsolicited proposal to provide dining services at Drexel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). The operative contract then in place between Drexel and Sodexo Management, Inc., was not due to expire until 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Nevertheless, following Aramark's proposal, which included an offer to invest $14.5 million in Drexel's campus, Drexel terminated its contract with Sodexo Management, Inc., and began a process of putting their dining services contract out to bid in June, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Drexel's dining services bidding process occurred in two phases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). On June 9, 2014, as part of the first phase, Drexel distributed a Request for Proposal Qualification Overview (also knowledge as a Request for Information, or \"RFI\") to five companies to qualify the firms with the best chance to compete for the contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). The RFI sent to potential bidders asked responding firms, among other things, to \"commit a minimum of $20M over the 10 year agreement with $12M paid up-front.\" (Sodexo SOF, Ex. 9). The RFI estimated the contract value \"to be between $275M and $300M over the term,\" but made clear \"this is strictly an estimate based on past performance and is in no way to be misconstrued as a firm commitment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As part of the second phase, following a determination of which companies responded favorably to the RFI, Drexel distributed a Request for Proposal (\"RFP\") on July 2, 2014 to four companies that remained in contention for the dining services contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Among the four companies remaining in contention were Aramark and SodexoMAGIC. (Drexel SOF, Ex. 3-8). The RFP stated that \"The University's Strategic Plan calls for an\n   enrollment increase from our current number of 26,132 to 30,470 students by 2017 and to 34,000 students by 2021.\" (Sodexo SOF, Ex. 14). The RFP continued, \"[p]roposed programs, facilities and infrastructure of services should be aligned to this plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The RFP made clear that \"traditional meal plans (aka residential, 'all-inclusive,' board plans, etc.) are required for residential freshmen and may be purchased on a voluntary basis by all other students and customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In an appendix to the RFP, Drexel projected the number of dining services participants who would purchase a variety of meal plans, with projections \"based on information available at time of budget submission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 14, at App'x. II). Drexel calculated the estimated number of meal plans based on an assumption of 3,100 students in the freshman class. (Resp. to Sodexo SOF \u00b6 18; Sodexo SOF, Ex. 16 (Email from Drexel representative stating, \"we gave the bidders participant numbers based on a freshman class of 3,100 and the FY budget that was loaded by Finance is based on 2,800.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In a pre-proposal meeting Drexel held separately with Sodexo and other bidders in July, 2014, Drexel informed the prospective bidders via PowerPoint presentation that the University's \"Strategic Growth Plan\" was to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [g]row enrollment commensurate with student demand and academic capacity, initially by adding graduate and transfer students, and then, after a three-year period, gradually growing subsequent undergraduate freshman classes. By 2017, Drexel will increase enrollment from our current number of 23,500 to 30,470 students; by 2021, Drexel will increase to 34,000 students.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Sodexo SOF, Ex. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The PowerPoint presented to the prospective bidders also stated that the \"Strategic Growth Plan\" was to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Grow enrollment commensurate with student demand and academic capacity, initially by adding graduate and transfer students, and then, after a three-year period, gradually growing subsequent undergraduate freshman classes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Sodexo submitted its Initial Proposal for the dining services contract to Drexel on July 25, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 19). Sodexo's Initial Proposal stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The financial terms set forth in this proposal and other obligations assumed by SodexoMAGIC herein are based on conditions in existence on the date SodexoMAGIC commences operations, including, by way of example, Client's attendance history; labor; food and supply expenses; and federal, state and local sales, use and excise taxes. In addition SodexoMAGIC has relied on representations regarding existing and future conditions made by [Drexel] in connection with the negotiation and execution of the proposal. In the event of a change in the conditions or the inaccuracy or breach of, or the failure to fulfill, any representation by [Drexel], the financial terms and other obligations assumed by SodexoMAGIC shall be renegotiated on a mutually agreeable basis to reflect such change, inaccuracy or breach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On August 6, 2014, Drexel asked Sodexo and Aramark to each submit a Best and Final Offer (\"BAFO\"). (Resp. to Sodexo SOF \u00b6 24). On August 8, 2014, Sodexo submitted its BAFO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). On August 12, 2014, Drexel's Campus Dining Selection Committee unanimously selected (9-0) and recommended awarding Sodexo the campus dining contract. (Sodexo SOF Ex. 21). On August 15, 2014, Drexel sent a letter to Sodexo, which stated, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   I am pleased to tell you that SodexoMAGIC has been awarded the campus dining contract. The award includes all financial components of the original SodexoMAGIC proposal submitted as well as all enhancements included in the Best and Final Offer (\"The Proposal\"). Beginning August 25, 2014, Drexel University proposes to reinstate the contract currently in effect and incorporate The Proposal as an amendment while a new agreement is negotiated during a period not to exceed 60 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    (C) Reaching the Terms of the Management Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   From this stage onwards, the principal negotiators of the Management Agreement were, on behalf of Drexel, Rita LaRue, Don Liberati, Stacey Kara, Melissa Brown, and Paula King (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31); and on behalf of Sodexo, Nancy Arnett and Rush Sherman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On September 12, 2014, Sodexo sent to Drexel a first proposal for the terms of the Management Agreement, and then, on September 19, 2014, Sodexo sent to Drexel a first draft of the comprehensive Management Agreement. (Resp. to Sodexo SOF \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33). On September 30, 2014, LaRue (of Drexel) wrote to Sherman (of Sodexo): \"We received the draft master agreement.... I do have to say that there are several inconsistencies and/or omissions from the SodexoMagic proposal and best and final offer that my team is having to check, revise and add....\" (Sodexo SOF, Ex. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   As negotiations proceeded, Arnett (of Sodexo) wrote an internal email to Sodexo listing three \"potential stumbling blocks\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   1. Indemnity ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   2. Meal Plan Rates ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   3. Financial Assumptions: In the RFP and presentations, Drexel provided specific student enrollment goals and suggested that bidders should take these into consideration when preparing a financial proposal. We included these assumptions to act as a trigger for discussion and mutually agreeable modification to the contract in the financial assumptions section-however [LaRue] violently objected to any kind of mention of specific numbers. She expressed that these were goals only and were never intended to be anything that we could count on.... I stressed that the numbers are not included as a guarantee on Drexel's part, but rather a baseline to trigger a conversation. Went over like a lead balloon. We left it that I would ask legal to take another pass at the language and they would see, but she told me that she would not take any type of specific numbers to her leadership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   I think that finance should prepare a cast of numbers at their proposed meal and potentially lower student population rate to better judge the overall [year-over-year] impact of any reductions to Sodexo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Ultimately, the parties agreed to the Management Agreement, the most relevant sections of which are excerpted below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   3.1 Term and Termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. The term of the Agreement is ten (10) years, ten (10) months, and five (5) days [ ] commencing [retrospectively] on August 25, 2014 and continuing until June 30, 2025.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   B. If either party breaches a material provision hereof (\"Cause\"), the non-breaching party shall give the other party notice of such Cause. If the Cause is\n   remedied within ten (10) days in the case of failure to make payment when due or thirty (30) days in the case of any other Cause, the notice shall be null and void. If such Cause is not remedied within the specific period, the party giving notice shall have the right to terminate this Agreement ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   C. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the other party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   8.15 Campus Visits by Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. Mr. Johnson shall appear on [Drexel's] campus (or mutually agreed upon location) as mutually agreed by the parties for up to two (2) 90-minute speaking engagements annually during the term of this Agreement provided that the appearance dates can be mutually agreed upon by the parties. At the time of the request, [Drexel] shall propose a minimum of three (3) dates for consideration and approval subject to Mr. Johnson's availability and provide a proposed agenda for Mr. Johnson's review and consideration. Any such request shall be made a minimum of twelve (12) weeks in advance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   8.17 Measurable Outcomes.

The financial terms set forth in this Agreement and other obligations assumed by SodexoMAGIC hereunder are based on conditions in existence on the date SodexoMAGIC commences operations, including by way of example, [Drexel's] student population; labor, food, and supply costs; and federal, state and local sales, use and excise tax. In addition, each party has relied on representations regarding existing and future conditions and projections made by the other in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement. In the event of a change in the conditions or the inaccuracy or breach of, or the failure to fulfill, any such representation by a party, the financial terms and other obligations assumed by the other party shall be renegotiated on a mutually agreeable basis to reflect such change, inaccuracy or breach. SodexoMAGIC shall submit any requested changes and the cause for such changes to [Drexel], in writing, prior to any negotiations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   9.2 Financial Assumptions. In the interest of a strong and lasting partnership, [Drexel] agrees to review the following items with SodexoMAGIC at the annual meeting in July of each year and discuss any applicable revisions to the Agreement that are mutually agreeable based on any deviations, provided that the relevant data and supporting documentation is submitted to [Drexel] thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting. [Drexel] recognizes that SodexoMAGIC made certain assumptions in preparing the financial package offered in this Agreement and understands that changes to the financial assumptions below may have an adverse economic impact on SodexoMAGIC; in such cases, [Drexel] shall work with SodexoMAGIC in good faith to mutually agree upon solutions in an effort to counter such impact. SodexoMAGIC acknowledges its responsibility to respond quickly and expertly to factors under their control that may affect these outcomes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \u2022 ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \u2022 Parties agree that the University's growth is a critical factor in calculating the Investments afforded under this Agreement and it has been projected by SodexoMAGIC that this growth will realize an increase of 2% per year in the freshman class year over year....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \u2022 ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \u2022 Minimum Catering Net Sales of Three Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,400,000) in full Contract Year 1 (July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016) with projected growth of three percent (3%) annually thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   10.11 Amendments to Agreement.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). A set of \"talking points\" for a Drexel Board of Trustees meeting sent on May 11, 2015 stated that \"[m]uch of what we expected, given changes we've made in our approach to recruiting and enrolling new students, has come to fruition,\" including \"fewer applications,\" and \"fewer offers of admission.\" (Sodexo SOF, Ex. 34). At that point in time, Drexel had \"2,902 deposits for the freshman class,\" which, after \"melt\" (expected declines based on students' changes in circumstances and choice of college) would be expected to yield somewhat fewer freshman enrollees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In fact, that email stated, \"[t]he adjusted budget is predicated on a class of 2,600, but we believe we are likely to do better than that due to lower melt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On June 8, 2015, President Fry of Drexel issued a \"Dear Colleague\" letter disclosing that Drexel would not enroll additional students from the waitlist and that the freshman class would be smaller than in prior years. (Sodexo SOF Ex. 33). The next day, Sodexo employee William Cunningham emailed, among others, LaRue (of Drexel), forwarding President Fry's \"Dear Colleague\" letter and stating, \"[t]he message below looks like there will be budget tightening and less mandatory dining plan customers for next year. Have you gotten any update as to what next year's actual first year student enrollment with [sic] be?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 36). LaRue forwarded the email to Liberati (of Drexel), who responded: \"I guess they were going to find out sooner or later ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). LaRue later responded to Sodexo's original email, stating, \"Currently, there are 2,918 freshmen admitted. It will be less with melt, potentially 2,600-2,700 but the rate of melt is\n   challenging to predict.\" (Drexel SOF Ex. 3-20). Drexel's freshman enrollment for the 2015-2016 academic year was 2,720.

Drexel bases its motion on the\n   \"sham affidavit\" doctrine, asserting that portions of the declarations directly contradict prior deposition testimony which was explicitly adopted as Sodexo's corporate representations. In response, Sodexo contends that the declarations elucidate, rather than contradict, prior testimony: Whereas prior testimony pertained to statements about Drexel being unable to predict future student enrollment, the declarations in question explain that Drexel did not make any statement that it knew enrollment would decline. In its reply, Drexel contends that it had no duty to disclose its knowledge of future enrollment figures, and therefore, because the declarations largely pertain to the extent of Drexel's forthrightness regarding future student enrollment, the entirety of the declarations-rather than any portions thereof-should be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In the Third Circuit, it is well-settled that \"a party may not create a material issue of fact to defeat summary judgment by filing an affidavit disputing his or her own sworn testimony without demonstrating a plausible explanation for the conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Baer v.

In the declarations, Sodexo employees state that \"Drexel employees or representatives never told me or, to my knowledge, anyone at Sodexo or SodexoMAGIC that there was a risk of enrollment decline.\" (ECF 208-1, at 5). Drexel claims that this statement is incompatible with deposition testimony-later adopted by Sodexo's corporate representative-in which a Sodexo employee recalled a Drexel employee saying, in sum and substance, \"nobody could predict what the freshman enrollment would be going forward,\" and \"they didn't know exactly where it [freshman class enrollment] would be.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Court finds that, in this instance, the deposition testimony and the declaration are compatible. While the deposition testimony stands for the proposition that Drexel made statements that it could not predict freshman enrollment, the declarations assert that Drexel never said there was a risk that freshman enrollment would decline. One can imagine two statements, in which the first occurred and the second did not: (1) \"Drexel cannot predict what student enrollment will be next year,\" and (2) \"There is a risk that freshman student enrollment at Drexel will go down next year.\" The first statement speaks to the\n   <em>\n    predictability\n   </em>\n   of freshman enrollment numbers. The second statement speaks to the\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of enrollment decline. It is entirely possible for Drexel to discuss the predictability of freshman enrollment without stating that there is a risk of enrollment decline. To the extent that the two technically overlap, the Court declines to strike the declarations on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In making this ruling, the Court is especially mindful that this motion does not present \"clear and extreme facts,\" which would justify striking the declarations.\n   <em>\n    Videon Chevrolet, Inc. v.

Moreover, to the extent any discrepancy might exist between deposition testimony and declarations, the Court notes that it is not required to disregard the affidavit, but instead may consider its weight in light of any apparent contradiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189286\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/609/#p624\">\n    392 F.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where \"there is a discrepancy between deposition testimony and the deponent's later affidavit, a district court is not required in all cases to disregard the affidavit\");\n   <em>\n    Heasley v.

May 22, 2009) (\"gaps or minor discrepancies in Plaintiff's testimony [ ] bear on her credibility and are matters properly reserved for cross-examination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Drexel also seeks to strike a third declaration, that of Thomas Farabaugh. Drexel bases this portion of its motion on a perceived contradiction between, on one hand, a representation made by Sodexo in its responses and objections to Drexel's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice and, on the other hand, a representation made by Farabaugh in his declaration. In Sodexo's responses and objections, Sodexo stated that it \"hereby identifies the financial model ... as located at SDXMAGIC0003035.\" (ECF 208-1, at 5). In his declaration, Farabaugh referenced the same spreadsheet, stating, among other things, that \"[i]t is not a 'model.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court agrees with Drexel that these representations present an irreconcilable contradiction. Sodexo may not label something a \"financial model,\" only to later submit a declaration stating that it \"is not\n   a model.\" However, the Court will not strike the entirety of the Farabaugh declaration, as urged by Drexel, but instead strike only the words, \"is not a 'model' and\" from the sentence in paragraph 9 of the declaration, leaving the sentence which originally began \"It is not a 'model' and does not distinguish ...\" to begin, \"It does not distinguish ....\" In so doing, the Court removes only the problematic portion of the declaration, consistent with rulings in other Courts in this Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Koken v.

The parties' obligations under\n   section 9.1 are clear, requiring the parties to \"renegotiate on a mutually agreeable basis\" should there be a \"change in the conditions or the inaccuracy or breach of, or the failure to fulfill, any [ ] representation by a party.\" Just as determining compliance with section 9.1 requires reference to outside \"facts\" (i.e., was a representation inaccurate?), so too does determining compliance with any other contractual provision. For example, determining whether a party breaches a confidentiality clause requires proof of an improper communication imparting sensitive information; paying only partial invoice sums requires reference to bank receipts; and breach of a contractual provision requiring passing grades for Health Department inspections requires reference to failed inspections. Although external evidence would be required in each of the above examples to prove the case, that fact does not preclude a contract containing such provisions from being legally integrated, nor does it mean the contract is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   A party can still substantiate its case with evidence where the above situations are presented (in the above examples, for breach of contract).

Here, however, Sodexo's does not seek to introduce parol evidence to resolve any ambiguity in the term \"representations.\" Instead, Sodexo seeks to introduce alleged oral representations by Drexel regarding student enrollment to prove its claim for fraudulent inducement. The purpose for which Sodexo seeks to introduce the parol evidence, therefore, is unrelated to any purported ambiguity, \"latent\" or \"patent,\" contained in the term \"representations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    f) Sodexo's Post-Argument Submission Regarding the Parol Evidence Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In its submission arguing against the application of the parol evidence rule, Sodexo fails to recognize the strength of Pennsylvania precedents holding that fraudulent inducement claims do not provide an escape from the parol evidence rule. Although citing\n   <em>\n    Yocca\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Toy\n   </em>\n   in passing references, Sodexo ignores their holdings, which this Court is bound to follow. Instead, Sodexo relies heavily on a recent, clearly distinguishable, non-precedential decision in this District,\n   <em>\n    Boardakan Rest. LLC v. Gordon Grp. Holdings LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-cv-5676,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204597970\">\n    2015 WL 4597970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. July 31, 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Boardakan\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs allegedly entered into lease agreements with defendant companies for space near a pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The parties entered into the lease agreements during ongoing pier construction, and they specified that the agreements became automatically null and void if the pier did not open on time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs alleged that, after it became apparent that the pier would open later than scheduled, they sought assurances from defendants that the other businesses\n   opening at the pier intended to maintain their leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the complaint in that case, the defendants specifically represented that the other businesses would \"definitely be opening\" at the pier, when in fact they had both already terminated their leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the plaintiffs allegedly entered into amended lease agreements with defendants and invested substantial sums of money on improvements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Sodexo acknowledges Judge Slomsky's decision in\n   <em>\n    Boardakan\n   </em>\n   finding the parol evidence rule inapplicable was premised on the fact that the plaintiffs in that case were not asserting that \"they were promised something different than what was reflected in the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Sodexo contends that its claims should similarly be considered separate-and-apart from the contents of the contract into which they allege they were fraudulently induced. However, Sodexo has persistently pointed this Court to the language of the Management Agreement stating that the \"[p]arties agree that the University's growth is a critical factor in calculating the Investments afforded under this Agreement and it has been projected by SodexoMAGIC that this growth will realize an increase of 2% per year in the freshman class year over year.\" (Sodexo SOF Ex. 1, \u00a7 9.2). Given that Sodexo's fraudulent inducement claim is exclusively premised on allegations that it was misled as to freshman student class sizes, it is clear that Sodexo's claim is based on promises that were partially, and could have been more completely, incorporated into the integrated contract.\n   <em>\n    Boardakan\n   </em>\n   has no relevance to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Also in its submission, Sodexo seeks to distinguish the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's 2004 decision in\n   <em>\n    Yocca\n   </em>\n   , discussed in detail\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which unambiguously reaffirmed the well-settled rule that, unless parol evidence is being offered to explain an ambiguous term, \"[o]nce a writing is determined to be the parties' entire contract ... evidence of any previous oral or written negotiations or agreements involving the same subject matter as the contract\" is inadmissible.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1329385\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/578/479/\">\n    578 Pa. at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1329385,9214675\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/854/425/\">\n    854 A.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sodexo dedicates a mere six lines in a footnote to an attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Yocca\n   </em>\n   on the basis that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Yocca\n   </em>\n   , \"SodexoMAGIC is not attempting to undo or vary any obligations set out in the Agreement.\" (ECF 245, at 7 n. 5). Given that the Management Agreement is, according to Sodexo, the source of a contractual duty to renegotiate in the event that freshman student enrollment does not grow by 2% annually, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sodexo SOF Ex. 1, \u00a7 9.2), this Court is unable to reconcile Sodexo's post-argument submission with its prior briefing. Stated bluntly, Sodexo fails to meaningfully distinguish\n   <em>\n    Yocca\n   </em>\n   's holding, which specifically controls the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Then, in footnote # 4 of its submission, Sodexo suggests that there is a \"second prong\" of the parol evidence rule which \"concerns whether the [parol] evidence contradicts the agreement's terms or creates a new contractual obligation.\" (ECF 245, at 5 n. 4). While Sodexo may be correct that parol evidence is barred where it constitutes the same subject matter as the integrated contract,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    HCB Contractors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"474192\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/539/395/\">\n    539 Pa. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"474192,7881878\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/652/1278/\">\n    652 A.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Sodexo itself acknowledges that the \"same subject matter\" inquiry has, in the past, involved scenarios in which the representations forming the basis for fraud were related to, and not necessarily specifically dealt with, in the parties' integrated contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gianni\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1086994\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/281/320/\">\n    281 Pa. at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.%20791\">\n    126 A. 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same subject matter where representation was that shop owner would have exclusive right to sell soda in the building, but the lease did not include that obligation even though the contract designated\n   what the shop owner could sell in the building).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Sodexo's final argument in favor of allowing its fraudulent inducement claim to succeed is that \"Pennsylvania has a strong interest in holding fraudsters accountable for their conduct and resulting injury.\" (ECF 245, at 9). Sodexo cites to\n   <em>\n    Toy\n   </em>\n   for this contention, although it is of course self-evident that Pennsylvania has an interest in curtailing fraud.

Both cases permitted potentially duplicative claims to go forward because, in the absence of a sufficient factual record to determine whether the tort or contract claim predominated the complaint, they could proceed \"in the alternative.\" Here, after substantial discovery and motion practice, it has become abundantly clear that the thrust of this case revolves around claims grounded in the parties' Management Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Thus, the Court will also, or alternatively, grant Drexel's Motion for Summary Judgment and dismiss Count I of Sodexo's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Clear and Convincing Evidence of Misrepresentations or Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Drexel asserts that a third ground precludes Sodexo from pursuing its fraudulent inducement claim, namely, that Sodexo has failed to present clear and convincing evidence of any misrepresentations made by Drexel during the time period preceding the execution of the Management Agreement. On this narrow point, the Court disagrees. When viewed in a light most favorable to Sodexo, the evidence it has presented could reasonably be seen as clear and convincing indications that Drexel misrepresented its freshman student enrollment. Specifically, the Court looks to three declarations attached to Sodexo's Statement of Undisputed Facts in Opposition to Drexel's Motion for Summary\n   Judgment (ECF 213, Ex. 70, 71, and 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   All three declarations, submitted by Sodexo employees Nancy Arnett, Rush Sherman, and Leonard Riccio, stated that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   during the RFP process and throughout contract negotiations, Rita LaRue repeatedly represented to me and other representatives of SodexoMAGIC that freshman enrollment would continue to grow over the ten-year life of the contract, or at the very least, enrollment would stay flat for the first three years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   (Ex. 93 \u00b6 9; Ex. 70 \u00b6 23; Ex. 71 \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that its conclusion regarding the issue of \"misrepresentations or omissions\" is inconsequential to its overall finding as to Count I, which, based on the gist of the action doctrine and the parol evidence rule, must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    (C) Drexel's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Sodexo Count II (Breach of Contract)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Count II of Sodexo's complaint alleges that Drexel breached \u00a7 9.2 of the Management Agreement by failing to renegotiate the Management Agreement in good faith. The Agreement provided that, in the event that any of the information on which Sodexo relied in forming a contract with Drexel was inaccurate, then Drexel would renegotiate in good faith to correct the inaccuracy and come to a mutually agreed-upon solution. Sodexo claims, however, that Drexel insisted on commercially unreasonable terms that wouldn't allow Sodexo to make any profit, demonstrating Drexel's lack of good faith. As a result of this alleged breach, Sodexo again alleges that it suffered millions of dollars of damages, including liabilities incurred and lost profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Drexel's Motion and Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Drexel argues that Sodexo cannot use the good-faith provision to impose liability on Drexel for provisions that it adamantly rejected. Drexel also asserts that the good-faith provision did not specify any basis by which to measure bad faith, and Sodexo cannot use this provision to force Drexel to terms that are not mutually agreeable. Additionally, Drexel asserts that there is no evidence of bad faith because Drexel made an offer that included various concessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Sodexo's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Sodexo asserts that the good-faith provision is enforceable because the term fulfills the meeting of the minds, definitive terms, and consideration requirements. Sodexo argues that Drexel breached the good faith provision during renegotiations by obscuring enrollment numbers, reneging on agreed-upon terms, and pursuing a contract with Sodexo's competitor Aramark during renegotiations. Sodexo argues that bad faith is a question of fact inappropriate for resolution at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   [Drexel] recognizes that SodexoMAGIC made certain assumptions in preparing the financial package offered in this Agreement and understands that changes to the financial assumptions below may have an adverse economic impact on SodexoMAGIC; in such cases [Drexel] shall work with SodexoMAGIC in good faith to mutually agree upon solutions in an effort to counter such impact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n   \u2022 [University] growth will realize an increase of 2% per year in the freshman class year over year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   \u2022 Minimum Catering Net Sales of [$3,400,000] in full Contract Year 1 ... with projected growth of three percent (3%) annually thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Good faith provisions can be implicit (i.e., parties to a contract must act in good faith, without anything written into the contract) or explicit (e.g., parties to a contract can write that they will act in good faith to renegotiate a resolution if interest rates rise beyond a certain point). Here, Sodexo argues that Section 9.2 operates as an explicit good faith provision, which was triggered when Sodexo's projection-that freshman student enrollment would grow by 2% each year-turned out to be incorrect. However, Sodexo urges the Court to borrow the standard for good faith claims from an implied good faith case,\n   <em>\n    Somers v.

Under Pennsylvania law, \"the test for enforceability of an agreement is whether both parties have manifested an intention to be bound by its terms and whether the terms are sufficiently definite to be specifically enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Channel Home Centers, Div. of Grace Retail Corp. v.

Considering the substance of the claim, Drexel argues that it should still fail because Sodexo cannot prove the requisite meeting of the minds to form the basis of a contract. The alleged contract regarding increased daily board rates and reduced commissions draws from correspondence in September 2016. Drexel asserts that Sodexo's response expressed its intention to terminate for cause effective immediately, without mention of Drexel's initial offer. Drexel argues that this does not constitute acceptance of an offer and cannot form the basis of a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Additionally, Drexel contends that there was no consideration for the alleged contract formed in September 2016. Sodexo continued providing dining services on campus for the remainder of the semester, stating that it did so because the company does not abandon students in the middle of a term. Sodexo, however, was still obligated to provide dining services for 60 days after Drexel's notice of termination under the Management Agreement. Sodexo cannot claim to have a new contract formed based on the September 2016 correspondence when it was already legally obligated to provide dining services by the terms of the Management Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Sodexo's Response to Drexel's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Sodexo disagrees with Drexel's characterization of the communication between the two companies in September 2016. Sodexo argues that Drexel's letter, dated September 19, constituted an offer which Sodexo accepted by both its conduct and by its reply letter dated September 26. Sodexo argues that it is irrelevant whether the reply letter stated that Sodexo does not abandon its students. Additionally, Sodexo asserts that it was only required to stay on campus for 60 days after Drexel's termination notice, i.e. only until November 19, 2016, but instead remained on campus until December 10, 2016 in consideration for adjusted daily rates and commissions. Therefore, Sodexo argues, it is entitled to the agree-upon compensation calculated at the increased daily rates and decreased commissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Briefing with Respect to Sodexo's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Sodexo's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Sodexo Count V (Breach of Contract)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Sodexo also seeks summary judgment on Count V (breach of contract). Sodexo asserts that it accepted Drexel's offer of modified terms concerning the increased board rate and the decreased commission in a letter dated September 26, 2016. As to the remaining damages associated with the breach of contract claim, Sodexo asserts that the deposition testimony of Rita LaRue indicates Drexel's admission that it owes these costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Drexel's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Concerning the daily board rates and reduced commission, Drexel reiterates that Sodexo never made a demand for relief on this claim; that no contract was formed because Sodexo rejected Drexel's September 19 offer by Sodexo's September 26 letter and subsequent suit; and that Sodexo provided no consideration for the alleged contract because Sodexo was already\n   obligated to remain on campus for at least 60 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Concerning outstanding contractual interest, Drexel argues that Sodexo is not entitled to summary judgment because Sodexo has not produced evidence showing that the alleged late fees are connected to any invoice that Drexel received. Further, Drexel asserts that the invoices were inaccurately calculated using rates other than those agreed upon, and that Sodexo failed to provide the required itemizations and back-up. Drexel asserts that these are disputed issues of material fact that cannot be determined on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Concerning the student labor wages, the inventory invoices, and the dining dollars, Drexel asserts that Sodexo actually owes Drexel for rolled-over dining dollars, and that the amount Drexel allegedly owes is dwarfed by the amount that Sodexo owes Drexel due to Sodexo's own breaches. Thus, Drexel argues that summary judgment cannot be granted to Sodexo on these claims while the net amount owed is yet undetermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Concerning attorneys' fees, Drexel asserts that Sodexo is not entitled to attorneys' fees, and certainly not on summary judgment, because section 10.12 of the Management Agreement indicates that such costs may only be recovered in a collections action or when enforcing an indemnity obligation. As this suit falls into neither category, Drexel asserts that Sodexo is not entitled to these fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Analysis of Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment as to Sodexo Count V (Breach of Contract)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   This breach of contract claim involves alleged breaches of both the Management Agreement and a later alleged agreement formed in September 2016 (the \"2016 Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   The Court begins by analyzing the alleged 2016 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   <strong>\n    a) The Alleged 2016 Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   The only two documents that inform the alleged 2016 Agreement are: (1) a letter dated September 19, 2016 from Drexel's legal counsel to Sodexo's legal counsel (ECF 130-1, \"Def. 9/19 Letter\"); and (2) Sodexo's counsel's response letter on September 26, 2016.

To meet this obligation, Drexel must have some reasonable degree of certainty about the future of its food service operations, which are a crucial component of the world-class student experience Drexel works to provide very day. Drexel certainly cannot meet its obligations to its students while laboring under an ongoing threat that its food service provider of over 20 years will cease operations on a mere 10 days' notice, in the middle of a term, based on a fabricated legal theory. Rather, Drexel must attempt to control its future and to create certainty. Accordingly, and regretfully, Drexel hereby exercises its right to termination for convenience under Section 3.1.C, effective December 10, 2016.

However, in a further extension of good faith, and provided [Sodexo] performs the services under the Agreement through December 10, 2016, Drexel will pay [Sodexo] an increased daily rate of $22.44 (for the all-inclusive plans) and accept a reduced commission of 7.75% for the period between today's date and December 10, 2016, and will forego any additional capital investment otherwise due under the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Sodexo's response letter, sent on September 26, 2016, is excerpted below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-311\">\n   I write regarding Sodexo's July 25, 2016 Notice of Default to Drexel for failure to pay amounts due under the Agreement.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. 9/19 Letter, at 2). Drexel noted that, though it was only required to give 60 days' notice, it was providing more as a part of its continuing good faith toward Sodexo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Drexel clarified that it\n   expects Sodexo to fully comply with its obligations, but went on to say that, \"in a further extension of good faith, and provided [Sodexo] performs the services under the Agreement through December 10, 2016, Drexel will pay [Sodexo] an increased daily rate of $22.44 ... and accept a reduced commission of 7.75% for the period between today's date and December 10, 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sodexo's response did not conclusively indicate an agreement of those terms, noting that while Drexel \"purports\" to terminate for convenience, Sodexo exercised its \"right to terminate the Agreement for Cause effective at the end of today.\" (Pla. 9/26 Letter). Sodexo stated that it would \"[agree] to remain on campus through December 10, 2016\" because it \"does not leave students in mid-term.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sodexo's letter mentions nothing of the rate modifications that Drexel offered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The words of Sodexo's response, particularly the assertion that Sodexo was terminating for cause effective at the end of the day, would indicate that Sodexo did not accept the terms of Drexel's initial offer. Therefore, this alleged \"agreement\" lacked the requisite meeting of the minds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   As to whether Sodexo's September 26 letter terminated the existing contract \"for cause\" while simultaneously accepting Drexel's offer to stay on campus until December 10, the Court notes that Sodexo's letter was transmitted at a time that termination was not yet finalized. In fact, Sodexo itself wrote that it \"intend[s] to end the cure period at the close of business ... effective at the end of today.\" (Pla. 9/26 Letter). Thus, even under Sodexo's understanding of events, Drexel still had the right to \"cure\" any alleged deficiencies that created the \"Cause\" for which Sodexo terminated the Management Agreement. Had Drexel effectuated a \"cure,\" such as, assuming Sodexo thought it sufficient, by waiving all capital investment requirements, the Management Agreement would have continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   There was no meeting of the minds as to the terms which Drexel proposed in its September 19 letter for Sodexo's rates and commissions. Sodexo may not accept some terms, reject others, and then assert that an agreement conclusively existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Consideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Further, even if the court were to find that the correspondence indicates a meeting of the minds, the letters exchanged between the parties in September, 2016 do not create a legally enforceable contract because there was no consideration given for the changed terms. To form a contract, \"it is axiomatic that the performance of an act which one party is legally bound to render to the other party is not legal consideration,\" \"for if a person gets nothing in return for his promise but that to which he is already legally entitled, the consideration is unreal.\"\n   <em>\n    Chatham Communications v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. 9/19 Letter, at 2; ECF 202-5, \"Man. Ag.\"). The termination-for-convenience provision that Drexel invoked requires 60 days' notice under section 3.1.C of the Management Agreement (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Man. Ag., at 5); Drexel gave over 80 days' notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. 9/19 Letter, at 2). Sodexo responded by invoking section 3.1.B, the termination-for-cause provision, based on Drexel's failure to make payments allegedly due under the Management Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pla. 9/26 Letter; Man. Ag., at 4). The termination-for-cause provision requires the non-breaching party to give notice of a failure to make payments and provide a 10-day\n   cure period, which can be extended upon a showing of good faith efforts by the breaching party. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Man. Ag., at 4). Sodexo alleged that the cure period had already extended beyond 10 days, and that the company was entitled to terminate the Agreement effective that day, September 26, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pla. 9/26 Letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   If the court had found that the September letters reflected a meeting of the minds, Sodexo would have\n   <em>\n    unequivocally\n   </em>\n   agreed to the terms of Drexel's offer, including the requirements under 3.1.C that the non-terminating party fulfills its obligations under the Agreement until, at the very least, the end of sixty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware River Pres.

Problematically, Sodexo already had a pre-existing legal obligation under the Agreement to remain on campus for the duration of the Agreement; thus, the services that Sodexo provided from September 19, 2016 until the end of the term cannot constitute consideration to support a new contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Commonwealth Trust Co. of Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"472120\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/357/349/#p354\">\n    357 Pa. at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20A.2d%20649\">\n    54 A.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Sodexo stayed on campus of its own accord, and cannot demand payment under terms beyond those legally agreed-upon in the Management Agreement. By asserting that the \"termination for cause\" provision had been triggered, Sodexo failed to accept all terms of Drexel's offer. Then, when it chose to stay at Drexel through December 10, 2016 (despite, according to its own letter, terminating for cause), Sodexo fulfilled its pre-existing legal obligation to provide dining services to Drexel students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   To the extent Sodexo's Count V relies on the existence of a contract alleged to have been formed through the September 2016 correspondence, it will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   The Court now turns to the additional claims in Sodexo Count V that are premised on alleged breaches of the Management Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Sodexo Count V Continued: Claims Based on the Management Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Sodexo alleges that it is owed, due to Drexel's breaches of the Management Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-328\">\n   (1) student labor wages totaling $7,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-329\">\n   (2) inventory invoice expenses totaling $76,945.81;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n   (3) dining dollars totaling approximately $75,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n   (4) outstanding contractual interest (i.e., late fees) totaling $407,625.16; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n   (5) attorneys' fees and court costs, the total of which is yet to be determined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   With respect to items (1) and (2) above, Drexel has admitted that it owes Sodexo for student labor wages and inventory invoice expenses. Sodexo will be granted summary judgment on those portions of Count V. (Drexel Resp. to Sodexo SOF \u00b6\u00b6 95-96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   With respect to item (3) above, dining dollars rollover, Sodexo claims that Drexel admitted it owes Sodexo $75,000. Drexel denies this characterization, citing to the relevant deposition testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 97). Having reviewed the transcript, the Court will not grant summary judgment as to dining dollars, because the testimony was not conclusive on this item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   With respect to item (4) above, there are various disputed facts regarding contractual interest, such that this portion of Count V cannot be resolved at this juncture. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Item (5) pertains to attorneys' fees, and more specifically, \u00a7 10.12 of the Management Agreement, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-337\">\n   10.12 Collection Costs and Costs to Enforce Indemnity Obligations. The parties shall pay each other the reasonable\n   collection expenses, attorneys' fees and court costs incurred in collecting from each other any amount not paid when due, and/or in connection with the enforcement of an indemnity obligation of a party under this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   (Sodexo SOF Ex. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Drexel contends that the language of \u00a7 10.12 only provides for fees in collections actions or when enforcing indemnity obligations. This is contrary to the plain language of the contract. Sodexo's claims, some of which have prevailed at summary judgment as described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , involved expenses \"incurred in collecting\" amounts that Drexel has admitted it owed Sodexo. Thus, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   Drexel also contends that the amount it owes Sodexo is offset by the amount that Sodexo owes Drexel, and therefore, that Drexel should not be liable for attorney's fees. Because this case remains ongoing, and the amounts justifiably owed to each party remain disputed, the Court will not grant summary judgment as to the attorney's fees provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   <strong>\n    (E) Drexel's Claims against Sodexo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Fraudulent Inducement (Drexel Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   Count I of Drexel's counterclaim alleges that Sodexo fraudulently induced Drexel into awarding it the dining services contract (which then materialized by way of the Management Agreement). By presenting a Best and Final Offer indicating that Sodexo could outperform Aramark, Drexel contends that Sodexo misrepresented its ability and intention to actually perform the contract. Drexel asserts that Sodexo knew of its inability to perform, and entered the contract in order to keep its large account with Drexel, with a hidden plan to renegotiate the terms at a later time by demanding substantial concessions. Drexel claims damages exceeding $1 million arising from the transition costs from Sodexo to Aramark; the loss of contracted-for investment money due to the breach of the Sodexo contract and Drexel's weakened bargaining power with Aramark; and the costs of litigating this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Sodexo's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Procedurally, Sodexo asserts that Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations governing common law fraud bars Count I. Even if the court allowed the amended counterclaim to relate back to the original filing date on January 27, 2017, Drexel asserts that the alleged fraud took place and should have been discovered before January 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Substantively, Sodexo first argues that Count I should be dismissed because the alleged fraud dealt with\n   <em>\n    awarding\n   </em>\n   the dining services contract to Sodexo, which was not itself a contract. Rather, it was a preliminary agreement pending further negotiations, which Sodexo argues cannot support a claim of fraudulent inducement into a contract. Second, Sodexo asserts that Count I fails because Drexel cannot establish the essential elements of fraudulent inducement, including justified reliance and the actual falsity of alleged misrepresentations. Third, Sodexo argues that this claim is barred by the gist of the action doctrine and, fourth, that it is precluded due to Drexel's failure to provide its Statement of Damages in accordance with the requirements set by the court in October 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Drexel's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   Drexel responds to Sodexo's procedural argument by asserting that both the discovery rule and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolled the statute of limitations until April 28, 2017. At that point, Drexel asserts that it learned through Sodexo's initial document production that Sodexo never intended to fulfill the promises in its Initial Proposal or its Best and Final Offer, and that Sodexo knew Drexel's growth plans would not increase the freshmen\n   class until 2017. Additionally, Drexel notes that it had no reason to believe Sodexo was falsely representing its understanding of the student growth plan or that Sodexo had lied at any point in their twenty-year relationship. Drexel asserts that Sodexo's actions to actively conceal its fraudulent misrepresentations preclude Sodexo from invoking the statute of limitations as a defense. Drexel contends there is no basis to conclude as a matter of law that Drexel knew or should have known about Sodexo's fraudulent actions before April 28, 2017, and therefore, Drexel timely filed its amended counterclaim within the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Drexel further argues that Sodexo has distorted Drexel's claim by focusing on whether the award of the dining services contract is itself a contract. Drexel contends that it justifiably relied on Sodexo's misrepresentations in awarding Sodexo, as opposed to Aramark, the dining services contract and in negotiating with Sodexo until September, 2016. Drexel claims it was unable to negotiate with Aramark to receive the same terms put forth in Aramark's Initial Proposal and Best and Final Offer, and Drexel seeks to recover the difference between Aramark's Best and Final Offer and the contract that was ultimately executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   Moreover, Drexel argues that its reliance on Sodexo's false statements was wholly justified. Drexel asserts that, while Sodexo knew of the decreasing freshmen enrollment, Drexel could not have known that Sodexo's representations of misunderstanding were false; thus, it cannot be determined as a matter of law that Drexel's reliance was unjustified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Drexel also contends that the gist of the action doctrine does not bar its fraud claim because it is not seeking the benefit of commitments made in the Management Agreement. Rather, Drexel seeks to recover reliance damages caused by Sodexo's false claims during the bidding process which induced Drexel to award Sodexo, rather than Aramark, the dining services contract. Further, Drexel claims, the gist of the action doctrine does not bar fraud claims based on false promises to continue a relationship. Drexel asserts that the gist of the action doctrine bars Sodexo's fraud claim, but not Drexel's, because, while Sodexo's claim concerns student growth requirements-which were thoroughly negotiated and explicitly written into the contract-Drexel's claim concerns Sodexo's misrepresentation that it had misunderstood the student growth plan, and is thus based on Sodexo's Initial Proposal and Best and Final Offer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the parol evidence rule serves as a bar to fraudulent inducement claims in Pennsylvania. Drexel claims that it was harmed by awarding Sodexo the dining services contract, but no firm commitment to Sodexo was made until the Management Agreement materialized. Because the actual harm to Drexel occurred with the signing of the Management Agreement, which as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   is fully integrated and unambiguous, any representations made in the Best and Final Offer, or otherwise occurring prior to the Management Agreement, are barred from this Court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Moreover, the \"gist of the action\" doctrine serves as a further bar to Drexel's fraudulent inducement claim. Also discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in great detail, the gist of the action doctrine bars fraud claims where the alleged liability \"stems from a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    eToll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311676\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/811/10/#p19\">\n    811 A.2d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The liability Drexel alleges is clearly derived from the fact that the parties entered into the\n   Management Agreement on terms that were \"worse\" for Drexel than the Best and Final Offers made by Sodexo and Aramark. Thus, this case also fits within the realm of cases where the \"gist of the action\" doctrine barred a fraud claim because the liability alleged as part of the fraud claim arose from a contractual obligation and/or breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311676\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/811/10/#p19\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Count I of Drexel's counterclaims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   <strong>\n    (F) Breach of Contract (Drexel Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Count II of Drexel's counterclaim alleges that Sodexo breached various provisions in the Management Agreement by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   (1) Failing to fill the Key Management Positions of Executive Chef and Retail General Manager within the 120-day limit as set by \u00a7 4.8(D) of the Management Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-359\">\n   (2) Failing to provide $230,000 in monetary support as laid out in \u00a7\u00a7 8.8-8.14;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-360\">\n   (3) Failing to secure any appearances by Mr. Johnson in Fiscal Year 2015 and only one appearance in Fiscal Year 2016, violating \u00a7 8.15; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   (4) Failing to provide Drexel with KPI compliance data, pursuant to \u00a7 8.17, during the approximately 18 months of the Agreement, which Drexel additionally suspects Sodexo failed to meet entirely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   Each allegation is addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Breach of Key Management Positions Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   The first part of Drexel's breach of contract claim is that Sodexo failed to fill key management positions within the 120-day limit, as required by \u00a7 4.8(D) of the Management Agreement, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-365\">\n   For any key management position that remains vacant beyond one hundred and twenty (120) days ...

To start, Drexel argues that it did not frustrate Sodexo's ability to fill the positions; it provided feedback but did not have veto power over the positions left empty. Further, Sodexo's claim regarding the lack of actual damages fails because the breached provision set liquidated damages in advance as a reasonable approximation of the expected loss, which could not be determined at the time the contract was signed. The fact that Sodexo filled other positions, Drexel argues, should not be considered when determining Sodexo's breach of this particular liquidated-damages provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   The Court concludes that there remain factual disputes regarding this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   While Sodexo is correct that a party to a contract may not frustrate its counterparty's ability to comply with any contractual provision,\n   <em>\n    Benchmark Grp., Inc. v.
