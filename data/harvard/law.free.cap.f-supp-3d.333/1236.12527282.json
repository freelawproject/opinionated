The New Mexico State Game Commission (\"Commission\") has ultimate authority to adopt such hunting and trapping regulations. N.M.A.C. \u00a7 19.31.11.3. In 2016, Defendants authorized recreational trapping and snaring for cougars on state trust land and private deeded lands throughout the state, making New Mexico the only state that authorizes the recreational trapping and snaring of cougars. (Hereinafter, the rules and regulations relating to the trapping and snaring of cougars will be referred to as the \"Cougar Rule\"). Plaintiffs allege the adoption of the Cougar Rule threatens Mexican wolves and that it will cause cougar trappers to trap and snare Mexican wolves without due care because it is impossible to modify cougar traps to avoid harming wolves. Plaintiffs contend that because the state has licensed the trapping activity, it is liable for the conduct of the trappers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Parties anticipate that this case can be resolved at the summary judgment stage, based on their cross-motions.

Plaintiffs emphasize the broad scope of activities included in the ESA's definition of \"take,\" arguing that even if no wolf has been caught in traps set for cougars, Defendants' conduct still constitutes\n   a take because it is an \"attempt\" at a \"take.\" However, an \"attempt to take\" implies an intent that is directed at wolves and would not include those instances where wolves may be caught in traps that were meant for cougars. There is no evidence in this case of any specific intent to trap Mexican wolves, and so the Court finds the use of \"attempt\" inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The FWS has promulgated a rule applying the ESA \u00a7 9 take prohibition to all threatened species, subject to certain exceptions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017.31\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 17.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17.40 - 17.48.

Special rules have been promulgated relating to experimental populations, such as the Mexican wolf population, which provide an exception to \u00a7 9's take prohibition under the ESA. One of these rules is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n    50 CFR \u00a7 17.84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) which addresses \"unavoidable and unintentional take.\" The regulation states that a violation of the ESA does not occur when take is incidental to a legal activity and is not a result of negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and when due care was exercised to avoid the taking. In a fairly recent unpublished District of New Mexico case, the court contrasted the taking of an animal under the special rules applied to experimental populations, with taking of an animal on the endangered species list:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Under the special rules applied to experimental populations, the taking of a wolf with a trap or other type of capture device within occupied wolf range would not be considered unavoidable, accidental, or unintentional, but no violation occurs if \"due care was exercised to avoid taking a wolf.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a trapper engaged in lawful trapping of furbearer animals, who was careful and sought to avoid capturing a wolf, would not violate the law. In contrast, under the \u00a7 9 prohibition on taking, it matters not if a trapper exercised due care to avoid taking a listed animal. Any taking of a listed animal under \u00a7 9 is a violation of law, and indeed, ESA \u00a7 9 does not contemplate any type of trapping of a threatened or endangered species that is not an experimental population.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians v.

The extent to which cougar trapping in New Mexico is authorized is limited in a number of other respects. For example, trapping is only permitted on certain lands, N.M. Admin.

Count III was dismissed by the Court on standing grounds, Doc. 28 at 28-29, and so the only remaining claims for relief are Counts I and II which allege take of Mexican wolves. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to bar Defendants from implementing those parts of the Cougar Rule that authorize cougar trapping or snaring, and specifically preventing the Department from authorizing the opening of a cougar trapping and snaring season. The Court recently denied Defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P.12(c) and found that Plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that the regulations that authorize cougar trapping by state-licensed trappers increase the risk of harm to Mexican wolves.

N.M. Admin. Code \u00a7 19.32.2.10. Pltffs' Fact 5.

L &amp; O (traps available for purchase generally).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based solely on his own review of the regulation, and without any other evidentiary support, Mr. Niemeyer stated that traps with jaw spreads that exceed 7 inches may be used for trapping cougars, and that these traps would meet the New Mexico trapping regulation requirements \"because their jaws are not laminated.\" Doc. 89, \u00b6 15. At the hearing, the Court questioned the basis for Plaintiffs' reading of the rule because it just did not make sense to prohibit the use of smaller laminated traps while allowing larger nonlaminated ones. In his Declaration, Mr. Griego stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The intent of the rule, as well as how it has historically been enforced, is that even if one or both of the jaws are laminated, the outside jaw spread cannot exceed seven (7) inches. If the inside jaw spread is greater than five and one-half (5.5) inches, the trap jaws shall be offset or padded. The maximum outside jaw spread size of seven (7) inches includes any possible lamination. Therefore, all traps which have an outside jaw spread greater than seven (7) inches are not legal in New Mexico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Griego Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 6-7 (citing N.M. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.32.2.10(B)(2) ). The Court clarified this issue at the hearing, where defense counsel explained that laminated traps were \"more humane,\" and meant to trap rather than kill, but the rule ensures that the thickness of the lamination is taken into account and included in the total size of the jaw so that larger traps are not used simply by disregarding the width of the lamination. Based on the Court's reading of this administrative code provision and the other evidence on this point presented at the hearing, the Court is convinced that Plaintiffs' gloss of the provision is incorrect and that Defendants' reading of the rule is more in line with the purpose behind the administrative code. The only reasonable interpretation of the provision is that the New Mexico Administrative Code (and by extension, the Cougar Rule) does not allow use of foot-hold traps that are larger than 7 inches in diameter, taking into account the thickness of lamination. The Court therefore considers Plaintiffs' Facts 5 and 8 to be disputed as well as unsupported by evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs can neither establish standing nor succeed on the merits because since the Cougar Rule took effect, there is no evidence that a single Mexican gray wolf has been caught in a trap set for cougars. Further, since the Cougar Rule took effect, there are only two instances of a Mexican gray wolf being caught in any trap and in both instances, the traps were set for coyotes. Defendants also point out that even prior to the effective date of the Cougar Rule, there is no record of a Mexican gray wolf\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   being caught in a trap set for cougars. Plaintiffs respond that a one-year season provides insufficient statistical evidence that wolves will not be caught in cougar traps; and that because there is no way to modify these traps to minimize or avoid capturing wolves, Mexican gray wolves will be harmed by the Cougar Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standing (Injury-In-Fact)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to establish injury-in-fact as part of the requirements for standing. For standing purposes, a plaintiff must meet three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury-in-fact\" that is both: (a) \"concrete and particularized\"; and (b) \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

However, as it turns out, the standard for showing an injury-in-fact for a standing analysis mirrors the inquiry used later on the merits question when determining whether Plaintiffs have shown the existence of the \"harm\" required for injunctive relief.

Defendants' position is that there is no evidence that Mexican gray wolves will be caught in traps set for cougars, since available records indicate that not a single Mexican gray wolf was caught in a trap set for cougars since the Cougar Rule went into effect two years ago. Plaintiffs contend that illegal take of wolves in cougar traps is unavoidable, since the traps are set in areas where Mexican wolves range and these traps will illegally take wolves who step in them. Plaintiffs describe the injuries resulting from Mexican wolves getting caught in traps:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 Wolves caught in traps or snares may get also deadly capture myopathies.

They also argue that prior to the Cougar Rule, trappers would have had no reason to use the larger traps when hunting smaller furbearers. However, at the hearing, Defendants emphasized that the Cougar Rule did not change the size of traps allowed for cougar hunting. Larger traps (although under 7 inches) were previously allowed for cougar trapping. The Rule opened up certain land areas to cougar trapping, such as state trust land and private deeded land, and this essentially allows recreational trapping of cougars which was not allowed prior to the Cougar Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiffs cite to studies from FWS documents obtained via a FOIA request (\"Freedom of Information Act,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and which catalog prior known incidents where Mexican wolves were accidentally caught in traps set by private parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.

Plaintiffs have not offered any evidence challenging the fact that no wolves were caught in traps set for cougars, and this fact remains undisputed. Defendants also note that the traps used in the Logan study were larger than seven inches and thus illegal for licensed trapping in New Mexico-which makes the Logan study immaterial and irrelevant. Finally, Defendants observe that many of the studies cited by Plaintiffs are older studies (see N.

Defendants' evidence here pointedly controverts Plaintiffs' statements that trappers are not required to take any measures to minimize or avoid the risk of injury to Mexican wolves and that no measures can be taken to set traps in a way that would be highly selective to cougars but not as likely to catch a wolf or other non-target species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Habitat Differences in Reducing Risk to Mexican Gray Wolves\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that harm to Mexican gray wolves is nearly inevitable because of the overlap in location and habitat preferences between wolves and cougars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hopkins Decl. (Doc. 94), \u00b6 7. They argue that the Cougar Rule authorizes trapping in areas where wolves and cougars live and range and harm to wolves is inevitable because of this overlap.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dec. (Doc. 96), \u00b6 10 (declarant stating that she photographed a wolf \"in the same area\" where she has seen signs of cougars); Gray Decl. (Doc. 93), \u00b6\u00b6 5-8 (seeing a line of wolf tracks on a forest service road in an area where declarant saw a cougar). At the same time, however, Plaintiffs abandon the \"overlap\" theory by arguing that virtually all cougar trapping-including the Bighorn Sheep program-occurs outside wolf range, thus minimizing the significance of any data resulting from the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   As mentioned earlier, it is undisputed that the land open to cougar trapping overlaps with MWEPA. Much of the land classified by the Defendants as prime cougar habitat within New Mexico also lies within key Mexican gray wolf habitat within the MWEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 99-2 (Goldstein Decl., Reply), \u00b6 7 (parts of bighorn sheep range are within the MWEPA and are located in occupied wolf range). Plaintiffs' claim that most cougar trapping occurs outside wolf territory is not supported by the evidence, as the counties involved in the program are located within the MWEPA and within wolf territory. Doc. 97-9 at 2 (program inter-agency documents listing counties involved in the program, such as Catron, Dona Ana, Grant and Hidalgo); Goldstein Decl., Doc. 99-2 (Reply), \u00b6 6 (describing these counties as lying within the MWEPA); Doc. 99-2, \u00b6 7 (parts of bighorn sheep range are within the MWEPA and is occupied wolf range). The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs' arguments are internally inconsistent. If habitats overlap geographically (and they do), then the Bighorn Sheep Restoration Project was conducted in areas within wolf range, and the data collected from the program over the last 15 years is both relevant and material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Defendants offer persuasive evidence that despite the habitat overlap, an understanding of habitat use can help eliminate the likelihood that Mexican wolves would be caught in non-target traps and snares. Species behave differently:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Differences in behavioral characteristics between cougars and wolves (and how these animals use the landscape differently) make it unlikely that a trap set for cougar would catch a wolf. Reply Goldstein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \u2022 Different animal species use the landscape in different ways and have different behavioral characteristics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Frequently, closely related species (such coyotes and wolves) use the landscape and behave in ways that are more similar than more distantly related species (such as cougars and wolves) despite the fact that their home ranges overlap. These differences make it unlikely that a trap set for cougar would catch a coyote or wolf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   \u2022 Wolves and coyotes typically use habitat with an open understory where they can give chase to their prey. On the contrary, cougars typically hunt in heavy vegetative cover which allows cougars to hide while stalking or waiting to ambush prey, and travel in canyon bottoms and across rocky terrain often through tight, narrow passageways, where they are protected from other cougars and wolves. Although cougar home ranges may overlap with coyotes and wolves, cougars typically spend their time in different locations within the home range. This means that trapping locations for cougars are not trapping locations for wolves or coyotes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \u2022 Wolves and coyotes behave differently than cougars when confronted with lures or disturbances (such as the area a trap is placed). Wolves and coyotes are attracted to certain scents but are naturally distrustful of new ground disturbance (such as modifying a site to attract them) and visual lures such as flagging which often repel them. In contrast, cougars are less attracted to scents but are attracted to flagging and because they are not wary of new ground disturbances, the site around the trap site is heavily modified to attract cougar while discouraging canines from approaching.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   \u2022 The differences between how cougars and wolves use the landscape, their natural behavior, and their response to attractants are evidenced by the fact that documented instances of Mexican wolves getting caught in traps in New Mexico are generally related to coyote trapping, and never related to cougar trapping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   -Goldstein Decl., (Doc. 99-2, Reply), \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   This evidence presented by Defendants regarding habitat use creates material disputes of fact on Plaintiffs' contention that harm to wolves is nearly inevitable because of the overlap of geographical boundaries. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, offer no evidence disputing Defendants' evidence of different habitat use by cougars and wolves which would reduce the risk of catching a wolf in a trap set for a cougar. Further, results from the Bighorn Sheep Restoration program suggest that harm to wolves is not reasonably certain or likely simply because of geographic overlap between cougars and wolves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Argument # 3: Irrelevance of Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute the fact that no wolves were caught in cougar traps during the 15 years of the Bighorn Sheep Restoration project, presented as Defendants' Fact 2. However, they minimize the significance of these facts by claiming that this data is insufficient because the program was conducted where there are almost no Mexican wolves. Thus, they argue, the data from that program sheds no light on the safety of cougar snares for Mexican wolves where they actually do exist. Doc. 102 at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Data from Bighorn Sheep Restoration Project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Plaintiffs first take issue with Defendant's Fact 2, although they do not dispute it. According to Fact 2, no Mexican wolves have been caught in traps set for cougars over the past 15 years from July 2002 to June 2017 as part of the Department's efforts to trap cougars to protect and manage\n   bighorn sheep populations. While 156 cougars were caught during these efforts, not a single Mexican gray wolf has been caught. Plaintiffs argue that the contractors in 15-year bighorn sheep Restoration Program used special precautions not required by the Cougar Rule for recreational trapping. The problem with this argument is that it completely ignores any of the hunting policies and recommendations issued by the Department as well as trapping regulations proposed by the Department and adopted by the Commission. These policies and regulations constitute the \"due care\" that hunters must use in order to avoid any penalty for the taking of a Mexican gray wolf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the statistics from this program are irrelevant because the program was conducted almost entirely\n   <em>\n    outside of Mexican gray wolf range\n   </em>\n   , and so Defendants cannot rely on this as evidence of the safety of cougar traps for wolves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 88 at 25; Arrivo Decl. (Doc. 97), Exs. I &amp; J. There are two problems with this argument. First, as mentioned earlier in this discussion, the evidence indicates that areas covered by the program were in counties within the MWEPA and where wolves were known to roam. Second, even if the Bighorn Restoration Program took place outside of the MWEPA, Plaintiffs should be estopped from claiming that statistics concerning wolf trappings outside of the MWEPA are not relevant, because Plaintiffs also have alleged in part, that the Cougar Rule will \"also cause the death, injury and harassment of Mexican wolves that range\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the MWEPA by exposing them to leghold traps and snares.\" Compl., Doc. 1 at 20, \u00b6 88 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways by alleging that EPA violations occur\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the MWEPA, and then claim that evidence relating to taking of wolves\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the MWEPA is not relevant. Third, Plaintiffs downplay the data from the Bighorn Sheep project because while the project was conducted within MWEPA where wolves were known to exist, it was not carried out in actual wolf habitat. However, as the Court discussed previously, this contention is not borne out by the evidence, which shows that the project took place in counties that are located in the MWEPA and which are in wolf range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   None of Plaintiffs' arguments abate the significance of Defendants' Fact 2. While the evidence in this fact is not necessarily entirely dispositive of the issues before the Court in this case, it is certainly relevant and material and weighs heavily in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Records Since Cougar Rule Went Into Effect\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute Defendants' Facts 4, 5 and 9. They admit they are unaware of any instance in which a Mexican wolf has been caught in a trap or snare set for cougars inside or outside the MWEPA either before or after the Cougar Rule went into effect, and they do not dispute that since November 2016 when the Cougar Rule went into effect, available records indicate that not a single Mexican wolf was caught in a trap set for cougars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Plaintiffs suggest, however, that this data is insufficient because it represents only one year of trapping under the Cougar Rule. Hopkins Decl., \u00b6 8 (one season is \"not nearly enough data\" from which to draw the conclusion that cougar trapping is safe for wolves). At the time of briefing, the Rule was in effect for only one year. However, since then Defendants have submitted a supplemental declaration by Ms. Goldstein providing an update for a second year of data: during the trapping season from November 2017 to March 2018, 34 cougars were trapped in New Mexico, but no Mexican wolves were trapped in traps set for cougars. Further, while four Mexican wolves were caught in traps in New\n   Mexico, in all four instances, the traps were set for coyotes, not cougars. Goldstein Decl. (Doc. 111), Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 4 &amp; 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ngo Decl. &amp; Exs. A-R; Pachelli Decl. (Docs. 79-3 and 79-22) (no record of Mexican wolves being caught in traps set for cougars). Thus, this data becomes less \"insufficient\" as Plaintiffs claim, and the Court finds this information material and relevant, if not solely dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Whether Defendants' Actions Will Cause Illegal Take of Mexican Wolves\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The ultimate question in this case is whether it is reasonably certain or likely that the Cougar Rule will cause injury or the take of the Mexican gray wolf. The next discussion focuses on that question in light of the evidence presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether Cougar Rule Authorizes Trapping and Snaring of Cougars Where Mexican Wolves Range\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Cougar Rule has been in effect for two one full trapping seasons, from November 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018, and no Mexican gray wolf has been caught in a trap set for a cougar. The Department has trapped cougars for 15-plus years in its Bighorn Sheep Restoration project without a single trapping of a Mexican gray wolf. Plaintiffs do not dispute these facts, but instead note that wolves have in fact been caught in traps meant for animals other than cougars, for example: references to sixteen mountain lions that were caught in traps that were set for wolves-in areas where wolf-trapping is legal. Doc. 102 at 17; Hopkins Decl. (Doc. 94), \u00b6 31; Arrivo Decl. (Doc. 97), Ex. O (Doc. 97-15) (traps set for wolves may hold bears, mountain lions and other large animals). Defendants do not deny that there are records of Mexican wolves being caught in traps. Ngo Decl. (Doc. 79-3), Exs. E-R. However, these records specify the targeted species, and in every one of these instances, the species targeted was not a cougar. Ngo Decl. (Doc. 79-3), Exs. F-K; Pachelli Decl. (Doc. 79-22), \u00b6 6. The Court fails to see the relevance evidence showing that wolves get caught in traps that are set for target animals other than cougars, when Plaintiffs are challenging the Cougar Rule rather than New Mexico's general hunting practices. Such evidence and related arguments are outside the scope of a challenge to the Cougar Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Information from other available records also supports Defendants' position. In its evaluation of the Department's cougar trapping program, the FWS concluded that it was not likely to adversely affect Mexican wolves. This \"Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation\" was part of an interagency mandate carried out by the Department pursuant to section 7 of the ESA (addressing interagency consultation). The evaluation states that the Cougar Rule either \"may effect\" or \"is not likely to adversely affect\" the jaguar or the Mexican gray wolf. The phrase \"is not likely to adversely affect\" is defined to mean that effects on wolves \"are expected to be discountable, or insignificant, or completely beneficial.\" Doc. 79-2 at 5; Defts' Fact 3; Goldstein Decl. (Doc. 79-1) at 3, 5 (noting the FWS' conclusion that cougar trapping program is not likely to adversely affect Mexican wolves).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Plaintiffs minimize this evidence as well as the FWS' conclusion because it pertains to professional cougar removal outside of the MWEPA (which is not evident from the documents) and because the evaluation is not based on an independent FWS analysis of the Cougar Rule. Plaintiffs offer no sensible reason to suspect the conclusions made in the Biological Evaluation other than the mere fact that the evaluation was done by cooperative government agencies rather than a private outside company, and they make no substantive challenges to the\n   accuracy, thoroughness or integrity of the evaluation. As a result, Plaintiffs fail to rebut this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the risk of harm to Mexican wolves will increase as the species grows, making it even more reasonably certain that wolves will get caught in cougar traps. The observation and argument seems plausible, but does not meet the reasonably certain standard to obtain an injunction. Moreover, as Defendants point out, because the Cougar Rule expires after two years, the argument becomes more speculative than plausible; there may be no trapping if the Rule is not renewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of \"Due Care\" Under the 10(j) Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Any discussion of causation must also include the policies and regulations in place which affect cougar trapping under the Cougar Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Any\n   <em>\n    unintentional\n   </em>\n   trapping of a Mexican gray wolf in the MWEPA is a violation of the 10(j) Rule (and therefore the ESA), only if it is done without the exercise of \"due care.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n    50 C.F.R \u00a7 17.84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(5)(iii).

Plaintiffs have not presented such evidence. In contrast, Defendants have presented evidence showing that harm to wolves is not reasonably certain to occur:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \u2022 First, the Cougar Rule does continue to permit the use of traps which could trap Mexican wolves just as easily, but prohibits traps with jawspreads larger than seven inches;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   \u2022 Second, regulations and policies are in place which either avoid or minimize harm to wolves the choice of equipment, for example, the use of sufficiently small traps that \"allow a reasonable expectation that the wolf will either immediately pull free from the trap or span the jaw spread when stepping on the trap.\" 80 Fed.Reg. at 2560. Snares and foot hold traps for cougars can be set to make the probability of capturing a wolf unlikely. For example, the design of the set for cougars will cause wolves and coyotes to avoid the trap, and \"pan tension\" can be adjusted upward on traps set for cougars. Griego Decl., \u00b6 10;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   \u2022 Third, in addition to trap modification and design, differences in behavioral characteristics between cougars and wolves and habitat use make it\n   unlikely that a trap set for cougar would catch a wolf, despite the fact that their home ranges overlap. A trapper's consideration of a cougar's use of habitat (as opposed to a wolf's) is part of the \"due care\" that can be followed to minimize the possibility of trapping a wolf in a trap that is set for a cougar. Defendants provide a detailed explanation of the differences in the use of habitat between wolves and cougars, including reaction to visual lures and attractants; how they hunt and where these species typically spend their time within their habitat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Goldstein Decl., Doc. 99-2 (Reply).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   \u2022 Fourth, while the Department's hunting rules and regulations may not have a binding legal effect, they are nevertheless designed to mitigate the possibility of a wolf being caught in a cougar trap, which the Court finds extremely relevant to an analysis of whether an injunction is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    National Wildlife Fed'n v.

These policies sand regulations also effectively deter noncompliance because a hunter is exposed to civil and criminal liability under the ESA and under state law. Such negative consequences would reasonably motivate a hunter/trapper to exercise all aspects of due care under the 10(j) rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In sum, the Court finds and concludes that the evidence presented by Defendants substantially and materially disputes Plaintiffs' statements that measures cannot be taken to avoid trapping wolves in traps set for cougars; overlap of species habitat will mean increased harm to wolves; and that any data collected by the FWS or the Department is irrelevant or insufficient. In contrast, Plaintiffs have failed to create factual disputes to this evidence presented by Defendants, and so Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Plaintiffs have argued that use of larger traps and overlapping territory will make it nearly inevitable that wolves will be caught in traps set for cougars, but they fail to rebut the facts and evidence presented by Defendants showing that measures can be taken either by use of habitat or compliance with trapping policies and regulations, to minimize any risk of harm to Mexican wolves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   For purposes of this discussion, it worth mentioning an unpublished District of New Mexico case,\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians v. Lane\n   </em>\n   , in which plaintiffs were challenging the rules addressing special exceptions of \"unavoidable and unintentional\" taking of Mexican gray wolves. Plaintiffs in that case contended that the defendants, by regulation or lack of regulation, caused others to take Mexican gray wolves through activities of trapping. No. CIV 12-118 LFG/KBM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206019306\">\n    2012 WL 6019306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.N.M. Dec. 3, 2012),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 4, 2012). The court in that case found that plaintiffs had raised no genuine issues of material fact demonstrating that Defendants' regulation or non-regulation of trapping actually caused trappings of Mexican gray wolves:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   The Court observes that not many trappings of wolves occurred in the New Mexico occupied wolf range over the last 7 to 12 years. While not determinative of the issues before it, the Court notes that over a 12-year period, only a very small percentage of wolf mortalities is attributed\n   to non-project personnel's trapping. Between 2002 and 2009, only 10 to 13 wolves were trapped in the pertinent recovery areas. Of those, not all were killed or injured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <em>\n    Lane,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206019306\">\n    2012 WL 6019306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23 (D.N.M. Dec. 3, 2012),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 4, 2012). Here too, the fact that no wolf has been caught in a cougar trap since the Cougar Rule has been in effect is strong evidence, even if it is not dispositive, that the rule is not causing take of the Mexican gray wolf, by any definition of the word \"take\" under the ESA statute. In\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife v. Burlington,\n   </em>\n   the Ninth Circuit found that the plaintiff failed to establish reasonable likelihood of irreparable future injury to grizzly bears from a railroad's possible future grain spills so as to warrant a preliminary injunction. The court in that case noted that following completion of major cleanup effort by the railroad, no bears had been hit by trains in the area of the corn spills in more than three years.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517048\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/1508/#p1511\">\n    23 F.3d 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1511 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"While we do not require that future harm be shown with certainty before an injunction may issue, we do require that a future injury be sufficiently likely\").
