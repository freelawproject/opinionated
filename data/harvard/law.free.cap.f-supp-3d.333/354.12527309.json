(\"DGI\") for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. The plaintiff and defendant were parties to an Engagement Letter under which the plaintiff was to provide financial advisory services for a reduced fee with the expectation that the defendant would offer the plaintiff the opportunity to act as a financial advisor to DGI on any resulting acquisition or other strategic transaction. Foros alleges that it provided the financial advisory services and was paid the reduced rate for its services but was never offered the opportunity to become a financial advisor in connection with the strategic transaction that ensued. DGI moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 8. DGI is a commercial provider of satellite imagery. Am. Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the early part of 2015, DGI was allegedly \"struggling to grow its revenues\" and investors had expressed concern with the business. Am. Compl. \u00b6 14. At that time, DGI had \"aspects of a satellite business, a government contractor, and an information services business\" and was allegedly \"suffering from an identity crisis in the marketplace\". Am. Compl. \u00b6 15. In order to address these issues, DGI engaged Foros as a financial advisor in mid-2015. Am. Compl. \u00b6 16. DGI sought Foros's assistance to develop long term strategies for the company, including \"identifying the key drivers for those strategies, understanding their financial implications, and establishing a clear market profile.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 1, 2015, Foros and DGI signed an Engagement Letter setting forth the services Foros would provide. Am. Compl. \u00b6 18. The Engagement Letter explained that Foros would assist DGI \"in the review of [DGI's] strategic plan and development of an acquisition strategy and framework for evaluating acquisition opportunities and such other matters as [Foros and DGI] may agree.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 18. For its work pursuant to the Engagement Letter, Foros would receive a $250,000 retainer fee for the first three months of work and $125,000 per quarter for work completed thereafter, commencing on November 1, 2015. Am. Compl. Ex. A, at 2. The Engagement Letter also contained a clause (the \"Offer Clause\") which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   If [DGI] determines to consider any acquisitions or other strategic transactions as a result of this engagement during the term of this Agreement or during the 18-month period following the termination of this Agreement, [DGI] will offer Foros the opportunity to act as a financial advisor to the company in connection therewith, and, if offered, Foros agrees to consider acting in such capacity. If Foros agrees to act in any such capacity for a particular transaction, [DGI] and Foros (or an affiliate of Foros, at its election) will enter into an appropriate form of agreement relating to the type of transaction involved and containing customary terms and conditions, including fee provisions and provisions relating to indemnification of Foros, as negotiated and agreed in good faith by [DGI] and Foros.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Am. Compl. Ex. A, at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the several months that followed, Foros provided \"guidance to DGI on how to frame its business and categorize its revenue sources\" and \"developed a roadmap for DGI on messaging and strategy to establish a clear market identity that would better position DGI as a candidate for investors.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 19. Specifically, Foros developed a financial model for DGI that allowed DGI to assess the financial impact of alternative business scenarios. Am. Compl. \u00b6 21. Described as the \"Sandbox,\" this tool \"allowed dynamic financial modeling of a given business strategy based on variations to [key business and financial drivers for DGI].\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During its work with Foros, DGI expressed interest in launching a \"platform\" business, which would bean online imagery platform that would enable others to develop applications to analyze DGI's imagery. Am. Compl. \u00b6 22. DGI asked Foros to help \"define what DGI's business would need to look like in order to be viewed as a platform company.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 23. In response to this request, Foros developed a business strategy including financial metrics\n   for DGI to assess the platform business idea. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24. The financial model created by Foros concluded that DGI would not be able to transition profitably to the platform model without merging with another company to acquire some of the necessary capabilities. Am. Compl. \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In September 2015, Foros provided the DGI board of directors with final versions of three operating scenarios for DGI, as well as financial projections. DGI management advised the board that the platform model had the most potential for DGI. Am. Compl. \u00b6 27. In September and October of 2015, DGI discussed with financial sponsors a potential leveraged buyout (\"LBO\") of DGI. Am. Compl. \u00b6 28. Throughout this process, DGI's chief financial officer and other DGI representatives communicated with Foros. Am. Compl. \u00b6 28. On October 8, 2015, Foros spoke with DGI's CFO and Barclays to discuss the LBO outreach. Am. Compl. \u00b6 29. DGI's CFO assured Foros that it would be a part of any advisory team if the LBO was successful. Am. Compl. \u00b6 29. However, ultimately the discussions about the LBO transaction were terminated. Am. Compl. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   About one year later, in October 2016, DGI began discussions regarding a potential merger with MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (\"MDA\")Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. From October 2016 to February 2017, DGI and MDA continued discussions about the merger, and DGI engaged Barclays and PJT Partners LP (\"PJT\") to serve as the financial advisors in connection with the potential merger. Am. Compl. \u00b6 33. Foros alleges that Barclays was provided with the financial model created by Foros and relied on the model in rendering its fairness opinion of the merger. Am. Compl. \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2017, DGI and Foros had an in-person meeting. Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. In February 2017, DGI requested that Foros continue to develop the strategy initiated in 2015. Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. During these meetings, DGI did not disclose to Foros that it was discussing merger opportunities with MDA or any other businesses. Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. DGI never approached Foros to offer Foros the opportunity to work as a financial advisor for the MDA merger. Am. Compl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 24, 2017, MDA agreed to acquire DGI for approximately $3.6 billion dollars. Am. Compl. \u00b6 35. Barclays and PJT received financial advisory fees of $36 million and $18 million, respectively, upon consummation of the MDA merger. Am. Compl. \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff filed suit against DGI alleging that the defendant breached the Offer Clause of the Engagement Letter when DGI failed to offer the plaintiff the opportunity to act as a financial advisor to DGI on the MDA merger. The plaintiff now brings claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. The plaintiff seeks contract damages of not less than $18 million together with pre-judgment interest, and in the alternative, damages for its quantum meruit and unjust enrichment claims in an amount to be determined at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claim for breach of contract must be dismissed because the Offer Clause is unenforceable under the New York common law of contracts and is barred by the Statute of Frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant first argues that the Offer Clause is an unenforceable \"agreement to agree\" under New York common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"It is well settled that for a contract to be valid, the agreement between the parties must be definite and explicit so their intention may be ascertained to a reasonable degree of certainty. Even if the parties believe that they are bound, if the terms of the agreement are so vague and indefinite that there is no basis or standard for deciding whether the agreement had been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy, and no means by which such terms may be made certain, then there is no enforceable contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Candid Prods., Inc. v.

The Offer Clause also does not specify the amount of money Foros would be paid for that work. There are plainly different types of financial advisors who provide different services for different levels of compensation on different types of strategic transactions. Even on the merger between DGI and MDA, two financial advisors were employed -- Barclays and PJT -- and they were paid vastly different compensation -- $36 million and $18 million respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Without such critical terms as the type of financial advisor, the scope of services, and the compensation, there can be no binding agreement because the Offer Clause is merely an agreement to agree on these material terms at a later time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clifford R.

But, in this case, customary terms and conditions cannot be used to determine the meaning of the ambiguous terms because the Offer Clause does not even define the specific type of financial advisor that Foros would be, or the scope of services to be performed, much less an objective or customary standard for determining the amount such an advisor would be paid. The vastly different amounts paid to Barclays and PJT is evidence of the wide range of advisory services available in any particular transaction and the compensation paid for those services.

Under that clause, the defendant was to compensate the plaintiff for work the plaintiff had already performed \"in an equitable manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"441139\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/29/56/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"441139\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/29/56/#p58\">\n    at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The invalid clause in\n   <em>\n    Mem'l Drive Consultants\n   </em>\n   was expressly related to compensation for work that the plaintiff had performed under the contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"441139\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/29/56/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that situation, the fact that the contract claim was invalid left the plaintiff without compensation for work it provided under one phase of the agreement, and the court of appeals affirmed the district court's decision to allow a quasi-contract claim to move forward for that phase of the work. Unlike the invalid clause in\n   <em>\n    Mem'l Drive Consultants\n   </em>\n   , the Offer Clause here does not purport to provide compensation for the work Foros actually performed under the contract. Foros was compensated for its work under the Engagement Letter at the rate it agreed to perform that work. Therefore, the fact that the Offer Clause is unenforceable does not leave Foros deprived of compensation for the services it performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Indeed, the only provisions of the Engagement Letter that purport to compensate Foros for the services it performed remain valid. The Engagement Letter specifically sets out the compensation due to Foros for the services Foros provided. The Engagement Letter states that, for Foros's services under the contract, DGI will pay \"a retainer fee, equal to $250,000 ... for the Strategic and Acquisition Review Work ... and thereafter ongoing retainer fees of $125,000 per quarter.\" Am. Compl. Ex. A, at 2. In exchange for that compensation, Foros agreed to \"perform the work set out in the Work Plan ... create a framework for consideration of acquisition opportunities; and ... make a presentation to [DGI's] Management ... regarding the foregoing, including its analysis and recommendations, the form and content of which shall be such as Foros considers appropriate.\" Am. Compl. Ex. A, at 1. Foros does not dispute that it was compensated for providing its services according to the schedule provided in the Engagement Letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, the Engagement Letter bars the Plaintiff's quasi-contract claims because \"the scope of the [Engagement Letter] clearly covers the dispute between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Mid-Hudson Catskill Rural Migrant Ministry, Inc. v. Fine Host Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931744\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/168/#p175\">\n    418 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (2d Cir.2005). Foros has not shown that it performed any additional services that were \"so distinct from\" its contractual duties that \"it would be unreasonable for [DGI] to assume that they were rendered without expectation of further pay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931744\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/168/#p175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931744\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/168/#p175\">\n    at 175-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. E. Telecomms. v. U.S. West Commc'ns Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852259\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1289/\">\n    38 F.3d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1994) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hindsight Sols., LLC v.

Indeed, the work Foros performed was exactly that which the Engagement Letter explicitly required of it, and for which the specific amount of compensation is also set forth in the Engagement Letter. The fact that the Offer Clause is unenforceable does not provide Foros the ability to renegotiate the rate for the work that it performed pursuant to the Engagement Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, the Engagement Letter, an enforceable contract, governs the compensation that DGI owed Foros. Because the Engagement Letter covers the work that was done and for which Foros received compensation, Foros cannot sue in quasi-contract for additional compensation beyond what it negotiated for in the Engagement Letter. Foros's quasi-contract claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment must be\n   <strong>\n    dismissed\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, the arguments are either moot or without merit. For the reasons explained above, DGI's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk is directed to close Docket No. 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Though Foros contends that it provided its services at a discounted rate in hopes of contracting with DGI again in the future, \"a claimant is not entitled to recover in quantum meruit when services have been rendered with the expectation that a future business opportunity or contract -- rather than direct compensation -- will be forthcoming.\"\n    <em>\n     Anderson v. Iceland Seafood Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20F.3d%20480\">\n     77 F.3d 480\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 480 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). If Foros agreed to perform that work at a reduced rate, it was nonetheless the rate at which Foros agreed to perform the work that it did perform. Foros cannot use quasi-contract claims to renegotiate the rate to which it agreed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Moreover, the additional work to be negotiated under the Offer Clause was itself barred by the Statute of Frauds. The fact that the provision of the Engagement Letter relating to the future engagement of Foros as a financial advisor is unenforceable and is barred by the Statute of Frauds does not somehow allow that provision to become enforceable under a quasi-contract theory. Indeed, claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment cannot be used to circumvent the Statute of Frauds.\n    <em>\n     Bonsey v.
