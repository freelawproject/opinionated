Brooke Jackson in his 2014 decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Sunset Roadless Area contains 5,800 acres of relatively undeveloped forest and scrub land in a part of western Colorado called the North Fork Valley. Mount Gunnison and the West Elk Wilderness lie to the east....[T]here have been human activities in the area making it less pristine than the nearby West Elk Wilderness Area. But at the same time the area is undoubtedly wild, relatively empty, and home to diverse flora and fauna.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Recreational opportunities are available in the area as well,...there are two trails...- the Sunset Trail and Trail 8152 - though they do not receive heavy use.

In considering methane flaring as an alternative, instead of a mitigation measure, the Agencies would not have avoided the dilemmas that they encountered during the\n   lease modification process, namely, that a different agency, the MSHA, is responsible for mine safety, MSHA would need to approve any proposed flaring system, MSHA has never approved a flaring system for an active coal mine, and MSHA has not received any proposal for a flaring system at the West Elk Mine. R. at FSLeasingII-0000189. Plaintiffs do not dispute that Mountain Coal needs to design the proposed mine ventilation system in order to propose a ventilation system to the MSHA and that such a design is dependent on the location of coal to be mined, which Mountain Coal has not yet explored, but is currently doing pursuant to the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 55 at 23.

While it is true that under the law of demand 'a decrease in the own price of a normal good will cause quantity demanded to increase'; the responsiveness of how quantity demanded changes relative to a change in price is more nuanced (own-price elasticity) and depends upon numerous factors such as the availability of substitutes, length of adjustment period and the budget share spent on the good.

In this present case, evidence has not been presented to support the claim that electricity demand would change with the addition or subtraction of projected amounts of North Fork coal from the coal supply. The assumption that [the] IPM [method used] does not incorporate the basic economic principle of price elasticity of demand is mistaken.

The Forest Service provided significant evidence and analysis showing that the basic supply and demand relationship asserted by plaintiffs is questionable\n   because of other factors that bear on the relationship between coal availability and electricity demand. In particular, with respect to future demand for coal to produce energy, the Exception SFEIS notes that numerous factors affect whether other energy sources can substitute for coal and that power plants operate subject to numerous technological and regulatory limitations that determine whether coal generally, or coal of the particular type recoverable in the North Fork area, can be substituted for other fuels, regardless of its price.

The lease modifications address a section of the area subject to the North Fork Exception and incorporate the Exception SFEIS, relying in part on its analysis.

Thus, the social cost of carbon information provided in the Exception SFEIS is informative of the climate impacts expected to occur under the lease modifications. The Forest Service's record of decision approving the lease modifications notes that the Exception SFEIS's discussion of greenhouse gas harms informed its decision on the harms of the lease modifications, but concluded that further analysis of the issue was not necessary because the \"public [has] been informed by the analysis done to date.\" R. at FSLeasingII-0000060;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   BLM000004 (BLM record of decision for lease modifications noting the new administrative proceedings \"address[ed] Court-identified deficiencies and incorporate[d] new information and policies since 2012\").
