(Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 8.) On June 7, 2017, Blanch's bankruptcy was discharged. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 9.) Blanch alleges that the following trade lines are \"incorrectly reporting with a status of account included in bankruptcy\": (1) DSNB/Macy's with account number: 41818278**** (Macy's), and (2) Goodyear/Cbna with account number: 603551012480**** (Citibank). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 7.) On September 1, 2016, Blanch obtained her credit files and noticed these trade lines. (Id. at \u00b6 10.) On October 25, 2017, Blanch submitted a letter to the credit reporting agencies Trans Union and Equifax disputing the trade lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 11.) In these dispute letters, Blanch explained that the subject accounts were discharged in her bankruptcy, attached a copy of the Order of Discharge, and asked the credit bureaus to report the correct status. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Blanch alleges that Trans Union and Equifax forwarded her dispute to Macy's and Citibank. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 12.) On November 1, 2017, Blanch received Trans Union's investigation results. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 13.) These results showed that the trade lines continued to report with what Blanch believed to be \"an incorrect status of account included in bankruptcy instead of reporting as discharged in bankruptcy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)

In the words of the court, \"[t]he debt was eliminated, and the bank reported it as such.\" Judge Lawson relied upon several prior opinions.

The November 1, 2017 Trans Union Investigations Results reveal that both Macy's and Citibank were reporting Blanch's accounts with the following notations: \"Chapter 13 Bankruptcy; Acct Info Disputed By Consumr; Account Included In Bankruptcy; Account Closed by Credit Grantor; Account Balance: $0\". There was nothing false or \"inaccurate\" about Macy's or Citibank reporting Blanch's accounts as included in her bankruptcy, closed, and with a zero balance. Blanch does not dispute that her personal obligation\n   to pay any amount once due on either account was discharged by her bankruptcy, and she does not contend that Macy's or Citibank ever made any effort to compel her to make further payments after that discharge, or that she would have had any obligation to do so if either party had. In short, Blanch's debts to Macy's and Citibank were eliminated, and Macy's and Citibank reported the situation as such. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that Blanch has not carried her burden of pleading that the information Macy's or Citibank furnished was inaccurate or incomplete, nor has she pleaded that the information about the Macy's or Citibank accounts was materially misleading. Accordingly, Blanch has not made out a plausible claim that Macy's or Citibank has negligently or willfully violated the FCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Motion to Dismiss (Doc.
