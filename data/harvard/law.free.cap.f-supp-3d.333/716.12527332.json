ECF No. 1. They allege that the State of Michigan operates an unconstitutional Newborn Screening Program which involves sampling, testing, and storing infant blood without parental consent. The complaint names Defendants Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and its director Nick Lyon, MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories director Dr. Sandip Shah, state epidemiologist and Michigan BioTrust manager Dr. Sarah Lyon-Callo, MDHHS Newborn Screening managers Harry Hawkins\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mary Kleyn, Michigan Neonatal Biobank (the \"Biobank\") (also known as the Michigan Neonatal Biorepository) and its director Dr. Antonio Yancey. The named individuals are sued in their official and individual capacities. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint (which they titled as a \"corrected complaint\") to address a deficiency in the original complaint (no summons requested), which was stricken. ECF No. 3. Defendants filed motions to dismiss. ECF Nos. 15, 21. In response, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (which they titled \"first amended\" complaint and will hereinafter be referred to as the \"amended complaint\") as of right, and the motions to dismiss were terminated as moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 26. Defendants then filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) which are now before the Court.

Accordingly, the relevant facts are derived from Plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since the 1960's, the State of Michigan has operated a newborn screening program, whereby medical professionals take blood samples (dried blood spots, or \"DBS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   cards\") from newborn babies to test for various diseases. Am. Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 26. The DBS cards are ultimately transferred to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank and stored indefinitely for testing and further research.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10-11, 33. The parents of the infant children in this case did not consent to the blood test or to the State taking custody of the blood samples.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3-4. MCL 333.5431(1) directs health care professionals to administer the blood test. Violating the statute is a misdemeanor. MCL 333.5431(5). The statute exempts the blood sampling and testing from informed consent requirements. MCL 333.5431(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs were never extended the option to opt-out of the blood test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Plaintiffs \"might have been\" presented with an option to opt out of donating the blood to research.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. In addition to the blood samples, healthcare professionals also submitted identifying information of the infants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. MDHHS's public documentation promises confidentiality and promises to resist demands for information that could identify the infant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Despite these promises, \"Blood samples on several occasions were provided pursuant to state court orders ... and being sold to third party businesses and researchers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Michigan Neonatal Biobank \"actively sells punches of various sizes to universities and businesses at different rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. \"Since the blood spots contain deeply private medical and genetic information ... the Parents are concerned and fear about the misuse of that information and fear the possibility of discrimination against their Infants and perhaps even relatives through the use of such blood samples and research activity thereon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. \"That [f]ear is well-founded and actual as the sharing of blood spots containing deeply private medical and genetic information has recently resulted in the arrest of an alleged killer but has already resulted in the wrongful arrest of persons who were not guilty of any crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that Defendants violated Plaintiffs' fourteenth amendment liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical procedures by conducting the blood test without parental consent (count I) or by improper/incomplete/false consent (count II).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-90, 91-101. The amended complaint also alleges that Defendants violated Plaintiffs' fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures where the initial extraction and seizure for testing was conducted without parental consent (count III), and then indefinite storage was also conducted without parental consent (count IV and V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants filed three separate motions to dismiss. ECF Nos. 32, 33, 34. The State Defendants (MDHHS, Mary Klen, Sarah Lyon-Callo, Nick Lyons, and Sandeep Shah) argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert fourteenth amendment claims because children possess no absolute right to have their parents or guardians make medical decisions on their behalf. State Def. Mot. at 11, ECF No. 32. The State Defendants also argue that neither the parents nor their children have standing to assert fourth amendment claims because any injury they allegedly have suffered as a result of the storage of the blood samples is speculative inasmuch as they only assert an \"unsubstantiated, vague 'concern[ ] and fear' about\n   <em>\n    the potential\n   </em>\n   for misuse of their children's stored DBS and 'fear [of]\n   <em>\n    the possibility\n   </em>\n   of discrimination against their infants\n   <em>\n    and perhaps even relatives.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting Am. Compl. \u00b6 78) (emphasis in original). They also argue that the blood test was not a search and, if it was, it was a reasonable one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-34. For largely the same reasons, the\n   State Defendants contend Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments. The State Defendants also argue that the eleventh amendment bars all claims against MDHHS and all claims against the individual Defendants other than the claims for prospective injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Finally, they argue that the claims for money damages against Defendants in their individual capacity are barred by qualified immunity because Defendants have not violated any clearly established rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants Michigan Neonatal Biobank and its director Antonio Yancy (in his official capacity) filed their own motion to dismiss, which largely echoes the State Defendants' motion. ECF No. 33. Dr. Yancy filed his own motion to dismiss in his individual capacity, arguing that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged his personal involvement in any constitutional violations. ECF No 34. Because the grounds for dismissal provided in the State Defendants' motion are equally applicable to the remaining Defendants, the latter two motions will not be addressed directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A pleading fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) if it does not contain allegations that support recovery under any recognizable legal theory.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court is directed to construe the pleading in the non-movant's favor and accepts the allegations of facts therein as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lambert v.

The pleader need not have provided \"detailed factual allegations\" to survive dismissal, but the \"obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

In essence, the pleading \"must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\" and \"the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The newborn screening program does not violate Plaintiffs' substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment. Throughout their briefing, the parties refer to three constitutionally protected liberty interests under the fourteenth amendment that might be implicated in this case, often interchangeably. The liberty interests are not interchangeable, however, and it is important to distinguish between the three. First, the parties refer to the right of a child to have its parent make medical decisions on its behalf. Second, the parties refer to the right of a competent person to refuse unwanted medical procedures. Third, the parties refer to a parent's right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There does not appear to be any legal authority supporting the notion that children have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their parent or guardian making medical decisions on their behalf. The case law cited by the parties certainly does not support this notion. Conceptually, this \"right\" may seem related to the other two. However, when conducting an analysis under the substantive due process clause, it is important to use the precise language describing the constitutionally\n   protected liberty interests that have been recognized by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As Plaintiffs emphasize, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruzan by Cruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep't of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215746\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/261/#p278\">\n    497 U.S. 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215746\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/261/#p278\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215746\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/261/#p278\">\n    111 L.Ed.2d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). It is self-evident, however, that an infant is not a\n   <em>\n    competent\n   </em>\n   person and cannot therefore make decisions concerning medical treatment. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Cruzan\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Supreme Court has also recognized \"the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\"\n   <em>\n    Troxel v. Granville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p66\">\n    530 U.S. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p66\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p66\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). It is equally true that \"a state is not without constitutional control over parental discretion in dealing with children\n   <em>\n    when their physical or mental health is jeopardized.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Parham v.

Indeed, Supreme Court precedent recognizes \"two competing values of equal worth: the right of parents to parent and the right of children to safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Spiering v. Heineman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5596899\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/448/1129/#p1140\">\n    448 F.Supp.2d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (D. Neb. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Supreme Court precedent, however, has not delineated the parameters of a \"parent's right to parent\" in a way that can be neatly applied to new sets of facts. See\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9137784\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/492/#p519\">\n    327 F.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting the Court's lack of clear guidance on limits of substantive due process parental rights doctrine). Therefore, this Court must look to the well-reasoned opinions of court's adjudicating comparable sets of facts.\n   <em>\n    Spiering\n   </em>\n   , in particular, is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Spiering\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that Nebraska's program of mandatory blood testing of infants for metabolic diseases did not violate the parent's fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\n   <em>\n    Spiering v. Heineman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5596899\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/448/1129/#p1140\">\n    448 F.Supp.2d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (D. Neb. 2006). Despite recognizing the status of the right as \"fundamental,\" the Court applied rational basis review to the program, noting that \"[l]ower courts have often assumed that various reasonable restrictions on such rights would be permissible, and that such restrictions need not be judged under the strict security test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5596899\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/448/1129/#p1140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Eugene Volokh,\n   <em>\n    Parent-Child Speech and Child Custody Speech Restrictions,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%20631\">\n    81 N.Y.U.

Given the State's interest in safeguarding infant health, and the minimally invasive nature of the procedure (a heel stick drawing 5-6 drops of blood), the blood test does not violate the parents' right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Case law addressing compulsory vaccinations also help support the analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found that\n   compulsory vaccination laws with only medical exemptions do not violate any federal constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    Jacobson v.

Indeed, public benefit and herd immunity is one of the main goals of compulsory vaccination requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nikolao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264239\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/310/\">\n    875 F.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the benefit of herd immunity and the critical mass of the vaccinated population necessary to achieve herd immunity). However, it is equally clear that vaccinations benefit the individual, by immunizing him/her from the disease in question. In fact, the benefit to the individual is more direct than the benefit the public receives via herd immunity. Similarly here, the blood tests benefit the infant by facilitating early detection and treatment. Furthermore, Plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Cruzan\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the individual's right to refuse unwanted medical treatment takes precedence over the state's interest in promoting the public health and safety is misplaced. As explained above,\n   <em>\n    Cruzan\n   </em>\n   spoke of the right of\n   <em>\n    competent\n   </em>\n   individuals to refuse unwanted medical treatment, and infants are not competent individuals capable of expressing a desire to refuse medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The only right potentially implicated here is the right of parents to make decisions concerning their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Notably, none of the authority provided by Plaintiffs in their response brief supports the proposition that the right of a parent to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children includes the right to refuse potentially life-saving testing or treatment on the infant's behalf. Plaintiffs' brief largely consists of quotations from cases supporting broad principles of constitutional law, such as the fact that \"minors, as well as adults are protected by the constitution, and possess constitutional rights,\" and that a minor child is not \"the mere creature of the State.\" Resp. at 23-24, ECF No. 45. These broad statements of law are undoubtedly true and not subject to any debate. However, this does not help resolve the present inquiry, namely whether the facts as pled in this case demonstrate action by the State that violates Plaintiffs' substantive due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs provide one case,\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   , which they contend is \"the closest and nearly on-point analogous case applying these principles ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.

Furthermore, the holding of\n   <em>\n    Spiering\n   </em>\n   is consistent with the principles derived from the compulsory vaccination cases discussed above. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have not stated a claim based on the assertion that the blood testing violated the parents' substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nor have the parents stated a claim that the retention and use of their children's blood samples violated their substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment. Throughout the complaint, the alleged unconstitutional action is frequently described as a continuous\n   course of conduct: \"a piercing device breaching the outside of the skin of the Infants to extract five or six blood drops and seize those blood spots for medical testing and use by the government.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , e.g. Am. Compl. \u00b6 87. Construing the amended complaint as alleging that the retention and use of the blood samples constituted an independent violation of their substantive due process rights (i.e. one not predicated on a finding that the blood test was itself unconstitutional), the amended complaint still fails to state a claim for such a violation. First, it is far from clear that the parents' constitutionally protected liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children is in anyway impinged by the government retaining and using the blood samples for research and/or commercial purposes as alleged in the amended complaint. Indeed, the authority provided in Plaintiffs' response is devoted almost exclusively to addressing the propriety of the blood test itself. Although Plaintiffs allege that the retention and use of the blood is generally wrongful and inappropriate, Plaintiffs devote minimal effort toward explaining or supporting the notion that the retention and use violates their substantive due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To the extent the amended complaint may be read to allege some vague privacy interest that is implicated by the retention and use of the blood, that theory is certainly not developed in the complaint or briefed in Plaintiffs' response. The Court should not and will not develop that claim on Plaintiffs' behalf. Such a theory is unlikely to be viable in any event, considering the statute that authorizes the State program in question expressly provides that any use of the blood samples must be \"in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the test subjects.\" MCL 333.5431(7)(b). Plaintiffs have not alleged that their blood samples have been used so as to compromise their confidentiality, despite their allegations concerning the use of blood samples belonging to third parties (see Am. Compl. \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Secondly, Plaintiffs have not pled facts demonstrating that their blood samples were used contrary to their express wishes. The amended complaint contains a number of allegations as to the State's practice concerning the use of blood samples generally, or in specific instances involving third parties, for commercial research and other purposes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 10, 12, 33, 70, 79, 80. The amended complaint cannot, however, be reasonably read to contend that Plaintiffs' specific blood samples are being used in a manner that is contrary to the parents' express wishes. In fact, the allegations in the amended complaint cut the opposite way. Paragraph 46 acknowledges that the parents \"might have been presented with a card giving the Parents an option of whether they want their Infants'\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     already\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   illegally seized and tested blood to be donated to medical research.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants attached a copy of this consent form to their motion to dismiss, as well as documents which purport to be forms filled out by the parents in this case. ECF Nos. 33-11, 11-12. Plaintiffs take issue with these exhibits for a number of reasons. Plaintiffs argue, without explanation, that these exhibits are improperly attached to a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Resp. at\n   4. Plaintiffs also note that the infants' names are redacted, that there only appear to be forms for 7 of the 9 children, and that two of the forms contain flat denials of consent. However, Defendants need not establish that Plaintiffs consented to their blood samples being used for research. At a minimum, these exhibits, in conjunction with Plaintiffs' own allegations and exhibits\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , establish that Plaintiffs were provided consent forms allowing them to opt into or opt out of their infant's blood sample being used for research. The allegations in the complaint provide no reason to believe that Defendants used Plaintiffs' blood samples in a way that was contrary to what the parents expressed on the consent forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that they were insufficiently informed about what they were consenting to: \"if they did sign such a document they had insufficient understanding of matters they asked/forced to sign and thus were not given proper informed consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This paragraph implies that the consent form was deficient, but does not explain why. Nor is it apparent how this alleged deficiency renders the subsequent use of the blood samples constitutionally suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In summary, Plaintiffs have made no effort to explain how the retention and use of the blood samples constitutes an independent violation (i.e. one not predicated on a finding that the blood test was itself unconstitutional) of the parents' substantive due process rights to parent their children. Furthermore, it is not reasonably in dispute that the parents were presented with an option to opt out of having their child's blood used for research, and there is no reason to believe that the parents' instructions were not respected. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for a violation of their substantive due process rights based on the retention and use of the blood samples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs have also failed to state a claim that the blood testing violated their fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. An initial question is whether the blood test constituted a search under the fourth amendment. The fourth amendment protects \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures ...\" The fourth amendment is implicated\n   when the government's challenged conduct invades an individual's legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized.\n   <em>\n    Rawlings v.

(collecting cases). Despite the lack of clear guidance from the Supreme Court regarding when and under what circumstances the special needs doctrine applies, the\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   court observed that the cases seem to share at least three features: \"(1) an exercise of governmental authority distinct from that of mere law enforcement-such as the authority as employer, the\n   <em>\n    in loco parentis\n   </em>\n   authority of school officials, or the post-incarceration authority of probation officers; (2) lack of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing, and concomitant lack of individualized stigma based on such suspicion; and (3) an interest in preventing future harm, generally involving the health or safety of the person being searched or of other persons directly touched by that person's conduct, rather than of deterrence or punishment for past wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537792\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1194/\">\n    336 F.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1213-14 (10th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, the state-mandated blood screening meets all three criteria. The exercise of governmental authority is entirely distinct from law enforcement. The mandatory blood screening applies to all infants, and involves no individualized considerations of wrongdoing. The Newborn Screening Program is also designed to protect the health and safety of the infants by facilitating early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Notwithstanding its observation that these three criteria were met, the\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   court nevertheless concluded that the special needs doctrine did not apply to the facts of that case. Notably, the regulations at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   expressly required the defendants to \"obtain advance parent or guardian authorization for all health and developmental procedures administered through the program,\" which they did not do.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537792\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201304.20\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2) ). The\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   court noted that the regulations did not require the defendants to obtain a physical examination within 90 days of enrollment, as was their contention, but only required them to \"make a determination as to whether the enrolled children have an ongoing source of continuous, accessible health care, and whether they are up-to-date on a schedule of appropriate preventative and primary health care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201304.20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201304.20\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(i), (ii) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   not only exceeded the requirements of the regulations, but also violated the regulations' express requirement to obtain parental consent. Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   court found that the physical examinations in question were not justified by the \"special needs\" of the head start program, given that those physical examinations were not even authorized under the program's regulations. Here, by contrast, there is no allegation that Defendants have acted contrary to MCL 333.5431, which mandates the blood tests in question and exempts them from informed consent requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furthermore, the nature of the intrusion on Plaintiffs' privacy is minimal when compared to the state's interest in protecting infant health. The intrusion involves a prick of the infants' heel after birth to withdraw 5 or 6 drops of blood, which enables the medical professionals to screen for a variety of diseases, facilitating early detection, treatment, and prevention. This search is a far cry from the invasive physical examination at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   , which is apparent from even a cursory reading of the court's description of that search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537792\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1194/\">\n    336 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other than the fact that the search at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   also involved a blood test, there is very little in common between the conduct at issue in this case and the conduct at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the court in\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   devoted little attention to the blood test, other than noting that \"[b]lood samples were taken by the finger stick (or 'hematocrit')\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   method, which can be frightening to small children.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537792\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is apparent that the\n   <em>\n    Dubbs\n   </em>\n   court was focused on the intrusiveness of the physical examination. Furthermore, the court noted that the physical examinations were neither required by the regulations nor did the examinations further the regulation's goal of ensuring that the student's had access to healthcare.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537792\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537792\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1194/\">\n    at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, a district court can consider exhibits attached to Defendants' motion to dismiss without converting the motion into one for summary judgment where two conditions are met: 1) the documents are referred to in the complaint, and 2) are central to the claims contained therein.\n    <em>\n     Gavitt v.

Both of these conditions are met here. Plaintiffs clearly refer to these documents in paragraph \u00b6 46, and they are central to the question of whether Defendants used the blood samples in a fashion that was contrary to the express wishes of the Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Plaintiffs' amended complaint contains an exhibit J, which is also referred to in the complaint at paragraph 66. The exhibit is a pamphlet explaining the Newborn Screening program, which states in relevant part: \"you can say 'yes' or 'no' to blood spot research. You will be asked to check a box and sign a form found in your baby's newborn screening card. If you say 'yes,' all blood spots taken for newborn screening may be used, except for the blood spot saved for your own use if needed. If you say 'no,' blood spots will be stored but not used for research. You must contact MDHHS if you do not want blood spots stored for any reason after newborn screening.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Considering that the words \"asked\" and \"forced\" are hardly synonymous, the Court does not read this paragraph to allege that the parents were compelled to sign the consent forms, and will assume that the word \"forced\" was added in error. To the extent Plaintiffs wish to stand by the allegation that they were compelled to sign a consent form against their will, Plaintiffs are free to seek leave to amend and clarify this allegation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Plaintiffs rely on\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Mcneely\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that \"It is explicit from binding Supreme Court precedence [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ]-a nonconsensual search and seizure of blood requires a warrant and failure to obtain the same is a Fourth Amendment violation.\" Resp. at 39, ECF No. 45.

Here, there is no allegation that Plaintiffs' blood samples were used for any law enforcement purpose. It is one thing to contend that an individual has a privacy interest in his/her blood even if the blood is not being used for the purposes of criminal prosecution of that individual. It is quite another thing to contend that the case law prohibiting warrantless blood draws for law enforcement purposes creates a per se rule against warrantless blood draws in all situations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    section IV.
