First, all of the named Defendant officers in this case were present at the scene when McGrew was arrested. Second, the officers' names are listed on the arrest report entered by Defendant Williams. (Doc # 1-1) Third, it is undisputed that one of the Defendant officers did in fact arrest McGrew. Fourth, McGrew was later found to have bruising on her wrist by a medical professional. To support their position, Defendants focus largely on the physical appearance of each individual Defendant officer, all of whom are shorter than six feet, two inches tall, and only two of whom, Duncan and Williams, can accurately be described as a \"light skinned black man\" based on the photos provided by Defendants.

Civ. JI 115.09). This Court has already determined that a material issue of fact exists regarding McGrew's excessive force claims for handcuffing. There is a triable issue of fact as to whether the officers' conduct was reasonable based on the bruising McGrew experienced, and her alleged indication that the handcuffs were too tight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A reasonable juror could determine that a battery was committed against McGrew. Summary judgment on McGrew's battery claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Similarly, a reasonable juror could also determine McGrew was put on the ground to commit the alleged battery. Summary judgment on McGrew's assault claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants argue summary judgment should be granted regarding McGrew's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because Defendant officers conduct did not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct, and there is no evidence that they acted reckless or intended to inflict emotional distress on McGrew. McGrew argues that she suffered from intentional infliction of emotional distress when Defendants illegally broke down the front door of her home, slammed her to the ground, handcuffed her, ridiculed her weight, and seized her belongings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Regarding governmental immunity, there is not a dispute whether the Defendant officers were acting in good faith pursuant to a valid search warrant, and within the scope of their employment. Defendants have satisfied the first two factors in the\n   <em>\n    Odom\n   </em>\n   test. As stated previously, the act of handcuffing McGrew was ministerial in this instance. The search of a home and seizure of evidence of criminal activity after the area has been secured, is similarly ministerial. Governmental immunity does not apply to the search and seizure conducted at McGrew's home in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) intent or recklessness; (3) causation; and (4) severe emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

The officers forcibly entered her home pursuant to a valid search warrant. McGrew was put on the ground and handcuffed during the search of the area. The search warrant gave the officers authority to search the home for evidence of drug trafficking. McGrew has not alleged that the officer made her suffer any further physical abuse beyond the excessively tight handcuffing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress relies primarily on comments made by the handcuffing officer, who called her a \"bitch\" and told her she \"shouldn't be so fat.\" McGrew also testified that he kept calling her a \"bitch\" and later added, \"[I]f you don't shut your fucking mouth I can blow your head off and nothing can be done.\" (Doc # 41-3, Pg. 10, 34:11-23) While this conduct is reprehensible, it does not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   McGrew has not alleged that the officer pointed a gun at her, or provided any other indication that the threat was serious. McGrew has not alleged that the officer physically harmed her following the handcuffing. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to McGrew, there is nothing on the record that rises to the level of extreme and outrageous. McGrew's attempt to argue that the taking of her property supports her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress is insufficient because \"[t]here is no Michigan precedent that permits the recovery of damages for emotional injuries allegedly suffered as a consequence of property damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

In addition, Defendants argue that summary judgment should be granted with respect to the statutory conversion ( M.C.L. \u00a7 600.2919a ) claim because there is no evidence that any of the Defendant officers converted McGrew's property for his own use. McGrew argues that particular personal items were missing following the search that were not returned to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On the issue of governmental immunity, the search of a home and seizure of evidence of criminal activity after the area has been secured, is ministerial. Governmental immunity does not apply to the search and seizure conducted at McGrew's home in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Under Michigan law, \"conversion\" is defined as \"any distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another's personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.\"\n   <em>\n    Thoma v.

Defendants assert that there has been no evidence of conversion presented, and McGrew did not see any of the officers with the property that went missing. McGrew, however, testified that she did see one of the Defendant officers with her Ruger handgun. (Doc # 41-3, Pg. 33, 36:18-20) She also specified where each allegedly stolen item was located before the raid on her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:1-38:20) Neither party has any other evidence on the conversion claim. There is a material\n   issue of fact regarding the whereabouts of McGrew's allegedly stolen property, and a reasonable juror could determine that the Defendants officers took her belongs.

The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment with respect to McGrew's statutory conversion claim against all Defendants because she has not (1) pled the required use element of a statutory conversion claim (see Doc # 1, Pg. 9, \u00b6 65), or (2) provided evidence that establishes the use element of a statutory conversion claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
