CONCLUSION...852\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This case arises from the plaintiff's arrest by city police officers for riding his ATV on and in a ditch beside a city street, allegedly in violation of a state statute that the officers believed had been, but was not, incorporated into the city's code of ordinances. Although I granted summary judgment for the city and the individual police officers on the plaintiff's claim of violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and his claim of false arrest, I reserved ruling on the plaintiff's claims against the city for violations of the Iowa Constitution. I certified to the Iowa Supreme Court the question of whether a defendant can raise a defense of qualified immunity to an individual's claim for damages for violation of article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 8 of the Iowa Constitution. The Iowa Supreme Court has now answered that question in the affirmative and adopted the available qualified immunity defense, in a thoughtful majority opinion over an equally thoughtful defense. The city seeks leave to amend its answer to assert the qualified immunity defense newly-minted by the Iowa Supreme Court. I must decide whether to allow the proposed amendment and whether to rule on all the questions raised in the parties' reanimated cross-motions for summary judgment and supplemental briefing on the Iowa constitutional claims, in light of the Iowa Supreme Court's answer to the certified question, or, once again, to certify some of those questions to the Iowa Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The factual background to this case is set out in considerable detail in my prior ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin v. Estherville, Iowa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271460\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/987/#p989\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 989-93 (N.D. Iowa 2016), then by the Iowa Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Baldwin v. City of Estherville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261-65 (Iowa 2018). For present purposes, suffice it to say that, on November 10, 2013, Officers Reineke and Hellickson, of the Estherville City Police, were shown a video by a resident in the Estherville area of a person the officers identified as plaintiff Gregory Baldwin riding a 4-wheeler ATV that proceeded along North 4th Street and turned into a ditch, using the north Joe Hoye Park entrance, after which it continued in the ditch until it reached West 14th Avenue North, where it returned to the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The officers then reviewed IOWA CODE CH. 321I, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , permitted operation of ATVs only on streets designated by cities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   IOWA CODE \u00a7 321I.10(3), because the officers believed that Chapter 321I had been incorporated by reference into the City's Code of Ordinances when Chapter 321 was incorporated. They also consulted\n   <em>\n    The Handbook of Iowa All-Terrain Vehicle and Off-Highway Motorcycle\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regulations\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Handbook\n   </em>\n   ), which the defendants contended is a handbook frequently relied upon by police officers when determining whether off-road vehicles are operating in compliance with applicable laws. Finally, they discussed the matter with the City's police chief and a police captain. They concluded that the activity shown in the video amounted to a violation of City Ordinance E-321I.10. However, that Ordinance was not valid or in effect at the time, because it did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Officer Reineke prepared a citation and attempted to serve it on Baldwin at his home, but he was not there. Officer Reineke then refiled the citation with the notation \"Request Warrant.\" On November 12, 2013, a state magistrate entered an order directing that a warrant issue. On November 13, 2013, Officer Hellickson served the warrant on Baldwin and took him to jail. Baldwin's wife posted bond, and Baldwin later pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the days that followed, the City Attorney discovered that the City had not included IOWA CODE CH. 321I when it incorporated IOWA CODE CH. 321 into the City's Code of Ordinances. The City Attorney was granted leave to amend the charge to allege a violation of a different ordinance, City Ordinance 219-2(2). City Ordinance 219-2 generally permits ATVs to be operated on City streets except where prohibited, but subsection (2) prohibits operation of ATVs \"in city parks, playgrounds, or upon any publicly-owned property.\" On Baldwin's Motion For Adjudication Of Law Points And To Dismiss, the Iowa District Court found that the cited act was not a violation of the City's Code of Ordinances as written and dismissed the case. The state court did so only after making two key constructions of pertinent City Ordinances: (1) that the plain meaning of \"street\" in City Ordinances included the \"ditch,\" and (2) that \"publicly-owned property\" in City Ordinance 219-2(2), to the extent that it conflicted with another ordinance defining \"street,\" did not include the \"ditch\" of a City street.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271460\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/987/#p989\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d at 1000-1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Again, some of the procedural background is set out in more detail in my ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271460\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/987/#p989\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d at 993-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Suffice it to say that, on November 4, 2015, Baldwin filed his Petition, which became docket no. 3 in this action, in the Iowa District Court in and for Emmet County, against the City and Officers Reineke and Hellickson, in their individual and official capacities. He asserted four claims arising from his citation and arrest for the allegedly improper operation of his ATV on November 10, 2013. In Count I, against the City, Baldwin alleged a violation of article I, \u00a7 8 of the Iowa Constitution by subjecting him to an unreasonable seizure. In Count II, against defendants Reineke and Hellickson, in their individual capacities, he alleged a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by subjecting him to an unreasonable seizure. In Count III, against the City, he alleged a violation of article I, \u00a7 1 of the Iowa Constitution by violating his right to freedom, liberty, and happiness. Finally, in Count IV, against all defendants, he alleged a common-law claim of \"false arrest.\" He sought-and still seeks-damages, interest, costs of the action, attorney's fees, and such other relief as may be deemed just and equitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The defendants removed this case to this court on November 20, 2015, based on federal question jurisdiction, with supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367(a), 1441(a), and 1446. Thereafter, on November 23, 2015, the defendants filed a\n   joint Answer, denying Baldwin's claims and asserting various affirmative defenses, including immunity from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On November 18, 2016, on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, I granted the defendants' motion as to Baldwin's claims of a federal constitutional violation in Count II and state law false arrest in Count IV, denied Baldwin's motion for summary judgment on those claims, and stayed those parts of Baldwin's motion seeking summary judgment on his claims of Iowa constitutional violations in Counts I and III pending a decision by the Iowa Supreme Court on whether it would review the decision in\n   <em>\n    Conklin v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-0764,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=863%20N.W.2d%20301\">\n    863 N.W.2d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201332003\">\n    2015 WL 1332003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Iowa Ct. App. March 25, 2015) (table op.), which held that there is no private cause of action for a violation of the Iowa Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 17, 2017, at the request of the parties, I continued the trial in this matter indefinitely until the Iowa Supreme Court issued a ruling in either\n   <em>\n    Conklin\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    State v. Godfrey\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-0695, which also raised the question of whether the equal protection and due process provisions of the Iowa Constitution provide a direct action for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On June 30, 2017, the Iowa Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Godfrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12336656\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/898/844/\">\n    898 N.W.2d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Iowa 2017), holding that the equal protection and due process clauses of the Iowa Constitution, article I, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 9, are self-executing, such that a tort claim for monetary damages exists for violations of each, when the legislature has not provided an adequate remedy. The Iowa Supreme Court left open the question of whether defendants could assert qualified immunity as a defense to such claims. On June 30, 2017, the Iowa Supreme Court issued Procedendo and an order denying further review in\n   <em>\n    Conklin\n   </em>\n   . In light of\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   , the defendants filed a Second Motion For Summary Judgment on August 11, 2017, in which they assumed that the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   extends to other claims under the Iowa Constitution, and they sought summary judgment in their favor on what they contended was the remaining legal question of whether they are entitled to qualified immunity in connection with Baldwin's remaining Iowa constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On October 2, 2017, in response to the defendants' Second Motion For Summary Judgment, I entered an Order Certifying Question To The Iowa Supreme Court staying all proceedings in this court, as to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   issues, in their entirety, pending the Iowa Supreme Court's answer to the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Can a defendant raise a defense of qualified immunity to an individual's claim for damages for violation of article I, \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 8 of the Iowa Constitution ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The parties did not thereafter request the certification of any additional questions to the Iowa Supreme Court. On June 29, 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court answered the certified question, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A defendant who pleads and proves as an affirmative defense that he or she exercised all due care to conform with the requirements of the law is entitled to qualified immunity on an individual's claim for damages for violation of article I, sections 1 and 8 of the Iowa Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 260-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On July 10, 2018, Baldwin filed a Status Report stating that the Iowa Supreme Court had answered the certified question. He requested that I lift the stay in this proceeding and order supplemental briefing\n   on the unresolved portions of the motions for summary judgment concerning the application of Iowa's new qualified immunity defense to the facts of this case. On July 12, 2018, the City filed its Motion For Leave To Amend Answer in order to assert Iowa's new qualified immunity defense, which Baldwin resisted on July 13, 2018. On July 13, 2018, the City also filed a Status Report agreeing that supplemental briefing was appropriate on the remaining portions of the motions for summary judgment. The City also reported that it believed that the parties had completed discovery and that, subject to a ruling on the various pending motions, this case was now ready to be set for trial. The Iowa Supreme Court's opinion answering the certified question was filed in this court on July 23, 2018. On August 5, 2018, Baldwin filed a supplemental brief in support of his Motion For Summary Judgment, as to his Iowa constitutional claims and in resistance to the City's Second Motion For Summary Judgment. In that supplemental brief, Baldwin also seeks summary judgment that the defendants acted in reckless disregard for his rights under article I of the Iowa Constitution, as a gateway to a jury award of punitive damages, and a determination that he is entitled to attorney's fees. On August 6, 2018, the City filed a brief in support of its Motion For Leave To Amend Answer and in resistance to Baldwin's Motion For Summary Judgment on his Iowa constitutional claims, a determination of reckless disregard, and Baldwin's entitlement to attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On August 29, 2018, I entered an Order lifting the stay on proceedings in this case and indicating that a trial date would be set by separate order, after consultation with the parties. On August 30, 2018, I entered a Trial Management Order setting a jury trial for January 7, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I now turn to consideration of the various matters raised by the parties in light of the Iowa Supreme Court's answer to the certified question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. THE CITY'S MOTION TO AMEND ITS ANSWER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The City seeks leave to amend its Answer to add the new affirmative defense of \"all due care\" adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court in answer to this court's certified question. Although the defendants had asserted as one of several affirmative defenses in their original Answer that \"Defendants are immune from suit,\" the City seeks leave to add the following affirmative defense in an Amended Answer: \"Defendant's employees exercised all due care to conform with the requirements of the law and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\" Baldwin contends that leave to amend should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Arguments Of The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The City acknowledges that good cause for an untimely amendment under Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a showing that, despite diligence, the movant could not reasonably have offered the amendment sooner. The City contends that it can meet this requirement, because the \"all due care\" standard for qualified immunity adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court could not reasonably have been foreseen. This is so, the City argues, because Baldwin argued for adoption of a strict liability standard, while it argued for adoption of the federal qualified immunity analysis, but the Iowa Supreme Court declined to do either and, instead, fashioned a new affirmative defense based on proof that the defendants exercised \"all due care.\" The City argues that, while its proffered amendment is admittedly after the deadline for amendments, there is good cause for the timing of the proffered amendment under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In his resistance, Baldwin argues that the deadline for motions to amend pleadings\n   under the court's original Scheduling Order expired more than ten months ago and, indeed, was marked \"COMPLETED\" in the court's subsequent Scheduling Order entered on August 2, 2017. He also points out that discovery is completed. He argues that allowing the City to amend its Answer to add an \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense, which asserts a position contrary to the City's previous admission of negligence, would cause undue prejudice to him within the meaning of Rule 16. More specifically, he asserts that he intends to use the City's original negligence defense against them, so it would unduly prejudice him to allow the City to pursue an inconsistent defense. Baldwin also argues that allowing the amendment would be prejudicial, because it would force him to go to trial without the opportunity to discover just what the City's officers contend was their exercise of \"all due care.\" Next, he contends that the amendment should be rejected, because it is futile, where the proposed \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense is entirely inconsistent with the City's original negligence defense and legally insufficient. Finally, in his supplemental brief, Baldwin argues that the City cannot assert an immunity defense, because the Iowa Municipal Tort Claims Act eliminates any common-law immunity of the City, which Baldwin asserts includes Iowa's new \"all due care\" immunity. He also argues that there is no mention in cases from the common-law era of a qualified immunity defense for a municipality based on the good faith of municipal officers, so that the City never had such a defense at common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the portion of its supplemental brief addressing its request for leave to amend its Answer, the City argues that seeking leave to amend without undue delay, based on a new development in the law, as it did, here, is precisely the kind of \"circumstance\" in which justice requires that leave to amend be granted. The City also points out that it is the sole remaining defendant and that it is properly allowed to plead and prove the due care of its officers as a defense. The City contends that an adjudication that the officers exercised due care bars a plaintiff's vicarious-liability claim against a municipality. Contrary to Baldwin's contentions, the City argues that IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.4(1)(c) specifically provides for municipal immunity for any claim based upon an act or omission of an officer or employee exercising due care in the execution of a statute, ordinance, or regulation, whether the statute, ordinance, or regulation is valid. Thus, the City argues that it is entitled to plead and prove the officers' due care in order to establish its immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Baldwin does not dispute the City's assertion that he argued for \"strict liability\" for violation of the Iowa Constitution, with no immunity defense, while the City argued for \"qualified immunity\" following federal law. It is plain that the Iowa Supreme Court considered and rejected both of these suggestions in its ruling and, instead, opted for an \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense that was not advanced by either party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even to the extent that the proposed new defense is just a \"legal variation[ ] on a theme the parties had been litigating for years,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kmak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266614\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1030/#p1034\">\n    873 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is a \"variation\" in an unforeseen tonality, not just in a new key. Thus, this is a situation in which there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a significant \"change in the law,\" resulting in \"changed circumstances\" that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the parties in this case.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522897\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/935/#p948\">\n    694 F.3d at 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a lack of diligence \"[w]here there ha[d] been no change in the law, no newly discovered facts, or any other changed circumstance ... after the scheduling deadline for amending pleadings\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   I am not persuaded by Baldwin's contention that the defense was not pleaded. I note that the defendants did not plead an affirmative defense based only on \"qualified immunity,\" as adopted by the federal courts for federal constitutional claims, as Baldwin seems to contend. Rather, the defendants pleaded more generally that \"[d]efendants are immune from suit,\" which might reasonably encompass the \"all due care\" qualified immunity affirmative defense subsequently adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Nor am I persuaded by Baldwin's argument that he would be unduly prejudiced by the amendment. It is true that such things as delay of the disposition of the case, the costs of additional discovery, alteration of trial strategy, and loss of the benefit of a previously obtained summary judgment might constitute prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kmak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266614\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1030/#p1034\">\n    873 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1035 ;\n   <em>\n    Kozlov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251257\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/380/#p395\">\n    818 F.3d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, Baldwin's arguments that more discovery or alteration of his trial strategy (such as whether or not he can use the defendants' admission of \"negligence\" at trial) will be required by\n   the amendment are belied by his renewed assertion that he is entitled to summary judgment on his Iowa constitutional claims, even in light of the newly-adopted \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense,\n   <em>\n    on the existing record.\n   </em>\n   Also, neither party contended in its status reports after the Iowa Supreme Court answered the certified question that more discovery would be required before proceeding to summary judgment or trial. Some adjustment of trial strategies is necessarily required\n   <em>\n    for both parties\n   </em>\n   when new, controlling law changes the requirements for proof of a claim or defense, as is the case, here. Thus, the adjustment of strategies to new\n   <em>\n    law\n   </em>\n   is not the sort of prejudice that should preclude an amendment.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kozlov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251257\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/380/#p395\">\n    818 F.3d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding prejudice from alteration of tactics and the need for additional discovery based on a newly-pleaded, but long-recognized claim);\n   <em>\n    Kmak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266614\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1030/#p1034\">\n    873 F.3d at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Also, I am not persuaded by Baldwin's assertion that the proposed amendment to assert an \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense is futile. While it is possible that the City might not\n   <em>\n    win\n   </em>\n   on that defense, for some of the reasons stated by Baldwin, it is not plain to me that the City's reliance on the new defense is deficient as a matter of law or contrary to a determination that the court has made or, for that matter, contrary to admissions that the City has made, that the officers were \"negligent.\"\n   <em>\n    Zutz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224518\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/842/#p850\">\n    601 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   850 ;\n   <em>\n    Mississippi River Revival, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9335639\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/1013/#p1018\">\n    319 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (an amendment may be futile if it is contrary to determinations the court has already made).

Certainly, I never held that the officers' conduct was negligent in all relevant respects, even if I acknowledged that the defendants had\n   <em>\n    argued\n   </em>\n   that the record shows no more than negligence. Baldwin's argument that no reasonable juror could find that the officers exercised \"all due care\" applies a summary judgment standard, rather than the applicable Rule 12(b) standard for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Zutz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224518\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/842/#p850\">\n    601 F.3d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To put it another way, allowing the City to amend its Answer to assert an \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense over Baldwin's \"futility\" objection would not be inconsistent with or otherwise prevent me from granting summary judgment in favor of Baldwin on that defense on his Motion For Partial Summary Judgment, as supplemented\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Baldwin's last argument is that the City is not entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense based on the allegation that its officers acted with \"all due care.\" Baldwin is correct that IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.2 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, every municipality is subject to liability for its torts and those of its officers and employees, acting within the scope of their employment or duties, whether arising out of a governmental or proprietary function.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.2(1).

Rather, as the parties are well aware, it is a qualified immunity defense just adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court and applicable specifically to tortious violations of the Iowa Constitution, which were also just recognized as the basis for claims for damages. In answering the certified question in this case, the Iowa Supreme Court recognized that Iowa courts have a role in crafting a remedy for a claim for damages for a violation of the Iowa Constitution as established in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Any claim based upon an act or omission of an officer or employee of the municipality,\n   <em>\n    exercising due care\n   </em>\n   , in the execution of a statute, ordinance, or regulation whether the statute, ordinance or regulation is valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of the municipality or an officer or employee of the municipality, whether or not the discretion is abused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.4(1)(c) (emphasis added). Thus, to the extent that the Iowa Municipal Tort Claims Act applies to the Iowa constitutional claims at issue, the immunity of the City for acts of its officers \"exercising due care\" is established\n   <em>\n    by statute.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, contrary to Baldwin's assertions, in answering the certified question in this case, the Iowa Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   address whether a municipal defendant, as well as an individual defendant, may assert the new qualified immunity defense.\n   <em>\n    Only\n   </em>\n   the City was a defendant in this case, after I granted summary judgment on Baldwin's federal constitutional claim and false arrest claim, because\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the City was named as a defendant on Baldwin's Iowa constitutional claims in the first place. Thus, at the time of certification of the question to the Iowa Supreme Court, the City was the only remaining defendant. The question I certified was not specifically limited to either municipal or individual defendants, because it was phrased in terms of whether \"a defendant\" can raise a defense of qualified immunity to an individual's claim for damages for the violations of the Iowa Constitution at issue, here. Thus, the Iowa Supreme Court was plainly aware that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   defendant in question was the City, but that court also did not formulate the qualified immunity defense in terms that limited its application only to individual officers\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a municipality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Although I believe the Iowa Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the City could assert qualified immunity, the dissenters to the decision answering the certified question stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [T]he issue of municipal liability for damages caused by the unconstitutional conduct of its employees was not presented by the parties in this case, is not addressed in the majority opinion, and is reserved for another day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Appel, J., joined by Hecht, J., dissenting).

Similarly, in support of the defendants' Second Motion For Summary Judgment, the defendants argued only that they were entitled to qualified immunity to the Iowa constitutional claims under the federal standard, which also is no longer viable in light of the Iowa Supreme Court's answer to the certified question. In its supplemental brief, the City does not renew a request for summary judgment on its qualified immunity defense, as that defense has been adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court. Rather, the City asserts simply that genuine issues of material fact on the new defense should defeat Baldwin's Motion For Partial Summary Judgment, as supplemented.

The Iowa Constitutional Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In his Motion For Partial Summary Judgment, as supplemented, Baldwin first seeks summary judgment on his claims for violations of the Iowa Constitution. More specifically, he seeks summary judgment that his rights under article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 8 of the Iowa Constitution were violated and that the City is not entitled to the newly-adopted \"all due care\" affirmative defense. I believe that the claim or claims that Baldwin asserts under the Iowa Constitution require some further clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Nature of the claim or claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In Count I of his Petition, Baldwin alleges that the City, through its officers, acting within the scope of their employment, violated his rights under article I, \u00a7 8 of the Iowa Constitution, when the officers took him into custody without probable cause to believe that a criminal offense had been committed. In Count III, he alleges that the City, through its officers, acting within the scope of their employment, violated his rights under article I, \u00a7 1 of the Iowa Constitution, when the officers took him into custody without a criminal offense having been committed. Although Baldwin has asserted two claims in two counts of his Petition, I believe that he is actually asserting only a single claim of a violation of the Iowa Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   I reach this conclusion based on Baldwin's arguments in his original summary judgment motion and in his supplemental brief. Baldwin asserts in both that, by analogy to equal protection law under the Iowa Constitution, which the Iowa Supreme Court held \"arises out of the confluence of article I, section 1 and article I, section 6,\"\n   <em>\n    McQuistion v. City of Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839273\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/872/817/\">\n    872 N.W.2d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 n.6 (Iowa 2015), search and seizure law under the Iowa Constitution arises out of the \"confluence\" of article I, \u00a7 1 and article I, \u00a7 8, where article I, \u00a7 1 protects individuals' rights, while article I, \u00a7 8, prevents the government from engaging in unreasonable\n   searches and seizures. Thus, Baldwin appears to assert only one violation of the Iowa Constitution, based on this \"confluence\" of the two sections. Indeed, in his now reanimated Motion For Partial Summary Judgment, he argues that \"the Defendants, acting under color of state law, arrested and jailed [him] without probable cause in violation of his article I, section 8, [and] article I, section 1... rights.\" Similarly, in his supplemental brief, based on a single discussion of whether there was probable cause, he argues, \"Concerning whether [his] article I rights were violated, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and [he] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Thus, there is only one Iowa constitutional claim at issue, based on a lack of probable cause for Baldwin's arrest, in violation of Baldwin's right to be free of an unreasonable search and seizure, even though that single claim is based on two provisions of the Iowa Constitution and was pleaded in two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

Arguments of the parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Baldwin argues that an unreasonable search and seizure claim under article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 8 of the Iowa Constitution is not coextensive with such a claim under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He points out that I concluded that the officers made a mistake of law, which supported probable cause under the Fourth Amendment, but he contends that such a mistake of law is not sufficient to satisfy the Iowa Constitution, because, under the Iowa Constitution, neither good faith nor a mistake of law, whether reasonable or not, supports probable cause. It appears that the only argument that the City raises concerning whether or not there was a violation of the Iowa Constitution is its contention that, at the very least, reasonable reliance by the officers on a facially valid warrant means that there is a jury question with respect to whether the challenged conduct of the officers breached a duty not to arrest Baldwin without probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

No party to this case can be in any doubt that the key issue at this point in the litigation is the availability of the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense to the City, and the parties have had a full and fair opportunity to marshal any pertinent evidence and arguments on that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barkley, Inc. v.

The \"all due care\" defense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   What is at issue in this case are the precise contours of the newly-minted \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense and precisely what the relevant factors are in determining whether it is applicable. These are issues of first impression, because no court has so far applied the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific factual circumstances. Nevertheless, my analysis of the Iowa Supreme Court's decision adopting the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense does suggest some pertinent considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   First, in the course of answering the certified question, the Iowa Supreme Court stated that \"the right to recover damages for a constitutional violation does not need to be congruent with the constitutional violation itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More specifically,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   Such an approach is not consistent with Iowa precedent or Restatement section 874A, and would result in too little play in the joints. Logically, the threshold of proof to\n   <em>\n    stop\n   </em>\n   an unconstitutional course of conduct ought to be less than the proof required to\n   <em>\n    recover damages\n   </em>\n   for it. Indeed, if a right of recovery for a constitutional tort existed whenever a constitutional violation occurred, it stands to reason that such recovery could not be subject to other limits, such as a statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 278-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the determination, above, that Baldwin's rights under article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 8 of the Iowa Constitution were violated, does not necessarily mean that he is entitled to recover damages for that violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Next, the Iowa Supreme Court defined the defense as \"all due care,\" but the City refers to it at times in its supplemental brief as \"due care\" or \"ordinary care,\" equating it with a \"negligence\" standard. Equating \"all due care\" with a \"negligence\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   standard appears to be appropriate. In answering the certified question, the Iowa Supreme Court explained, in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   We have decided not to follow any of these lines of authority [previously discussed] exactly. We believe instead that qualified immunity should be shaped by the historical Iowa common law as appreciated by our framers and the principles discussed in Restatement (Second) of Torts section 874A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   <em>\n    This means due care as the benchmark.

Indeed, the court emphasized, \"Constitutional torts are torts, not generally strict liability cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also expressly did not address \"the possibility that constitutional claims other than unlawful search and seizure may have a higher mens rea requirement, such as intent, embedded within the constitutional provision itself. In other words, it may take more than negligence just to violate the Iowa Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These statements reinforce the understanding of the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense as embodying a \"negligence\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   There is still more to be gleaned from the Iowa Supreme Court's decision answering the certified question. The defense is not based on \"all due care,\" standing alone. Rather, the Iowa Supreme Court stated the defense in terms of proof that the defendant \"exercised all due care\n   <em>\n    to conform to [or with] the requirements of the law.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    at 260-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (with), 279 (to), 281 (to) (emphasis added). For example, it appears that, although \"objective reasonableness\" of the defendant's conduct is relevant to qualified immunity for a violation of the Iowa Constitution, just as it is relevant to qualified immunity for a violation of the United States Constitution, \"exercising all due care to conform with the requirements of the law\" imposes a greater burden on defendants than not violating \"clearly established ... constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194865\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/800/#p818\">\n    457 U.S. at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194865\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/800/#p818\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Iowa Supreme Court said as much, when it explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   As we have noted, a number of states allow\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   immunity for direct constitutional claims.

The distinction appears to me to be between\n   <em>\n    taking reasonable action\n   </em>\n   to \"conform\" to the requirements of the law, under the Iowa \"all due care\" qualified immunity standard, and\n   <em>\n    avoiding action\n   </em>\n   one should reasonably know would violate the law, under the\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   federal qualified immunity standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The Iowa Supreme Court also suggested that \"all due care\" encompasses some kind of \"good faith.\" Notwithstanding that, as pointed out, above, the Iowa Supreme Court rejected a \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule in\n   <em>\n    Cline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11188607\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/617/277/#p281\">\n    617 N.W.2d at 284-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court was aware of the potential impact of \"good faith\" on a damages action for a search or seizure that violated the Iowa Constitution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   There is simply no meaningful remedy available to one who has suffered an illegal search other than prohibiting the State from benefiting from its constitutional violation. A civil remedy would probably be unsuccessful because the good faith that prevents exclusion would also preclude an action for damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <em>\n    Cline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11188607\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/617/277/#p281\">\n    617 N.W.2d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Cline\n   </em>\n   suggests that, while \"good faith\" is irrelevant to the constitutional violation, it is relevant to the issue of damages.

It appears likely to me that reliance on a non-existent ordinance did not involve the exercise of \"all due care\" as a matter of law, and that Baldwin would be entitled to summary judgment on the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense, if a mistake as to the existence of the ordinance the officers relied upon were all that the defense is based on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   On the other hand, it is possible that the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense is properly applicable to the officers' mistake of law in this case about the existence of Ordinance E321I.10. For example, the officers' mistake may be more akin to the mistake of the justice of the peace and the constable in\n   <em>\n    Hetfield\n   </em>\n   in taking away the plaintiff's oxen. The officers, in what they did, were in the performance of their official duties as Estherville police officers. Therefore, unless they exceeded their jurisdiction, or acted corruptly, or without authority of law, they would not be liable. Although the officers might have acted erroneously, still they may not be liable for an unconstitutional search and seizure under the Iowa Constitution. Baldwin, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hetfield\n   </em>\n   , had his remedy when the Iowa District Court dismissed the charge against him. Furthermore, Baldwin admits that the officers were acting in the scope of their employment, and he has not pointed to evidence that demonstrates \"bad faith,\" while they have pleaded that they acted in good faith in the performance of their duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   276 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hetfield\n   </em>\n   , 3 Greene at 584-85 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The erroneous reliance on a non-existent ordinance is not the only issue in the application of the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense or, indeed, the factor on which the City focuses. Rather, the City argues that the officers' reasonable reliance on a facially valid warrant means that there is a jury question with respect to whether their challenged conduct breached a duty to exercise \"all due care.\" In my ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, I concluded that the officers' reliance on a warrant issued on the basis of an alleged violation of City Ordinance E321I.10, which did not exist, was not a basis for qualified immunity to Baldwin's federal constitutional claim, because no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that such a warrant should issue.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271460\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/987/#p989\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The officers' error in reliance on the warrant was exactly the same as their mistake in citing Baldwin for a violation of a non-existent ordinance, in the first place: it was the result of a sloppy study of the laws the officers were duty-bound to enforce. Because of that, on an objective basis, I concluded that it was obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue based on an alleged violation of an ordinance that did not exist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271460\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/987/#p989\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks and citations omitted). If anything, the lack of immunity to an Iowa constitutional claim on this basis appears to me to be even more obvious, because, again, this mistake resulted from a failure to exercise due care to conform to the requirements of the law, that is, to\n   <em>\n    take reasonable action\n   </em>\n   to comply with the law, not merely to\n   <em>\n    avoid action\n   </em>\n   that one should reasonably know would violate the law.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , page 843. Likewise, had the officers done their minimum homework and informed the neutral magistrate that no such ordinance existed, no magistrate could have reasonably issued the warrant based on the then available information in position of the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Nevertheless, it is possible that the Iowa Supreme Court could conclude that the \"all due care\" qualified immunity defense is properly applicable to the officers' reliance on a warrant for Baldwin's arrest for violating an ordinance that did not exist. The officers might have taken the magistrate's\n   issuance of a warrant as settling any doubts about the validity of the ordinance and about the existence of probable cause that the ordinance was violated by Baldwin's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams v. City of Alexander, Ark.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315407\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1307/#p1311\">\n    772 F.3d 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311 (8th Cir. 2014) (\"The fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner.\" (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ). One reason that the Iowa Supreme Court rejected reliance on a warrant as establishing an exception to the exclusionary rule was that \"[c]ommon sense tells us that the exclusionary rule prompts more care and attention at all stages of the warrant-issuing process, including by the judicial officers issuing the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Cline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11188607\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/617/277/#p281\">\n    617 N.W.2d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Holding the City (or the officers, if they were defendants on the Iowa constitutional claims) liable for damages for the judicial officer's error in issuing a warrant based on a non-existent ordinance would not serve that broader deterrent purpose of prompting more care and attention by judicial officers issuing warrants, but would place the consequences of the failure on the police officers, who did not have the last say in the matter, or their employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   I also believe that it is likely that \"all due care\" qualified immunity is not available based on the issue of whether a reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue\n   <em>\n    based on Baldwin's conduct known to the officers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on an\n   <em>\n    alternative basis\n   </em>\n   for probable cause. In my prior ruling, as to qualified immunity to the federal constitutional clam, I concluded that it was not clearly established that Baldwin's conduct-operating his ATV in a ditch that was publicly-owned property-did not violate City Ordinance 219-2(2) prior to the Iowa District Court's interpretation of that Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271460\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/987/#p989\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No advisory judicial construction could be obtained, however, and I doubt even recourse to the City Attorney would have led the defendants to the conclusion that the construction subsequently made by the Iowa District Court was the only reasonable construction of City Ordinance 219-2(2).

Can the City assert qualified immunity to a claim for damages for violation of the Iowa Constitution based on its officers' exercise of \"all due care\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   2. If the City can assert such a defense, on the facts presented in this case, does the City have \"all due care\" qualified immunity to liability for damages for the violation of Baldwin's right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure under article I of the Iowa Constitution? This question necessarily includes questions about the extent to which reliance on a warrant may satisfy the \"all due care\" standard and whether the \"all due care\" analysis considers alternative bases for probable cause or a warrant on which the officers did not rely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Additional questions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   I turn, next, to additional questions of first impression raised in Baldwin's supplemental briefing. First, Baldwin seeks summary judgment that the defendants acted in reckless disregard of his rights under article I of the Iowa Constitution, as a gateway to a jury award of punitive damages. He argues that, notwithstanding that IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.4(1)(e) bars claims for punitive damages against a municipality, the Iowa Supreme Court has affirmed the award of punitive damages for a case based on a defendant's \"wanton and reckless\" disregard of the plaintiff's Iowa constitutional rights in\n   <em>\n    Krehbiel v. Henkle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2182164\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/iowa/152/604/\">\n    152 Iowa 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20N.W.%20945\">\n    129 N.W. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1911), and that the issue was raised in the dissent to the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion answering the first certified question in this case and in the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   . Baldwin contends that, more generally, under IOWA CODE \u00a7 668A.1(1)(a) and applicable case law, \"reckless disregard of the rights of another\" is sufficient to award punitive damages. He then argues that the officers acted with \"reckless disregard\" in arresting him. In response, the City argues that IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.4(1)(e) bars punitive damages claims against municipalities and that there is no Iowa case that holds to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   I am not in a position to decide whether the Iowa Supreme Court's recognition of a claim for damages for a violation of the Iowa Constitution, as established in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   , is better served by (1) maintaining the bar on punitive damages against a municipality pursuant to IOWA CODE \u00a7 670.4(1)(e) for Iowa constitutional violations, or (2) lifting that bar and either (a) reaffirming the standard for punitive damages that is otherwise applicable, or (b) adopting some different standard for punitive damages against a municipality for an Iowa constitutional violation by its officers or employees. That is a question for the Iowa Supreme Court in its role in crafting a remedy for a claim for damages for such a violation.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the third and fourth questions on which I believe that an authoritative answer by the Iowa Supreme Court will be determinative in this case are the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   3. If punitive damages are an available remedy against an individual defendant for a violation of a plaintiff's rights under the Iowa Constitution, can punitive damages be awarded against a municipality that employed the individual defendant and, if so, under what standard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   4. If punitive damages are available in answer to the previous question, would a reasonable jury be able to find that the applicable standard was met on the facts presented in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In his supplemental brief, Baldwin also seeks a determination that he is entitled to attorney's fees. He argues that his claim\n   for violation of his right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure under article I, \u00a7 8 of the Iowa Constitution has already achieved significant benefit, specifically, a departure from the federal qualified immunity standard for such claims. He asserts that he is a prevailing party as a catalyst to a change in Iowa law. He might now add that he has prevailed on his Iowa constitutional claim to the extent that I found a violation of his rights under the Iowa Constitution, notwithstanding that I have not resolved the question of the City's \"all due care\" qualified immunity to that claim. He argues that, if attorney's fees are not awarded for violation of Iowa constitutional rights, it will leave a gaping hole in available remedies. The City argues that there is no authorization for punitive damages for a violation of the Iowa Constitution under state law, so Baldwin's opportunity to recover attorney's fees disappeared with his federal claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Again, I am not in a position to decide whether the Iowa Supreme Court's recognition of a claim for damages for a violation of the Iowa Constitution, as established in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   , is better served by allowing or prohibiting an award of attorney's fees for some degree of success on such a claim. That is a question for the Iowa Supreme Court in its role in crafting a remedy for a claim for damages for such a violation.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557163\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/915/259/#p261\">\n    915 N.W.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is possible that the Iowa Supreme Court would apply Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA) standards to the question of whether to award attorney fees, but that court may depart from the ICRA standards in performing its role in crafting a remedy for a claim for damages for a violation of the Iowa Constitution as established in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the fifth question on which I believe that an authoritative answer by the Iowa Supreme Court will be determinative in this case is the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   5. If an award of attorney's fees would have been available against an individual defendant for a plaintiff who attains some degree of success on a claim of a violation of a plaintiff's rights under the Iowa Constitution, would they be available against a municipality that employed the individual defendant and, if so, under what standard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Application Of The Certification Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   I now conclude that each of these questions meets the Iowa Supreme Court's standards for certified questions. Each question (1) is a question of Iowa law, (2) may be determinative of Baldwin's case, which is pending in this court, and (3) appears to me to be one for which there is no controlling Iowa precedent.\n   <em>\n    Board of Water Works Trustees of City of Des Moines\n   </em>\n   , 890 N.W.2d at 56.
