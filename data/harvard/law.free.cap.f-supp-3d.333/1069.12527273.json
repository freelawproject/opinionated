If no coverage exists, then A.Z. cannot succeed on her claim to recover benefits or for breach of fiduciary duties for denying such benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that the Plan provides coverage to A.Z. for \"Mental Health Services\" which specifically includes \"Residential Care\" provided by a licensed facility. Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 25-26. The Amended Complaint asserts that Evoke's wilderness program is a covered facility within the corresponding terms of the Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Defendants dispute this characterization and argue that the program is not a benefit covered under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Plan covers Mental Health Services for treatment of Mental Health Conditions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Plan covers \"Mental Health Services for treatment of Mental Health Conditions.\" Plan at Regence 0041. Clarifying this term, the Plan provides the following definitions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Mental Health Conditions\n   </em>\n   means mental disorders in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association except as otherwise excluded in this [Plan].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Mental Health Services\n   </em>\n   means Medically Necessary outpatient services, Residential Care, partial hospital program or inpatient services provided by a licensed facility or licensed individuals with the exception of Skilled Nursing Facility Services ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Residential Care\n   </em>\n   means care received in an organized program which is provided by a residential facility or Hospital, or other facility licensed, for the particular level of care for which reimbursement is being sought, by the state in which the treatment is provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517036\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1155/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties' coverage dispute centers on these definitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Mental Health Condition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that \"A.Z. has a diagnosed mental illness, depression, which is contained in the most recent edition of the DSM [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders].\" Amended Complaint at \u00b6 24. Thus, A.Z. has alleged that she suffers from a Mental Health Condition expressly covered by the Plan. Plan at Regence 0041. A.Z. alleges that, to treat this condition, her doctors recommended that she attend Evoke's wilderness program. Amended Complaint at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Mental Health Services &amp; Residential Care\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Addressing the Plan's \"Residential Care\" definition, the parties' dispute whether the Evoke wilderness program was (1) an organized program (2) provided by a facility that was (3) licensed for the particular level of care for which reimbursement was sought. As to the first issue, the Amended Complaint alleges that \"Evoke is, and was while A.Z. received treatment, licensed as an 'outdoor youth program.' \" Amended Complaint at \u00b6 20, Exhibit B. Evoke's licensing certificate expressly authorizes Evoke to operate an \"Outdoor Youth Program\" pursuant to ORS 418.205 through .327.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit B. ORS 418.205(6)(a) defines \"outdoor youth program\" as \"a program that provides, in an outdoor living setting, services to children who have ... mental health problems ....\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint at \u00b6 21 (quoting the statute). The Amended Complaint's allegations that Evoke's wilderness program is \"an organized program\" licensed by the State of Oregon fall squarely within the definition of Residential Care provided by the Plan. Plan at Regence 0041.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Concerning whether Evoke is a \"facility\" within the definition of Residential Care, the Amended Complaint alleges that Evoke is both a \"residential facility\" and \"facility\" under the Plan's definition of Residential Care. Amended Complaint at \u00b6 2. The Plan does not define the word \"facility,\" and Defendants urge the Court to apply the term's ordinary meaning in arguing that a \"facility\" should be limited to a \"brick and mortar\" structure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants' \"brick and mortar\" argument is unconvincing, as the ordinary meaning of \"facility\" is not so restrictive. The common dictionary definition of \"facility\" supplied by Defendants includes \"something ... that is ... established to serve a particular purpose.\" Facility,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed. 2018),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facility. That same dictionary also provides an alternative definition of facility, which Defendants appear to ignore: \"something that makes an action, operation, or course of conduct easier[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drawing all inferences in favor of A.Z., as it must on a motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that Evoke's wilderness program could plausibly qualify as a \"facility\" under both definitions. On the one hand, A.Z. alleges that Evoke was established to serve the particular purpose of providing treatment to children suffering from various conditions, including depression.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 1,\n   3, 19-21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, the Amended Complaint alleges that the Evoke wilderness program is \"something\" that makes the treatment of mental health disorders in children easier. The Court disagrees with Defendants' myopic view of what a \"wilderness program\" is and, for purposes of resolving the instant Motion, concludes that A.Z. has plausibly alleged that Evoke is a facility within the definition of Residential Care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the Court is satisfied that it is at least plausible that Evoke was \"licensed for the particular level of care for which the reimbursement is being sought.\" Plan at Regence 0041. The Claim Forms attached to the Amended Complaint as Exhibit 11 show that Evoke sought reimbursement for \"PSYCH-OUTDOOR B/H PROGRAM\" using billing code \"1001.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, Exhibit F (Evoke Claim Forms). This description aligns with the level of care that Evoke is authorized to provide under its license issued by the State of Oregon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 418.205(6)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ignoring the description Evoke used in seeking reimbursement, Defendants argue that Evoke improperly sought reimbursement using the \"1001\" code, which should be reserved for \"residential treatment.\" Motion at 11; Reply at 5-6. Defendants conclude that because Evoke was not licensed to provide residential treatment, it sought reimbursement for a level of care that it was not licensed to provide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even if Defendants are correct-an issue that is best left for the discovery phase of this litigation-the competing inference, if any, created by Evoke's use of the \"1001\" code must be resolved against Defendants and in A.Z.'s favor. Defendants' argument is therefore insufficient to warrant dismissal of A.Z.'s first and second claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Together, the Amended Complaint plausibly alleges that the Evoke wilderness program was an \"organized program\" and a \"facility\" licensed for the particular level of care for which reimbursement was sought. Thus, the care that Evoke provided to A.Z. was \"Residential Care\" falling within the Plan's definition of \"Mental Health Services.\" Because A.Z.'s depression is a \"Mental Health Condition\" under the Plan, the Court is satisfied that the treatment she received at the Evoke wilderness program is plausibly covered by the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Whether Evoke's wilderness program is excluded\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Amended Complaint also alleges that Defendants improperly denied coverage by relying on the Plan's \"Counseling in the Absence of Illness\" exclusion. Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, 44-53, 56, 59-62. Defendants argue that A.Z. \"fails to assert plausible assertions that the 'Counseling in the Absence of Illness' exclusion does not apply under the plain language of the Plan.\" Motion at 11-12. The Plan's Counseling in the Absence of Illness exclusion provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Services for counseling in the absence of illness, not expressly described in this plan as a Covered Service, will not be covered. Examples of non-covered services: educational, social, image, behavioral or recreational therapy; sensory movement groups; marathon group therapy; sensitivity training; Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services; [and] wilderness programs ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517036\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1155/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Regence 0055.

The\n   <em>\n    Welp\n   </em>\n   court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the defendants maintained a \"blanket exclusion for services at wilderness treatment centers.\" Construing the plan documents, the court concluded that the defendants properly applied the plan's criteria for determining whether a program is covered. Specifically, the court noted that the reasons defendants gave in denying coverage-including the program's lack of a multidisciplinary team and consistent supervision of professionals-were legitimate criteria listed in the plan and qualified as non-quantitative treatment limitations under the Parity Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. In drawing this conclusion, the court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   the denial of coverage for a requested benefit pursuant to a limitation is not the same thing as an\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   limitation prohibiting coverage for that benefit.

The\n   <em>\n    Welp\n   </em>\n   court thus identified two possible ways to allege a Parity Act violation. A claimant can allege that she was denied coverage pursuant to a limitation, but must correctly identify that limitation and compare it to a relevant analogue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6 (finding that the plaintiff did not meet this standard). In addition, a claimant can also allege that a wilderness program met the plan's criteria in situations \"where the individual program in question confounds the categorical distinctions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5, n.8. Thus, if a claimant's wilderness program treatment satisfies the limitations imposed in the claimant's plan, she might still be entitled to proceed to the merits of her claim to determine (1) what\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   limitations, if any, the defendant imposed in denying coverage; and (2) whether those limitations violate the Parity Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, A.Z. alleges both theories identified by the court in\n   <em>\n    Welp\n   </em>\n   . Although she alleges that the face of the Plan impermissibly excludes wilderness programs in violation of the Parity Act, she also alleges that the wilderness program satisfied all criteria for coverage under the Plan. In contrast to the pertinent plan provisions at issue in\n   <em>\n    Welp\n   </em>\n   that excluded\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   wilderness programs that did not qualify as PRTFs, the Plan here merely lists wilderness programs as an example of an excluded service that would not be covered \"in the absence of illness.\" Without specifying any criteria that could be analogized to the pertinent non-quantitative treatment limitations articulated in the Parity Act, Defendants explained that, under their interpretation of the Plan, wilderness programs are not covered. For example, in their October 17, 2016 denial letter, Defendants stated that \"this is not a determination of medical necessity; rather, it is a limitation of your health care contract.\" Amended Complaint, Exhibit D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because the Amended Complaint alleges that the Plan covers the services A.Z. received at the Evoke wilderness program,\n   <em>\n    Welp\n   </em>\n   does not control the outcome of this case.

Drawing all reasonable inferences in A.Z.'s favor, this is enough to state a Parity Act violation for purposes of resisting a motion to dismiss. This makes sense, as requiring A.Z. to specify the exact process by which Defendants reached their decision on outdoor/wilderness behavioral healthcare programs \"would likely create a serious obstacle\" to an otherwise meritorious Parity Act claim.\n   <em>\n    Bushell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201578167\">\n    2018 WL 1578167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Likewise, A.Z. alleges that \"[w]hile Regence generally covers medical and surgical services when provided in intermediate settings, it has a practice of excluding wilderness therapy - a form of intermediate therapy to treat mental illnesses.\n   <strong>\n    This practice occurs even when exclusion is not permitted by the plan\n   </strong>\n   .\" Amended Complaint at \u00b6 67 (emphasis added). Put differently, A.Z. contends that the improper exclusion occurs in application rather than by the Plan's terms.

Reading these allegations and the Amended Complaint in a light most favorable to A.Z., as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, the Court concludes the allegations that Defendants disparately apply an otherwise \"facially neutral plan term\" are sufficient for purposes of withstanding dismissal at the pleadings stage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203518511\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that A.Z. has met the applicable pleading standards in stating a Parity Act violation.

This case should proceed to the discovery phase and A.Z. should be permitted to test the processes Defendants employ in denying coverage for outdoor/wilderness behavioral healthcare programs and whether such disparate application of the \"Counseling in the Absence of Illness\" exclusion in fact exists.

A.Z. relies on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-5(a), which provides that \"a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance\n   coverage shall not discriminate with respect to participation under the plan or coverage against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that provider's license or certification under applicable State law.\" Amended Complaint at \u00b6 102.

Under this rule, A.Z. posits that Defendants are restricted to relying on the Plan's \"Counseling in the Absence of Illness\" exclusion, since that was the only reason Defendants offered in denying coverage prior to this federal court litigation. The Court disagrees. While the focus of Defendants' denial was certainly on the \"Counseling in the Absence of Illness\" exclusion, the record suggests that Defendants conveyed to A.Z. that they were denying coverage \"[a]ccording to the terms of [the] health care plan\" in general.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Amended Complaint, Exhibit D (October 17, 2016, denial letter). Moreover, the exclusion itself extends only to services \"not expressly described in this plan as a Covered Service.\" Plan at Regence 55. Thus, out of an abundance of caution, the Court finds it necessary to determine whether the Amended Complaint has plausibly alleged that the Evoke wilderness program is covered by the Plan but for the \"Counseling in the Absence of Illness\" exclusion.
