BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant FXCM was one of the first brokerage firms to permit retail customers to trade currency in the retail foreign exchange (\"FX\") market. (Compl.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 31.) Dror Niv is one of the founders of FXCM and was, at all relevant times, its CEO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff is an institutional investor that purchased FXCM common stock from March 17, 2014, up to and including January 20, 2015 (the \"Class Period\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 27.) Plaintiff brings this putative class action on behalf of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired FXCM stock during the Class Period and were damaged thereby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    FXCM's Business and the FX Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FXCM gives its customers access to the FX market, allowing them to bet on changes in prices for certain currency pairs, such as the Euro against the Swiss Franc (\"EUR/CHF\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Whenever an FX trader buys one currency-known as trading \"long\"-that trader simultaneously sells another currency, such as by simultaneously buying Euros and selling Swiss Francs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Most retail brokerage firms earn revenue through what is known as a \"principal model.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Under that model, the broker takes the opposite side of its customers' trades, meaning that when the customer takes a loss on a trade, the broker profits (and, conversely, when the customer makes a profit, the broker takes a loss). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) FXCM, by contrast, primarily relied on an \"agency model,\" under which FXCM served as an intermediary between its customer and banks serving as \"liquidity providers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under this model, FXCM did not profit when its customers lost money, but instead earned commissions on trades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Because FXCM did not take the opposite side of its customers' trades, it was not exposed to the risk that a customer's profit would result in a loss the FXCM, as the customer's counterparty. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although FXCM's business model eliminated the \"principal risk\"-acting as its customers' counterparty-FXCM was still exposed to certain changes in currency prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45.) One type of risk FXCM faced resulted from its practice of permitting customers to use leverage to place trades for amounts much larger than the amount of collateral posted in their account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Customers in the United States, for example, were permitted to trade with leverage up to 50:1, meaning a customer with $100 in collateral could post a trade up to $5,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) The leverage permitted in other countries was higher, such as up to 500:1 in Australia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Under FXCM's agreements with its customers, in the event that a customer suffered a loss, the customer would be responsible only for the amount of collateral\n   the customer posted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Thus, if a loss exceeded the customer's collateral, FXCM would responsible for paying that excess loss, known as \"negative equity\" or a \"debit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) In this way, although FXCM was not exposed to the \"principal risk\" that could result in losses when its customers did well, it was exposed to the risk that its customers could experience losses exceeding their collateral. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) To protect itself against the risk of customers accruing losses over-and-above their collateral, FXCM closed out a customer's position whenever changes in currency prices exhausted that customer's collateral. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The EUR/CHF Pair and the SNB Crash\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 6, 2011, the Swiss National Bank (\"SNB\") announced that it was pegging the value of the Swiss Franc to the Euro at a rate of 1.20 Swiss Francs to 1 Euro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) By doing so, the SNB permitted the Euro's value to increase against the Swiss Franc, but prevented the Swiss Franc's value to ever increase beyond the rate of 1.20 Swiss Francs to 1 Euro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60, 110.) The SNB's decision resulted in an immediate change in currency prices, causing a movement of 8% in the Swiss Franc within minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2015, FXCM's customers collectively held a $2.2 billion position in the EUR/CHF pair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) On January 15, 2015, the SNB announced that it would de-peg the Swiss Franc from the Euro, meaning that SNB would allow the Swiss Franc to move to its actual market value, even if that value went beyond the rate of 1.20 Swiss Francs to 1 Euro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51) Within minutes, the price of the Swiss Franc soared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) As a result, many of FXCM's customers with positions in the EUR/CHF pair suffered losses well above their collateral, meaning that FXCM was responsible for those losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55) FXCM ultimately suffered losses of $276 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To avoid a regulatory default, FXCM agreed the next day to a punitive financing agreement with an outside investment company, Leucadia National Corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56, 112.) As a result, FXCM's stock plummeted from $14.87 on January 14, 2015, to $1.60 on January 20, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Allegations of Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made a number of materially false or misleading statements during the Class Period, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 132-40.) Plaintiff alleges that Niv, as a \"controlling person\" of FXCM, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 141-44.) Plaintiff alleges, in particular, that Defendants misled investors about the risks associated with FXCM's business, especially with respect to the risks associated with FXCM's \"agency model,\" FXCM's leverage policies, and FXCM's exposure to massive losses if the Euro were de-pegged from the Swiss Franc.

(ECF No. 73.) On October 7, 2016, judgment was entered against Plaintiff. (ECF No. 77.) On November 3, 2016, Plaintiff appealed the Court's order of dismissal. (ECF No. 78.) On July 27, 2017, the Second\n   Circuit vacated the judgment against Plaintiff, to permit this Court to hear new evidence and arguments. (ECF No. 92.) On July 28, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend its complaint. (ECF No. 93.) On August 25, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 96.) On September 28, 2017, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, which became fully-briefed on November 17, 2017. (ECF Nos. 102, 105, 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Defendants filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy and Notice of Automatic Stay. (ECF No. 111.) On December 21, 2017, the Court stayed this action as to FXCM. (ECF No. 112.) On February 9, 2018, FXCM notified the Court that the automatic stay has been lifted.

In that context, it is clear that FXCM's agency model did not eliminate all risk, but only certain types of risk. The document discloses, for example, that FXCM's operations \"involved risk of loss due to the potential failure of [FXCM's] customers to perform their obligations under these transactions,\" including the risk that \"a customer's losses exceed the amount of cash in their account.\" (Dahan Decl., Ex. 1, at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dahan Decl., Ex. 1, at 11 (\"[O]ur policy is generally not to pursue claims for negative equity against our customers.\"), 25 (same).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) For these reasons, no reasonable investor reading FXCM's 2013 Form 10-K would have believed that FXCM's agency model made it \"riskless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that the agency model did, in fact, eliminate the counterparty risk inherent to the \"principal model,\" meaning the risk that the broker will face losses when its customer experiences gains. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 40.) Plaintiff instead alleges that because of FXCM's margin policy, FXCM was exposed to the same risk as its customers, namely the risk that FXCM's customers' investments would fall in value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Plaintiff claims that this type of risk is \"market risk,\" and so FXCM misled investors by stating it was not exposed to \"market risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n, at 15.) Defendants, by contrast, claim that this type of risk is not \"market risk,\" but \"credit risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 5.) Regardless of whether the 2013 Form 10-K should have referred to this type of risk as \"market risk\" or \"credit risk,\" what matters is that the document disclosed that FXCM was exposed to loss in the event that its customers' investments decreased to a point where their losses exceeded their collateral. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dahan Decl., Ex. 1, at 7, 11, 25.) Because FXCM fully explained this risk, a reasonable investor would have understood the risk to which FXCM was exposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   b)\n   <em>\n    Statements about the Risk of FXCM's Customers Not Performing Their Obligations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants misled investors by not disclosing that\n   FXCM had a \"no debit\" policy making FXCM responsible for its customers' losses exceeding their collateral. (Opp'n, at 1, 15.) A reasonable investor reviewing the Form 2013 10-K as a whole, however, would have understood that FXCM\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   responsible for losses exceeding customer collateral and that FXCM faced risk from that exposure.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the document plainly discloses that FXCM could be exposed to liability in the event that \"a customer's losses exceed[ ] the amount of cash in their account.\" (Dahan Decl., Ex. 1, at 7.)\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , in two different places, FXCM discloses its policy \"generally not to pursue claims for negative equity against our customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 25.) A reasonable investor would understand from these disclosures both that FXCM is generally responsible for any \"negative equity\" held by its customers and that this policy poses serious risks for FXCM. For this reason, Plaintiff's claim based on this allegation fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   c)\n   <em>\n    Statements About FXCM's Margin Policy, Liquidity, and Regulatory Capital\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made false statements that FXCM had a \"fairly conservative margin policy,\" \"maintained a substantial pool of liquidity,\" and \"maintained excess regulatory capital.\" (Opp'n, at 15.)

(Opp'n, at 5.) In the very statement that Plaintiff references, however, Niv noted that \"[m]ost clients ... use 15:1 [leverage], and some use\n   <em>\n    much more\n   </em>\n   .\" (Compl., \u00b6 108 (emphasis added).)

(Opp'n, at 27 n.11.) Plaintiff instead attempts to show scienter by alleging that Niv \"falsely described the risks inherent in FXCM's business,\" even though he was \"fully aware of the truth.\" (Opp'n, at 27.) Specifically, Plaintiff relies on the following allegations to prove scienter: (1) Niv knew that FXCM was exposed to a $2.2 billion long bet on the EUR/CHF pair, (Opp'n, at 28-29); (2) because Niv \"pioneered\" the agency model, he knew about the risks associated with it, (Opp'n, at 30); (3) the extreme price movement of the EUR/CHF pair in 2011 informed Niv of the risks of the EUR/CHF pair being de-pegged, (Opp'n, at 31); (4) FXCM experienced a reduction in excess net capital on December 12 and 15, 2014, due to changes in the Japanese Yen and Russian Ruble, as well as further reductions a week later, (Opp'n, at 32); (5) Niv knew that two of FXCM's competitors had increased their margin collateral requirements to reduce the risk from the EUR/CHF pair, (Opp'n, at 33); and (6) Niv tried to \"cover up\" the extent of the loss by (i) claiming that the amount of customers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   open positions in the EUR/CHF pair was $1 billion (not $2.2 billion), (Opp'n, at 35), and (ii) stating that the loss resulted from \"failure of the banks to provide pricing\" and because of a lack of \"liquidity from banks,\" (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 88-89).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Individually, and when taken together with all of the other allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, these allegations do not create a \"strong inference\" of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   a)\n   <em>\n    $2.2 billion bet\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff claims that as FXCM's CEO, Niv must have known that FXCM was concealing an \"enormous, highly-leveraged $2.2 billion long bet,\" and thus must have known that FXCM's statements about its risks were false. (Opp'n, at 27-28.) On its own, this allegation is not enough to show scienter. Although Niv's knowledge of the $2.2 billion position shows that Niv was aware of the possible\n   <em>\n    consequences\n   </em>\n   of the EUR/CHF being de-pegged, it does not speak to the\n   <em>\n    likelihood\n   </em>\n   of that event occurring.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For these reasons, the more \"compelling\" inference that can be drawn from the Second Amended Complaint is that Niv did not perceive a credible risk that the SNB would de-peg the EUR/CHF pair, and so did not act with scienter when making statements about the risks in FXCM's business and when omitting to\n   disclose information about FXCM's positions in the EUR/CHF pair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    551 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   b)\n   <em>\n    Niv \"pioneered\" the agency model\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Niv \"pioneered\" the agency model, and so must have known the risks inherent in FXCM's business. (Opp'n, at 29-30.) As discussed above, however, FXCM fully disclosed that it was exposed to risk from customer losses exceeding collateral. For this reason, Niv did not knowingly mislead investors about the general risks inherent in FXCM's business. Niv's knowledge of FXCM's agency model also did not make it any more likely that he believed that the SNB would de-peg the Euro from the Franc; instead, as discussed above, the more likely inference is that Niv did not perceive the potential de-pegging as a legitimate risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   c)\n   <em>\n    Extreme price movements in 2011\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the extreme price movements that resulted from the SNB pegging the Euro to the Swiss Franc in 2011 should have informed Niv about the risks to FXCM if the pair were de-pegged. (Opp'n, at 31.) This allegation does not show scienter for the same reason that Niv's purported knowledge of the $2.2 billion position does not show scienter: The fact that FXCM could face serious consequences from the Euro and Franc being de-coupled says nothing about Niv's perception of the likelihood of that risk being realized. Additionally, when considered with the other allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, the facts surrounding the 2011 event weigh\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   a finding of scienter. In particular, as the Court previously held, although the pegging of the Euro to the Franc in 2011 led to volatility, FXCM survived that volatility unscathed, showing that FXCM's model was able to withstand high-volatility events. (ECF No. 73, at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   d)\n   <em>\n    Reduction in capital in December 2014\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff claims that FXCM's prior experience with losses from changes in the Japanese Yen and Russian Ruble must have alerted Niv to the risks inherent in FXCM's business. The Second Amended Complaint also alleges, however, that FXCM\n   <em>\n    survived\n   </em>\n   that period of volatility. (Compl., \u00b6 50.) For this reason, as the Court previously noted, this fact weighs against a finding of scienter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 73, at 17 n.11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   e)\n   <em>\n    Warnings from employees and competitors' decisions to change margin requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff contends that scienter exists because Niv was aware \"that other companies had raised margin requirements\" with respect to the EUR/CHF pair. (Opp'n, at 33.) As the Court previously held, however, information about FXCM's competitors \"provide[s] no information about Defendants' conduct or knowledge.\" (ECF No. 73, at 18.) The fact that Niv made a different decision than his competitors shows nothing more than that he had a different business judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Salomon Analyst Level 3 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8950852\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/373/248/#p252\">\n    373 F.Supp.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (Lynch, J.) (\"[T]he fact that other individuals ... may have had views different from [defendant] does not provide any basis for an inference that [defendant] did not believe his own professed opinions ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that FXCM employee CW1 warned FXCM's management about the risks associated with the EUR/CHF pair and that Niv was personally warned about the risks by FXCM employee Paresh Patel. (Opp'n, at 33-35.) With respect to CW1's warning, the Court held that this fact was not sufficient to show scienter, because it was made to Brendan Callahan,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   Niv. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   73, at 17 n.10.) But even if it the statement were made to Niv, it does not show scienter, because Niv may have simply held a different opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Salomon Analyst Level 3 Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8950852\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/373/248/#p252\">\n    373 F.Supp.2d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When taken as a whole, CW1's statement also weighs against scienter because he told Niv, \"I personally don't think the peg is in danger.\" (Dahan Decl., Ex. 17, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   With respect to Patel's statements to Niv, they concern only FXCM's potential losses in the event the Euro and Franc were de-pegged, not the likelihood that SNB would, in fact, de-peg the Swiss Franc from the Euro. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.) For this reason, just as Niv's knowledge about the $2.2 billion position is not sufficient to prove scienter, neither is Niv's knowledge about FXCM's potential losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   f)\n   <em>\n    Evidence of a \"cover up\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (1) $2.2 billion trading position\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff contends that after the January 15, 2015, crash, FXCM misrepresented to investors that its total trading position in the EUR/CHF pair was $1 billion, when in fact it was $2.2 billion. (Opp'n, at 35-36.) According to Plaintiff, this disparity shows a \"cover up,\" resulting in an inference of scienter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The statements Plaintiff points to, however, are not contradictory. The first statement, made in FXCM's 2014 Form 10-K, states that \"over 3,000 of [FXCM's] clients held slightly over $1 billion in open positions,\" and that immediately following the de-pegging of the EUR/CHF pair, the positions of those 3,000 or so clients resulted in a $276 million debit. (Compl., \u00b6 52; Dahan Decl., Ex. 19, at 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The second statement is a document FXCM submitted to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission showing that that FXCM's customers had a\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   of $2.2 billion open positions in the EUR/CHF pair. (Compl., \u00b6 18.) Whereas the first statement provides the trading position of the 3,000 or so customers\n   <em>\n    who were responsible for FXCM's loss\n   </em>\n   , the second statement provides the trading position of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of FXCM's customers. These statements, then, are not contradictory, and do not lend themselves to an inference that Niv attempted to cover up anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (2) Availability of liquidity providers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Niv tried to cover up the reason for FXCM's losses by stating that one of the reasons for the loss was \"a lack of 'liquidity from banks.' \" (Compl., \u00b6 88.) Plaintiff contends that a statement in an email by Niv and deposition testimony by another FXCM employee, Janelle Lester, show that Niv's statement that the loss resulted from \"a lack of liquidity\" was false. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89.) In the email statement by Niv, Niv states that Citibank and Deutsche Bank \"NEVER turned us off,\" meaning that they never stopped trading with FXCM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) This statement, however, does not contradict Niv's prior statement that part of FXCM's loss was due to \"a lack of liquidity.\" In fact, Niv states in the same email that many of FXCM's liquidity providers did, in fact, stop trading with FXCM at the time of the crash: \"Most of our LPs [liquidity providers] were back within early the next week after the January 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   event. Some took longer and have turned us on in the past two weeks.\" (Compl., Ex. 5, at FXCM-CFTC-00006482.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The deposition testimony by Lester, similarly, does not prove scienter. Although Lester does state, \"we never had our pricing halted by our liquidity providers\" (ECF No 81-10, at 129:16-17), it is unclear whether she is referring to liquidity providers\n   <em>\n    in general\n   </em>\n   or liquidity providers trading in the EUR/CHF pair, in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Regardless, the fact that there is an apparent contradiction between a statement by Niv and deposition testimony by an FXCM employee is not sufficient proof of a \"cover up.\" A contradiction in these statements-which were made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   January 15, 2015-does not make it more likely that\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   January 15, 2015, Niv considered the de-pegging of the Euro and the Franc a serious risk, and lied to investors about that risk. For this reason, this apparent contradiction does not create a \"strong inference\" in favor of scienter. Instead, as detailed above, the more likely inference drawn from the Second Amended Complaint is that Niv did not consider there to be a legitimate risk that the EUR/CHF pair would be de-pegged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Loss Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because Plaintiff fails to adequately plead material misstatements and scienter, the Court does not reach the issue of loss causation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re UBS AG Sec.
