The State has filed a motion to dismiss the Petition (ECF No. 19), to which Rivera filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 29). The Court has determined that no hearing is necessary. For the reasons that follow, the Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED and the Petition is DENIED and DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background and Travel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 19, 1999, following a six-day trial, Rivera was convicted by a jury of first degree murder and related firearms charges and was found to be a habitual offender. He filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied on October 27, 1999. Rivera was sentenced on February 3, 2000, to life in prison for the murder conviction,\n   two concurrent ten year sentences and one suspended ten-year sentence for the firearms offenses, and a consecutive term of 20 years, non-parolable, as a habitual offender. Rivera timely appealed the conviction, as well as the denial of his motion for new trial, but in a decision issued on November 19, 2003, the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's judgment. Rivera did not seek further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Rivera filed both a motion for sentence reduction and an application for post-conviction review in the Superior Court. The motion for sentence reduction was denied on July 21, 2004, and the post-conviction petition was denied, after a two-day hearing, on February 11, 2011. Rivera appealed the latter denial, and on January 14, 2013, the Rhode Island Supreme Court again affirmed the lower court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 13, 2014, Rivera, through counsel, filed the instant Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State initially filed a motion to dismiss (ECF No. 4) (\"First Motion to Dismiss\") based on timeliness grounds on February 21, 2014. Rivera filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 10) to the First Motion to Dismiss on August 4, 2014. The State subsequently filed a reply (ECF No. 14), to which Rivera filed a further response (ECF No. 17). In an Order (ECF No. 18) dated September 23, 2015, the Court denied the First Motion to Dismiss without prejudice and directed the State to respond to the Petition on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State filed a second motion to dismiss (ECF No. 19) (\"Second Motion to Dismiss\") on October 30, 2015, followed by an appendix of exhibits (ECF No. 20) (\"State's Ex.\"). On October 8, 2016, Rivera filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 29) (\"Opposition\") to the Second Motion to Dismiss as well as a supplemental memorandum (ECF No. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rivera presents sixteen grounds for the Court's review, including allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, due process violations, and failures on the part of both the Superior Court and the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The State contends that three of Rivera's claims are unexhausted, six have been procedurally defaulted, and the remainder fail on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Unexhausted claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State contends that three of Rivera's claims-Grounds Twelve, Thirteen and Sixteen-have not been raised in any of Rivera's submissions to the Rhode Island Supreme Court and, therefore, are unexhausted and cannot be litigated for the first time in a \u00a7 2254 petition. (Second Mot. to Dismiss 5.) Rivera maintains that it is \"manifestly clear\" that he \"has exhausted his State Court remedy ....\" (Opp. 2.) He further states that \"[c]laims of actual innocence based evidence like that set forth in Ground Thirteen, Twelve, and Sixteen ought to ... survive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rivera argues in Ground Twelve that his post-conviction counsel failed \"to present evidence and legal argument on all the named grounds of [his] state post-conviction petition and fail[ed] to adequately brief and argue [his] appeal from denial of post-conviction relief\" (Pet.'s Att. 1 11), thereby rendering ineffective assistance of counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rivera additionally argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   My post-conviction counsel obtained a statement from Hector Rodriguez wherein he recanted his trial testimony. My post-conviction counsel failed to present this new evidence in my post-conviction relief case. This failure further constituted constitutionally ineffective\n   assistance of counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment and due process pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as applied to the States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rivera further asserts that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he result of the State PCR proceeding [is] so tainted by the application of the wrong standard to counsels['] performance that it is patently unreliable and as such renders equally unreliable the Rhode Island Supreme Court's appellate findings. The Supreme Court went along without comment with the Superior Court's standards based on ... their prior case law. Therefore the Ground 12 should survive but even absent that analysis in the actual innocence context the claim ought to be free standing in the federal court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Opp. 27-28.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State contends that to the extent Ground 12 \"allege[s] deficiencies with the Rhode Island Supreme Court's determination of Petitioner's post-conviction appeal, such allegations, having not been previously raised in state court, cannot be litigated for the first time in a \u00a7 2254 action.\" (Second Mot. to Dismiss 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the most part, the Court reads Ground 12 as alleging deficiencies with post-conviction counsel's performance with respect to the hearing and appeal. As to alleged failure to present evidence and argument on all grounds in Rivera's state petition, as well as to present new evidence, during the hearing, the State is correct that Rivera has not given the state courts an opportunity to address any constitutional errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    455 U.S. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133896\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/838/#p839\">\n    526 U.S. at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133896\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/838/#p839\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true with respect to Rivera's allegation regarding the inadequacy of counsel's performance in his appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief. Rivera admits as much in the Petition, arguing that \"[t]hese issues arose as a result of counsel's performance in the post-conviction relief hearing on the merits and the appeal of the denial of relief.\" (Pet.'s Att. 1 13.) He provides no evidence that he has made any attempt to redress these issues in the state courts. Nor does Rivera argue that there is an absence of available corrective process in the state courts or that any such process would be ineffective to protect his rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, the claims regarding post-conviction and post-conviction appellate counsel are unexhausted and may not be considered by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In Ground Thirteen, Rivera faults both the Superior Court and trial counsel, alleging denial of his right to due process and to effective assistance of counsel. (Pet.'s Att. 1 13-14.) He states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Failure of the Superior Court to preclude testimony and grant a new trial where a witness having previously being informed of her obligation to appear and testify by the court was nevertheless asked just prior to her appearance in court by the prosecutor that \"There's no question you're scared about testifying, correct?\" To which she responded \"yes.\" The Court's failure to do so denied the defendant a fair trial under the due process\n   clause of the United States Constitution. Defendant[']s counsel similarly failed to object to the witnesses' [sic] testimony which constituted unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) The State contends that \"Issue 13 does not appear to have been raised in any of the appellate submissions Petitioner tendered to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, either upon his direct appeal or upon his post-conviction relief appeal.\" (Second Mot. to Dismiss 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exs. 4, 6, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In his brief on direct appeal, Rivera stated that Cournoyer \"reluctantly\" testified at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (State's Ex. 4 14.) However, the statement was made in Rivera's summary of the facts of the case (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14), not as a separate ground for relief (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8), or as part of his argument that the evidence did not support the verdicts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-30). Rivera made no mention of Cournoyer's alleged fear or duress (Pet.'s Att. 1 15), in his post-conviction filings with the Rhode Island Supreme Court. (State's Exs. 6, 8.) Therefore, the Court does not discuss Rivera's allegations in Ground Thirteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rivera argues in Ground Sixteen that he was denied due process due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of both trial and post-conviction counsel for failing to raise prosecutorial misconduct as a separate issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pet., Att. 1 19.) He states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The Petitioner was denied due process and a fair trial where the prosecutor wrongly introduced evidence, to wit, the pre-trial photo pack arrays, where the State prosecutor had knowledge that there were issues relevant to the legality and reliability of how the photo arrays were presented to the witnesses pre-trial, knew that they had not produced the original array with the numbering on the reverse side in discovery, and knew the police reports clearly showed that the Defendant/Petitioner was not identified on the night of the murder by the witnesses with reference to the packs as numbered.[ ] At trial, Defendant was pictured in photo pack 2, which was introduced at trial. The police reports clearly stated that the witnesses, when shown photo pack 2, were unable to identify the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rivera concedes that the \"issue of prosecutorial misconduct was not raised on appeal from the conviction,\" but states that \"the issue of the insufficiency of evidence presented and, specifically, the disturbing lack of reliability of the pre-trial identifications in the photo arrays was raised.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Rivera acknowledges that \"[t]he issue of prosecutorial misconduct in presenting the evidence stated above was not raised,\" in his post-conviction relief action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, however, he argues that the pretrial identification issue was raised during the post-conviction relief proceedings, as was trial counsel's failure to press the motion to suppress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Rivera states that \"[i]n the context of actual innocence of the defendant where he was wrongly identified as the shooter, justice demands this court allow these claims to be heard.\" (Opp. 28.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Clearly Rivera's prosecutorial misconduct claim is unexhausted, along with the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failing to raise prosecutorial misconduct as a separate issue in the state court proceedings. Although related issues\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   were presented to the state courts, the courts were not given an opportunity to determine in the first instance whether Rivera's constitutional rights were violated by the prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    455 U.S. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Grounds Twelve, Thirteen, and Sixteen have not been \"fairly presented\" to the state courts and, therefore, cannot be raised in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Picard v.

(Second Mot. to Dismiss 6.) Rivera counters that the claims are not procedurally barred, (Opp. 2), and argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The fact is that each of the claims brought in the PCR case were wrongly adjudicated and this Court should consider the findings in that action completely unreliable.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   State's Ex. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In Grounds Four, Five, and, to an extent, Fifteen, Rivera claims that trial counsel failed to conduct any investigation or\n   pretrial preparation. (Pet. 12; Pet'r's Att. 1 1, 19.) Grounds Six and Ten focus on his attorneys' failure to preserve issues for appeal and to challenge evidence. (Pet'r's Att. 1 2-3, 9.)

Therefore, both subsections of \u00a7 2254(d) are implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court begins with the facts. The Rhode Island Supreme Court summarized the evidence presented at trial as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   In the early morning hours of November 23, 1997, the victim, Edward \"Chipper\" Wilson IV, and his friend Robert K. Rhoads arrived at the Weiner Palace in Woonsocket for a late night bite after an evening out. As they were conversing with two female employees and the owner of the establishment, defendant, nicknamed \"Hippy,\" and three male friends entered the Weiner Palace. Although some derogatory comments were exchanged between members of each group of men, Wilson and his friend made an uneventful exit from the restaurant and headed back to their parked vehicle. Before he got to the vehicle, however, Wilson noticed defendant staring at him from the front window inside the Weiner Palace. Wilson, who was a martial arts instructor, challenged defendant to come outside. The defendant complied, and the two exchanged profanities and blows, resulting in defendant's being knocked to the pavement. At some point, defendant's friends also became involved in the scuffle. At trial, Rhoads testified that defendant pulled out a metal object and hit Wilson over the head with it. At this point Wilson fled down the hill in a direction away from the Weiner Palace. By several eyewitness accounts, Wilson was pursued by defendant. Shots were fired and Wilson was struck twice, once in the abdomen and once in the head, the wound that proved to be fatal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Although no eyewitness could testify [to] seeing defendant fire the bullet that killed Wilson, the state presented several witnesses throughout the course of the six-day trial who testified to having\n   seen defendant with a weapon and heading in the direction of where Wilson fled just before Wilson was shot. The two waitresses on shift at the Weiner Palace, Heather Cournoyer and Michelle Oliveira, gave consistent testimony about the events that unfolded that evening. Each testified that, from their vantage point inside the Weiner Palace, they had seen defendant pull out a gun, cock it, and walk in the direction of the victim. Each then heard what sounded like a thud and then a gunshot ring out in rapid succession. John Muniz, one of defendant's friends involved in the fight, told police that he saw defendant in possession of a gun and that he saw him pull it back and cock it as the victim fled. However, Muniz later recanted this version of events while testifying for the state. At trial he said that defendant had never had a gun and that it was only upon threats by police that he placed a gun in defendant's hands. Rhoads, Wilson's friend, testified that he saw defendant pointing a gun at Wilson, heard a gunshot, and saw his friend fall. Rhoads heard a second gunshot while running away. Michael Cote, a customer at the Weiner Palace, testified that although he never saw a weapon in defendant's hands, defendant was involved in a confrontation with Wilson, and that he heard a scuffle outside the restaurant, followed by two gunshots about fifteen seconds apart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Evidence was presented at trial that positive identifications of defendant were made using a series of photo packs shown to witnesses not more than a day after the shooting. Cournoyer, Oliveira, and Rhoads all selected defendant's photo from one of several photo packs. At trial almost two years after the incident, only Oliveira, among these three witnesses, was able to make a positive in-court identification of defendant. However, other witnesses, including three of his friends, were able to identify defendant at trial as the same man referred to as \"Hippy.\" Rhoads and Cournoyer did not recognize defendant as the same man they had seen that night. All three witnesses, however, did testify that they were confident in their selection of defendant's photo at the time following the incident and that the man in the photo was the assailant. Furthermore, Cournoyer and three police sergeants involved in the case testified that defendant looked significantly different at trial than he did at the time of the crime. These physical changes included a gain in weight, a haircut, shave of facial hair, and the addition of glasses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition to the abovementioned witnesses, the state presented additional evidence of suspicious behavior by defendant in the hours following the murder. Wanda Vasquez, a friend of defendant, testified that defendant asked her on the morning after the murder to care for a dog in his care because he had to go out. Hector Rodriguez, another friend, testified that he gave defendant a ride to Providence later that day so that defendant could \"get out of Woonsocket.\" Finally, evidence was presented to establish that Maribel Albino, the sister of defendant's then-girlfriend, told police that on the evening after the murder, defendant told her he had been in a fight with a white man and that he spoke of going to a hotel. However, she recanted this story on the stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Rivera I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058185\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/497/#p501\">\n    839 A.2d at 499-500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Based on the above evidence, the Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Upon review of the record in this case, it is apparent that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant's motion\n   for a new trial. He acknowledged that he made his decision upon independently weighing the evidence and considering the testimony and credibility of the witnesses. To that effect, he referred specifically to the facts and testimony upon which he relied. With regard to the identification of defendant, the trial justice said that \"[a]s to Oliveira and Cournoyer, they satisfactorily * * * identified this defendant as the culprit with the firearm.\" Furthermore, the trial justice noted that Rhoads's inability to make an in-court identification in no way diminished or dispelled his earlier out-of-court identification using a photo pack in which he picked out defendant's picture. With respect to the issue of premeditation, the trial justice noted that Oliveira and Cournoyer both saw defendant pull out a handgun, cock it, and set out in the direction where Wilson had fled. The trial justice regarded as truthful a similar statement that Muniz made to the police, and he rejected as not truthful Muniz's subsequent change of story while testifying at trial. Additionally, the trial justice addressed the issue of premeditation by saying that, based on the entry point of the second bullet as the medical examiner testified to,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the evidence that defendant was armed with a gun while pursuing the victim, he believed the murder to have been \"an execution which bespeaks first degree murder.\" Finally, the trial justice said that \"the State produced in my mind credible and substantial evidence that this defendant did, in fact, commit first degree murder and all of the other offenses for which he was charged; that proof was easily to the level of beyond a reasonable doubt. And the jury, in my view, quite properly made the correct decision * * *.\" To our mind, the trial justice conducted a proper and thorough analysis of the evidence before him. Only after making his own independent assessment did he agree with the jury's verdict and deny the defendant's motion. Because the trial justice agreed with the verdict, his analysis need not have extended beyond that which it did. Because we hold that the trial justice neither misconceived nor overlooked material evidence, nor was he otherwise clearly wrong, we defer to his factual findings and his judgment. For these reasons, we disagree with the defendant's allegations of error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058185\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/497/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058185\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/497/#p501\">\n    at 503-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations other than footnote in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Just as the Rhode Island Supreme Court deferred to the trial court's factual findings,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058185\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/497/#p501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058185\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/497/#p501\">\n    at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court must defer to the state court on issues of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Teti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047190\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/50/#p57\">\n    507 F.3d at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The presumption of correctness is equally applicable when a state appellate court, as opposed to a trial court, makes the finding of fact.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).

He states that \"the inability of witnesses to make in court identifications and the troubling recantations coupled with the troubling photo pac[k]s, trajectory of the bullets from directions where the Petitioner was not located, [and a] witness testifying under apparent fear or duress manifestly demonstrated the sufficiency finding requires review by this court.\" (Opp. 33.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Rivera overlooks the fact that the purpose of habeas review is not to relitigate state trials,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9480377\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/265/1/#p7\">\n    265 F.3d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or to serve as a substitute for direct appeals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055354\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1/#p8\">\n    775 F.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Application of standard of review to ineffective assistance of counsel claims (Ground One)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Rivera claims that both the Superior Court on post-conviction review and the Supreme Court in reviewing the denial of Rivera's post-conviction petition applied the wrong standard of review to his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. (Pet. 6.) Specifically, he contends that the state courts utilized a more demanding \"farce and mockery\" standard instead of the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Opp. 2-4.) Rivera further asserts that the courts applied a higher standard because he had privately retained, not appointed, counsel. (Pet. 6; Opp. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Rivera argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   In Rhode Island the Rhode Island Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the standard to be applied in a case claiming ineffective assistance of counsel has become a distinct and more deman[d]ing standard, than that articulated by the United Stat[e]s Supreme Court, and especially so where the defendant is represented by private cou[ns]el. Rhode Island jurisprudence continues to apply a long-discarded pre- Strickland standard formerly pronounced pursuant to The Due Process c[la]use, namely the farce and mockery standard. The Rhode Island Supreme Court commingled the more demanding standard, with the subsequent Sixth Amendment Strickland standard, and thus unconstitutionally diminishes the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (Pet. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As Rivera recognizes, both the post-conviction court and the Rhode Island Supreme Court correctly articulated the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. 2, 4.) It is true that the post-conviction court also mentioned \"farce and mockery\" and differential treatment with respect to retained, as opposed to appointed, counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A 1-2.) It is clear, however, from a close reading of the courts' opinions that they applied the proper standard of review-that is, the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard- to Rivera's ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The post-conviction court began its discussion of Rivera's ineffective assistance of counsel allegations by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   In matters such as these for postconviction relief, at bottom on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, certain general propositions obtain. The touchstone, of course, relates to the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   case adopted by our Court as well. In\n   <em>\n    Powers [v]s. Rhode Island\n   </em>\n   (1999), reflecting on\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , our court said \"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Secondly, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.

Motion to Suppress Identification (Grounds Three, Eleven, Fourteen)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Rivera's remaining claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel-Grounds Three, Eleven, and Fourteen-all relate to a motion to suppress identification, specifically through photo arrays presented to certain witnesses. (Pet. 10;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Att. 1 11, 16-17.) In Ground Three, Rivera faults trial counsel for failing to litigate a motion to suppress identification, which was filed but never argued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pet. 10.) Rivera also alleges in Ground Eleven that the Superior Court's failure to conduct a hearing on his motion to suppress identification evidence denied him a fair trial in violation of his right to due process. (Pet., Att. 1 11.) Finally, in Ground Fourteen, Rivera again contends that counsel were ineffective for failing to argue the motion to suppress, or to attempt to schedule a hearing on it, and the trial court's failure to hold a hearing on the motion or to rule on it violated his due process rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) Because Rivera argued the motion to suppress issue in the state courts solely as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Court addresses it from that perspective only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   According to Rivera, \"[t]here were issues with the way the photos were set up, procedural issues, and there were numbers on the back of the photo packs, which did not match Mr. Rivera being picked out in the photos.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Thus, in Rivera's view, the evidence was tainted and should not have been admitted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The post-conviction court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   We know that with respect to motions to suppress identification, particularly through photo spreads, first, the photo pack itself must be inherently suggestive, and, even if it had not been, secondly, there had to have been activity by the police that may have suggested the selection of a photograph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   There was nothing suggestive about the photo spreads. I've looked at them. They were presented yesterday. Nothing inherently suggestive. Then the question became did the police officer do anything that was suggestive? Nothing in the record supports that. Both attorneys yesterday testified that they inspected the photo packs and that they\n   were of the view that a motion to suppress identification would not be successful. I wholeheartedly agree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Furthermore, the decision not to pursue the motion to suppress identification was clearly, as set forth yesterday by counsel, a trial strategy. Apparently, during the course of inspecting the evidence and the photo packs ... defense counsel recognized prior to trial that there was some irregularity with regard to the photo spreads and that, had they pursued a motion to suppress, they would have given the State, particularly the Woonsocket Police, an opportunity to meet that kind of inquiry at trial such that whatever mileage the defense attorney might have been able to make of it would have been diminished, watered down, defused, if you will, at trial, because they would have tipped their hand early on, and the Woonsocket Police witnesses would have been able to counter, impairing that kind of examination. So, defense counsel decided to keep it to themselves and loose that arrow from their quiver during trial, and they did so rather successfully. They made hay out of that issue, and, frankly, it was not the best day that the Woonsocket Police had when it came to that particular moment. They were, in all likelihood, somewhat embarrassed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   So, with respect to the motion to suppress, the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   clearly is not violated, and there has been an utter failure to carry the burden of proof with regard to that claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   (Opp., Ex. A 3-5.) Accordingly, the court rejected Rivera's claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On appeal of the denial of post-conviction relief, the Rhode Island Supreme Court first summarized counsels' testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   As for their decision not to pursue a motion to suppress evidence, Smith and Verdecchia both testified that they felt the motion would be futile for two reasons. First, they agreed that there was nothing inherently suggestive about the photo arrays that would provide grounds for a motion to suppress. Second, they believed it would be better to highlight some irregularities with the photo arrays through cross-examination at trial rather than \"tip[ ] [their] hand\" at a suppression hearing ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    Rivera II\n   </em>\n   , 58 A.3d at 177\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (alterations in original). The court then turned to the decision below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   As for Rivera's contention that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to pursue a motion to suppress, the hearing justice noted that there was \"nothing suggestive\" about the photo arrays that were introduced into evidence at trial. Crediting Smith's and Verdecchia's testimony, the hearing justice concluded that trial counsel had made a prudent tactical decision not to pursue the motion to suppress. He noted that Rivera's attorneys were \"rather successful[ ]\" in exposing irregularities with the photo arrays at trial and that the Woonsocket police probably were \"somewhat embarrassed\" as a result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178 (alterations in original). After noting \"the deference [it] must afford to the hearing justice's findings of historical fact,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 181, the court concluded that the tactical decision made by counsel did\n   not constitute constitutionally deficient representation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   First, concerning the motion to suppress, we discern no error in the hearing justice's finding that there was \"nothing suggestive\" about the photo arrays. Furthermore, the hearing justice credited the testimony of Smith and Verdecchia, who explained that they had made a strategic choice to expose irregularities with the photo arrays as they were presented at trial rather than at a suppression hearing. The hearing justice found that \"the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   clearly [was] not violated, and there [had] been an utter failure to carry the burden of proof with regard to that claim.\" We agree, and therefore hold that Rivera's attorneys did not render ineffective assistance of counsel in choosing not to pursue a motion to suppress evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \"[C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phoenix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172295\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/77/#p80\">\n    233 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The mere fact that [counsel's] cross-examination failed to persuade the jury of [defendant's] innocence is not enough to establish ineffective assistance.\"). \"While [counsels'] trial tactics may appear dubious to the petitioner in hindsight, especially in the grim reflection of the intervening convictions, the reviewing court must be persuaded that the failed trial strategy was not within the 'wide range of reasonable professional assistance' contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Lema\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508219\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/48/#p51\">\n    987 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   56 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting court's obligation \"to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time\").
