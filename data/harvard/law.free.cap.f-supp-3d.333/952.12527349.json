On June 1, 2018, defendants removed this action pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (\"CAFA\"), under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201453\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Removal of Class Actions\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to remand came on for hearing before this court on August 1, 2018. Plaintiff appeared through his counsel, James Taylor-Copeland. Defendants appeared through their counsel, Peter Morrison. Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby DENIES plaintiff's motion, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, Ripple created a digital currency called XRP. Compl. \u00b6 20. According to the complaint, unlike other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Etherium, Ripple fully generated 100 billion XRP prior to its distribution. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 20. As of June\n   30, 2015, Ripple held approximately 67.51 billion XRP and all individuals-including Ripple's founders-held 32.49 billion XRP. Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in 2013, defendants began selling XRP to the general public and wholesale to larger investors in a \"never ending ICO\"-initial coin offering. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26. In an ICO, digital assets are sold to consumers in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies. Compl. \u00b6 3. Plaintiff alleges that \"the XRP offered and sold by defendants have all the traditional hallmarks of a security\" and in fact is a security within the meaning of Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") and/or the California Corporations Code. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 100-111, 133, 136, 139, 143. Accordingly, plaintiff contends that defendants \"never ending ICO\" constituted an unregistered sale of securities in violation of the Securities Act and the California Corporations Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On behalf of \"all persons or entities who purchased XRP from January 1, 2013 through the present,\" Compl. \u00b6 122, plaintiff asserts four causes of action for: (1) violation of \u00a7\u00a7 5 &amp; 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act for the unregistered offer and sale of securities; (2) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2025110\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7\u00a7 25110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   &amp; 25503 for the unregistered offer and sale of securities; (3) violation of \u00a7 15 of the Securities Act (control person liability); and (4) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2025504\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 25504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (control person liability). Plaintiff seeks, inter alia, rescission of all XRP purchases, damages, and a constructive trust over the proceeds of defendants' alleged sales of XRP. Compl. at 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That said, the present motion and this order address a narrow issue: Whether the presence of Securities Act claims bars a defendant from removing an action pursuant to \u00a7 1453 based on state law claims that independently satisfy CAFA's jurisdictional requirements. The court believes that this is an issue of first impression. The parties candidly admit that their research failed to turn up any case directly addressing this question and the court's own research fared no better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agree that absent plaintiff's Securities Act claims, defendants could properly remove this action under CAFA based on plaintiff's state law claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff, however, argues that \u00a7 22(a) of the Securities Act operates as a complete bar on removing any action that includes a Securities Act claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77v(a) (\"\u00a7 22\").

Here, plaintiff alleges claims under both California law and the Securities Act. More importantly, defendants did not remove this action based on the Securities Act claim satisfying CAFA's requirements-likely a losing proposition under\n   <em>\n    Luther\n   </em>\n   . Instead, defendants removed this action based on plaintiff's California claims, which independently satisfy CAFA's requirements.\n   <em>\n    Luther\n   </em>\n   says nothing about that situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition, part of\n   <em>\n    Luther\n   </em>\n   's reasoning has been undermined by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Luther\n   </em>\n   court relied on the Ninth Circuit's general rule that \"removal statutes are strictly construed against removal,\" and that \"any doubt is resolved against removability.\"\n   <em>\n    Luther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038062\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/1031/\">\n    533 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court has subsequently rejected that premise. Noting that the district court's remand order relied on the same faulty premise, the Court determined \"that no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593418\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/547/#p551\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (vacating 10th Circuit's decision denying review of district court's remand order).

The Role of Removal Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With no directly applicable authority, the court first turns to reviewing how removal provisions operate generally, outside the context of the disputed statutes. As noted, \"[t]he right to remove a case from state to federal court is purely statutory, being dependent on the will of Congress.\" Wright and Miller, 20 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Deskbook \u00a7 40, Scope of the Removal Jurisdiction (2018). That is, a defendant must point to some statute that allows the defendant to deprive the plaintiff of her choice of forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076667\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1178/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[I]n addition to the general removal statute,\" \u00a7 1441(a), \"there are certain other statutes authorizing removal ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   If a defendant is, for example, faced with a claim under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the defendant may remove the action under \u00a7 1441(a). That is because \u00a7 1441(a), subject to its except clause, allows for removal of \"any civil action\" that the U.S. district courts have original jurisdiction over-such as a claim asserting a violation of a federal statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, if \u00a7 1332(a)'s general diversity jurisdiction requirements are met, then a defendant may remove the action under \u00a7 1441(a), so long as the removal also complies with \u00a7 1441(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (providing additional guidance for removal based on jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a) ). That is uncontroversial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It is also uncontroversial that the defendants in the above situations may successfully remove the action without satisfying the requirements of other inapplicable removal provisions. That is, a defendant\n   removing an action under \u00a7 1441(a) based on federal question jurisdiction, defined by \u00a7 1331, need not show that diversity jurisdiction, defined by \u00a7 1332, also exists. Or, put another way, the federal question plaintiff cannot defeat removal by arguing that the defendant has not complied with \u00a7 1441(b) or met \u00a7 1332's diversity jurisdiction requirements. Those two sections are inapplicable when removing based on federal question jurisdiction. The converse, of course, is also true. A defendant may remove an action based on diversity jurisdiction even if the action does not present a federal question. Indeed, that is the very purpose of diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The same is true for a foreign state defendant removing a civil action under \u00a7 1441(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That defendant may remove the action if it meets the requirements of subsection (d), regardless of whether the removal complies with subsections (a) or (b). And the plaintiff in that case could not defeat removal by pointing to \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, 1441(a), or (b).\n   <em>\n    Teledyne, Inc. v.

The other statutes authorizing removal also operate independently. For example, \u00a7 1442(a) and (b) authorize removal of actions against certain federal officers or agencies. Nothing in \u00a7 1442 directs a removing defendant to comply with any part of \u00a7 1441 and, accordingly, a defendant may remove the action without meeting the diversity, federal question, or foreign state jurisdictional requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Leite v.

Just like the above-discussed removal provisions, \u00a7 16(c) provides an independent basis for removal.

Far from taking \u00a7 1441(a)'s \"express exception requirement seriously,\" that reading renders the except clause entirely superfluous.

Section 1332(d)(2), states \"district courts have\n   <em>\n    original jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   of any civil action\" satisfying the CAFA requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (emphasis added). Accordingly, an action satisfying CAFA's diversity requirements could be removed pursuant to \u00a7 1441(a) -allowing for removal of \"any civil action ... of which the district courts of the United States have\n   <em>\n    original jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   .\" Doing so, however, would subject the removal to \u00a7 1441(a)'s except clause and the entire array of federal antiremoval statutes. Plaintiff contends that \u00a7 1453(b) should operate the same way and defer to \u00a7 22(a)'s removal bar. That makes no sense. If Congress wanted that result, it\n   could have omitted \u00a7 1453(b) entirely. Instead, Congress enacted an entirely different removal provision that does not include anything resembling \u00a7 1441(a)'s broad except clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Section 1441(c) Compared to \u00a7 1453\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Both parties argue that this court's decision should be informed by how courts treated \u00a7 1441(c) vis-\u00e0-vis \u00a7 1441(a) before the former's amendment in 1990.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants argue that similar to how \u00a7 1453(b) should operate, courts concluded that cases otherwise barred from removal by \u00a7 1441(a)'s except clause could nevertheless be removed under pre-1990 \u00a7 1441(c). This court agrees. Pre-1990 courts reasoned that subsections (a) and pre-amendment subsection (c) \"refer to two completely different situations\" with the latter \"grant[ing] additional removal jurisdiction in a class of cases which would not otherwise be removable\" under the former.\n   <em>\n    Gregg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3539979\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/348/1004/#p1015\">\n    348 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1015 (\u00a7 22(a) did not bar removal under subsection (c) );\n   <em>\n    Emrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1788410\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/846/1190/#p1197\">\n    846 F.2d at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed at length above, the same reasoning applies to \u00a7 1453 because, like pre-1990 subsection (c), \u00a7 1453 provides a separate basis for removal and does not include anything resembling \u00a7 1441(a)'s except clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Despite that parallel, plaintiff argues that in fact pre-1990 subsection (c) shows that when Congress resolves conflicts between diversity jurisdiction and antiremoval statutes it does so explicitly. That argument, however, begs the question because it assumes antiremoval statutes automatically apply to all removal provisions-an assumption that the above discussion shows lacks merit. And plaintiff has provided no reason to suspect that \u00a7 22(a) operates differently than other run-of-the-mill antiremoval provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   At most, plaintiff's argument shows that Congress knows how to create removal provisions that are not subject to \u00a7 1441(a)'s except clause-by enacting an independent removal provision, such as \u00a7 1453(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In sum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [W]hen an anti-removal provision such as Section 22(a) is invoked, the threshold question is whether removal is being effectuated by way of the general removal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), or by way of a separate removal provision that \"grants additional removal jurisdiction in a class of cases which would not otherwise be removable under the prior grant of authority.\" If removal is being effectuated through a provision[, like \u00a7 1453,] that confers additional removal jurisdiction, and that provision contains no exception for nonremovable federal\n   claims, the provision should be given full effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    WorldCom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9243308,9246943\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/86/\">\n    368 F.3d at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \u00a7 22(a) does not bar removal under \u00a7 1452 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Section 1453 grants defendant an additional, independent basis for removing an action from state to federal court. The parties do not dispute and the court finds that plaintiff's California claims satisfy CAFA's removal requirements. Because \u00a7 1453 says nothing about incorporating \u00a7 1441(a)'s except clause, or otherwise deferring to antiremoval provisions, \u00a7 22(a) does not bar removal of this action. In addition, plaintiff's application of \u00a7 22(a) to all removal provisions unnecessarily renders numerous statutory clauses superfluous. Lastly, removal in this situation accords with Congress' \" 'overall intent ... to strongly favor the exercise of federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions with interstate ramifications.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076667\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1178/\">\n    781 F.3d at 1183-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( (ellipses in original) discussing\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee\n   </em>\n   ; quoting congressional record).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Based on the foregoing, plaintiff's motion to remand is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The court also finds the plaintiff's state law claims meet CAFA's requirements.
