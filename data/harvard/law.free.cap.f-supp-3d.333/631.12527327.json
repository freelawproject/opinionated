She alleges USACE's employees failed to secure one of the tables and \"moved it such that the anchor was exposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mrs. Greer's son had paid USACE for exclusive use of the pavilion to host Mrs. Greer's grandson's birthday.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   She asserts that as a result of the fall, she incurred injuries including fractures in both arms.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Charles Greer (\"Mr. Greer\"), claims that he suffered a loss of consortium as a result of the injuries sustained by his wife, Mrs. Greer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Plaintiffs exhausted administrative remedies under the FTCA, this action was instituted.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege the United States and its agents/employees acted negligently by: (1) failing to adequately warn patrons and visitors, by sign or other means of the dangers associated with the exposed anchor; (2) failing to provide supervision when patrons and visitors were using the pavilion area; (3) failing to keep the Tom Merrill Recreation Area in a safe condition; (4) failing to routinely inspect the Tom Merrill Recreation Area to ensure the safety of the visitors; (5) willfully exposing the anchor; (6) failing to follow the policy of supervising the area while in use; (7) improperly training, supervising, hiring, and retaining its employees; and (8) failing to train and reinforce safety standards with its employees.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 13, 2017, the United States moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims, arguing it had not waived sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 9-1.

If a district court \"lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case,\" dismissal of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is proper.\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Miss, Inc. v.

There is no mandatory policy or procedure which provides that the anchors should not be exposed or that users of the pavilions should be warned about exposed anchors.\" Record\n   Document 9-1 at 10. However, the United States is incorrect. Plaintiffs presented the Engineering Manual 1110-1-400 (Recreation Facility and Customer Service Standards) issued by the Department of the Army.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 15-2. The manual specifically details the requirements for anchoring picnic tables at USACE controlled recreational areas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5. \"This manual applies to all Civil Works field activities responsible for the evaluation, design, construction, renovation, rehabilitation, management, and administration of all new or existing recreation developments on Government lands.

The guidelines for picnic tables are addressed in Chapter 4 of the manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 15-2 at 5. Under the Construction and Design Features, the manual states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1) When anchored, anchoring method eliminates safety hazards such as protruding stakes and chains........ REQUIRED\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, the Court finds the safety standards within the Engineering Manual are sufficient to remove discretion under the FTCA. The Engineering Manual specifically addressed the anchoring method of picnic tables and mandated that they be free of safety hazards. The Court disagrees with the United States and finds an exposed anchor is certainly an anticipated safety hazard discussed in Table 4.1. Therefore, the USACE and its employees had a duty to eliminate safety hazards such as an exposed anchor. Since both prongs must be satisfied, the failure to establish the first prong makes the analysis of the second prong unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p323\">\n    499 U.S. at 322-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p323\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
