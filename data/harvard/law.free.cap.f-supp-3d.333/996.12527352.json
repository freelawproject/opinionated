Under the federal rules, a civil suit is timely if filed on the next business day when \"the last day [of the limitations period] is a Saturday ....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1)(C). Because plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on Monday, March 5, 2018, one business day after March 3, 2018, their suit is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint was timely filed on March 5, 2018. Defendant has not shown \"beyond doubt\" that the undisputed facts could not establish the \"timeliness of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Supermail Cargo\n   </em>\n   , 68 F.3d at 1206.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At hearing, defense counsel suggested equitable tolling should not be applied based on prejudice caused by the delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (explaining \"prejudice is a factor to be considered in determining whether the doctrine of equitable tolling should apply.\") (citation and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the record before the court, defendant has not shown prejudice. Specifically, defense counsel argues delay prohibited defendant from properly investigating the claimed water damage, and that plaintiffs' sale of their home seven months before filing this suit further precluded defendant's investigation efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Req. Jud. Notice, ECF No. 12 (deed of sale dated Aug. 10, 2017). Defense counsel cites no support for the argument, and portions of the record contradict it. For instance, defendant's denial letter, issued four months before plaintiffs sold their home, indicated the investigation into the water damage was complete as of March 3, 2017. Denial Letter at 2-3 (\"we have completed our investigation of your homeowner's claim, which revealed continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water or steam over a period of time\"). Furthermore, at hearing plaintiffs' counsel argued that after receiving the independent consultant's report contradicting defendant's basis for coverage denial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. C, plaintiffs asked defendant to reevaluate the water damage, but defendant refused. Defense counsel did not rebut this contention, which if true, also undermines defendant's position that it was precluded from further investigating the claimed damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court declines to find any prejudice weighs against the application of equitable tolling here. Defendant's request for judicial notice, ECF No. 12, is DENIED as MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because plaintiffs timely filed this lawsuit on March 3, 2018, defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint as time barred is DENIED. Defendant's outstanding motions to strike are DENIED as MOOT and defendant's answer is due within 21 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This resolves ECF Nos. 7, 15 and 19.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \"If the last day for the performance of any act provided or required by law to be performed within a specified period of time is a holiday, then that period is hereby extended to and including the next day that is not a holiday. For purposes of this section, 'holiday' means all day on Saturdays, all holidays specified in Section 135 and, to the extent provided in Section 12b, all days that by terms of Section 12b are required to be considered as holidays.\" Cal.
