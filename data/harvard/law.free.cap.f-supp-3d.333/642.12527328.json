The Court has carefully reviewed the motions, responses, replies, the extensive record, the applicable law, and the arbitration award. The Court finds no grounds upon which it must vacate, modify, or correct the arbitration award as to Respondent AVIC USA, Inc. (\"AVIC USA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 11. The Court must confirm the arbitration award against AVIC USA because the arbitrators' ruling as to the liability of AVIC USA \" 'draws its essence' \" from the Soaring Wind Energy Agreement. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Movants' Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award Against Respondent AVIC International USA, Inc. and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Respondent AVIC USA's motion to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, Soaring Wind Energy, LLC (\"SWE\") was created with a Limited Liability\n   Company Agreement (\"the Agreement\" or \"the SWE Agreement\"). The members of SWE are Respondent AVIC USA, non-party Paul E. Thompson (\"Thompson\"), and Movants Tang Energy Group, LLC (\"TEG\"), Keith P. Young, Mitchell W. Carter, Jan Family Interests, Ltd., and The Nolan Group, Inc. (collectively \"Movants\"). AVIC USA held a 50% membership in SWE, while the five Movants held the other 50% membership in varying percentages. The Agreement defined the purpose and nature of SWE's business:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The purpose and nature of the business to be conducted by the Company shall be to provide worldwide marketing of wind energy equipment, services and materials related to wind energy including, but not limited to, marketing wind turbine generator blades and wind turbine generators and developing wind farms (the \"Business\"), and to engage in any other business or activity that now or hereafter may be necessary, incidental, proper, advisable or convenient to accomplish the foregoing purposes (including the borrowing of money and the investment of funds) and that is not forbidden by the law of the jurisdiction in which the Company engages in that business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Agreement also contains a Dispute Resolution section (\"Arbitration Provision\") requiring disputes to be resolved in binding arbitration. The Arbitration Provision of the Agreement provides for the following process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (a) The Disputing Member desiring to initiate arbitration in connection with any Dispute shall notify the other Disputing Members in writing, which notice shall provide the name of the Arbitrator appointed by the Disputing Member, demand arbitration and include a statement of the matter in controversy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (b) Within 15 days after receipt of such demand, each other Disputing Member receiving notice of the Dispute shall name an Arbitrator.... The Arbitrators so selected shall within 15 days after their designation select an additional Arbitrator.... In the event that there are more than two Disputing Members to the Dispute, then unless otherwise agreed by the Disputing Members, the Arbitrators selected by the Disputing Members shall cause the appointment of either one or two Arbitrators as necessary to constitute an odd number of total Arbitrators hearing the Dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It defines \"Disputing Member\" as \"each Member that is a party to such Dispute.\" \"Member\" is defined as \"either a Class A Member or a Class B Member, or any Person hereafter admitted to the Company as a member as provided in this Agreement, but such term does not include any Person who has ceased to be a member in the Company.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2014, TEG filed a Demand for Arbitration, joined by the other Movants, asserting a claim for breach of Agreement against the Respondents-Signatories AVIC USA and Thompson as well as the Non-Signatory Respondents Aviation Industry Corporation of China, China Aviation Industry General Aircraft Co., Ltd., AVIC International Holding Corp., AVIC International Renewable Energy Corp., and CATIC TED, Ltd. (collectively \"Non-Signatories\"). The Non-Signatories are foreign companies. After the arbitration demand was made, each SWE member selected an arbitrator for a total of seven (7) arbitrators being selected-one each by AVIC USA and Thompson, as well as one by each of the five Movants. Following the process set out in the Arbitration Provision, those seven arbitrators then selected two additional arbitrators, resulting in a nine-member arbitration panel (\"the Panel\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   in the proceeding. The Panel later permitted SWE to intervene as a party to the Arbitration. The Non-Signatory Respondents objected to any attempt to subject them to arbitration, and provided notice that they would not participate in the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 5, 2014, after the Panel had been composed but before an arbitration award had issued, AVIC USA filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking the Court's intervention related to the composition of the Panel and also a stay of the arbitration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    AVIC Int'l USA, Inc. v. Tang Energy Grp., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 14-CV-2815-K (\"\n   <em>\n    AVIC USA I\n   </em>\n   case\") (Doc. No. 1).

Tang Energy Grp., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 14-CV-3314-K (\"\n   <em>\n    Ascendant\n   </em>\n   case\") (Doc. No. 1). Ascendant sought a stay of the arbitration and a declaration from the Court regarding its party status to the arbitration, including whether the Panel or a court must determine if Ascendant was a proper party to the arbitration as a non-signatory to the SWE Agreement which contained the arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342217\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/614/218/#p219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Doc. No. 1). On August 4, 2015, the Court granted Ascendant's motion for summary judgment, declaring:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) whether Ascendant, a non-signatory to the Agreement, can be subject to arbitration based on the arbitration clause of the Agreement is for a court, not the arbitration panel, to decide because Ascendant disputes the very existence of an agreement between these parties; and (2) because the existence of any agreement between these parties is in dispute, any determination by the arbitration panel as to the jurisdiction over Ascendant is not controlling on a court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Ascendant Renewable Energy Corp. v. Tang Energy Grp., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 14-CV-3314-K,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204713240\">\n    2015 WL 4713240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 4, 2015). The Court denied as moot the requested stay. No appeal was taken in that matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The arbitration hearing occurred August 10-14, 2015. On December 21, 2015, the Panel issued their Final Award. The panel concluded, in relevant part, that: (1) the SWE members vested the Panel with authority to determine their own jurisdiction, including arbitrability of any claim or defense, such as any dispute related to the interpretation or construction of any provision in the Agreement; (2) AVIC USA's \"Affiliates\", as defined in the Agreement, engaged in the \"Business\" of SWE in violation of the Agreement's covenant not to compete; (3) AVIC USA as a Signatory was liable for its Affiliates' breach of the Agreement; (4) the Movants were entitled to damages for lost profits relating to the breach and AVIC USA should be divested of its membership interest in SWE; (5) SWE properly intervened to assert its own claims for damages; (6) SWE was entitled to $62.9 million in damages and TEG was entitled to arbitration fees, attorneys' fees, and expenses (up through a final appeal to the United States Supreme Court) allocated against all Respondents\n   except Thompson; and (7) the Movants were the \"prevailing Members\" as defined in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the Court now are the Movant's motion to confirm the arbitration award and the AVIC USA's motion to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Next, AVIC USA argues the Arbitration Provision requires a panel of three arbitrators in any scenario and asks the Court to \"give effect to the plain and objectively reasonable meaning of the arbitrator selection provision for this dispute as understood by AVIC USA: one arbitrator per side plus a third arbitrator as a tie-breaker.\" Finally, AVIC USA contends the arbitration selection provision was misinterpreted because the Non-Signatories were not allowed to select arbitrators.

However, the record does not bear this out. The Arbitration Provision does indeed clearly provide for a method of selecting the arbitrators, but it is not the method alleged by AVIC USA.

More to the point, AVIC's strained interpretation of the arbitration provision would mandate that there be precisely three arbitrators in any and every instance, no more and no fewer-one selected by one \"side,\" a second selected by the other \"side,\" and the third selected by the first two. The unambiguous wording of the arbitration provision eschews such a reading: The agreement expressly contemplates the possibility of (1) an even number of arbitrators (an impossibility under AVIC's proposed, three-only arbitrators interpretation) and (2) adding either one\n   <em>\n    or two\n   </em>\n   more arbitrators to achieve an odd number (also an impossibility under a three-only arbitrator situation).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    AVIC Int'l USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342217\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/614/218/#p219\">\n    614 F.

In reading the Agreement's provisions together, the Panel found that \"[t]he SWE Agreement requires Members and their Representatives and Affiliates to conduct the 'Business' of SWE solely through SWE or its Controlled Companies.\" There is no citation to any specific section of the Agreement as the basis for this finding and AVIC USA never identifies any liability finding by the Panel based specifically on a breach of Section 6.10. In fact, the\n   Panel's determinations make it clear that other provisions also prohibited Members and Affiliates from competing with SWE Business, and these could arguably have provided the basis for the liability determination. The Court's review of the award reveals that the Panel simply did not make the liability determination as to AVIC USA as it has alleged. This argument does not support vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   AVIC USA's argument essentially amounts to assertions that the Panel's interpretation was flawed.

Furthermore, the Court also did not declare or otherwise order that this Court must decide Ascendant's party status before any arbitration may proceed. The Court simply declared Ascendant's right for a court to \"resolve whether an agreement to arbitrate exists that would require Ascendant to participate in the underlying arbitration,\" and confirmed that if the Panel did make such a determination, the reviewing court would owe the Panel's finding no deference and would not be bound by it. The Court did not opine or make any ruling as to whether an agreement to arbitrate did indeed exist or whether some alternative theory could bind Ascendant to arbitrate; neither issue was before the Court in that declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   AVIC USA contends the Panel disobeyed the order \"[b]y taking the non-signatory alter ego question away from this Court,\" and this constitutes misconduct. This argument is meritless as the Panel did not \"take away\" this issue from the Court. Citing clear Fifth Circuit precedent, the Court declared in the\n   <em>\n    Ascendant\n   </em>\n   case that a reviewing court owes no deference to and is not bound by any such finding by arbitrators. No where did the Court order that the Panel could not hear the issue of or make a determination regarding the jurisdiction over and/or party status of Ascendant; rather, the Court declared simply that an arbitrator's findings would not be binding on a reviewing court in an instance where the existence of an agreement to arbitrate was in dispute. The Panel did not ignore this Court's order in the\n   <em>\n    Ascendant\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court concludes AVIC USA did not establish the Panel committed any misconduct under this theory, therefore the Court cannot vacate the arbitration award on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Did the Panel Make Adverse Inferences Against AVIC USA?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   AVIC USA also argues the arbitration panel committed misconduct when it made \"adverse inferences against AVIC USA based solely on the non-signatories' absence from the arbitration.\" Again citing the order in the\n   <em>\n    Ascendant\n   </em>\n   case, AVIC USA claims the Court \"rul[ed] that the non-signatories had no obligation to participate in the [arbitration] proceedings\" yet, the Panel determined the Non-Signatories' participation was required and, when they did not participate, punished AVIC USA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As previously discussed, the Court did not rule or otherwise determine in the\n   <em>\n    Ascendant\n   </em>\n   case that the Non-Signatories were not required to participate in the arbitration as AVIC USA alleges. Ascendant, which is not a party to the instant action, was the only Non-Signatory to appear in that declaratory judgment action. The Court declared Ascendant's rights under the controlling law, specifically that it was for a court, not an arbitrator, to decide Ascendant's party status because it attacked the existence of any agreement to arbitrate with Tang or any other party, and, if the arbitrator did make such a determination, it would not be controlling on a court reviewing the arbitration award. There was never a ruling from this Court that Ascendant, the only non-signatory to appear before it, had no obligation to participate\n   in the arbitration proceedings, as AVIC USA claims. That issue was not before the Court. AVIC USA has misconstrued or misinterpreted the Court's ruling in the\n   <em>\n    Ascendant\n   </em>\n   case, and this argument fails to the extent the \"adverse inference\" argument relies on this misinterpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   AVIC USA contends that it was \"punished\" by the Panel when they found AVIC USA liable based on adverse inferences the Panel made as a result of the Non-Signatories' refusal to participate. AVIC USA alleges the damages award is at least some indication of how \"the panel's 'adverse' view of the evidence affected its findings.\" The only specific adverse inference AVIC USA references is the following sentence: \"As a result, the panel has opted to infer that Xu Hang's statement in CX 330 that AVIC International has invested $50 USD million in wind power projects in the United States is accurate without any additional evidence.\" AVIC USA argues there was no actual evidence to support any damages award and, in fact, there was uncontested evidence rebutting Xu Hang's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   At the heart of this argument, AVIC USA is ultimately complaining about: (1) the arbitration panel's decision to make an adverse inference pursuant to their authority under the AAA rules and language in the SWE Agreement, as interpreted by the Panel; and (2) the weight the Panel chose to give the evidence. The Court cannot vacate the arbitration award based on errors in interpretation or application of the law, or mistakes in factfinding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Paperworkers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p37\">\n    484 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p37\">\n    108 S.Ct. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    McKool Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338233\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/650/208/#p211\">\n    650 F.

AVIC USA first argues that this damages award constitutes consequential damages as Delaware law clearly provides that \"lost profits\" are consequential damages. (SWE is a Delaware limited liability company.) What AVIC USA fails to clarify is that well-established Delaware law provides that \"lost profits\" on \"\n   <em>\n    collateral\n   </em>\n   business arrangements\" are considered consequential damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    eCommerce Indus., Inc. v.

This breach was not related to a \"collateral business arrangement\", but was, at the least, a very important part of what the parties bargained for in this Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205621678\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"With respect to a non-compete provision or agreement, I conclude that the profits\n   of the product line or business that is being protected from competition constitute the benefit for which the protected party bargained.

The Court disagrees that Delaware law automatically categorizes these damages as consequential and finds AVIC USA did not establish the Panel exceeded their authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   AVIC USA next argues the \"lost profits\" award is \"wholly speculative\" because it is based solely on adverse inferences whereas the \"actual unrebutted evidence\" establishes there was no such investment. As the Court discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , AVIC USA did not meet its burden related to its adverse inferences arguments. AVIC USA's argument that the award was purely speculative because it is based on these adverse inferences must fail. The Panel indicated in the arbitration award the \"lost profits\" damages arose from breach of the Agreement, and included how they arrived at it in light of the Agreement and the evidence they considered.

The Panel did not characterize the divestiture as \"punitive\" or \"special\" damages in the award, and AVIC USA provides no persuasive argument or case law establishing such a divestiture is considered punitive or special damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Executone\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed it prior holding that the arbitrators' choice of remedy is afforded more deference than their interpretation of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Executone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515973\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1314/#p1320\">\n    26 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1325 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Timegate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n    713 F.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \" 'The single question is whether the award, however arrived at, is rationally inferable from the contract.' \"\n   <em>\n    Executone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515973\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1314/#p1320\">\n    26 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderman/Smith Operating Co. v.

The Panel determined the lost profits award of $62.9 million was due to SWE for distribution to its Members. The Panel also noted that the divestiture was necessary to prevent AVIC USA, a member of SWE, from profiting from the breach of the SWE Agreement. The Court finds the divestiture is rationally inferable from the SWE Agreement, therefore it meets the \"essence\" test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Executone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515973\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1314/#p1320\">\n    26 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, AVIC USA failed to meet its burden to establish the panel had no authority under the Agreement to award these damages, thereby exceeding their powers and requiring vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Did the Panel Improperly Award Attorneys' Fees to SWE?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   AVIC USA contends the Panel exceeded its authority in awarding TEG past and future attorneys' fees along with costs against AVIC USA. On this point, AVIC USA makes three specific arguments. First, although the Agreement allows \"prevailing Members\" to recover court costs, fees, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, AVIC USA argues the Agreement specifically requires the arbitrators to \"determine that compelling reasons exist for allocating all or a portion of such costs and expenses to one or more than Disputing Members.\" Because the Panel did not make this determination or identify compelling reasons for this allocation, AVIC USA contends the award must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In allocating attorneys' fees and arbitration expenses, the Panel cites to Section 13.4 of the Agreement which provides that the \"prevailing Members ... shall be entitled to recover from the other Member or Members ... all court costs, fees and expenses of such arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees.\" AVIC USA does not dispute that the Agreement allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees and expenses. Instead, AVIC USA takes aim at the Panel's failure to reference Section 13.3(k) which, according to AVIC USA, requires the panel to identify a \"compelling\" reason in order to award attorneys' fees and costs against another Disputing Member. This argument attacks the Panel's interpretation of the Agreement and their authority under the specific section addressing allocation of these costs. The Court may not vacate the award on these grounds.\n   <em>\n    Timegate Studios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n    713 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second, AVIC USA argues the allocated fees and expenses must be from a \"Disputing Member\" to another \"Disputing Member\". AVIC USA asserts that SWE was award the damages, but SWE is not a \"Disputing Member\", and the fees and costs were awarded to TEG, a \"Disputing Member\"; yet, the Panel made no finding as to whether the costs and fees being allocated were TEG's or SWE's. This argument centers on an interpretation of the Agreement which is within the panel's jurisdiction. This Court will not, and cannot, second-guess the panel's reasons for allocating the attorneys' fees and expenses as it did. Even if the Court disagreed with the panel's interpretation of the Agreement, the Court cannot vacate an award on this basis.\n   <em>\n    Timegate Studios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n    713 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As a final argument on fees and expenses, AVIC USA contends no \"Disputing Member\" prevailed over AVIC USA. This argument hinges in part on AVIC USA's earlier argument in Section III.B regarding liability based on a rewriting of Section 6.10. The Court has already concluded that argument fails; therefore to the extent this argument relies on vacatur under that Section 6.10 argument, it too fails. AVIC USA argues alternatively that regardless of that prior argument, TEG is still not a prevailing party because all but one of its claims were dismissed and TEG recovered less than 1% of the damages it sought. As with the previous arguments, this argument attacks the Panel's interpretation of \"prevailing party\" as defined and used in the Agreement. AVIC USA simply disagrees with the Panel's conclusion. This argument does not provide a basis for vacating the arbitration award.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Did the Panel Fail to Account for Any Return on the Investment?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   AVIC USA argues any damages award should have included a deduction for AVIC USA's return on investment (\"ROI\") for wind development projects pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. AVIC USA contends it was entitled to some amount of ROI deduction for the capital contribution it would have made and because there is no way to determine the specific amount (as it was undefined in the Agreement), the entire award is speculative and in violation of the Agreement's provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As stated previously many times, this Court is very limited it is review of the arbitration award. The Court may review only \"whether the award, however arrived at, is rationally inferable from the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Executone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515973\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1314/#p1320\">\n    26 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). \"[P]erhaps most importantly, even if the arbitrators incorrectly calculated the damage award, an arbitrator's erroneous interpretation of law or facts is not a basis for vactur of an award.\"\n   <em>\n    Pfeifle v. Chemoil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144597\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/73/720/#p722\">\n    73 F. App'x 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722-722 (5th Cir. 2003). The law is clear on this and AVIC USA's argument fails. Any error in failing to account for an ROI does not provide a basis for the Court to vacate this award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Did the Panel Improperly Assert Jurisdiction Over Derivative SWE Claims?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In its final argument for vacatur, AVIC USA asserts the Panel exceeded its powers in allowing TEG to intervene on SWE's behalf and because SWE was not a proper party to the arbitration, the $62.9 million awarded to SWE must be vacated. Specifically, AVIC USA argues that the Agreement requires a Supermajority (&gt;66%) of Class A membership interests to approve any decision outside the ordinary course of SWE's business. Because AVIC USA owned 50% of the Class A membership interests, it was necessarily required to agree to SWE's participation in the arbitration, but TEG never sought or secured AVIC USA's consent. Therefore, SWE's motion to intervene should have been denied and the award should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   AVIC USA's argument is essentially this-because AVIC USA did not authorize this legal action\n   <em>\n    against itself\n   </em>\n   , the Panel exceeded it powers in permitting SWE to intervene, and therefore this award must be vacated. While this argument is absurd, it ultimately fails just as numerous of its other arguments. AVIC USA objected on these same grounds during arbitration when SWE petitioned to intervene; the Panel, however, decided SWE was a proper party to the arbitration because \"[t]he management committee of SWE took action in accordance with article VI of the SWE Agreement authorizing SWE's claims.\" The Panel clearly interpreted the Agreement in ruling that SWE was a proper claimant with standing and was permitted to intervene. The Court must affirm the award \"as long as the arbitrator's decision 'draws its essence' from the contract\", resolving all doubts in favor of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Timegate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n    713 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . AVIC USA failed to meet its burden to prove that the Panel exceeded their powers in \"utterly contort[ing] the evident purpose and intent of the parties-the 'essence' of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558615\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/797/#p802\">\n    at 802-803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
