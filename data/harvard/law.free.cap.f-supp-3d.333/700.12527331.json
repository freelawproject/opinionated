PARKER, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action reflects a conflict faced by many public universities in their attempt to balance the First Amendment rights of students and the need to provide a safe learning environment free from discrimination and harassment. Speech First, Inc., an organization that seeks to preserve the civil rights of students at colleges and universities, filed this action on behalf of three unidentified students at the University of Michigan (\"University\") who claim\n   their rights to free speech have been chilled by the University's disciplinary code prohibiting \"harassment,\" \"bullying,\" and \"bias-related conduct.\" Speech First also challenges the University's \"Bias Response Team,\" which it claims is tasked with investigating and punishing students for \"bias\" conduct. The matter presently is before the Court on Speech First's motion for preliminary injunction, filed May 11, 2018. (ECF No. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In its motion, Speech First seeks an injunction enjoining Defendants, members of the University's Board of Regents, from:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) taking any actions to investigate, threaten, or punish students for violations of the prohibitions on \"harassment,\" \"bullying,\" and \"bias-related misconduct\" set forth in the University's Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities (the \"Statement\"); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (2) using the Bias Response Team to investigate, threaten, or punish students (including informal punishments such as \"restorative justice\" or \"individual education\") for \"bias incidents.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 82.) The United States submitted a statement of interest in support of Speech First's motion on June 11, 2018. (ECF No. 14.) After requesting and receiving an extension of time, Defendants filed a response to the motion for preliminary injunction on June 15, 2018. (ECF No. 18.) Speech First filed a reply brief on June 29, 2018. (ECF No. 21.) The Court held a hearing with respect to the motion on July 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The University's Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities (\"Statement\") \"describes possible behaviors which are inconsistent with the values of the University community[.]\" (Mot., Ex. A(1) at 1, ECF No. 4-2 at Pg ID 125.) The Statement \"outlines procedures to respond to such behaviors,\" and \"suggests possible sanctions/interventions which are intended to educate and to safeguard members of the University community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the Statement indicates that the University's standards of conduct \"may exceed federal, state, or local requirements[,] it further indicates that \"[s]tudents at the University have the same rights and protections under the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Michigan as other citizens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, Pg ID 125-26.) The Statement elaborates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   These rights include freedom of expression, press, religion, and assembly. The University has a long tradition of student activism and values freedom of expression, which includes voicing unpopular views and dissent. As members of the University community, students have the right to express their own views, but must also take responsibility for according the same right to others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, Pg ID 126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The \"Violations\" section of the Statement provides a list of behaviors deemed to \"contradict the values of the University community\" and which \"are subject to action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Pg ID 127.) The list includes \"[h]arassing or bullying another person-physically, verbally, or through other means.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These terms, like the remaining \"[t]erms associated with Statement violations[,] are not defined within the Statement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 2(B) at 1, ECF No. 4-2 at Pg ID 141;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2(A) at 1-14, Pg ID 124-38.) The Statement governs behaviors occurring on University controlled property, at University sponsored events and programs, and in the city of Ann Arbor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2(A) at 4, Pg ID 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   University students, faculty members, and staff members may file a complaint alleging a violation of the Statement with the University's Office of Student Conflict Resolution (\"OSCR\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5, Pg ID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   129.) A Resolution Coordinator (\"RC\") then investigates the complaint and decides how to respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Statement identifies the following possible \"sanctions/interventions\": (A) formal reprimand, (B) disciplinary probation, (C) restitution, (D) restrictions on University employment, (E) enrollment and completion of a class or workshop to help the student understand why the behavior is inappropriate, (F) completion of an educational project, (G) community service, (H) removal or transfer from university housing, (I) removal from specific courses or activities, (J) no contact restrictions, (K) suspension, and (L) expulsion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10, Pg ID 133-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   OSCR's website, where the Statement is posted, also contains a \"Definitions\" webpage for terms associated with Statement violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2(B), ECF No. 4-2 at Pg ID 141.) This webpage begins: \"Terms associated with Statement violations are not defined within the Statement. The following explanations are provided as examples of various interpretations that exist for terms used in the [Statement].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , emphasis removed.) When this lawsuit was filed on May 8, 2018, the webpage included definitions for \"harassing\" and \"bullying\" from Merriam-Webster Dictionary, University policies, and Michigan law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pg ID 146-47.) The Court recites the dictionary definition, as it is the one Speech First highlights in support of its First Amendment claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Harassing (\n   <em>\n    http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harassing\n   </em>\n   ): (1) to annoy persistently (2) to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for, especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal and physical conduct[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Bullying (\n   <em>\n    http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bully\n   </em>\n   ): (1) to frighten, hurt, or threaten (a smaller weaker person), (2) to act like a bully toward (someone), (3) to cause (someone) to do something by making threats or insults or by using force, (4) to treat abusively, (5) to affect by means of force or coercion[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before Speech First filed this lawsuit, the University was reviewing its websites and policies to ensure they complied with the law. (Defs.' Resp., Ex. C \u00b6 8, ECF No. 18-4 at Pg ID 395.) On June 11, 2018, the University announced that it had revised the definitions of \"harassing\" and \"bullying\" that appeared on the OSCR website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, citing Ex. 1, Pg ID 395, 400;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18-4 at Pg ID 402-03.) Specifically, the University eliminated the definitions from the dictionary and other University policies and left those drawn from Michigan statutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10, Pg ID 395, 400.) The remaining definitions are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Harassing: conduct directed toward a person that includes repeated or continuing unconsented contact that would cause a reasonable individual to suffer substantial emotional distress and that actually causes the person to suffer substantial emotional distress. Harassing does not include constitutionally protected activity or conduct that serves a legitimate purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Bullying: any written, verbal, or physical act, or any electronic communication, directed toward a person that is intended to cause or that a reasonable person would know is likely to cause, and that actually causes, physical harm or substantial emotional distress and thereby adversely affects the ability of another person to participate in or benefit from the University's educational programs or activities. Bullying does not include constitutionally protected activity or conduct that serves a legitimate purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12, Pg ID 396.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to E. Royster Harper, the University's Vice President for Student Life, who oversees the OSCR, the revised definitions were considered and approved\n   by multiple members of the University's leadership, including the President. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14, Pg ID 396.) Mr. Harper indicates that the earlier definitions had not gone through such review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Harper states in his declaration, made under penalty of perjury: \"These definitions, and no others, now will govern the initiation and conduct of disciplinary proceedings involving harassing or bullying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, Pg ID 397.) The definitions are now the only ones appearing on the OSCR website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2, ECF No. 18-4 at Pg ID 412-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In April 2018, the University also announced amendments to the Statement to take effect on July 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16, Pg ID 397;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. K, ECF No. 4-2 at Pg ID 263-64.), These amendments include the addition of a new \"violation\" for engaging in the previously-listed prohibited behaviors (i.e., behaviors labelled \"A\" through \"U\") when \"motivated by bias or prejudice\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   V. Engaging in misconduct as defined in violations \"A\" through \"U\" motivated by bias or prejudice. This includes behavior motivated on the basis of any person's identity as protected by the University of Michigan's Nondiscrimination Policy (race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status) [201.89-1 and Regents bylaw 14.06]. Sanctions may be enhanced for any misconduct listed in sections IV of the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities that is determined to be motivated on the basis of the above classifications. This violation will be evaluated under current legal standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Defs.' Mot., Ex. C \u00b6 17, ECF No. 18-4 at Pg ID 397; Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 2(K), ECF No. 4-2 at Pg ID 263-64.) An amendment to the sanctions section of the Statement reflects that bias-motivated misconduct will be treated as two separate violations, evaluated separately in the sanctions/interventions stage: one for the specific act of misconduct and a second for the bias motivation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The \"Definitions\" page on the OSCR's website does not define \"bias\" or \"prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://oscr.umich.edu/article/definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During the 2010-2011 academic year, the University created a Bias Response Team (\"BRT\") as an informal resource to support students who believe they have been affected by incidents of bias, to report them to other campus resources as appropriate, and to educate the University community regarding bias issues. (Defs.' Resp., Ex. D \u00b6 2, ECF No. 18-5 at Pg ID 424.) The BRT is based out of the office of the University's Dean of Students, Laura Blake Jones. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, Pg ID 423-24.) According to Ms. Jones and the BRT webpage on the Dean of Students' website, the BRT is not a disciplinary body; it cannot punish or sanction anyone and does not make a determination whether a reported incident should be considered an instance of \"bias.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, Pg ID 424;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 at Pg ID 455.) Instead, the BRT's role is to listen to students who feel negatively impacted by conduct they perceive as \"bias\" and to serve as an educational resource. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, Pg ID 425-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Jones explains that the webpage for the BRT on the Dean of Students' website provides an intentionally broad description of a \"bias incident\" because the BRT is focused on providing support for students who need it, rather than punishing anyone or proving anything. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Pg ID 426.) \"It is an invitation to students who feel impacted by what they consider to be bias to seek support from professionals who are equipped to help them should the students voluntarily wish to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Dean of Students' website explains that \"[b]ias often stems from fear, misunderstanding, hatred, and stereotypes and may be intentional\n   or unintentional.\" (Ex. F at Pg ID 4-2 at Pg ID 169.) The website also states: \"Bias incidents may involve conduct that does not violate any law or university policy,\" although some cases \"do involve conduct that may violate federal, state, or local laws or U-M policies.\" (Ex. 2 \u00b6 13, citing Ex. 1, Pg ID 427, 454.) According to Ms. Jones, when the conduct is deemed unlawful or in violation of University policies, the BRT may discuss appropriate referrals with the student reporting the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In an affidavit attached to Defendants' response brief, Evelyn Galvan, one of the two Bias Incident Prevention and Response Team Coordinators on the BRT, describes how a report to the BRT is handled. (Defs.' Resp. Ex. B, ECF No. 18-3.) As Ms. Galvan describes, when received, a report is entered on the Bias Incident Log, which the Interim Dean of Students, Dr. Julio Cardona, and Ms. Jones review before it is published. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4, ECF No. 387.) No determination is made as to whether the conduct described is a \"bias incident\" or not, all reports are logged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Galvan then determines whether the incident falls within the purview of University Housing (e.g., a roommate dispute) or the Office for Institutional Equity (i.e. incidents between employees). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) In those instances, the report is referred to a BRT member from one of those offices to address it through the unit's internal procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Galvan handles the remaining incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ms. Galvan first tries to reach out to the person who made the report and will meet with that person, if he or she is willing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6, at Pg ID 387-88.) In that meeting, Ms. Galvan discusses the experience that prompted the report and the support the University offers, which may include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   educating the reporter on healthy coping mechanisms in the face of bias or how to listen and respond to people with different views; safety planning; discussions about free speech law; a referral to Counseling and Psychological Services (\"CAPS\"); introductions to relevant student groups; or brainstorming on how to find a mentor or support network.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, Pg ID 388.) If the reporter is interested in utilizing OSCR's ACR pathways program, or if it seems like an appropriate resource, Ms. Galvan explains the program and will facilitate an introduction to the individual who oversees it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, Pg ID 388.) If Ms. Galvan or the reporter believes the incident violates the Statement, Ms. Galvan will discuss the possibility of the reporter making a report to OSCR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, Pg ID 388.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Galvan will reach out via email to the person whose conduct is reported if the reporter wants her to do so, although this does not occur in the majority of cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Pg ID 389.) In her email, Ms. Galvan invites the person to meet with her to discuss the report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Galvan states that a response to her request is entirely voluntary (although it is not clear whether this is expressed in her email) and that many of the people who she emails decline to meet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In that case, she does not follow up with the individual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The University also is running a campaign called \"Expect Respect,\" which it describes as \"an educational initiative that includes annual proactive programming aimed at supporting a campus climate in which all persons are treated with respect.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    http://expectrespect.umich.edu\n   </em>\n   . Speech First quotes definitions of \"bias\" and \"harassment\" found on the \"Definitions\" page of the Expect Respect website, to demonstrate the overbreadth of the University's policies. (Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. at 7, ECF No. 4 at Pg ID 96.) On that webpage, \"bias\" is defined as \"a pre-formed negative opinion or attitude toward\n   a group of persons who possess common physical characteristics, such as skin color; or cultural experiences, such as religion or national origin.\" (Pl.'s Mot., Ex. E, ECF No. 4-2 at Pg ID 164.) \"Harassment\" is defined as \"unwanted negative attention perceived as intimidating, demeaning or bothersome to an individual.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 165.) The following appears at the top of the webpage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Below are definitions of terms that are commonly used in conversations about creating a safe and respectful climate, as adopted by the University of Michigan.\n   <strong>\n    These definitions, however, should not be interpreted as legal definitions used to determine if a violation of law has occurred.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 164, emphasis in original.) The definitions page no longer appears on the website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to Speech First's President, the organization has several members who are current students at the University who feel that they cannot openly and vigorously debate and discuss a wide array of often-controversial topics without running afoul of the University's harassment and bullying policies. (Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7-8, ECF No. 401 at Pg ID 117-18.) The Complaint describes three of these students: which it identifies as \"Student A\", \"Student B\", and \"Student C.\" The topics these students wish to debate and discuss include, but are not limited to: (a) support for gun rights, President Trump, the border wall, and the right of \"highly unpopular speaker[s]\" to lecture on campus; (b) opposition to illegal immigration, abortion, affirmative action, and having children outside of marriage; and (c) criticism of the Black Lives Matter and \"gender identity\" movements, welfare, affirmative action, and Title IX. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-124.) According to the Complaint, these students \"credibly fear\" that they will be reported to the BRT or OSCR if they attempt to discuss or debate these topics.

In fact, when questioned at the motion hearing, counsel for Defendants indicated that there were sixteen disciplinary cases involving \"bullying\" or \"harassing\" misconduct from 2016-2018. The policy's alleged overbreadth means that members of the University cannot pre-determine what matters of speech may or may not subject them to punishment. In that instance, Supreme Court precedent dictates that Speech First-on behalf of Students A, B, and C-has standing to challenge the University's policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Village of Schaumburg v.

As indicated, the BRT website expressly states that it lacks the authority to impose discipline and that no one is required to participate in any aspect of its work and cannot be compelled to meet. Speech First presents no evidence of any communication from the BRT to an individual reported to have engaged in \"bias\" or \"biased conduct\" conveying something different-more specifically, pressure or an intimation that some form of punishment or adverse action will follow the failure to accede the BRT's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The evidence does not even reflect an instance where the BRT criticized the speech of an individual who is reported to have engaged in biased conduct.

The Court agrees with defense counsel's assertion at the motion hearing that a university should be able to address a student when his or her speech may offend or hurt other students without running afoul of the First Amendment. As counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   That's education. That's what a professor should do. That's what the university should do when someone comes to a body that's created in order to promote respect and understanding on the campus. Respect and understanding are not enemies of the First Amendment.... Respect is a condition for effective speech. Understanding is the goal of speech.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In short, Speech First fails to demonstrate that the BRT poses a concrete or objective threat of harm to the First Amendment rights of University students. The Court therefore holds that Speech First fails to demonstrate the injury-in-fact necessary to establish Article III standing with respect to its challenge to the BRT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Speech First argues in reply that the University's unilateral changes to its definitions do not moot the case and that the changes do not impact Speech First's challenges with respect to the BRT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Article III of the United States Constitution restricts the power of federal courts to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const. art.

Under either standard, this Court finds that Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating mootness with respect to the University's \"bullying\" and \"harassment\" policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   First, the University removed the objected to definitions of \"bullying\" and \"harassing\" within a month of Speech First's initiation of this lawsuit. The revisions were the product of a review started before the action was filed to ensure the University's website and policies complied with First Amendment principles and the University's legal obligations. Unlike the previous definitions challenged by Speech First, the revisions were considered and approved by multiple members of the University's leadership, including the President. The changes were announced to the University community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, the University has not defended to any degree the constitutionality of the previous definitions. And, the University represents in a statement made under penalty of perjury that the revised definitions, and no others, will govern the initiation and conduct of disciplinary proceedings involving \"harassing\" and \"bullying\" behavior. Speech First insinuates that the University routinely adopts policies that infringe the First Amendment rights of its students, referencing\n   <em>\n    Doe v. University of Michigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11352390\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/721/852/\">\n    721 F.Supp. 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the fact that the University adopted a policy\n   <em>\n    thirty years ago\n   </em>\n   that was immediately overturned, does not persuade this Court that it is likely to reverse course once this lawsuit terminates. Nothing suggests that the University will resume using the challenged definitions once this litigation terminates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The OSCR website does not define \"bias\" or \"prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    https://oscr.umich.edu/article/definitions\n   </em>\n   . Thus, Speech First may maintain that the allegedly overbroad definitions of those terms, which still appear on other University materials, could be used to define such prohibited conduct. Nevertheless, a violation of the Statement occurs only if the \"bias\" or \"prejudice\" motivates other prohibited conduct. This requirement prevents the prohibited conduct from being interpreted in an unconstitutionally overbroad manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The University's conduct after this lawsuit was filed \"ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" As such, the Court finds Speech First's constitutional challenge to the University's previous \"bullying\" and \"harassing\" definitions to be moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Irreparable Harm to Speech First and Others\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Speech First argues that it and its members will suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction because \" '[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.' \" (Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. at 24, ECF No. 4 at Pg ID 113, quoting\n   <em>\n    Elrod v. Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p373\">\n    427 U.S. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p373\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176896\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/347/#p373\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976).) The University's removal of the challenged \"bullying\" and \"harassing\" definitions, however, removes the threat to students' free speech rights. Speech First does not argue that the remaining definitions, which are based on Michigan statutes, are overbroad or otherwise unconstitutional. In fact, Michigan state and federal courts have upheld the constitutionality of those statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Speech First's counsel acknowledged at the motion hearing that a university must do all it can to promote respect among students. Further, as the\n   <em>\n    Bonnell\n   </em>\n   court found, enjoining such policies harm the public's interest \"in knowing that such goings on are properly investigated and not allowed to continue in any given arena.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139082\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/800/#p826\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that the second, third, and fourth preliminary injunction factors also weigh against the issuance of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
