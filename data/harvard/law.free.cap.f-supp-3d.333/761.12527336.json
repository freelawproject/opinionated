The Fund is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Defendants in this lawsuit are Janet L. Billeter and her attorneys, Bordas &amp; Bordas, PLLC (collectively \"Defendants\"). Ms. Billeter was an enrollee in the Fund at the time that she sustained serious injuries in an accident on January 9, 2015, when she was struck as a pedestrian by a tractor trailer. (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, ECF No. 1.) \"These injuries included fractures of the neck, back, pelvis, ribs and left arm, a collapsed lung, a lacerated liver, and a severed right arm from the shoulder and numerous surgeries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Mot.

(\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1, \u00b6 10.) The Fund alleges that \"sometime between January and March 2017 Defendants settled the personal injury claim for approximately $10,000,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Fund brings this suit \"for equitable relief to enforce the terms and preserve the assets of an employee welfare benefit Fund's subrogation and reimbursement rights under the terms of the governing Fund documents through imposition of an equitable lien by agreement or a constructive trust on funds received or to be received by Defendant from a third party, pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1.)

(\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Mot. S.J.\n   </em>\n   , p. 8, ECF No. 22.) The Fund's assertion is well taken. This case is similar to\n   <em>\n    McCutchen\n   </em>\n   in all material respects except one. In this case, the plain language of the Plan disavowing the common-fund doctrine Defendants seek to impose is unambiguous, and leaves no room for equitable defenses to operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although there are cross motions for summary judgment, the Court addresses the Plan's motion first. In view of this approach, the Court treats Defendants as the non-movants with respect to the evidence in the record. As discussed in more detail below, the Court grants the Fund's motion for summary judgment because the terms of the plan are clear and they foreclose the application of the equitable defenses asserted by Defendants, and because Defendants' remaining arguments are not sufficiently supported by evidence in the record. The Court also denies as moot Defendants' motion for summary judgment, which raises largely the same arguments as Defendants' opposition brief and which introduces no additional evidence that would support a different decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the Fund's motion for leave to file a sur-reply and motion to strike are denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Fund's complaint asserts one count, seeking to enforce the terms of the Fund documents pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-32, ECF No. 1.) ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)(B)(ii) provides that a \"civil action may be brought by a plan fiduciary ... to obtain other appropriate equitable relief ... to enforce ... the terms of the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The Fund asserts that it relies \"on the equitable relief provided by ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), along with the Subrogation and Reimbursement Agreement and the Subrogation and Reimbursement provision in the Fund's governing document for their demand for equitable relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Mot. S.J.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5, ECF No. 22.) Additionally, the Fund asserts that \"[t]he Subrogation and Reimbursement provision in the Fund's governing document satisfies the requirements of an equitable lien by agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Plan Sets Forth an Equitable Lien by Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Fund's Rules and Regulations (the \"Plan\") \"were originally adopted effective January 1, 1984 by the Trustees of the UFCW [United Food and Commercial Workers] Local Unions and Employers Benefit Plan of the Southwestern Ohio Area under the Plan's Trust Agreement to\n   establish the Rules and Regulations determining the eligibility of Employees for the health and welfare benefits to be provided by the Plan and to prescribe the amount, extent, conditions and method of payment of such benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Mot. S.J.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. H, Heartland Health &amp; Wellness Fund Rules and Regulations, p. 1, ECF No. 22-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plan sets forth the duties and authorities of the Plan's Trustees. These duties include carrying out the obligation \"to maintain, within the limits of the funds available to them, a sound and economical program dedicated to providing the maximum benefits for eligible Employees and Dependents ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Fund contends that it has a right to recover benefits paid by a third party that is legally responsible for medical payments. The Plan sets forth its rights to subrogation and reimbursement in Section 7.6(c):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    Plan's Rights to Subrogation and Reimbursement\n   </em>\n   . The Plan shall be entitled to subrogation or reimbursement with regard to all rights of recovery of a Person, or representatives, guardians, beneficiaries, fiduciaries, trustees, estate representatives, heirs, executors, administrators of any special needs trust, and any other agents, persons or entities that may receive a benefit on behalf of the Person (collectively for purposes of this section 7.6(c), \"Person\"), to the extent of any amounts which the Plan has paid or may become obligated to pay on account of any claim against any person, organization or other entity in connection with the injury, illness, sickness, accident or condition to which the claim relates (\"Source\"). A Source includes, but is not limited to, a responsible party and/or a responsible party's insurer (or self-funded protection), no-fault protection, personal injury protection, medical payments coverage, financial responsibility and any employer of the Person under the provisions of a Worker's Compensation or Occupational Disease Law. The Plan shall also be entitled, to the extent of payments made or to be made on account of the claim, to reimbursement from the proceeds of any settlement, judgment or payments from any Source that may result from the exercise of any rights of recovery by the Person. Such subrogation and reimbursement rights shall apply on a priority, first dollar basis to any recovery whether by suit, settlement or otherwise, whether there is a partial or full recovery and regardless of whether the Person is made whole and shall apply to any and all amounts of recovery regardless of whether the amounts are characterized or described as medical expenses or as amounts other than for medical expenses and regardless of whether liability is admitted or contested by the Source. Once the Plan makes or is obligated to make payments on behalf of a Person on account of the claim,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the Plan is granted, and the Person consents to, an equitable lien by agreement or a constructive trust on the proceeds of any payment, settlement or judgment received by the Person from any Source\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The Plan shall have no right of subrogation or reimbursement against an insurance carrier arising out of an individual policy of insurance maintained by a Person, except for a policy which provides \"no-fault\" automobile insurance. The Plan will not pay benefits in excess of $2,500 on behalf of any Person if such Person does not pursue his own rights of recovery to which he may be\n   entitled from any individual, organization or other entity in connection with the injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. VII-22)(emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, in Section 7.6(c)(ii), the Plan states that it may also require the execution of a Subrogation and Reimbursement Agreement, but the rights to subrogation attach regardless of whether the separate agreement is executed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The Trustees may also require the Person to execute a Subrogation and Reimbursement Agreement (\"Agreement\"), in a form provided by and acceptable to the Trustees, as a condition to receiving benefits for a claim. The Plan has the right to suspend all benefit payments if the Agreement is not executed by the Person or if the Agreement is modified in any way by the Person without the consent of the Plan. If the Person is a minor or is incompetent to execute the Agreement, that person's parent, the Person (in the case of a minor dependent child), the Person's spouse, or legal representative (in the case of an incompetent adult) must execute the Agreement upon request of the Plan. If the Plan, in its sole discretion, advances claims payments in the absence of an Agreement, or if the Plan advances claims payments in error, said payments will not waive, compromise, diminish, release or otherwise prejudice any of the Plan's rights to reimbursement or subrogation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A Person must comply with all terms of the Agreement, including the establishment of a trust for the benefit of the Plan. In this regard, the Person agrees that the amount that the Plan has advanced or is obligated to advance in benefits received from any source will be immediately deposited into a trust for the Plan's benefit and the Plan shall have an equitable lien by agreement that shall be enforceable under legal, equitable and/or injunctive action to ensure that these amounts are preserved and not disbursed. The Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights shall apply regardless of whether the Person executes the Agreement\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p.

The Plan Unambiguously Requires a Person to Pay their own Attorney's Fees, and Disavows Common Law Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, the Plan clearly and unambiguously provides that \"the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply to any recovery by the Person without regard to legal fees and expenses of the person\" \"unless the Trustees, in their sole discretion, have agreed in writing to discount the Plan's claim by an agreed upon amount of such fees or expenses.\" Furthermore, the Plan clearly disavows common law defenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (iv)\n   <em>\n    Person's Attorney's Fees\n   </em>\n   . The Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply to any recovery by the Person without regard to legal fees and expenses of the Person. The Person shall be solely responsible for paying all legal fees and expenses in connection with any recovery for the underlying injury, illness, sickness, accident or condition, and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the Plan's recovery shall not be reduced by such legal fees or expenses, unless the Trustees, in their sole discretion, have agreed in writing to discount the Plan's claim by an agreed upon amount of such fees or expenses\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (v)\n   <em>\n    Disavowal of Common Law Defenses\n   </em>\n   .

The plaintiff is required to pay for the medical bills of Ms. Billeter, regardless of whether a third party tort-feasor may also be liable for the same medical expenses. Ms. Billeter, through her attorneys, has received a settlement in excess of such amounts. The plaintiff demands a 100% recovery of the payments it has made, even though the upshot will be that Ms. Billeter's contingent fee agreement requires her to pay from her own recovery a percentage of the $712,761.51 she now owes the fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) is designed to make whole a fund that expends attorney's fees to recover monies owed.

Section 1132(g)(1) provides that \"the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney's fee and costs of action to either party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As explained above in\n   <em>\n    McCutchen\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that, given the language of an ERISA plan providing for full recovery of subrogated benefits, the fund was not subject to equitable defenses. Yet, the Court also was quite clear that \"No one can doubt that the common-fund rule would govern here in the absence of a contrary agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 104,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697067\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/88/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, since Ms. Billeter paid money to gain funds for herself and the Fund, she would be entitled to reimbursement for a proportionate share owed to the plaintiff. The Plan gives the Fund the power to demand a 100% recovery - not so with additional attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court finds that, given the 100% recovery of the plaintiff, an imposition of additional attorney's fees on the defendant would be manifestly unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(\n    <em>\n     Def.'s Mot. S.J.\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 21.) They also assert that Ms. Billeter did not actually sign the separate subrogation agreement. Taken as true, it is of no moment, because the language of the Plan set forth in detail in the Opinion below specifically states that \"the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights shall apply regardless of whether the Person executes the [separate] Agreement.\" Defendants also assert that the amount of the reimbursement was not properly calculated using insurance codes, but this assertion is not sufficiently supported by the evidence in the record. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , pp. 4-7.) Additionally, Defendants assert that they relied to their detriment on a letter from the Fund's law firm dated October 17, 2016, advising that the lien had been reduced by the Fund's stop loss coverage, such that the remaining lien amount due is $520,9990.59. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , pp. 12-13.) However, the letter itself directs Defendants to \"contact us to confirm the total amount of the Fund's subrogated interest before resolving this matter.\" (\n    <em>\n     Letter\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 23-2.)
