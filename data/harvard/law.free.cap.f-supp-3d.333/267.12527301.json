If so, the claimant is not disabled.

To do so, the Commissioner must present evidence to demonstrate that the claimant \"retains a residual functional capacity to perform alternative substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy\" in light of his or her age, education, and work experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosa v.

The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ALJ's decision analyzed Guttierez's claim for benefits under the process described above. At step one, the ALJ found that Guttierez had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date. Tr. 27. At step two, the ALJ found that Guttierez has the following severe impairments: obesity and bipolar, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Tr. 27-28. At step three, the ALJ found that these impairments, alone or in combination, did not meet or medically equal any Listings impairment. Tr. 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Next, the ALJ determined that Guttierez retains the RFC to perform medium work\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with additional limitations. Tr. 29-35. Specifically, the ALJ found that Guttierez cannot operate a motor vehicle, can perform simple tasks that are routine and repetitive, can make simple work-related decisions, and can frequently interact with supervisors, coworkers, and the public. Tr. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step four, the ALJ relied on the VE's testimony to determine that this RFC prevents Guttierez from performing her past relevant work as a cashier. Tr. 35. At step five, the ALJ relied on the VE's testimony and found that Guttierez can adjust to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy given her RFC, age, education, and work experience. Tr. 35-36. Specifically, the VE testified that Guttierez could work as a hand packager, kitchen helper, and vehicle washer/detailer. Tr. 36. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Guttierez was \"not disabled\" under the Act. Tr. 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Guttierez argues that remand is required because the ALJ violated the treating physician rule. ECF No. 9-1 at 14-22. Specifically, Guttierez asserts that the ALJ failed to provide the requisite \"good reasons\" for rejecting the opinion of psychiatrist Christopher Healey.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She argues that, because Dr. Healey's opinion was the only medical assessment of her ability to perform mental work-related functions, the resulting RFC determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[A]n ALJ is not qualified to assess a claimant's RFC on the basis of bare medical findings, and as a result an ALJ's determination of RFC without a medical advisor's assessment is not supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Mar. 6, 2015) (citation omitted). Thus, even though the Commissioner is empowered to make the RFC determination, \"[w]here the medical findings in the record merely diagnose [the] claimant's exertional impairments and do not relate those diagnoses to specific residual functional capabilities,\" the general rule is that the Commissioner \"may not make the connection [her]self.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201003933\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Jermyn v.

Dr. Healey opined that psychological factors cause Guttierez to have an extreme limitation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in her ability to remember locations and work-like procedures; understand and remember detailed instructions; carry out very short and simple or detailed instructions; maintain attention and concentration for extended periods; perform activities within a schedule, maintain regular attendance, and be punctual within customary tolerances; complete a normal workday or workweek without interruptions from psychologically-based symptoms; travel in unfamiliar places or use public transportation; and set realistic goals or make plans independently of others.

Tr. 338. He also noted that he based his assessment on Guttierez's longstanding history of bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Tr. 339.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ALJ acknowledged Dr. Healey's opinion and afforded it \"little weight\" for various reasons. Tr. 34. Regardless of whether the ALJ properly discounted this opinion, she created a gap in the record when she rejected the only opinion as to Guttierez's mental ability to perform work-related functions on a regular and continuing basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Covey v.

For example, the ALJ gave \"little weight\" to the \"opinion\" of Nicole Riddell, M.D., \"who assessed a low GAF score\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   of 45.\" Tr. 34. Dr. Riddell's report summarizes Guttierez's psychiatric, medical, and personal histories, evaluates her mental status, provides diagnoses, and sets forth a treatment plan, but does not opine as to Guttierez's ability to work. Tr. 398-99. Similarly, the ALJ gave \"little weight\" to the opinions of the State Agency review psychologists, but those doctors did not have all the record evidence when they made their evaluation and did not provide RFC assessments. Tr. 35, 80-92, 95-109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ afforded \"great weight\" to the opinion of consultative psychologist Lori Chang, Psy.D., \"who assessed a GAF score of 51.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 34. Dr. Chang's assessment contains her observations, summarizes Guttierez's present illness and past history, evaluates her mental status, and provides a prognosis and recommendations, but does not opine as to Guttierez's ability to work. Tr. 326-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Despite the fact that the ALJ rejected Dr. Healey's opinion-the only opinion on Guttierez's mental capacity to work-she somehow determined that Guttierez can perform simple tasks that are routine and repetitive, make simple work-related decisions, and frequently interact with supervisors, coworkers, and the public. Tr. 29. It is unclear to the Court how the ALJ, who is not a medical professional, was able to make this determination without relying on a medical opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

Here, the ALJ merely concluded that Guttierez is \"capable of meeting the mental demands of work that is limited to simple routine tasks with simple work-related decisions, and only frequent interaction with supervisors, co-workers and\n   the general public,\" and did not explain what evidence led her to conclude that Gutteriez could perform these tasks. Tr. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Without reliance on a medical source's opinion or a function-by-function assessment connecting the medical evidence to the RFC, the ALJ's decision leaves the Court with many unanswered questions and does not afford an adequate basis for meaningful judicial review.
