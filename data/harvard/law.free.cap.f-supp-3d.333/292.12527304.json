ENGELMAYER, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On February 19, 1917, in the midst of World War I, a British ship, the SS Mantola, was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. The ship and its cargo-including what is believed to be 536 bars of silver, each weighing 1,000 ounces and together worth several million dollars today-sat at the bottom of the ocean for a century. In 2011, Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (\"Odyssey\"), an underwater exploration company, located the\n   Mantola. It has since endeavored to bring the ship's cargo to the surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In April 2017, Odyssey brought this action\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   , invoking the Court's admiralty jurisdiction, against the Mantola and its cargo. Odyssey's complaint seeks to foreclose a maritime lien-a property interest explained below-that it claims against the Mantola for the services Odyssey performed in salvaging the wreck and its cargo. Odyssey has also asserted a claim for ownership over the vessel and its cargo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue here is a motion by an alternative claimant. The United Kingdom Department for Transport (\"DfT\") entered this case as a claimant, asserting ownership over the Mantola. DfT now moves to dismiss Odyssey's claims against the Mantola. DfT argues that this Court lacks\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over that portion of the wreck's cargo-some 526 of the 536 bars of silver-that it represents was removed from the wreck at an unspecified date in the past two years by an unspecified United Kingdom entity. Further, DfT argues, the removal of the vast majority of the wreck's valuable cargo makes the wreck no longer viable to salvage, such that Odyssey can no longer plausibly assert a claim for a salvage award, and thus cannot assert a maritime lien on the Mantola.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Separately, DfT contends that Odyssey has no right to disclosure of certain information relating to the circumstances under which the 526 bars of silver, take from the wreck, came to be deposited in the United Kingdom with the British government's Receiver of Wreck. DfT argues that disclosure of such information is prohibited by foreign law, and, in any event, is beyond the scope of the present litigation and thus irrelevant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court denies DfT's motion to dismiss and denies, without prejudice, Odyssey's request to compel discovery as unripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Initial Stage of Salvage of the Vessel (2011-2015)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1917, the SS Mantola, a United Kingdom-flagged 8,260 gross ton passenger steamship, sank during combat in World War I. Compl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2011, Odyssey located the Mantola in the North Atlantic Ocean, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any sovereign nation, at a depth of approximately 2,500 meters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Mantola is believed to have contained 536 silver bars when it sank. Odyssey alleges that, as of the date (April 21, 2017) its Complaint was filed, these remained aboard the vessel, on the ocean floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. In addition, the wreck site contains vessel remains, metal objects, cargo and other loose objects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, DfT and Odyssey \"entered into an agreement for the salvage of the cargo, which provided that Odyssey would retain 80% of the net value of the recovered silver.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Odyssey assumed the \"risk, expense and responsibility\" for the operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In September 2015, that agreement lapsed, and was not renewed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During this time, Odyssey recovered from the wreck a piece of silk cloth,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19, which it has turned over to this Court as the basis for\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction, and the ship's bell, which is currently at a conservation facility in the United Kingdom,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Subsequent Developments (2015-present)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Odyssey claims it has maintained \"actual, continuous, and exclusive possession or constructive occupancy of the shipwreck site since it first located the Vessel to the extent this is possible\" and since the expiration of the contract with DfT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Odyssey further maintains that it is the only company engaged in salvage operations on the vessel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Odyssey is in the process of developing a plan to continue the salvage operations of the vessel, to recover cargo and artifacts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. It claims that it is \"ready and able\" to recommence operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Odyssey claims that it has invested substantial time, money and effort in its preparation for, and partial execution of, salvage operations thus far.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to representations by counsel for DfT, in April 2017, at or around the time this action was commenced, 526 of the 536 bars of silver believed to be inside the wreck were salvaged-by an unnamed salvor-and delivered to a UK agency, the Receiver of Wreck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Status Report; January 17, 2018 Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 21, 2017, Odyssey filed this action. Dkt. 1. On April 24, 2017, Odyssey moved,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   , for the issuance of an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   warrant of arrest for the Mantola and its \"cargo, apparel, tackle, and appurtenances, etc.\" Dkt. 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 6-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 25, 2017, Odyssey moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin any interference with the vessel by any other would-be salvor. Dkts. 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 1, 2017, the Court held an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing on Odyssey's motions. At\n   that hearing, Odyssey presented to the Court a silk cloth removed from the Mantola wreck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23 (5/1/17 Tr.) at 13-14. Thereafter, the Court entered three orders relevant here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the Court issued a warrant of arrest for the silk cloth. Dkt. 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5/1/17 Tr. at 14 (The Court: \"You are under arrest.\"). That order effected an arrest of the portion of the Vessel brought into the district-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the silk cloth-and gave rise to the Court's \"constructive possession of the Vessel itself, the site of the property, and everything that is a part thereof, wherever located and whenever removed there from, past, present or future and ... any and all items that have or will be removed from the site of the defendant\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   , no matter who has brought up or who will bring up such items until a further determination of ownership is made or a further order of this Court is issued.\" Dkt. 17 at 3. The Court's order also authorized the U.S. Marshal to surrender possession of the arrested silk cloth to Odyssey, which the Court named as substitute custodian for the cloth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the Court issued a preliminary injunction. Dkt. 18. That order enjoined any third party from interfering with Odyssey's \"rights to salvage the shipwreck site.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The Court also ordered Odyssey to give public notice of its preliminary injunction by publication in\n   <em>\n    The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   , and a shipping trade publication,\n   <em>\n    Lloyd's List. Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, the Court granted Odyssey's request to seal the exact coordinates of the Vessel. Dkt. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On August 17, 2017, following an extension of the deadline to file such a claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 29-30, DfT submitted its claim of ownership to the Mantola, Dkt. 32. On September 7, 2017, DfT filed an answer to Odyssey's complaint. Dkt. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On November 14, 2017, the Court held an initial pretrial conference in this case. Following that conference, the Court issued an order staying the case until February 15, 2018, to provide the parties an opportunity, through informal disclosures and correspondence, to resolve their dispute. Dkt. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 15, 2018, the parties submitted a joint status update to the Court. Dkt. 42. In that letter, DfT represented that, in April 2017, 526 of the 536 bars of silver from the Vessel had been salvaged by a third party and transported to the United Kingdom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. DfT refused, however, to disclose (to the Court or to Odyssey)\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   had salvaged those silver bars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Odyssey requested that the Court compel DfT to do so. DfT, in turn, requested that the Court dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On February 16, 2018, the Court set a briefing schedule for DfT's contemplated motion to dismiss. The Court also directed the parties to address Odyssey's contemplated motion to compel disclosure from DfT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 16, 2018, DfT moved to dismiss this case in its entirety. Dkt. 44;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 (\"DfT Br.\"). On April 5, 2018, Odyssey filed its brief in opposition. Dkt. 49 (\"PL Br.\"). On April 20, 2018, DfT filed its reply.

DfT's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Applying those principles here, the Court concludes that DfT's motion to dismiss must be denied. DfT seeks dismissal of Odyssey's\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action against the Mantola on the ground that, because most of the silver cargo has been removed from the Vessel, Odyssey does not have-and will never have-a maritime lien on the Vessel. DfT's argument straddles two interrelated issues: this Court's jurisdiction over the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   and Odyssey's entitlement to a maritime lien over the\n   <em>\n    res.\n   </em>\n   Construed either way, however, DfT's argument falters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     In Rem\n    </em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On May 1, 2017, this Court exercised jurisdiction over the entirety of the Mantola and its cargo. As explained above, that exercise of jurisdiction was-and is-based on the property brought into the District by Odyssey, a silk cloth salvaged from the vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 17 &amp; 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5/1/17 Tr. at 17. Therefore, the Court has constructive\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the wreck and everything on it. Defendants concede that the Court has constructive\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the wreck site, DfT Reply Br. at 2, but claim that the Court never exercised jurisdiction over the 526 silver bars because they, assertedly, were removed from the site before the Court issued its injunction on May 1, 2017,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At this stage in the litigation, however, DfT's representations are insufficient to defeat this Court's jurisdiction.

To the extent DfT's motion embeds factual representations tending to call the Court's jurisdiction into question, those representations are of scant value. DfT has not averred\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   salvaged the bars of silver, from where they were salvaged, or when they were recovered from the Mantola.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 17, 2018 Letter. On the contrary, DfT refuses to disclose the name of the purported salvor; believes the date on which the bars were found-as represented to it by this anonymous salvor-is incorrect and accordingly represents that it has no \"information on [the] actual recovery date\"; and does not provide any basis for its conclusion that the bars were salvaged from the Mantola, rather than some other wrecked vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Further, it appears from DfT's representations that the limited information it\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have is secondhand: to the extent DfT represents that the 526 recovered bars of silver come from the Mantola, it is representing what an unknown salvor told an unknown official at the UK Receiver of Wreck.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Such representations are inadequate to support a fact-based Rule 12(b)(1) motion (as the Court-generously-construes DfT's motion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Odyssey's Maritime Lien\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based again on the assertion that 526 of the 536 silver bars aboard the Mantola have been removed to the United Kingdom, DfT contends that Odyssey does not have, and will never have, a maritime lien on the Mantola because it has not performed, and realistically will never perform, any salvage services giving rise to such a lien. The Court agrees with Odyssey, however, that Odyssey's actions to date already give rise to a plausible claim for a salvage award, and thus a plausible claim for a maritime lien. That the bulk of the Mantola's valuable cargo may have been removed may-depending on the circumstances-ultimately prove relevant to the value of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   on which Odyssey may have a lien. It does not, however, pretermit, at the pleading stage, Odyssey's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As noted above, a plaintiff claiming an award for salvage \"must demonstrate (1) that he has rendered aid to a distressed ship or its cargo in navigable waters; (2) that the service was voluntarily rendered without any preexisting obligation arising from contract or otherwise to the distressed ship or property; and (3) that the service was useful by effecting salvage of the ship or its cargo, in whole or in part.\"\n   <em>\n    R.M.S.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Odyssey has also \"engaged in extensive exploration, recovery and survey operations on the Vessel,\" and has \"voluntarily and successfully obtained video and photographic images of the Vessel and has begun documentation of the site.\" Compl. \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.M.S.

Odyssey has thus rendered \"useful\" service to the Mantola. Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the 526 silver bars were legally removed from the vessel by the unidentified U.K. entity-and the undeveloped record in this case makes it impossible for the Court yet to so find-Odyssey's salvage efforts in the early stages of salvage may have made that extraction possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13 (Odyssey has \"engaged in extensive exploration, recovery and survey operations on the Vessel\");\n   <em>\n    Nadle v.

It is sufficient if his efforts contributed in some way to the ultimate success.\");\n   <em>\n    Hener\n   </em>\n   , 525 F.Supp. at 357. Odyssey has thus plausibly pled facts sufficient to show, at the least, that it has salvaged the silk cloth and the bell. Beyond that, Odyssey's pleadings are consistent with the finding-as discovery may or may not establish-that its efforts meaningfully contributed to the salvage of the other material (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the 526 silver bars) from the wreck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   DfT's representation that 526 silver bars have been removed by another entity, assuming this claim is substantiated, may bear on the ultimate value of any salvage award to which Odyssey will be entitled and the property that may be available to satisfy Odyssey's lien. This litigation may establish that those 526 bars were removed from the wreck before this Court took jurisdiction, and thus that those bars are not part of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   over which Odyssey may have a maritime lien. Or, it may establish that Odyssey did not contribute to the salvage of those 526 bars. Or, it may establish that Odyssey's salvage of the vessel facilitated the retrieval of the 526 silver bars. Or, it may establish other facts altogether. Those questions are left for the merits. That the 526 bars of silver, under circumstances that remain elusive, may have been removed from the Mantola does not sink, at this early stage, Odyssey's claim for a salvage award or its entitlement to a lien on the Mantola.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For avoidance of doubt, this decision denying DfT's motion to dismiss does not resolve Odyssey's ultimate entitlement to a salvage award or a maritime lien. Nor does it resolve with finality this Court's jurisdiction, which the Court has an independent duty to ascertain throughout the pendency of this litigation. In the event discovery yields evidence calling its jurisdiction into question, the Court will welcome a renewed motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Request to Compel Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The final issue presented involves discovery regarding the alleged salvage of the 526 bars of silver. Odyssey seeks to compel DfT to disclose information relating to the removal of the silver bars as proffered in the February joint status report submitted to the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Status Report. There, DfT represented that \"526 of the 536 bars of silver known to have been aboard the SS MANTOLA had been salvaged by another party and delivered to the UK Receiver of Wreck (RoW).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Odyssey seeks information regarding the identity of this purported salvor. DfT resists this discovery request. It argues that this information is not relevant to the current proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DfT Br. at 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This dispute is not yet ripe for this Court's review for the simple reason that discovery has not yet begun; the Court has not even entered a case management plan providing for fact discovery. The parties had proposed a plan that contemplated delaying all fact discovery until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Odyssey had completed salvage operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40-1. Declining to implement that plan, the Court instead stayed this case for 90 days to give the parties an opportunity to engage in informal discovery that might resolve the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41. That process failed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Status Report, and this motion resulted. With formal discovery having not yet commenced, the Court has not had occasion to resolve a hypothetical discovery dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court does, however, offer this guidance. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [p]arties [to] obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). It appears highly likely that the circumstances surrounding the removal of the 526 bars of silver from the Mantola-including who salvaged them; when such salvage began and concluded; whether the silver came, in fact, from the Mantola; and the connection, if any, between the removal of the silver and Odyssey's salvage efforts-will be integral to the claims of this case. Barring some as-yet unidentified basis for avoiding discovery as to these matters, the Court expects that discovery of DfT on these issues is likely to satisfy Rule 26's relevance requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, the parties are directed to submit, by one week from the issuance of this decision, a proposed case management plan for the remaining litigation of this case, which plan is specifically to include a plan for discovery. The parties are also to submit a joint letter, of no more than three single-spaced pages, setting forth their expectations as to how this case will now proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons given above, the Court denies DfT's motion to dismiss Odyssey's\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   complaint. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at Dkt. 44. As set forth above, the parties are directed to submit, one week from today, a case management plan and joint letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The Court draws these facts principally from the Complaint, Dkt. 1 (\"Compl.\").
