For the reasons set forth below, the motions for summary judgment are granted in part and denied in part. The motion to strike, motion to dismiss, and motion for judgment on the pleadings are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 2, 2016, the Plaintiffs initiated this declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 10-06.1 of the North Dakota Century Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. The Plaintiffs filed an\n   amended complaint on August 17, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19. On January 1, 2017, the Court entered an order allowing Farmers Union and the DRC to intervene as Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Chapter 10-06.1 is officially known as the Corporate or Limited Liability Company Farming law (\"Corporate Farming Law\"). The Corporate Farming Law was originally enacted in 1932 as an initiated measure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stenehjem ex rel. State v.

In its original form, the Corporate Farming Law prohibited corporations from owning farm or ranch land or engaging in the business of farming or agriculture.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6950241\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/844/892/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since 1932, the law has been amended a number of times and it now permits a number of exceptions to the general rule prohibiting corporate farming. Chapter 10-06.1 \"is rooted in the desire to preserve rural agricultural land for use by family farmers\" by making unlawful, with some exceptions, corporate farming and corporate ownership of farms as well as farming and ownership of farms by limited liability companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plaintiffs specifically challenge N.D.C.C. \u00a7 10-06.1-12 (\"the family farm exception\") which provides an exception for family farms to the general ban on corporate farming if the shareholders or members do not exceed fifteen in number, are family members within a specified degree of kinship, and meet other specified requirements. The family farm exception was added to the Corporate Farming Law in 1981.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. J.P.

The Plaintiffs contend the family farm exception is facially discriminatory and violates the Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the entirety of Chapter 10-06.1 is unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The relevant provisions of Chapter 10-06.1 provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   All corporations and limited liability companies, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, are prohibited from owning or leasing land used for farming or ranching and from engaging in the business of farming or ranching.

The following requirements also apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. If a corporation, the corporation must not have more than fifteen shareholders.

Each individual who is a shareholder or member must be a citizen of the United States or a permanent resident alien of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   6. If a corporation, the officers and directors of the corporation must be shareholders who are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     actively engaged in operating the farm or ranch\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and at least one of the corporation's shareholders must be an individual\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     residing on or operating the farm or ranch\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   . If a limited liability company, the governors and managers of the limited liability company must be members who are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     actively engaged in operating the farm or ranch\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and at least one of its members must be an individual\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     residing on or operating the farm or ranch\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   7.

The income of the corporation or limited liability company from nonfarm rent, nonfarm royalties, dividends, interest, and annuities cannot exceed twenty percent of the gross income of the corporation or limited liability company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 10-06.1-12 (emphasis added). The dispute between the parties largely centers on the meaning of the word \"domestic\" and the phrases \"actively engaged in operating the farm or ranch\" and \"residing on or operating the farm or ranch\" in Section 10-06.1-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff North Dakota Farm Bureau (\"Farm Bureau\") is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of North Dakota, with its principal place of business in Fargo, North Dakota. The Farm Bureau's voluntary membership consists of more than 26,000 farm, ranch, and rural families residing in North Dakota. The mission of the Farm Bureau is to advocate for agriculture and enhance the economic opportunities of its membership while promoting individual freedoms and self-reliance. The Farm Bureau contends the Corporate Farming Law interferes with its ability to fulfill its organizational purpose and injures it members because the law prohibits farmers from utilizing beneficial business structures and limits the value of their farms and ranches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff Galegher Farms, Inc., is a farming corporation organized under the laws of North Dakota, with its principal place of business in Thompson, North Dakota. Galegher Farms leases approximately 3,100 acres of North Dakota farmland for crop farming purposes. The president and vice-president of Galegher Farms are first cousins and currently meet the kinship requirements of Chapter 10-06.1-12. However, the president's son and the vice-president's nephew have expressed interest in becoming shareholders in the corporation but cannot as they do not meet the kinship requirements of Section 10-06.1-12. Galegher Farms contends it is harmed by the Corporate Farming Law's kinship requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff Brian Gerrits is an individual who resides in De Pere, Wisconsin. Gerrits\n   is a member of a Wisconsin limited liability company, Breeze Dairy Group, LLC, that engages in dairy farming in Wisconsin. Gerrits contends Chapter 10-06.1 prohibits him and Breeze Dairy from expanding into North Dakota which limits his ability to earn a living in his chosen occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff Breeze Dairy Group, LLC (\"Breeze Dairy\") is an LLC incorporated in the State of Wisconsin. Breeze Dairy was founded in 2003 in response to the changing farming economy. Breeze Dairy was formed in 2003 by five families who merged their dairy operations into a single limited liability company. Breeze Dairy contends it is not a \"domestic\" LLC as defined by North Dakota's Corporate Farming Law. For these reasons, Breeze Dairy contends it cannot expand into North Dakota and thus is harmed by Chapter 10-06.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff North Dakota Pork Council (\"Pork Council\") is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of North Dakota. The Pork Council promotes the interests of pork producers and provides them with educational resources and services which enhance profitability. The Pork Council contends Chapter 10-06.1 interferes with its ability to fulfill its mission to help pork producers enhance profitably as it precludes them from utilizing beneficial business structures and limits the value of the pork production operations located within the state; causes them harm by limiting the number of pork producers in North Dakota, which in turn reduces its membership; and limits its members access to capital and thus limits the number of pork producers within North Dakota, which negatively impacts the Pork Council's membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff Bill Price is an individual who resides in Center, North Dakota. Price is a farmer and rancher involved in multiple farming and ranching operations in North Dakota, including the Price Cattle Ranch which is organized as a limited liability partnership. Several of the operations in which Price is involved in have been unable to utilize the corporate business structure due to their inability to meet the requirements in Chapter 10-06.1, and they have also been unable to bring in capital through corporate investments. Price is the managing partner of Price Cattle Ranch. Price contends he would prefer to operate Price Cattle Ranch as a corporation or limited liability company but is prohibited by Chapter 10-06.1 from doing so. Price also contends the next generation of the Price family will not be able to continue the Price Cattle Ranch as they do not meet the kinship requirements of Section 10-06.1-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant Wayne Stenehjem is the Attorney General for the State of North Dakota. As Attorney General, Stenehjem is charged with enforcing Chapter 10-06.1. The enforcement provisions include court-ordered divestment and civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 10-06.1-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant Farmers Union is a non-profit organization founded in 1927 to provide assistance to farm families. Farmers Union is the largest general farm organization in North Dakota, with 45,500 member families. Farmers Union works to advance family farms and ranches and the quality of life for North Dakotans through member advocacy, educational programs, cooperative initiatives, and insurance services. In the early 1930s, Farmers Union drafted the language for what would ultimately become North Dakota's Corporate Farming Law. Farmers Union has long been committed to preserving and has actively defended North Dakota's Corporate Farming Law which it sees as the foundation of family farms, rural communities, the State's agrarian heritage, and stewardship of natural resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant DRC is a nonprofit organization formed in 1978 with the purpose of protecting North Dakota's rural communities, family farms, agricultural economy, soil, land, and water. The DRC consists of approximately 1,000 members, more than half of whom are farmers and ranchers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO STRIKE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The DRC moves to strike portions of the declarations of John L. Galegher, Jr. (Docket No. 81), Brian Gerrits (Docket. No. 82), Tamra Heins (Docket No. 84), and Bill Price (Docket No. 85) filed by the Plaintiffs in support of their motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 93. The DRC contends the declarations do not comply with Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Plaintiffs maintain they have complied with the requirements of Rule 56(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rule 56(c) requires that an affidavit or declaration used to support a summary judgment motion must be made upon personal knowledge and that the content of the affidavit consists of facts that would be admissible at trial. A careful review of the declarations to which the DRC has objected reveals the Plaintiffs have complied with the rule. In this case, the Court is faced with cross-motions for summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of a state law. The declarations in question relate to the issue of standing and whether the Plaintiffs have suffered an injury. In this context, the witnesses are competent to give their lay opinions as to the impact of the Corporate Farming Law on themselves, their farming operations, their membership, and the organizations they operate. The Court would permit such testimony at trial. As such, the Court finds the DRC's contentions meritless and the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     STANDING\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State contends the Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their Commerce Clause claim. Farmers Union contends the Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims for violation of the Commerce Clause (Count I), the Privileges and Immunities Clause (Count II), and the Equal Protection Clause (Count III) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count IV). The Plaintiffs concede their Privileges and Immunities Clause claim (Count II) should be dismissed as it is foreclosed by case law from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Upon careful review of the entire record, the Court concludes, for the reasons set forth below, that the Plaintiffs have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(1) governs motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \"Subject matter jurisdiction defines the court's authority to hear a given type of case.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlsbad Tech., Inc. v.

Specifically, Plaintiffs contend Section 10-06.1-12 creates exceptions to the general prohibition on owning farmland and ranchland\n   for only domestic corporations and domestic limited liability companies, thereby treating them differently than it does foreign corporations and foreign limited liability companies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19, \u00b6 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The basic underlying principle of the Equal Protection Clause requires \"the government to treat similarly situated people alike.\"\n   <em>\n    Klinger v.

As the Plaintiffs read Section 10-06.1-12, the family farm exception violates the simple command of the Equal Protection Clause, by treating corporations and limited liability companies interested or engaged in the business of farming and ranching differently based on where they are incorporated or organized. While the Defendants disagree with this reading of the family farm exception, it is certainly reasonable, and standing in no way depends on the merits of a plaintiff's claim or contention that particular conduct is prohibited by law.\n   <em>\n    Warth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p518\">\n    422 U.S. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p518\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plaintiffs have alleged they are harmed by the family farm exception as they are not \"domestic\" entities and thus are unable to take advantage of it, and it limits their access to out-of-state capital. These allegations are supported by declarations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 81, 82, 83, 85, and 97) setting forth specific facts which the Court must accept as true for purposes of determining standing.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs have adequately alleged how Chapter 10-06.1 injures them by treating them differently than it does domestic corporations and LLCs and individuals seeking to establish entities to own farmland or ranchland in North Dakota.

Because the Court can find no ambiguity in the term \"domestic\" as used in Section 10-06.1-12, and because when the term \"domestic\" is given its plain and ordinary meaning it gives preference to North Dakota entities, the Court finds this provision of the Corporate Farming Law clearly violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Operational Requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Section 10-06.1-12(6), provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   If a corporation, the officers and directors of the corporation must be shareholders who are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     actively engaged in operating the farm or ranch\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and at least one of the corporation's shareholders must be an individual\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     residing on or operating the farm or ranch\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .

The Defendants argue the second requirement that at least one shareholder be \"residing on\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   operating the farm or ranch\" can also be satisfied by either residing on the farm\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   making operational decisions from afar and without a physical presence on the farm. The argument as to both requirements is essentially the same, namely the farm may be managed or operated from a distance or remotely without requiring a physical presence on the farm. For example, a non-resident shareholder living off the farm and outside North Dakota may operate a North Dakota family farm through management decisions made by that individual and the actual planting, harvesting, and other operations may be contracted out to independent entities which perform custom agriculture services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The dispute over the operational requirements essentially comes down to whether a physical presence in North Dakota is required to satisfy the statutory language.

Since the Attorney General's opinion was issued in 1982, state agencies have relied upon NDAG 82-25 in implementing and enforcing the Corporate Farming Law. Because NDAG 82-25 was issued contemporaneously with the enactment of the family farm exception and has been impliedly approved by the North Dakota Legislature's inaction, the Court will afford it considerable weight in assessing the meaning of the operational requirements in Section 10-06.1-12(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The family farm exception's operational requirements have twice been reviewed in state district court in\n   <em>\n    NAS I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Crosslands I.\n   </em>\n   On both occasions, the state district court analyzed the family farm exception and found the operational requirements did not require a physical presence in North Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 67-10 and 67-11. In 2009, the state district court in\n   <em>\n    Crosslands I\n   </em>\n   reviewed the family farm exception within Chapter 10-06.1, considered its text, applied principles of statutory construction, analyzed the applicable evidence, and concluded that the family farm exception \"does not require persons to reside on the farm as long as there is an actively engaged person operating the farm or ranch.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-11, p. 29. The state district court consequently concluded that the operational requirements in the family farm exception did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-11, p. 32. In 2011, the state district court in\n   <em>\n    NAS I\n   </em>\n   reviewed the family farm exception within Chapter 10-06.1, considered its text, applied principles of statutory construction, analyzed the applicable evidence, and concluded that the family farm exception \"does not require a daily physical presence or daily labor to satisfy the 'actively engaged' or 'operating' requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-10, p. 28.

Both\n   <em>\n    NAS I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Crosslands I\n   </em>\n   offer reasoned analysis of the operational requirements and lend\n   support to the interpretation offered by the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue the legislative history supports their contention that the family farm exception's operational requirements demand an actual physical presence on the farm or ranch. Specifically, the Plaintiffs rely upon exchanges between Allen Hoberg, Staff Council for the Legislative Council, and Senators Dotzenrod, Barth, Wright, and Sorum during a hearing on a 1979 bill (SB 2280). The 1979 bill, which was passed by the Legislature but vetoed by Governor Link, was similar to the 1981 bill (SB 2233) which forms the core of the current version of the Corporate Farming Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ross H. Espeseth,\n   <em>\n    North Dakota's Corporate Farming Statute: An Analysis of the Recent Change in the Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20N.D.%20L.%20Rev.%20283\">\n    58 N.D. L. Rev. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287 n. 38 (1982). During this exchange, Senator Dotzenrod stated that \"there is nothing in this bill that states that an outside corporation with the qualifications of this bill couldn't come into North Dakota and buy land.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-7, p. 4. Hoberg responded that \"the provision in the bill states they must be 'natural' persons and must be related and actively engaged in farming in North Dakota.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-7, p. 4. Senator Barth wanted it clarified that \"in order to be an officer or director of the corporation, they must be actively engaged in farming or ranching\" and Hoberg concurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-7, p. 4. Senator Wright expressed concern about \"outside corporations coming in to buy farm land.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-7, p. 16. Senator Sorum \"stated the term 'actively engaged' concerns him as it has no restrictions on it and felt it should be defined.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-7, p. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court finds these brief exchanges less than helpful in defining the operational requirements and shedding light on the question of whether an actual physical presence on the farm is required. No mention of defining the operational requirements is made. Indeed, Senator Sorum expressed a desire to define \"actively engaged\" but no definition was ever added to the bill and no discussion was held as to what a definition should entail. Further, while the 1979 bill may have been similar to the 1981 bill, the 1979 bill never became law and is not the focus of this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   To support their interpretation, the Plaintiffs also rely on a discussion between several members of the Senate Agricultural Committee on the 1981 bill. The discussion is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Senator Dotzenrod\n   </em>\n   proposed an amendment for page 3, new subsection 10, which would say, \"Each shareholder or member of the corporation must be actively engaged in operating the farm or ranch\". (sic)\n   <em>\n    Senator Sorum\n   </em>\n   suggested instead that it read \"the major shareholder be actively engaged in farming\"; (sic)\n   <em>\n    Senator Albers\n   </em>\n   indicated that this might eliminate the small farmer and encourage large farms to incorporate only. In the case of off farm heirs: If one decided to sell their stock or share of the land, they could only sell to those who are actively engaged in farming the land, giving these people control of the destiny of the corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-9, p. 5. While this discussion referenced the operational requirements several times, there was no mention of a physical presence on the farm being necessary. It would seem the discussion centered on whether some or all of the shareholders must be actively engaged in operating the farm and not on whether being actively engaged in operating the farm required a physical presence on the farm. The Court finds the discussion of little assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Plaintiffs' citation to comments made by James Marsden, then director of public affairs for the Farm Bureau, regarding\n   the 1979 bill also unavailing. While statements from lawmakers are helpful in determining legislative intent, the Court gives scant weight to comments from witnesses such as Marsden, as statements from non-lawmakers are of little help in determining legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5664182\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/1261/#p1267\">\n    470 F.3d at 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting statement by lawmakers may evidence a discriminatory purpose).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Plaintiffs' reliance on Minnesota case law is equally unpersuasive as it bears virtually no relation to North Dakota's Corporate Farming Law, NDAG 82-25,\n   <em>\n    NAS I\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Crosslands I.\n   </em>\n   In addition, the provision of Minnesota law in question in\n   <em>\n    Rengstorf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bornhorst\n   </em>\n   has been subject to varying interpretations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

N.D.C.C. ch. 10-06 (1981). The Corporate Farming Law incorporated by reference the requirements and definitions of the Business Corporation Act in 1983, and the Limited Liability Company Act in 1993. 1983 N.D.

A review of the legislative history shows the family farm exception was intended to help preserve family farms by allowing the use of favorable tax structures, assisting with estate planning, protecting assets, limiting personal liability, making it easier to raise capital, and making it easier to provide employee benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67-9, pp. 25-31, 51-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   A careful review of the legislative history does not reveal an intent to discriminate against out-of-state interests. Rather, the purpose was to promote and preserve family farms by giving them the ability to use the corporate form, with some limitations, in an increasing complex and connected world. For instance, it was thought the corporate form would offer tax advantages and make it easier to pass the family farm from generation to generation. From the Court's review of the available legislative history, the purpose of enacting the family farm exception was to help keep family farming viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In some sense, every state law is enacted to further state interests. But this does not mean every state law violates the Commerce Clause. There must be a showing\n   of discriminatory purpose.

The 1981 family farm exception was intended to help preserve family farms through the limited use of corporations. Economic protectionism was not its intent. Things went somewhat awry in 1983 and 1993 when the Business Corporation Act and the Limited Liability Company Act definitions were incorporated by reference, but this does not change the purpose of the 1981 family farm exception which the Plaintiffs challenge.

Phrased another way, would the Legislative Assembly have enacted the law absent the offending provisions? In this case, the answer is clearly yes. North Dakota's Corporate Farming Law and the general prohibition on all corporate land ownership became law in 1932.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1933 N.D. S. L. ch. 89. The family farm exception was not enacted until 1981.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1981 N.D. S. L. ch. 134, \u00a7 4. The Corporate Farming Law was on the books for nearly fifty years before the family farm exception was added in 1981. The Corporate Farming Law incorporated by reference the requirements and definitions of the Business Corporation Act in 1983 and Limited Liability Company Act in 1993. Since the Corporate Farming Law was originally enacted without the family farm exception there is no reason to believe the Legislature would have preferred to repeal the entire law in 1981 when the family farm exception was added. When Governor Link vetoed a version of the family farm exception in 1979, the Legislature did not push for full scale repeal but again introduced the legislation in 1981, and was successful. Further, the Corporate Farming Law includes other exceptions, which are not challenged in this lawsuit, such as the exception for surface coal mining ( N.D.C.C. \u00a7 10-06.1-06 ); certain industrial and business purposes ( N.D.C.C. \u00a7 10-06.1-07 ); cooperatives ( N.D.C.C. \u00a7 10-06.1-08 ); and certain non-profit organizations ( N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10-06.1-09 and 10-06.1-10 ). These exceptions would be unnecessarily voided if the Court enjoined operation of the entire chapter as suggested by the Plaintiffs. The Court sees no reason to enjoin the Corporate Farming Law in its entirety, a law which operated on its own for nearly fifty years without the family farm exception, and which can clearly stand on its own. Indeed, all that is necessary is to enjoin the enforcement of\n   the offending \"domestic corporation\" and \"domestic limited liability company\" language while leaving the remainder of the family farm exception intact. Accordingly, the Court finds severance is the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Defendant Farmers Union's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 104) and its alternative motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket No. 113) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . The Defendant Dakota Resource Council's motion to strike (Docket No. 93) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . The State's motion for partial summary judgment (Docket No. 64) and the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 71) are\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   as explained herein. Count Two of the amended complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   and declares that the State is permanently enjoined from enforcing or seeking to enforce Section 10-06.1-12 of the North Dakota Century Code in a manner which limits its application to only North Dakota corporations and limited liability companies, and must permit corporations and limited liability companies organized under the laws of other states to utilize the family farm exception, so long as they meet the other requirements of the current law which are not the subject of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Despite the Court's finding that the operational requirements do not require a physical presence on the farm, it would be helpful if the Legislature adopted a clarifying definition or otherwise revised the statutory language to make it clear no actual physical presence on the farm is required.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
