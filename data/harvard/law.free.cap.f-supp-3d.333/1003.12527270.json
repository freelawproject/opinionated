Cynthia Bashant, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case stems from the San Diego Unified School District's (the \"District\") decision in July 2016 to develop an Anti-Islamophobia Initiative (the \"Initiative\") to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying and the District's decision in April 2017 to adopt implementing \"Action Steps.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are two organizations-Citizens for Quality Education San Diego (\"CQESD\") and San Diego Asian Americans for Equality Foundation (\"SDAAEF\")-and six parents of students in the District-Scott Hasson, Chaoyin He, Xuexun Hu, Kevin and Melissa Steel, and Jose Velazquez (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). Plaintiffs claim that the Initiative is a pretext to establish the District's preference for Islam and Muslim students. They allege that the Initiative and its implementing measures establish \"a subtle, discriminatory scheme\" based on religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution, the religion clauses of the California Constitution, and various California state statutory provisions. (ECF No. 3 First Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Compl. (\"FAC\").) Plaintiffs further allege that the District's relationship with non-party Council on American-Islamic Relations\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"CAIR\") to address Islamophobia violates Plaintiffs' constitutional rights because Defendants \"have entangled themselves with [a] religious organization.\" (FAC \u00b6 2.) Given the parties' previous request to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim for nominal damages, the only relief Plaintiffs seek is injunctive and declaratory. (ECF Nos. 17, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. (ECF No. 26.) Plaintiffs request this relief solely for the claims they assert pursuant to the No Preference and No Aid Clauses of the California Constitution and the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. (ECF No. 26-1 at 11-18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In connection with these claims, Plaintiffs request the Court enjoin Defendants from: (1) \"[i]mplementing and executing the Initiative as detailed in the Policy's 'Action Steps' or any similar Policy,\" (2) \"[p]ermitting [CAIR], its employees, agents, and representatives to advance their organizational objectives within the District,\" and (3) \"[a]dopting and implementing the CAIR Committee's 'Islamophobia Toolkit' and all related online resources, recommended books, and instructional materials, together with all such materials currently in use in the District.\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' motion. (ECF Nos. 32, 55.) Because the parties previously requested dismissal of the District as a defendant (ECF Nos. 17, 19), the remaining Defendants in this case are District Board members Richard Barrera, Kevin Beiser, John Lee Evans, Cynthia Marten, Michael McQuary, and Sharon Whitehurst-Payne (collectively, \"Defendants\" or the \"Board\"). Among other arguments they raise, Defendants contend that one of the District's post-FAC actions has mooted Plaintiffs' claims, which they argue in turn means that Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. (ECF No. 32 at 8-13; ECF No. 55 at 1-8.) CAIR-California (\"CAIR\" for the purposes of this Order) has filed an\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   brief opposing Plaintiffs' motion based on the merits of Plaintiffs' claims, to which Plaintiffs have responded. (ECF Nos. 36, 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Having considered the FAC, the preliminary injunction record and the briefing, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in its entirety because Plaintiffs have failed to show that this extraordinary relief is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The \"Initiative\".\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   On July 26, 2016, the Board approved a recommendation by two Board members to \"take action to\n   direct the superintendent to bring back to the board a plan to address Islamophobia and the reports of bullying of Muslim students ... at a future date.\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 4 Ex. 2; FAC \u00b6 30.) Plaintiffs refer to this Board action as the \"Initiative.\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties dispute the reasons for the Initiative's genesis. Defendants represent that they adopted the Initiative \"[i]n the wake of the increased instances of Islamophobia following Donald Trump's election campaign.\" (ECF No. 32 at 2.) Defendants cite an article, which explains that \"[h]ate crimes against American Muslims have soared to their highest levels since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to data compiled by researchers\" and identifies statements by candidate Trump about Muslims as one source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Eric Lichtblau,\n   <em>\n    Hate Crimes Against American Muslims Most Since Post-9/11 Era\n   </em>\n   ,\" N.Y. TIMES (Sept. 17, 2016), https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/us/politics/hate-crimes-american-muslims rise.html. The FAC also alleges that the Board relied on a CAIR California state-wide survey,\n   <em>\n    Growing in Faith: California Muslim Youth Experiences with Bullying, Harassment &amp; Religious Accommodation in Schools\n   </em>\n   [hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    CAIR Survey\n   </em>\n   \"].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 36-39.) The survey details the experiences of surveyed California Muslim youth regarding religion-based bullying and harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In contrast, Plaintiffs believe that the Initiative's express focus on Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying masks the District's true goal to \"singl[e] out a religious sect for favorable treatment\" and \"delegat[e] government power to a religious organization,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , CAIR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 26-1 at 1; FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) For example, Plaintiffs point to the District's reported instances of bullying as insufficient to show \"a Muslim bullying crisis even existed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The\n   District's 2016 \"Protected Class Report\" for July 2016 through December 2016 reported seven incidents of religion-based bullying, which Plaintiffs characterize as showing a \"a 0.006% crisis\" based on the District's approximate 125,300 K-12 student enrollment as of May 19, 2017. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex 5; FAC \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). Plaintiffs further note that the District reported to the California Department of Education in 2015 and 2016 \"just two instances related to Muslim students.\" (ECF No. 26 at 3; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, Exs. 3-4.) Lastly, Plaintiffs point to a pre-existing California state law requirement that California public school districts adopt policies that prohibit religiously-based \"discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying\" to assert that the District already had an anti-bullying program in place. (ECF No. 26-1 at 3 (citing 5 Cal. Code Reg. \u00a7 4261); FAC \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The \"Action Steps\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . In an April 4, 2017 presentation to the Board, Stanley Anjan, the Executive Director of the District's Family and Community Engagement Department (\"FACE\") \"propos[ed] action steps for an anti-Muslim bullying initiative.\" (ECF No. 32-2 Anjan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 5 at 51; FAC \u00b6 5.) Anjan identified three sets of \"Action Steps\" for the District\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-21\"><strong>Action Steps</strong> (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 5 at 55-57; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. A at 8-10; FAC \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.) \"Immediate \u2022 \"Distribute a letter to staff and parents addressing Islamophobia and direct Action support\" Steps\" \u2022 \"Review district calendars to ensure Muslim holidays are recognized\" \u2022 \"Include a link of supports on the district's `Report Bullying' page\" \u2022 \"Provide resources and strategies to support students during the upcoming month of Ramadan\" \u2022 \"Continue the collaboration with community partners and district departments\" \"Action \u2022 \"Review and vet materials related to Muslim culture and history at the steps: Instructional Media Center or in video libraries\" Before the start of the \u2022 \"Provide resources and materials for teachers on the History/Social Services 2017-18 page\" school \u2022 \"Add information related to this topic in the Annual Employee Notifications year\" (AP 6381)\" \u2022 \"Explore and engage in formal partnerships with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)\" \"Steps \u2022 \"Create a survey to measure knowledge and implementation of practice\" Over Multiple \u2022 \"Identify areas of prevention, intervention, and restoration\": \"Restorative Years\" Practices\" and \"Trauma Informed Practices\" \u2022 \"Provide a series of professional development opportunities for staff related to awareness and advocacy for Muslim culture\" \u2022 \"Provide practical tools for educators regarding Islamic religious practices and accommodations in schools\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants acknowledge that \"the Board approved the plan in the presentation, and FACE was responsible for implementing the action steps.\" (Anjan Decl. \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs refer to the Action Steps as \"the Initiative's official policies and procedures[.]\" (FAC \u00b6 52; ECF No. 26-1 at 3 (labelling Action Steps as the \"Policy\".)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs speculate that the Action Steps are the \"polished product of months of close collaboration between\" the District and CAIR, but their speculation is not credibly supported. (ECF No. 26-1 at 3.) Plaintiffs' derive support for this speculation from notes of a September 26, 2016 CAIR meeting attended by some District officials, including Defendant Superintendent Marten. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 8 Ex. 6.) The topics of the meeting included resources for teachers, professional development, curriculum, reporting bullying, and metrics to assess progress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beyond this document, the evidence otherwise shows that CAIR provided suggestions to the District and otherwise lacked information on aspects of the District's implementation plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District in fact notes that\n   although CAIR \"has been very generous in offering its time, advice and guidance to the district on ways to prevent bullying against Muslim students ... [t]he District's anti-bullying program has been developed and implemented\n   <em>\n    by District staff\n   </em>\n   .\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 25 Ex. 23 (emphasis added).) Plaintiffs do not provide evidence controverting this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For example, in the week before the Action Steps were announced, Mohebi, CAIR-San Diego's Executive Director, emailed Linda Trousdale, a District employee, about the April 4, 2017 Board meeting. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 24 Ex. 22.) Mohebi expressed his concern that \"we have not discussed details of an MOU, partnership, or any understanding\" and noted that he had shared comments on the proposed presentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Marten responded: \"[w]hile the details for the implementation of these plans are currently being developed, one thing is clear: you, and your organization-CAIR are key partners in any of our next steps. I look forward to continuing to partner with you in our next steps.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly after announcing the Action Steps, District officials explored purchasing several CAIR-recommended third party books for the District's Intercultural Materials Center (\"IMC\"). (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 28 Ex. 26; Woehler Decl. \u00b6 3.) Pursuant to California Education Code \u00a7 60040\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and District procedures, the District's Instructional Resources and Materials Department (\"IRMD\") vetted suggested books. (Woehler Decl. \u00b6 3 Exs. B, C.) Valerie Shields, a CAIR member, sent Anjan a $1,236.54 Barnes &amp; Noble price quote for the anticipated purchase of several books, the titles of which included \"\n   <em>\n    Does My Head Look Big in This\n   </em>\n   ?\", \"\n   <em>\n    I'm New Here\n   </em>\n   \", and \"\n   <em>\n    Lailah's Lunchbox: A Ramadan Story\n   </em>\n   .\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 30 Ex. 28; Woehler Decl. \u00b6 4.) A District employee subsequently purchased the books using an IRMD procurement card with the costs covered by a budget code whose funds derive from payments by a third party recycling company for old books the District recycles. (Woehler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) Books were then distributed at \"trainings with school librarians during the week of May 8, 2017,\" but without Anjan's authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Aftermath.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Action Steps and perceptions about the extent of CAIR's alleged involvement in developing them were viewed unfavorably by some. During April 2017 Board meetings, several parents and local community members \"presented their concerns\" that the Action Steps showed \"Defendants' favoritism and preference for a particular religious group\" and that Defendants had a \"sustained and detailed relationship with a controversial advocacy organization.\" (FAC \u00b6 58.) In an April 27, 2017 letter, Plaintiffs' counsel told the Board \"that the [ ] Initiative raises serious constitutional questions,\" \"the policies, practices, and procedures associated with the [ ] Initiative were presently insufficient to prevent civil rights violations,\" and \"recommended that Defendants rescind the prior vote that approved the [ ] Initiative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   These negative reactions affected the District. On May 12, 2017, Anjan directed Steven Woehler, a District employee, to \"retrieve all distributed [CAIR-recommended] books from school librarians.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Woehler Decl. \u00b6 4; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 4.) On May 17, 2017, Anjan \"informed CAIR that SDUSD was putting a pause on any further actions pursuant to the April 4, 2017 Board meeting while SDUSD made the determination as to how best to move forward with the CAIR relationship.\" (Anjan Decl. \u00b6 5.) Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on May 22, 2017 and the FAC on June 28, 2017, seeking to enjoin Defendants from \"enacting, implementing, and enforcing\" the Initiative and \"engaging in any partnership or associations whatsoever with\" CAIR. (ECF Nos. 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Revised Policy.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"In the wake of backlash from certain community members and this lawsuit\" (ECF No. 32 at 3) and after the FAC was filed, Defendant Superintendent Marten moved the Board to adopt a new \"plan\" to \"address[ ] tolerance\" on July 25, 2017. (Anjan Decl. \u00b6 6 Exs. E, F; ECF No. 32-6 Villegas Decl. \u00b6 3; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) The Board meeting agenda identified this plan as \"E. STUDENT INSTRUCTIONAL MATTERS. 2. Revised 7/25/17: Addressing Tolerance Through the Comprehensive School Counseling and Guidance Plan.\" (Anjan Decl. \u00b6 6 Exs. E, F; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) Plaintiffs call this action the Revised Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Revised Policy acknowledges that the purpose of the Board's April 4, 2017 \"plan to address the bullying of Muslim students\" was \"to raise awareness of the issue of anti-Muslim bullying, ensure that District staff are aware of and sensitive to the issue, and to assure our Muslim community that their children will given [sic] the same protection from bullying as other students in the District.\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) Under the Revised Policy, however, \"the Board affirms its commitment to ensure our schools are safe for all students and that the District will not tolerate the bullying of any students; and clarifies that our Muslim students will be treated equally with respect to bullying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In this manner, the Revised Policy articulates guiding principles for how the District will address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying, which are absent from the Action Steps. The Revised Policy continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 A calendar of observances to be created shall include holidays of all faiths for the purpose of enhancing mutual understanding and respect among the various religious, ethnic and cultural groups, and to assist staff to be sensitive to such holidays in the scheduling of events.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Staff have not been assigned specifically to address the bullying of students of any single religion; rather, the District's anti-bullying program is developed to comprehensively address the issue of bullying of all students through the No Place for Hate program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 The District's instructional materials are and will continue to be consistent with state standards which address all major world religions in the context of world history and culture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 While students are entitled under federal law to form student clubs focused on religion; however, District policy (consistent with federal law) prohibits staff from promoting any such club and that remains unchanged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (bulleting added).) Several of these items are consistent with the Action Steps\n   and the Revised Policy is largely silent on the Board's approach to several Action Steps. But, in a stark departure from a prior Action Step, the Revised Policy commands that \"staff is redirected from forming a formal partnership with CAIR to forming an intercultural committee which shall include representatives of all faiths and cultures and which shall provide input to District staff on issues of cultural sensitivities and the individual needs of various subgroups within our diverse community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs believe the Revised Policy's statement regarding the District's potential formal partnership with CAIR was a farce because of a communication prior to the Board's announcement. Two hours before the Board publicly announced the Revised Policy, CAIR member Linda Williams sent District employees a \"1st DRAFT\" for \"[c]reating a Toolkit of online resources for Addressing Islamophobia.\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 33 Ex. 31.) Noting that the CAIR Committee which compiled the resources \"is comprised of a large number of interfaith, intercultural community volunteers,\" Williams characterized the resources as \"only the very beginnings of what could grow into a robust 'Toolkit' for Teachers, Counselors, and Administrators.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The resources included: CAIR's 2013 and 2015 reports on anti-Muslim bullying, suggested book lists for addressing Islamophobia, \"compassionate comprehension\" exercises for students, information on restorative justice and conflict resolution techniques, and information for teachers about childhood trauma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' view, the Revised Policy clearly alters CAIR's relationship with the District, including by CAIR's own account. On July 28, 2017, Williams contacted the Board. She acknowledged \"the challenges and stress created by the backlash to the Board 4-4-17 vote to address Islamophobia and the bullying of Muslim students-and especially the ensuring threats and lawsuit.\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 35 Ex. 33.) Yet, she noted that, \"[w]e are still quite incredulous that no one connected with CAIR or our Committee ... to give us a respectful, timely notice that Board action item E.2 included specific reference to the District's relationship with CAIR, changing that relationship in dramatic though unspecified ways.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Williams expressed that \"the following list of Action Steps are still in effect. Our Committee has worked diligently to assist the District in Implementation; however, instead of being supported and ... appreciated, our efforts have actually been undone/reversed by District Staff[.] Please let us know what the next steps are-and when they will be taken-to follow through with what the Board voted unanimously to do on 4-4-17.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Williams further noted that CAIR was requesting a restorative justice circle with the District. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Post-Revised Policy.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In the wake of the Revised Policy, the CAIR-recommended, District-vetted books \"were subsequently incorporated into a Multicultural Text Set that covered a variety of culture and identity groups to support SDUSD's goal of providing a supportive environment for all students that values diversity.\" (Woehler Decl. \u00b6 5; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 4.) The books appear to have been redistributed to District libraries by November 2017. (LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. 53.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs contend that \"school library shelves are stocked with CAIR books.\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On November 1, 2017, the District entered into a formal partnership with the Anti-Defamation League (\"ADL\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   to implement the No Place for Hate program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Villegas Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. J.) The program \"is a strong anti-bullying effort that highlights and fosters positive school environments, climates, and cultures for all students\" and \"does not emphasize any one religion[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) The District has not entered into a formal partnership with and \"has not implemented any program, curriculum, or materials created by CAIR[.]\" (ECF No. 32 at 7; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 12; Santos Decl. \u00b6 7; Villegas Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The District also established the Intercultural Relations Community Council (\"IRCC\"), which is overseen by the Youth and Family Advocacy Department and District staff. (ECF No. 32-4 Santos Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 8; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 7.) The IRCC first met on January 22, 2018, to \"hav[e] an open dialogue with community members and local organizations regarding safe and inclusive school environments for all students.\" (Santos Decl. \u00b6 3; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. H.) Organizations present included the San Diego LGBT Community Center, San Diego Youth Services, the Southern California American Indian Resource Center, and Social Advocates for Youth San Diego. (Anjan Decl. \u00b6 7.) Attendees expressed excitement about using the IRCC to focus on diversity and social justice. (LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6 18 Ex. 68.) Additional meetings were held on March 29 and May 21, 2018. (Santos Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. I.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Interactions between the District and CAIR.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The District and CAIR have interacted since the Board adopted the Revised Policy. First, as a follow-up to the previously suggested \"toolkit\" resources, Williams provided an updated list of resources on August 9, 2017 \"to be reviewed/vetted by SDUSD Curriculum Department,\" noting that \"[w]e are glad to support the District's efforts in this way[.]\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 36 Ex. 34.) Another CAIR member, Lallia Allali, suggested additional books on addressing Islamophobia-several of which were the books the District purchased in May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 38 Ex. 36)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams followed up with District staff about the suggested resources on September 28, 2017. (LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 57.) Plaintiffs label all the materials Allali and Williams suggested as \"the District's New 'Islamophobia Toolkit,' \" and contend that the \"Toolkit\" is being circulated in the District. (ECF No. 26-1 at 8-9.) Plaintiffs do not provide evidence showing that the District has adopted this \"Toolkit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the District and CAIR sought to repair their relationship given the damage it sustained from the backlash to the Initiative and the Action Steps. The District met with representatives of CAIR, Alliance San Diego (\"ASD\") and the American Civil Liberties Union at ASD's suggestion on August 31, 2017. (ECF No. 32-5 Sharp Decl. \u00b6 4.)

Defendants easily satisfy the third\n   <em>\n    Rosebrock\n   </em>\n   factor.

Sept. 20, 2018). The Revised Policy cannot show mootness by voluntary cessation because it leaves intact the \"wrongful behavior\" Plaintiffs allege and seek to enjoin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For one, the Initiative-the directive to \"adopt a plan to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying\"-and its underlying purpose remain intact. Although Defendants contend that the Revised Policy \"rescinded\" both the July 26, 2016 Initiative and the April 4, 2017 Action Steps (ECF No. 32 at 9), the Revised Policy refers solely to the Action Steps. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 6 Ex. E.) By its own terms then, the Revised Policy cannot moot Plaintiffs' challenge to the Initiative. The preliminary injunction record shows that addressing Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying remains an objective of the District. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 36 Ex. 34; LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-6 Exs. 53-56.) The District maintains a webpage on \"Addressing Bullying of Muslim students.\" (ECF No. 51 at 9; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 25 Ex. 23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The page expressly notes that \"[t]he\n   District recently announced an intent to take action specifically to address the bullying of Muslim students\" and \"the proposed action will be a part of the district's efforts to protect all students from bullying, intimidation, and discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Addressing the Bullying of Muslim Students\n   </em>\n   , San Diego Unified School District, https://www.sandiegounified.org/addressing-bullying-muslim-students (last accessed September 19, 2018); (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 25 Ex. 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, although the Revised Policy clearly clarifies the District's intention not to single out a particular religion, government \"action that is not governed by clear or codified procedures cannot moot a claim[.]\"\n   <em>\n    McCormack v. Herzog\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230960\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/1017/#p1025\">\n    788 F.3d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1025 (9th Cir. 2015). In this case, the Revised Policy is silent on and therefore cannot rescind many Action Steps identified in the April 4, 2017 presentation to the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 5 at 55-57\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) Other items covered in the Revised Policy are consistent with several Action Steps. Although the Court can appreciate Defendants' argument that the Revised Policy shows the District's religion-neutrality (ECF No. 55 at 1-8), the Court is reticent to conflate the merits arguments with mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, although the Revised Policy \"redirected [staff] from forming a formal partnership with CAIR,\" it does not sever the District's ties with CAIR, nor prevent CAIR from addressing Islamophobia in the District-relief Plaintiffs seek. The District has received CAIR's suggestions for resources. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38 Exs. 34, 36; LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10 Exs. 57, 60.) The District has otherwise solicited information from and discussed with CAIR how to address Islamophobia. (LiMandri Supp. Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 Exs. 55-56.) And CAIR participates in the IRCC, which Defendants have expressly told CAIR may be used to recommend additional resources and curriculum on addressing Islamophobia. (Anjan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; Santos Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6 17 Ex. 67.) In sum, the Revised Policy is not a wholesale and clear revocation of the District's Initiative to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying, the Action Steps implementing it, or reliance on CAIR to support the District's measures. There is a continuing stake in these proceedings sufficient to support the Court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Revised Policy's Impact on the Requested Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Although Defendants have not met their heavy burden to show that this entire case is moot based on voluntary cessation, the Revised Policy nevertheless impacts the relief Plaintiffs seek. First, it is clear to the Court that part of the Revised Policy substantially undermines the need for, if not moots, Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants from creating a formal partnership with CAIR. Based on its plain terms, the Revised Policy eliminates the prior Action Step regarding the creation of a formal partnership between CAIR and the District to implement the Initiative. (\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7\n   Ex. 5 at 55-57\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) The record shows that Defendants have not created a formal partnership with CAIR to achieve the Initiative's objectives, but have instead entered into a formal partnership with a different organization. CAIR recognizes that the District's action forecloses a formal relationship with CAIR. (ECF No. 36.) And Plaintiffs do not provide evidence showing any credible possibility that the District will enter into a formal partnership with CAIR to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, although the Revised Policy does not otherwise moot Plaintiffs' requests for preliminary injunctive relief, the Revised Policy may impact the Court's preliminary injunction analysis. Although a defendant's post-complaint conduct may not moot a case such that a court lacks jurisdiction, changes in a defendant's conduct \"may ... render[ ] certain aspects of Plaintiffs' originally-alleged harm no longer imminent[.]\"\n   <em>\n    McFalls v. Purdue\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-2116-SI,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20785866\">\n    2018 WL 785866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D. Or. Feb. 8, 2018). Changes in a defendant's conduct are therefore relevant to a court's consideration of whether the plaintiff has carried his or her burden to demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lofton v. Verizon Wireless (VAW) LLC\n   </em>\n   , 586 Fed. App'x 420, 421 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    TRW, Inc. v. F.T.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224177\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/942/#p953\">\n    647 F.2d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953-54 (9th Cir. 1981) ). Plaintiffs implicitly recognize the relevance of the Revised Policy to the merits of their requested preliminary injunctive relief by arguing that \"the Revised Policy not only fails to moot this case, it is unconstitutional.\" (ECF No. 51 at 4.) Defendants also argue about the impact of the Revised Policy on Plaintiffs' request. (ECF No. 55 at 1-8.) Accordingly, the Court finds it appropriate to consider the Revised Policy in assessing whether Plaintiffs have met their burden to show that they are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiffs Have Not Shown They Are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claims because Defendants did not directly address Plaintiffs' briefing on this issue. (ECF No. 51 at 3.) The Court unequivocally rejects this contention. Despite the vacuum in Defendants' opposition on merits element, CAIR's amicus directly addresses it.

Treating as a foregone conclusion that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success is inconsistent with their burden. It is furthermore inappropriate in this case because Plaintiffs rely on the asserted merits of their First Amendment claim as the panacea for the remaining preliminary injunction elements. (ECF No. 26-1 at 20 (irreparable harm),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (balance of the hardships and public interest); ECF No. 51 at 11.) The Court thus turns to Plaintiffs' merits showing and concludes that they have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the claims on which they premise their need for preliminary injunctive relief. Since the requested relief is not warranted, the Court will not consider the parties' arguments regarding the scope of such relief.

Tellingly, Plaintiffs do not argue that the District is\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   providing taxpayer money to any sectarian organization, nor does the record contain any evidence that would support such an argument. Even assuming that a government policy may violate the No Aid Clause if taxpayer money is used \"under the direction of a sectarian organization,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), Plaintiffs have not provided evidence that CAIR directs or has directed the District's use of taxpayer money pursuant to the Initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The only concrete financial expenditure Plaintiffs identify in their motion is the District's purchase of several books that CAIR recommended as part of the District's measures to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Setting aside that the FAC does not allege this expenditure, the record shows that District staff separately vetted the books pursuant to a vetting process mandated by California law and District procedures. (Woehler Decl. \u00b6 3 Exs. B, C.) The books were purchased solely by a District employee from a third party commercial retailer. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 30 Ex. 28; Woehler Decl. \u00b6 4.) And the record shows that only District has made decisions regarding how the books are distributed in District schools, where they are available to teachers and students on an equal basis. (Woehler Decl. \u00b6 4; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 4; LiMandri Supp. Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. 53.) The Court finds that any \"benefit\" to religion based on the purchase of the CAIR-recommended books is properly characterized as \"incidental\" and consistent with the No Aid Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Non-Financial, Intangible \"Aid\".\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs further argue that the Initiative violates the No Aid Clause because \"Defendants have placed their power, prestige, and purse behind a single religion: Islam.\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 191-92.) Recognizing that the No Aid Clause does not prohibit \"incidental benefits\" to a sectarian purpose, Plaintiffs argue that the Initiative violates the No Aid Clause on this more far-reaching basis because: \"[t]here are no programs promoting 'Jewish culture.' There are no lectures from priests on how to accommodate Catholic students during Lent. And there are no partnerships with Evangelical Christian activists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs fail to support this assertion of a No Aid Clause violation with any concrete evidence or analysis tethered to the actual substance of the Initiative, its implementing measures, or even the District's treatment of other religions in general.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   This failure is a sufficient\n   basis to conclude that Plaintiffs have not met their preliminary injunction burden to state a No Aid Clause claim on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   However, the Court finds that the record does not support Plaintiffs' assertions. For one, there is no evidence to support Plaintiffs' suggestion that the District has failed to provide instructional materials for other religions and religious groups. In fact, the District indicates that its instructional materials \"address all major world religions[.]\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Woehler Decl. \u00b6 5; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 4.) Plaintiffs have not controverted this evidence. Second, the record contradicts Plaintiffs' suggestion that the District has a \"partnership\" with CAIR in connection with the Initiative. The District expressly rejected a formal partnership with CAIR. (\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 5 at 55-57\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) CAIR acknowledges in its amicus that there is no partnership between it and the District. (ECF No. 36 at 14.) Third, and relatedly, the record shows that the District has in fact entered into a formal partnership with the ADL. (Villegas Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. J.) Plaintiffs recognize that the ADL \"is a national, nonprofit organization that works to stop anti-Semitism, discrimination, and bigotry[.]\" (FAC \u00b6 45.) It is simply not accurate for Plaintiffs to suggest that the District excludes organizations with focuses on other religions or religious groups from the District. Fourth, there is no evidence to support Plaintiffs' belief that the District \"lavishes\" Muslim students with \"benefits\" not received by students of other religions. The text of many of the Action Steps are framed to\n   <em>\n    update\n   </em>\n   District resources and recognition of Islam and Muslim culture. This framing strongly suggests that the District sought to make its offerings on par with what it already provides students of other religions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   More fundamentally, Plaintiffs' zero-sum view of who \"benefits\" from the District's efforts to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying is not persuasive. The Initiative aims to address the behavior and conduct of \"Islamophobia\" and \"anti-Muslim bullying.\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 4 Ex. 2; FAC \u00b6 30.) There is nothing inherent in addressing such behavior and conduct that limits any benefit to solely those who are Muslim. The evil that measures like the Initiative seek to address can harm more than those who are directly targeted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In this case, the District has sought to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim by updating certain instructional materials and resources regarding Islam and Muslim culture for all staff and students. As CAIR persuasively asserts, any benefit from these measures \"accrues to all of the students at the School District by learning about the world,\" including \"about the culture of a growing\" segment of the Nation. (ECF No. 36 at 24.) Even if the District's measures could be construed to provide a \"benefit\" to Muslim students, the Revised Policy largely blunts Plaintiffs' claims about an unequal benefit or \"special treatment\" for Muslim students. The Revised Policy expressly states that: \"the District's anti-bullying program is developed to comprehensively address the issue of bullying of all students through the No Place for Hate program\" and \"[t]he District's instructional materials are and will continue to be consistent with state standards which address all major world religions in the context of world history and culture (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) Any alleged \"benefit\" that the Initiative is alleged to have provided Muslim students in the District\n   is presently available on an equal basis. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs haven not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their No Aid Clause claim, nor have they have shown a need for preliminary injunctive relief on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Perhaps realizing that this characterization of the relevant interest is not a fair one and in response to CAIR's amicus which highlights the particular dangers bullying may pose for the educational environment (ECF No. 36 at 6-7, 8-9), Plaintiffs concede that \"protecting students from bullying [is] a valid concern[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 50 at 4.) The Court accepts that addressing bullying of students, including bullying directed at students of a particular background, is a \"valid\" government interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that Defendants lacked the requisite basis to make this interest \"compelling\" in the context of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying. According to Plaintiffs, Defendants have not shown that there is an \"actual problem in need of solving.\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 15.) Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that \"there is not a scintilla of credible evidence that 'Islamophobia' ... runs rampant in District schools,\" but rather, in Plaintiffs' view, \"Defendants have relied solely on specious student surveys and testimonials that CAIR had provided as part of its lobbying for the Initiative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at 4.) Plaintiffs do not provide evidence or persuasive arguments to support their contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Although Plaintiffs allege that the District relied on \"prepared student testimony\" of Muslim students when it decided to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying (FAC \u00b6 123), evidence substantiating the suggestion of fabricated testimony is entirely absent from the preliminary injunction record. Plaintiffs have not otherwise articulated in their briefing or at oral argument on what concrete basis they believe the reports and testimony by Muslim students on which the District allegedly relied to adopt the Initiative are not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs' challenge to the District's alleged reliance on the CAIR Survey as methodologically flawed is also unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (ECF No. 26-1 at 15 n.15.) Based on Plaintiffs' allegations, the Court understands the survey's alleged flaws to be that: (1) the survey used a definition of bullying that they believe is \"dissimilar\" from the definitions used by HHS or identified in the California Education Code and (2) CAIR \"did not distribute a comparative survey to non-Muslim students to validate its findings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42-43.) Plaintiffs' motion, however, curiously omits evidence based on which the Court can assess Plaintiffs' assertions. Plaintiffs fail to provide a copy of the CAIR survey and they do not introduce any evidence showing its alleged methodological flaws. Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertions about the CAIR survey's flaws then, this is not a case in which \"significant, admitted flaws in methodology\" undermine the existence of a compelling interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Video Software Dealers Ass'n v.

More broadly, Plaintiffs provide no authorities showing that the District would need a validated study of identity-based bullying, or even bullying more generally, in order for District administrators and staff to develop policies to address student reports of such behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs provide no persuasive explanation for the basic premise underlying their argument that the District lacks a compelling interest: that the District may not take into account Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying that occurs outside the District. In opposing Plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion, the District makes clear that it adopted the Initiative \"[i]n the wake of the increased instances of Islamophobia following Donald Trump's election campaign.\" (ECF No. 32 at 2.) The Court observes that CAIR has offered more detailed insight into this point. (ECF No. 36 at 5-6.) Plaintiffs do not seriously contend that nationwide information about identity-based bullying and harassment is not a relevant consideration. Plaintiffs rely on nationwide surveys of anti-Semitism and bullying of Asian-American students, including religion-based bullying of Asian-American students. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 48);\n   <em>\n    see also ADL Audit\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    AAPI Task Force Report\n   </em>\n   . The Court is left to wonder what makes Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying different. When the Court pressed Plaintiffs at oral argument about why the District cannot take into account national events or reports about Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying, Plaintiffs' counsel speculated that such new was \"fake\n   news.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   This speculation by Plaintiffs' counsel is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Narrowly Tailored\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The Initiative is not self-executing-it requires a plan to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 4 Ex. 2; FAC \u00b6 30.) The Action Steps reflect the District's initial plan to do so and the Revised Policy provides an additional gloss on how the District seeks to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court turns first to a narrow tailoring argument Plaintiffs raise that applies equally to the Action Steps and the Revised Policy. According to Plaintiffs, \"narrow tailoring requires the District to show that the Initiative 'will in fact alleviate' the alleged Islamophobia in a 'direct and material way.' \" (ECF No. 26-1 at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39619\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/622/#p644\">\n    512 U.S. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39619\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/622/#p644\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39619\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/622/#p644\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).) Plaintiffs argue that the District's plan to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying fails this requirement because \"the District already has an anti-bullying department\" and \"already has state-mandated policies in place to address student bullying and discrimination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs have submitted a copy of the District's \"Administrative Procedure\" for addressing \"Bullying and Intimidation,\" which became effective in November 2011 and which the District revised in August 2015. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 40 Ex. 38.) The procedure is silent on religion-based bullying, let alone any type of identity-based bullying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As even Plaintiffs recognize, religion-based bullying is reported to have occurred in the District. (FAC \u00b6 26; ECF No. 26-1 at 3; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 5 Ex. 3,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6, Ex. 4.) It is thus unclear to the Court on what basis Plaintiffs' believe the District's pre-existing bullying procedure limits the measures the District may take to address religion-based bullying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Action Steps are not narrowly tailored because the District failed to consider \"constitutionally-mandated\" religion-neutral alternatives. (ECF No. 26-1 at 16);\n   <em>\n    Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573087\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/701/#p735\">\n    551 U.S. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573087\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/701/#p735\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573087\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/701/#p735\">\n    168 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). The Court is at a loss to understand how the District could meaningfully address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying through measures that do not account for the fact that, by Plaintiffs' own definitions, \"Islamophobia\" and \"anti-Muslim bullying\" target an individual precisely because he or she is Muslim (or perceived to be). Even taking Plaintiffs' argument on its own terms, however, Plaintiffs do not provide evidence showing that the District failed to consider religion-neutral alternatives or that the Initiative was built \"from the ground up with CAIR.\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Turning to the Action Steps, many of them do not in fact use the terms \"Islam\" or \"Muslim,\" or even refer to any associated religious beliefs or practices. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 5 at 55-57; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 3 Ex. A at 8-10; FAC \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.) There are of course several Action Steps which do refer to Islam and Muslims-steps which the Plaintiffs emphasize to raise the specter\n   of the Initiative's unconstitutionality. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 53-55; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex. 5 at 55-57 (highlighting certain Action Steps).) These Action Steps direct the District \"to review District calendars to ensure Muslim holidays are recognized,\" \"provide a series of professional development opportunities for staff related to awareness and advocacy for Muslim culture,\" \"provide practical tools for educators regarding Islamic religious practices and accommodations in schools,\" \"provide resources and strategies to support students during the upcoming month of Ramadan,\" and \"review and vet materials related to Muslim culture and history at the Instructional Media Center[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   To the extent Plaintiffs believe that the District's mere references to \"Islam\" or \"Muslims\" are an unconstitutional endorsement of a religion, they impute to the Establishment Clause a breadth that is not tenable in a pluralistic society.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas Monthly, Inc. v.

Importantly, there is no evidence that the District does not recognize other religious holidays and there is no evidence that the District is not receptive to or lacks instructional materials about other religions and cultural groups. Without such evidence, the Court cannot conclude that the District's use of the terms \"Muslim\" and \"Islam\" is for a purpose other than recognizing that it serves a student population which also includes Muslim students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   More fundamentally, several of the Action Steps which use the terms \"Muslim\" and \"Islam\" are entirely consistent with religious accommodations to which, like students of any religious faith, Muslim students are entitled as a matter of government neutrality \"in the face of religious differences.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Church of God (Worldwide, Texas Region) v.

The District's decision to \"ensure\" that Muslim holidays were included on the District-wide calendar clearly reflects that such holidays were inadequately recognized beforehand. There is nothing nefarious about the District taking action to ensure the adequacy of its recognition of such holidays. And certain Action Steps which aim to increase awareness of \"Muslim culture\" are consistent with \"the entirely nonreligious (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , secular) and commendable purpose of exposing students to different cultural attitudes and outlooks.\"\n   <em>\n    Grove v.

(Anjan Decl. \u00b6 6 Exs. E, F; LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) The Revised Policy expressly directs the creation of \"[a] calendar of observances\" which \"shall include holidays of all faiths for the purpose of enhancing mutual understanding and respect among the various religious, ethnic and cultural groups, and to assist staff to be sensitive to such holidays in the scheduling of events.\" (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.)

In the context of government activity affecting curriculum, the express rejection of a subjective test has particular force. \"If an Establishment Clause violation arose each time a student believed that a school practice either advanced or disapproved of a religion, school curricula would be reduced to the lowest common denominator, permitting each student to become a 'curriculum review committee' unto himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 27 F.3d at 1378-79. The Court sees no reason to distinguish this rationale in the school classroom curriculum context from trainings and resources provided to teachers, both of which are elements of the Initiative and its implementing measures. Because a subjective test does not govern, primary effect is assessed \"from the point of view of a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   observer who is 'informed ... [and] familiar with the history of the government practice at issue.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3105893\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1246/#p1250\">\n    487 F.3d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 27 F.3d at 1378 ) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs do not argue nor present evidence regarding how an objective or reasonable observer would perceive the Initiative as an endorsement of Islam and Muslims and rejection of other religions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finally, to the extent Plaintiffs believe that the Initiative's focus on Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying primarily advances religion because it coincides with a focus of CAIR or because the District has adopted educational and awareness measures that account for religion, the Court rejects this argument. In addition to the reasons the Court has set forth in analyzing Plaintiffs' narrow tailoring argument, there is \"no reason to conclude\" that the Initiative \"serves an impermissible religious purpose simply because\" its focus \"coincide[s] with the beliefs of certain religious organizations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have \"delegate[d] government power to a religious organization,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , CAIR, and relatedly, Defendants \"give sectarian activists exclusive access into classrooms to proselytize to schoolchildren[.]\" (ECF No. 26-1 at 18.) Based on the assertion that \"[l]ittle analysis is needed\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), Plaintiffs fail to identify any evidence in the record substantiating these claims of excessive entanglement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Viewing the preliminary injunction record as a whole, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to show excessive entanglement with religion on the basis of the District's relationship with CAIR. As the Court has noted, Defendants have eliminated the possibility of a formal partnership between the District and CAIR to address Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying. (LiMandri Decl. \u00b6 32 Ex. 30.) CAIR's role is largely limited to the IRCC on terms that apply equally to any other community organization. (ECF No. 32 at 7; Anjan Decl. \u00b6 12; Santos Decl. \u00b6 7; Villegas Decl. \u00b6 5.) Moreover, to the extent CAIR has provided and suggests resources for the District on Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bullying, these resources are subject to review by the District and/or the ADL. (LiMandri Supp. Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 Exs. 55-56.) Plaintiffs have simply not substantiated their belief that CAIR has unfettered and preferential access to the District's classrooms and students. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their Establishment Clause claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
