INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Former plaintiff Friends of Ruth &amp; Emily, Inc. (\"Friends\") filed suit against the defendant City of New Bedford (\"New Bedford\"), alleging that New Bedford's city zoo committed an unlawful taking under the Endangered Species Act. After New Bedford moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of proper legal representation, Joyce Rowley (\"Rowley\") substituted herself as plaintiff, rendering the issue moot. ECF Nos. 18, 23. This Court withheld judgment on the motion, however, asking the parties instead to brief the issue of standing. ECF No. 30. Satisfied that Rowley does indeed have the requisite standing to maintain this suit at this stage of the litigation, the Court now DENIES New Bedford's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 21, 2017, Friends filed a complaint against New Bedford in this Court under its federal question jurisdiction. Compl. Decl. &amp; Inj. Relief (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 25. New Bedford moved to dismiss the complaint on October 16, on the basis that Rowley, the non-attorney founder and president of Friends, could not represent Friends in a federal lawsuit. Mot. Dismiss Pl.'s Compl. (\"Mot. Dismiss\"), ECF No. 7. Friends opposed the motion, Resp. Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Dismiss (\"Opp'n Mot. Dismiss\"), ECF No. 14, and moved for a preliminary injunction on December 12, Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 16. That day, this Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss and granted a conditional dismissal, allowing Friends thirty days to retain proper counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 12, 2018, Rowley moved to intervene, which this Court allowed as a motion to substitute the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 21, 23. Rowley then renewed Friends' previous motion for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 27, 28. Concerned about Rowley's standing to maintain suit, this Court requested briefing on the issue, which both parties duly provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br.

Facts Alleged\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rowley alleges maltreatment of two Asian elephants, named Ruth and Emily, at the Buttonwood Park Zoo (the \"Zoo\") in New Bedford. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Rowley is the founder and president of Friends, a \"nonprofit organization and [ ] public charity\" consisting of \"dozens\" of members supporting the effort to shut down the Zoo's elephant exhibit and transfer Ruth and Emily to an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13. Rowley is also a member of the Buttonwood Park Zoological Society and visits the Zoo on a \"near daily basis\" to observe Ruth and Emily.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Rowley alleges that she has formed \"an aesthetic, emotional, and spiritual relationship with Ruth and Emily over the years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rowley alleges that the Zoo has harmed Ruth and Emily in several ways, such as by chaining their legs to restrain them overnight; failing to protect Ruth from attacks by Emily (it is allegedly \"well documented\" that the two elephants do not get along); housing them in inadequate facilities; failing to provide the elephants with sufficient socialization opportunities; and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-65. Rowley claims that the Zoo's treatment of Ruth and Emily violates Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits the \"taking\" of any endangered species and the possession of any endangered species unlawfully taken.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.

It goes beyond the limit, however, and into pure speculation and fantasy, to say that anyone who observes or works with an endangered species, anywhere in the world, is appreciably harmed by a single project affecting some portion of that species with which he has no more specific connection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    at 566-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Japan Whaling Ass'n\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    American Cetacean Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205024\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/221/#p231\">\n    478 U.S. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231, n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205024\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/221/#p231\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205024\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/221/#p231\">\n    92 L.Ed.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By contrast, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/\">\n    528 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), established standing for their claims concerning a facility's unlawful discharge of pollutants into a river.

The fact that some cases have involved plaintiffs who have based their theories of injury on the observation of a species in its natural habitat,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. at 563-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not compel the conclusion that all plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have observed, or will observe, a species in its natural habitat. None of the cases known to this Court require such a showing, and New Bedford does not offer any that do. Rowley has sufficiently established injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The second requirement of standing is \"a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, Rowley must show \"that the injury is fairly traceable to [New Bedford's] allegedly unlawful actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Animal Welfare Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790938\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/19/#p25\">\n    623 F.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nulankeyutmonen Nkihtaqmikon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Impson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920675\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/18/#p26\">\n    503 F.3d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2007) ). In her complaint, Rowley alleges that the Zoo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) keep[s] Ruth &amp; Emily in a facility ... that interferes with normal behavior; (2) confin[es] them in a small enclosure and even smaller \"barn\" with bars and hard substrates that cause physical and psychological harm; (3) prevent[s] them from having appropriate social interactions with each other and other elephants; (4) fail[s] to protect Ruth from Emily's aggression which causes Ruth physical and psychological harm; (5) fail[s] to provide adequate veterinary care which harms both Ruth and Emily; (6) fail[s] to provide proper food and enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 10. New Bedford claims that because the Zoo has in fact not mistreated the elephants, Rowley cannot show that its conduct has caused any harm. Def.'s Mem. 3-4. Whether or not Rowley will ultimately succeed in proving her allegations of harm, however, is irrelevant at this stage. Rowley has sufficiently alleged that the Zoo's actions cause the harm complained of by \"interfer[ing] with [Ruth and Emily's] natural state\" and \"increas[ing] [their] risk of death.\"\n   <em>\n    Animal Welfare Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790938\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/19/#p25\">\n    623 F.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Redressability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Rowley must show that \"it [is] likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790938\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/19/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Impson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920675\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/18/#p26\">\n    503 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   26 ). This requirement has been held to have been satisfied through requests for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920675\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/18/#p26\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26 ;\n   <em>\n    Strahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7655594\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/939/963/\">\n    939 F.Supp. at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, here, Rowley requests a declaratory judgment that the Zoo's treatment of Ruth and Emily violates the Endangered Species Act, as well as injunctions prohibiting the Zoo from euthanizing the elephants and continuing to violate the Endangered Species Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. at 25. Were the Zoo to improve its facilities for Ruth and Emily, protect them in the appropriate manner, and provide adequate veterinary care and nutrition, it is likely that Ruth and Emily would suffer less harm and face a decreased risk of illness or death. Thus, a favorable decision is likely to redress Rowley's\n   injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glickman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338947,11704543\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/154/426/\">\n    154 F.3d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Tougher regulations [in compliance with federal law] would either allow [the plaintiff] to visit a more humane Game Farm or, if the Game Farm's owners decide to close rather than comply with higher legal standards, to possibly visit the animals he has come to know in their new homes within exhibitions that comply.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   New Bedford contends that Rowley has not established redressability because her complaint proposes the relocation of Ruth and Emily to a sanctuary in Tennessee, yet she \"has not alleged that she would travel to Tennessee\" or \"stated how she would personally benefit by the proposed relocation.\" Def.'s Mem. 5. This Court need not determine whether such allegations are necessary, however, because while Rowley's complaint at times urges this relocation, it does not actually seek this relief. Instead, it requests that this Court enjoin the Zoo's alleged unlawful taking, possession, and mistreatment of the elephants and declare its practices unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 25. Further, there has been no indication that the elephants' fate rests in part with agencies not involved in this lawsuit or government initiatives outside New Bedford's control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. at 568-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Zoo is the custodian of these two elephants, and New Bedford, the Zoo's owner, is a party to this case. If Rowley prevails, the Court may order New Bedford to take certain actions that would likely provide full relief to Rowley's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   New Bedford next argues that Rowley's injuries are unlikely to be redressed by the Court because Ruth and Emily fall into an exemption from the Endangered Species Act's requirements. Def.'s Mem. 5-6. The Endangered Species Act does indeed exempt certain wildlife from some of its provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The provisions of subsections (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(G) of this section shall not apply to any fish or wildlife which was held in captivity or in a controlled environment on (A) December 28, 1973, or (B) the date of the publication in the Federal Register of a final regulation adding such fish or wildlife species to any list published pursuant to subsection (c) of section 1533 of this title:\n   <em>\n    Provided\n   </em>\n   , That such holding and any subsequent holding or use of the fish or wildlife was not in the course of a commercial activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201538\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). New Bedford asserts that because Ruth and Emily have been held in captivity prior to either of the applicable dates, the statute exempts them from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This argument might carry weight if Rowley were claiming violations of subsections (a)(1)(A) or (a)(1)(G) of section 1538. Her complaint, however, alleges violations of subsections (a)(1)(B), prohibiting the unlawful \"taking\" of an endangered species, and (a)(1)(D), prohibiting the possession of such an unlawfully taken species. Compl. \u00b6 9. The statute's plain language indicates that the exemption does not apply to these subsections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ringling Bros. &amp; Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5702230\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/502/103/#p108\">\n    502 F.Supp.2d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108-09 (D.D.C. 2007) (analyzing the statute's language and congressional intent to conclude that the exemption applies only to subsections (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(G) ). Consequently, this statutory exemption does not disturb the Court's conclusion that Rowley's claims are redressable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Rowley has sufficiently demonstrated standing to pursue her claims. New Bedford's motion to dismiss, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   No. 7, is DENIED. This case has already dragged on far too long. Since Rowley seeks preliminary injunctive relief, it is appropriate in this instance that such hearing be joined with trial on the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a). The Court will convene a status conference as soon as possible to set an early trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Given that Rowley has alleged that she is the founder and president of Friends, Compl. \u00b6 9, and is now the substituted plaintiff, the Court considers it reasonable to infer that she was involved in the activities attributed to Friends in the complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Rowley has also recently moved for a preliminary injunction based on allegations of Ruth's declining health, seeking a court order enjoining the Zoo's continued allegedly unlawful possession of Ruth and mandating Ruth's assessment by an expert.
