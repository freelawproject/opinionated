CAMPBELL, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court are Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 201) and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Abdullah Abriq immigrated to the United States under an F-1 student\n   visa and resided in Davidson County. On April 6, 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") took custody of Plaintiff, pursuant to the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"), pending civil removal proceedings. Defendant Metropolitan Government of Nashville/Davidson County (\"Metro\") was not involved in Plaintiff's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of Plaintiff's arrest, ICE issued to him two forms, a Form I-200 (Warrant for Arrest of Alien) and a Form I-862 (Notice to Appear). The Form I-200 states that an authorized immigration officer \"determined that there is probable cause to believe that Abriq Abdullah is removable from the United States.\" (Doc. No. 222 at \u00b6 12). Although Plaintiff disputes that it establishes probable cause, the Form I-862 sets forth four facts concerning Plaintiff that formed the basis of ICE's determination that probable cause existed to believe he was subject to removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After arresting him, ICE first took Plaintiff to the local ICE office and then transported him to the Davidson County Sheriff's Office (\"DCSO\"). When ICE presented Plaintiff for housing at the DCSO, it provided the DCSO with an I-203 Form, which is titled \"Order to Detain Alien.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 222 at \u00b6 14; Doc. No. 31-5). ICE did not issue a detainer for Plaintiff. (Doc. No. 222 at \u00b6 16). DCSO housed Plaintiff from April 6 until April 11, 2017. On April 10, 2017, ICE sent DCSO an I-203B form (Order to Release) for Abriq and on April 11, 2017, ICE removed Plaintiff from DCSO's physical custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It is undisputed that, at the time of Plaintiff's arrival at the DCSO in April of 2017, Metro had no contract directly with ICE for the housing or detention of immigration detainees. The Court, therefore, will not address the many arguments and alleged statements of undisputed facts pertaining to whether any such contract governs this case. The issue presented here is whether Metro's actions, taken\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   a contract with ICE, were constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Metro held Plaintiff pursuant to the ICE Order to Detain, without determining whether there was additional, independent, probable cause to detain him. Metro also held Plaintiff without a warrant from a local magistrate indicating additional probable cause to detain him. (Doc. No. 224 at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44). Plaintiff does not dispute that when the DCSO detains a civil immigrant detainee for whom no state charges are pending, it detains that person based on its assumption that ICE believes the person has committed a civil immigration violation. (Doc. No. 222 at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff sued Metro for alleged violations of his constitutional rights and state law. The Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, unjust enrichment and false imprisonment. (Doc. No. 137). Plaintiff alleges Metro had no lawful authority to house, hold or detain him as an immigration detainee and, therefore, its actions violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from illegal seizure. Both parties moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's remaining Fourth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

There was no request for Metro to continue to hold Plaintiff, because it was not holding him. The cases involving continued detention, pursuant to detainers and/or administrative warrants, of aliens already in state custody, are therefore distinguishable upon their different facts, even if they do offer correct statements of general immigration law. Here, local or state officers neither arrested an alien for an immigration violation nor held an alien based solely on an immigration detainer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff was brought to the DCSO in ICE custody.

This case is distinguishable from those in which courts held that continued detention of an alien\n   <em>\n    already in state custody\n   </em>\n   constituted a new seizure.

In that case, the transfer of the detainee was from state/territorial custody to federal custody. The same should apply to transfers from federal custody to state custody. This Court agrees that Metro cannot acquire federal civil immigration arrest powers informally, but Metro did not arrest Plaintiff. Plaintiff's argument that \u00a7 1357(g)(10) does not grant authority to state officers to make immigration arrests, therefore, is inapplicable, because the state officials here did not make an immigration arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Metro held Plaintiff based upon a specific request from ICE agents. That request (I-203 Form) was issued and presented to Metro\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   ICE found probable cause,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was \"seized,\" and\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was in ICE custody. Metro did not unilaterally take any action with regard to Plaintiff - it did not investigate, apprehend or arrest him. ICE made the underlying removability determination. If Metro chooses to cooperate with ICE as it did in this case, it has no discretion at all; it merely follows the direction of ICE agents.\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   at 799-800, at *4. Metro cooperated with a request from ICE to house Plaintiff pending ICE's transfer to another facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because it did not \"seize\" Plaintiff, Metro did not need probable cause. Even so, Metro did not provide housing for Plaintiff without probable cause. Plaintiff does not dispute that ICE had probable cause to detain him. Plaintiff was in ICE custody pursuant to a warrant for which ICE had to have probable cause.

Nov. 7, 2017), to argue that Metro violated his rights by holding him without probable cause to believe he had committed a crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, that holding was based upon a different standard, and the Court found that Plaintiff had \"stated a claim,\" not that he was entitled to judgment on that claim. It is now undisputed that this case does not involve an ICE detainer. Moreover, as indicated herein, the Court finds that Metro did not violate Plaintiff's rights by holding him without probable cause to believe he had committed a crime, because Metro did not \"seize\" Plaintiff and Metro was entitled to rely upon the probable cause found by ICE. No one disputes that ICE must establish probable cause in order to detain individuals for immigration violations or that ICE had such probable cause in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In other words, Metro was not required to have additional, independent probable cause to simply \"house\" Plaintiff for ICE. Metro was not required to have probable cause to believe Plaintiff had committed a crime because Metro did not \"seize\" Plaintiff. Even if Metro was required to have probable cause to hold him for a civil immigration violation, that probable cause was determined by ICE and then imputed to Metro. Having found that Metro did not \"seize\" Plaintiff and had no requirement to find independent probable cause to accept him for housing from ICE (who\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have probable cause), the Court need not address Metro's argument about acting under color of state law. Metro's actions did not violate Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For these reasons, Metro's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted, and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied. Accordingly, this action will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is so\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The I-203 form is not a criminal warrant or a court-issued document.

No. 222 at \u00b6 17). The form at issue says \"Please detain\" Abdullah Abriq and is signed electronically by \"E7733 BAKER.\" (Doc. No. 31-5).
