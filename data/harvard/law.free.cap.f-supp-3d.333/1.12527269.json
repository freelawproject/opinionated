Defendant Turco moves to dismiss the Plaintiff's Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to state a viable supervisory liability claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion (Docket No. 44) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from Plaintiff's complaint and are assumed true for the purposes of this motion. Manuel Lucero was formerly an inmate at Worcester\n   County Jail and House of Corrections (WCJHOC). During his time there he was deprived of \"the basic necessities of life, including: warmth, safety, sanitation, and adequate medical care.\" (Docket No. 11 at \u00b6 26). Inmates are kept in close quarters consisting of two-person bunks arranged about four feet on all sides from another bunk; he was given a dirty mattress; he was forced to take hot showers; there were insufficient fire drills; he was given insufficient blankets; his food was cold and contained bodily fluids; he was deprived of engaging in consensual sexual intimacy with other inmates; he was denied adequate medical care; he had insufficient access to legal resources; and prison officials retaliated against him for complaints and denied three orders of Black's Law Dictionary under the false pretense that they were used when in fact ordered new directly from the publisher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss, based solely on the complaint, for the plaintiff's \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

Importantly, on a motion to dismiss, merely \"[p]arroting our standard for supervisory liability in the context of Section 1983... is precisely the type of 'the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me' allegation that the Supreme Court has determined should not be given credence when standing alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3503702\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/31/#p49\">\n    590 F.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has provided no factual allegations that could plausibly establish that Defendant Turco was deliberately indifferent to the fact that conditions at WCJHOC presented a risk that federal rights would be violated or that deficient medical care presented a risk of constitutional injury. In fact, according to Massachusetts law, the Commissioner of the Department of Correction does not have supervisory authority over county personnel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. Gen. L. c. 124 \u00a7 1(d). Further, Plaintiff does not plead any facts that could lead to an inference that Defendant Turco was causally connected to his harms in any way. Instead, Plaintiff has merely \"parroted\" the standard for supervisory liability. Therefore, Defendant Turco is also not liable in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Defendant Turco's motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
