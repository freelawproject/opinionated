CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   When Gaylon Lawrence attempted a creeping takeover of Capstar Financial Holdings, Inc. (\"Capstar\"), by buying over 10% of Capstar's stocks, Capstar filed this action to stop him. Before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. No. 22.) For the following reasons, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. ALLEGATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After four years of growth, on July 1, 2016, Capstar filed a preliminary prospectus for an initial public offering of its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. (Doc. No. 1 at 5.) Days later, Lawrence called Capstar's Chief Executive Officer Claire Tucker and indicated that he would like to acquire Capstar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On behalf of Capstar, Tucker rejected Lawrence's advances, but informed him that she would notify the Chairman of Capstar's Board of Directors, Dennis Buttorff, of Lawrence's interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lawrence then called Buttorff himself and arranged a lunch meeting to express his desire to acquire Capstar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 29, 2016, Capstar filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Two days later, The Lawrence Group, a company Lawrence uses as his \"investment vehicle\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1) but is not registered with the Federal Reserve Board as a bank holding company (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), submitted a letter proposal offering to acquire Capstar or, alternatively, a majority of its shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) Two days later, Capstar's Board of Directors voted unanimously to decline The Lawrence Group's proposal and proceed with Capstar's initial public offering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The Lawrence Group subsequently sent letters to two of Capstar's largest shareholders and separately requested to purchase all of their stock, totaling more than 30% of Capstar's stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The shareholders declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Eleven months after Capstar released its initial public offering, Lawrence began purchasing Capstar stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On August 11, 2017, Lawrence filed a Schedule 13D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is required whenever a person or group acquires over five percent of a company's stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The Schedule 13D indicated that Lawrence was purchasing\n   stock that, in the aggregate, would put him as a 6.2 percent owner. (Doc. No. 20-1 at 3.) Lawrence described his purpose of acquiring Capstar's stock under Item 4 of the form:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Reporting Person acquired the securities described in Schedule 13D for investment purposes, and he intends to review his investments in the Issuer on a continuing basis. Any actions the Reporting Person might undertake may be made at any time and from time to time without prior notice and will be dependent upon the Reporting Person's review of numerous factors....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Depending upon overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available to the Reporting Person, and the availability of the Issuer's securities at prices that would make the purchase or sale of the Issuer's securities desirable, the Reporting Person may acquire additional securities of the Issuer, or retain or sell all or a portion of the securities then held, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Reporting Person and his representatives may, from time to time, engage in discussions with members of the management and the board of directors of the Issuer.... Except as set forth above, the Reporting Person has no present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the transactions required to be described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Two weeks later, Lawrence amended his Schedule 13D to reflect that he had purchased more stock and he was a 7.2 percent owner of Capstar. (Doc. No. 1 at 7; Doc. No. 20-2.) He did not amend his Item 4 disclosure. (Doc. No. 1 at 7; Doc. No. 20-2.) Lawrence amended his Schedule 13D three more times in the next two months, each time increasing the percentage of stock he owned, but he never amended his Item 4 disclosure. (Doc. No. 1 at 7; Doc. No. 20-3; Doc. No. 20-4; Doc. No. 20-5.) His final disclosure, filed on October 17, 2017, indicated that he had purchased in the aggregate 10.2 percent of Capstar's shares. (Doc. No. 1 at 7.) The Schedule 13D disclosures did not mention The Lawrence Group, but instead disclosed that Lawrence himself owned the stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) Lawrence did not notify the Federal Reserve Board that he intended to purchase over ten percent of Capstar's stocks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

Lawrence argues that this claim must be dismissed because everything in his Schedule 13D disclosure is truthful, and he was only interested in continuing to acquire stock depending on the market conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lawrence's argument is the same one courts have rejected time and time again. Although it is true that overstating the definiteness of plans to acquire stock violates Section 13(d),\n   <em>\n    Elec. Specialty Co. v. Int'l Controls Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2199913\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/409/937/\">\n    409 F.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1969), it is well-settled that \"Item 4 of\n   Schedule 13D requires disclosure of a purpose to acquire control, even though this intention has not taken shape as a fixed plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Chromalloy Am.

In short, a beneficial owner cannot claim that he purchased securities for \"investment purposes\" when he is actually attempting to acquire control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen. Aircraft Corp. v. Lampert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"956389\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/556/90/#p94\">\n    556 F.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95-96 (1st Cir. 1977) (affirming the district court's granting of a preliminary injunction because defendants misled investors by stating its purpose in acquiring shares was \"for the purpose of investment rather than acquisition of control\");\n   <em>\n    K-N Energy, Inc. v.

Col. 1983) (holding that a \"person or group filing a Schedule 13D may not use 'investment' as a catch-all purpose when plans for implementing another purpose,\" such as obtaining control of the issuer, are \"indefinite or undeveloped\" because it is misleading). The allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to support an inference that Lawrence intended to take control of Capstar. Lawrence did not disclose that purpose in his Schedule 13D, but instead only stated that his acquisition of Capstar stock was for \"investment purposes.\" Like in\n   <em>\n    General Aircraft Corp\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    K-N Energy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Capstar has sufficiently alleged that statement was potentially misleading to investors and did not accurately describe Lawrence's purpose in acquiring stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Capstar also plausibly pleaded that Lawrence and The Lawrence Group acted as a group. The Complaint alleges that Lawrence acted through the Lawrence Group to make multiple offers to purchase stock and that Lawrence has given power of attorney to control his securities to The Lawrence Group. (Doc. No. 1 at 6, 9, 12.) This is sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that he acted with The Lawrence Group as a group in purchasing 10.2 percent of Capstar's shares, which would have to be disclosed on a Schedule 13D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants also argue that the Court should dismiss any claim for damages or for divestiture of stock because such relief is not available under Section 13(d). Capstar concedes that damages are not available. (Doc. No. 33 at 16.) However, divestiture may be awarded in a \"proper case\" where an injunction requiring Defendants to amend their Schedule 13D would not be an adequate remedy.\n   <em>\n    ICN Pharms., Inc. v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    ICN Pharmaceuticals\n   </em>\n   , the defendant participated in illegal insider trading of the plaintiff's common stock, and the court found that divestiture of the illegally-acquired shares was appropriate to prevent the defendant from voting its illegal shares.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3611127\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/574/1172/#p1202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hanna Mining Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Northern District of Ohio ordered divestiture of stock when the defendant had a tender offer in place because the defendant engaged in a \"manipulative scheme.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3611127\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/574/1172/#p1202\">\n    574 F.Supp. at 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
