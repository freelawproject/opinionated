No. 34] pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the\n   <em>\n    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n   </em>\n   . Because the factual matter, legal standards, and arguments of these motions overlap, the court has decided them together. For the reasons discussed below, the Motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hannah Knouse brings her Complaint, as administrator of Dr. Charles Knouse's estate, for relief arising from the decedent's death while in custody at South Central Regional Jail in Kanawha County, West Virginia. She alleges, inter alia, that the defendants failed to adequately provide\n   certain medical care and attention to Dr. Knouse while he was incarcerated, resulting in his death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 19; [ECF No. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. Knouse was arrested on a forty-count federal indictment, including charges for distribution and manufacturing of controlled substances. Compl. Ex. A at 6; [ECF No. 1-1]. At his Initial Appearance before Magistrate Judge Omar J. Aboulhosn, Dr. Knouse detailed serious concerns over his medical treatment since being incarcerated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Dr. Knouse began by explaining that South Central was not meeting his serious medical needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Among these included a life-threatening heart condition that leads to a fatal arrhythmia if not treated with medication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. He stated that he suffered from rapidly progressing congestive heart failure, which also required medication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He explained that because he was required to self-catheterize, he was unable to urinate for the first two days after arriving in prison and had not been given the opportunity to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, he explained that he was on a prescription of suboxone and that if he did not resume his treatment, the withdrawal from the suboxone would prevent his heart medication from being able to control his heart rhythm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Lastly, he explained that he needed to resume his herpes treatment to prevent oral outbreaks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dr. Knouse also elaborated on the conditions of his confinement: he stated that he was nearly naked while wearing only a safety smock, a \"pickle suit,\" that he had to hold closed with his hands. Compl. Ex. A at 10. He also stated that he was otherwise on bare concrete and did not receive a blanket until after his first few days in prison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In light of those serious concerns, the Magistrate Judge ordered the authorities of the South Central Regional Jail to (1) \"immediately place and hold [Dr. Knouse] in the medical unit\"; (2) \"immediately resume [him] on all of his prescribed medications\"; and (3) \"immediately treat [him] for Herpes.\" Compl. Ex. B at 2; [ECF No. 1-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 7, 2017, authorities moved Dr. Knouse to a mainline housing unit, contrary to the Magistrate Judge's Order to keep him in a medical unit. Compl. 5. On August 12, 2017, Dr. Knouse was moved again and placed on suicide watch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. At 12:45 a.m., Dr. Knouse requested to speak with medical staff at his cell door.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He told staff that he was suffering from chest pain and that his resting heart rate kept dropping dangerously low to approximately twenty beats per minute. Compl. Ex. D at 5 [ECF No. 1-4]. Prison and medical personnel purportedly believed that Dr. Knouse was stable and did not provide any emergency medical care or alert the medical doctor of his condition, despite their awareness of Dr. Knouse's coronary artery disease and ongoing chest pains.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 5:45 a.m., Dr. Knouse's cellmate alerted defendant Chandler that Dr. Knouse was unresponsive. Compl. 6. Prison personnel attempted CPR, but at 6:18 a.m., Dr. Knouse was pronounced dead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of the staff's failures, defendant Chandler and three Primecare Medical employees were terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 7, 2018, the plaintiff filed her Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The Complaint names ten defendants, including defendants WVRJA, Douglas, and Chandler (\"Prison Defendants\"). It alleges counts of negligence; medical professional negligence; violation of the West Virginia State and United States Constitutions; intentional infliction of emotional distress; fraud and civil conspiracy; negligent hiring, retention, and\n   supervision; punitive damages; waiver of governmental immunity and punitive damages; violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and Civil Rights violations and constitutional violations through\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On June 26, 2018, defendants WVRJA and Douglas moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and asserted defenses of immunity, and on July 27, 2018, defendant Chandler moved to dismiss on the same grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

See W. VA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 31-20-3 (West 2018). Additionally, Douglas, the jail administrator, and Chandler, a correctional officer, are agents of the WVRJA. Consequently, the plaintiff's Counts alleging constitutional violations under \u00a7 1983 against the WVRJA and against defendants Douglas and Chandler in their official capacities fail.

Moreover, all sections of the Complaint incorporate all other allegations from the Complaint, which the rules plainly permit. See FED. R. CIV.

And unlike the plaintiff's state law claims (discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), the Complaint sufficiently states a claim for relief under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Dr. Knouse's serious medical needs in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, pretrial detainees, like convicted prisoners under the Eight Amendment, are protected against \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Magistrate Judge Aboulhosn ordered \"the authorities of the South Central Regional Jail\" to house Dr. Knouse in a medical unit and to continue all of his medications. The defendants failed to do that. Moreover, defendants Chandler and Douglas knew that Dr. Knouse had life-threatening medical issues; Dr. Knouse pleaded with nurses and other prison officials, making plain the urgency of his requests and the seriousness of his condition. He was ignored-which was confirmed by surveillance cameras, contrary to prison medical procedure, and in violation of two court orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court finds that the Complaint alleges enough factual matter to state a plausible claim that the plaintiff is entitled to relief for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The defendants' motions are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . The remaining federal constitutional claims, however, fail to state a claim for relief and are therefore\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Americans with Disabilities Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to state a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability on account of or because of that individual's disability: \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012132\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"To establish a violation of [the ADA, the plaintiff] must show that: (1) [Dr. Knouse was] a qualified individual with a disability, (2) [he] was discriminated against, excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of a public entity's services, programs, or activities; and (3) the discrimination, exclusion, or denial of benefits was because of [his] disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, the plaintiff failed to allege that Dr. Knouse was a qualified individual under the Act. While the plaintiff did make the conclusory statement that \"[t]he decedent\n   was a disabled person as defined in the [Act],\" the plaintiff did not state any factual matter showing that this was the case, and the court is \"not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, as noted by the defendants, the plaintiff failed to allege any factual matter stating that the defendants discriminated against Dr. Knouse\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   his disability. The causation element is missing. Count IX is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    4. West Virginia State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the West Virginia state law claims against the Prison Defendants are dismissed. Including the Prison Defendants, the plaintiff has named three entities and seven individuals as defendants in this lawsuit-ten defendants and ten counts, most asserting multiple legal grounds. As the defendants point out, the Complaint fails to \"give the defendant[s] fair notice of what the ... claim[s against each defendant are] and the grounds upon which [they] rest[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Complaint refers numerously to the defendants in a plural sense as it makes formulaic recitations of the elements of the causes of action (if and when the complaint actually lists the relevant elements). A court cannot accept as true legal conclusions that merely recite the elements of a cause of action supported by conclusory statements. The Complaint fails to state enough factual matter, accepted as true, to bring the defendants' conduct within the scope of the many tort and state constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 677-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Complaint uses a \"shotgun pleading\" approach.
