The defendants were in two categories: (1) the DOC Defendants and (2) the Medical Defendants. The DOC Defendants include the DOC, Thomas Turco,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carol Higgins O'Brien, Stephanie Collins, Pamela MacEachern, Michael Rodrigues, and Sheila Kelly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Medical Defendants have settled with the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Plaintiff has been incarcerated since 1996 and is serving a life sentence in the Massachusetts DOC. He has been a quadriplegic throughout his incarceration and is hearing impaired. The relevant institutions where Plaintiff has been housed for purposes of this action are Bridgewater State Hospital (\"Bridgewater\") from 2011 through 2014, Souza Baranowski Correction Center (\"Souza Baranowski\") from 2014 until 2016, and the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Shirley (\"MCI Shirley\") from 2016 until present. During Plaintiff's incarceration his health has significantly decreased. He can no longer brush his teeth, feed himself, sit in a wheelchair, and showers on a stretcher,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff has alleged the following counts: failure to provide adequate medical care in violation of the 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment (Count I) and Article 26 Of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Count II); reasonable accommodations in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Count III), the Rehabilitation Act (Count IV) and Article 114 (Count V); unlawful conditions of confinement in violation of the 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment (Count VI) and Article 26 of the Declaration of Rights (Count VII); failure to protect in violation of the 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment (Count VIII) and Article 26 (Count IX); and violation of Plaintiff's due process rights provided by the 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment (X) and Articles 1, 10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights (Count XI); intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count XIV); and violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (\"MCRA\") (Count XII). Both parties have filed motions\n   for summary judgment, discussed below with the exception of Count XII, which Plaintiff's concedes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Defendants motion for summary judgment as to the Count XII is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a motion for summary judgment it is the moving party's burden to show an absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact on the record.\n   <em>\n    DeNovellis v.

Defendants argue instead that Plaintiff has failed to show that the Defendants knowingly disregarded or failed to provide available remedies because they lacked the responsibility to intervene in a meaningful way. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prison officials are not be relieved of a duty to provide adequate medical care by contracting that responsibility out to private medical vendors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West v.

The DOC has the authority and the obligation to ensure contract compliance by the medical providers with regards to the adequacy of their care. Specifically, Collins, as the Associate Deputy Commissioner of Clinical Services, oversees the medical services through regular meetings, audits, review of records, and may impose sanctions to remedy services deemed to be inadequate compared to\n   community standards of care. Furthermore, the record shows that she was aware of, and involved in the requested accommodations and grievances filed by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soneeya v.

For example, the record shows that Plaintiff is not being provided adequate range of motion therapy or as often as he should. There are inconsistencies with the documentation of when Plaintiff is being provided therapy as well as his \"refusal\" of therapy. It appears that Plaintiff has refused range of motion therapy because the DOC denied his request to be given therapy after his bath when he is clean. Additionally, since the entry of a preliminary injunction in July of 2016, the Plaintiff has seen a spinal cord specialist only twice, the Plaintiff appears to continue to be in chronic constipation with no bowel management plan or system in place regarding emergency response in the event Plaintiff suffers from autonomic dysreflexia, and the Plaintiff does not have working hearing aids. This absence of care as opposed to a dispute regarding two or more choices of care supports this claim against the DOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's condition and overall health has significantly declined and there is evidence to support a link between this decline and the alleged inadequate care. The DOC has been aware of these issues including the lack of medically necessary treatment plans mentioned above since at least the filing of this action in 2015. For all of these reasons, I find that there are triable issues as to the DOC's deliberate indifference and decline to grant summary judgment as to Counts I and II for either Party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Qualified Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because the Plaintiffs have confirmed that they are only seeking injunctive relief for Counts I and II, qualified immunity is not available as a defense.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Accommodations (&amp; Disability Discrimination) Counts III, IV &amp; V\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The record supports a reasonable conclusion that MacEachern, Rodrigues, and Morin were aware of the Plaintiff's significant limitations and failed to provide reasonable accommodations at Bridgewater, Souza Baranowski, and Shirley. \"The\n   ADA, the RA, and art. 114 of the Massachusetts Constitution all prohibit the same conduct: disabled persons may not be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities, and they may not be subjected to discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Shedlock v.

The record shows that specific written requests are not required for the DOC to make accommodations when such accommodations are obvious. Additionally, verbal requests for accommodations are permitted. The Plaintiff's disability is obvious and the record shows that the DOC Defendants were aware of it. Furthermore, the characteristics of Plaintiff's disability is such that he is dependent on prison officials and providers to physically get anywhere. It follows that the DOC was aware of the fact that Plaintiff had not been given access to at least some of these accommodations because the DOC Defendants had not transported him to them. Additionally, the record shows that Plaintiff made numerous verbal and written requests at different times in the various facilities. For example, at Bridgewater he filed written requests concerning programming and hearing accommodations and verbally requested to be brought outside. At Souza Baranowski he filed a written request for access outside, referencing his denial of such access for years, and requested a shower in a shower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To the extent that Defendants argue that Plaintiff was not discriminated against at Souza Baranowski based on his denial of access to services and programs, I disagree. Plaintiff was placed in the health services unit because of his disability. In contrast to the typical inmates housed there temporarily, Plaintiff was there indefinitely. I am unpersuaded by the Defendants attempt to shield themselves from liability for discrimination by\n   comparing apples and oranges. It is one thing to limit or deny access to services and programs for a temporary period of time and another to deny access to such activities indefinitely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Defendants also argue that Plaintiff has been offered certain accommodations and has either denied them and/or that his requested accommodations are not feasible. There is no dispute that the Plaintiff has been disrespectful and difficult towards prison officials. While recognizing the challenges to the DOC, I find that it is arguable that the Plaintiff's denials support a conclusion that the accommodations were not meaningful offers because they resulted in unnecessary hardship to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shedlock v.

Furthermore, while the denial of the limited privileges Plaintiff has access to create a hardship on Plaintiff, the DOC must be able to discipline the Plaintiff somehow for inappropriate behavior.
