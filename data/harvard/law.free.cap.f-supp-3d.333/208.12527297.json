BIANCO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff M. Norman Donnenfeld (\"Donnenfeld\" or \"plaintiff\") brings this putative class action against defendant Petro, Inc. (\"Petro\" or \"defendant\"), a home heating oil provider, for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, fraudulent inducement, and violations of New York's General Business Law and other state consumer protection laws. Presently before the Court is Petro's motion to dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint in its entirety. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the motion as to plaintiff's claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and fraudulent inducement, but otherwise denies it. The Court will grant plaintiff leave to re-plead the fraudulent inducement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from the First Amended Class Action Complaint. (ECF No. 20.) The Court assumes these facts to be true in deciding the motion to dismiss, and construes them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petro is a home heating oil provider that operates in several states, including New York. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 16, 21-23.) Petro offers three pricing plans to its home heating oil customers: variable, ceiling, and\n   fixed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 24.) These pricing plans are described on Petro's website as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Variable Plan\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Variable Plan has an attractive rate that fluctuates up and down with market conditions. There are no price protective cost or termination fees associated with this plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Fixed Plan\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Our Fixed Plan requires a 1-year commitment to Petro. The oil price remains the same for every delivery, for every gallon throughout the year, regardless of market conditions. Petro pre-purchases all of your oil and assumes all risk, so if you terminate your account prior to the expiration of your contract, an early termination fee of $599.00 will be assessed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The Petro Ceiling Plan\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Many customers feel this plan is a better option than the fixed price plan as it gives you a limit on how high your price can go and hopefully take advantage of lower prices in the future. The price will trend up or down based on market conditions at the time each delivery is made but will never exceed a set limit. A 1-year commitment to Petro is required for this plan. Similar to the fixed plan, Petro protects the cost of your oil and assumes all risk, so if you terminate your account prior to the expiration of your contract, an early termination fee of $399.00 will be assessed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 7, 2013, Donnenfeld entered into a fixed price Retail Fuel Delivery and Services Agreement with Petro (\"the Fixed Price Contract\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, Ex. A.) Under that contract, Petro agreed to deliver home heating oil to Donnenfeld at a fixed price of $3.649 per gallon for the approximately one-year period from August 7, 2013 to August 31, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 1.) In return, Donnenfeld agreed to obtain home heating oil exclusively from Petro during that period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The contract provided that, if Donnenfeld's account was \"cancelled for any reason\" during the one-year period, he would \"be charged a $599.00 early termination fee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In connection with entering into the Fixed Price Contract, Donnenfeld received, among other documents, Petro's Terms and Conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Those Terms and Conditions included a \"Limits of Liability\" provision, which provided that \"[a]ny and all actions, whether based in contract or tort, whether for personal injury or property damage, and whether brought by buyer or buyer's insurance company, must be commenced within one year of the cause of action or shall be barred as a matter of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 30, 2014, Donnenfeld continued his Fixed Price Contract for another year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) That agreement was memorialized in a form letter to Donnenfeld from Mike Perna, the President and General Manager of Petro's Plainview, New York office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B.) The phrase \"A note of thanks for renewing your contract with Petro\" appeared at the top of the letter, and the first sentence read, \"Thank you so much for renewing your heating oil agreement with Petro!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter provided that, for the approximately one-year period from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015, Petro would deliver home heating oil to Donnenfeld at a $3.699 per gallon fixed price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It further provided that Donnenfeld agreed to obtain home heating oil exclusively from Petro during that period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter also stated that, if Donnenfeld's account was \"cancelled for any reason\" during the one-year period, he would be charged a $599.00 early termination fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Donnenfeld alleges that heating oil prices dropped significantly shortly after he agreed to continue his Fixed Price Contract with Petro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Based on Petro's representations that, under their ceiling plan, the price he paid for heating oil would be based on market conditions, Donnenfeld determined that he would save money by entering into a ceiling price contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, in December 2014, several months before his current contract was due to expire, Donnenfeld called Mike Perna to change to a ceiling price plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To make that change, Petro charged Donnenfeld-and Donnenfeld paid-a $300 early termination fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Donnenfeld then received a form letter from Mike Perna \"confirm[ing] [the] phone conversation\" and \"outlin[ing] the terms of [the] ceiling price agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C (the \"Ceiling Price Contract\").) As with the previous letter, the phrase \"A note of thanks for renewing your contract with Petro\" appeared at the top of this letter, and the first sentence again read, \"Thank you so much for renewing your heating oil agreement with Petro!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter stated that, for the approximately one-year period from December 5, 2014 to December 31, 2015, Petro would deliver home heating oil to Donnenfeld at a price that would \"not exceed $2.899 per gallon,\" but that Donnenfeld's \"actual delivered price ... w[ould] vary based on market conditions, including but not limited to, product availability, wholesale cost and other factors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Like the previous contracts, the letter provided that Donnenfeld agreed to obtain home heating oil exclusively from Petro during the relevant one-year period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the letter stated that, \"with [Donnenfeld's] permission, [Petro] recorded the conversation detailing the terms of this Ceiling Price agreement, and w[ould] retain a copy of that recording for [Donnenfeld's] protection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Donnenfeld alleges that, despite a steady decline in oil prices throughout the term of his Ceiling Price Contract, his \"price per gallon did not budge after the first two months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) He alleges that \"Petro has an unstated policy or practice of unilaterally and without justification, not reducing the per gallon price to customers who have entered into a Petro ceiling plan agreement, even as oil prices fall, and instead, charge Petro ceiling plan customers the top of the ceiling price per gallon on a regular basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Donnenfeld originally filed this lawsuit against Petro on February 18, 2016, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. On May 9, 2016, Petro moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. In opposing the motion, Donnenfeld argued that, if the court found personal jurisdiction over Petro lacking, it should transfer the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Donnenfeld also requested leave to amend the complaint if the court determined that his pleadings were otherwise deficient. Petro argued in its reply that the interests of justice favored dismissal rather than transfer, and that Donnenfeld had failed to identify any special circumstances warranting transfer rather than dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 24, 2017, the district court dismissed plaintiff's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over Petro and, alternatively, for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donnenfeld v. Petro Home Servs.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 16-882,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201250992\">\n    2017 WL 1250992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Mar. 24, 2017). The court declined to transfer the case to the Eastern District of New York, concluding that Donnenfeld had not established that the\n   case was filed in the wrong venue or \"address[ed] any of the personal or public interest factors that a court must consider when deciding whether to transfer a case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201250992\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *4 n.2. The court did, however, grant Donnenfeld leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rather than submit an amended complaint in the District of New Jersey, Donnenfeld filed a complaint in this Court on April 18, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) On July 31, 2017, Petro moved to dismiss. (ECF No. 17.) In response, Donnenfeld filed the First Amended Class Action Complaint. (ECF No. 20.) On September 15, 2017, Petro moved to dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint. (ECF No. 23.) Donnenfeld opposed the motion on October 20, 2017. (ECF No. 26.) Petro filed a reply in further support of its motion on November 10, 2017. (ECF No. 27.) The Court heard oral argument on January 18, 2018. On January 22, 2018, Donnenfeld filed a letter supplementing his opposition to the motion to dismiss. (ECF No. 31.) Petro submitted a response to that letter on January 25, 2018. (ECF No. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court has fully considered the parties' submissions and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A. Contractual Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Petro argues that the complaint should be dismissed as untimely under the one-year statute of limitations contained in the Terms and Conditions that were enclosed with Donnenfeld's initial Fixed Price Contract. As noted above, the \"Limits of Liability\" provision contained in those Terms and Conditions provided that \"[a]ny and all actions, whether based in contract or tort, whether for personal injury or property damage, and whether brought by buyer or buyer's insurance company, must be commenced within one year of the cause of action or shall be barred as a matter of law.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. A at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties dispute whether the Terms and Conditions, which were provided to Donnenfeld only with his Fixed Price Contract, apply to the Ceiling Price Contract. Petro relies on language in the Terms and Conditions that defines the parties' \"Agreement\" to include \"the Price Plan, these terms and conditions and\n   <em>\n    any agreed renewal terms\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) It asserts that the Ceiling Price Contract was a renewal of the Fixed Price Contract, and that the Terms and Conditions therefore continued to apply. To support the assertion that the Ceiling Price Contract was a renewal, Petro points to the language in the form letter from Mike Perna thanking Donnenfeld for \"renewing [his] contract with Petro.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For his part, Donnenfeld argues that the Ceiling Price Contract was an entirely new contract, and that the Fixed Price Contract was terminated. Because the Terms and Conditions were not provided to Donnenfeld in connection with the Ceiling Price Contract, Donnenfeld argues they do not apply to that contract. As explained below, the Court concludes that these issues cannot be decided on this motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under New York law, \"a novation is a new contract replacing and extinguishing a prior contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Gem Glob.

App'x 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, there is a sufficient basis for Donnenfeld to plausibly assert that the parties' intentions are not manifest on the face of the agreement. The terms of the Ceiling Price Contract are silent as to whether that agreement was intended to extinguish, supersede, substitute, modify, or have any other effect on the Fixed Price Contract. It also does not state that Petro's Terms and Conditions would continue to apply; nor does it incorporate any Terms and Conditions by reference. Petro makes much of this confirmation letter's use of the word \"renewal\" at the top of the letter and in its first sentence. The Court is not persuaded that that usage is necessarily conclusive evidence of the parties' intentions, particularly because the letter references an earlier telephone conversation and is a confirmation letter that Donnenfeld did not sign. Accordingly, the Court cannot ascertain the parties' intentions as a matter of law on this motion to dismiss, and the parties should be given the opportunity to present extrinsic evidence to establish intent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.S. Am. (E.), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7846514\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/873/786/#p794\">\n    873 F.Supp. at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying motion to dismiss because parties' intention as to whether subsequent agreement acted as a novation could not be determined as a matter of law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, construing the language most favorably to Donnenfeld, there is a plausible argument that the Ceiling Price Contract is incomplete. It does not contain a merger clause, and expressly refers to the telephone conversation between Donnenfeld and Mike Perna. Presumably, the recording of that conversation will illuminate the parties' intentions as to the effect of the $300 early termination fee and the execution of the Ceiling Price Contract. It will also likely reveal any discussions about the terms and conditions that applied to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In short, Donnenfeld plausibly alleges that the Ceiling Price Contract replaced the Fixed Price Contract such that dismissal of the claims as untimely at this stage is unwarranted. Specifically, Donnenfeld alleges that he entered into the Fixed Price Contract with Petro in August 2013, which he renewed in July 2014. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) He further alleges that he paid a $300 fee to terminate the Fixed Price Contract before its expiration, and entered into a new contract with Petro-the Ceiling Price Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) These allegations are sufficient, at the motion to dismiss stage, to plausibly allege that the Ceiling Price Contract extinguished the Fixed Price Contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schuster v. Dragone Classic Motor Cars, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11508147\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/98/441/#p446\">\n    98 F.Supp.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    City of Amsterdam v.

Breach of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To state a claim for breach of contract under New York law, a complaint must allege four elements: \"(1) the existence of an agreement, (2) adequate performance of the contract by plaintiff, (3) breach of the contract by defendant, and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Eternity Glob. Master Fund Ltd. v. Morgan Guar. Tr. Co. of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373816\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/168/#p187\">\n    375 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (2d Cir. 2004). Petro moves to dismiss Donnenfeld's breach of contract claim for failure to plausibly allege the third element-that Petro breached the Ceiling Price Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Donnenfeld's breach of contract claim centers on Petro's contractual representation that his \"actual delivered price ... w[ould] vary based on market conditions, including but not limited to, product availability, wholesale cost and other factors.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. C.) In short, Donnenfeld contends that Petro breached the Ceiling Price Contract by charging him prices that did not vary based on market conditions. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 30, 92-96.) To support this contention, Donnenfeld alleges that, other than for the first two months of the contract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petro consistently charged him the $2.899 per gallon ceiling price for his heating oil throughout the contract's term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) He further alleges that Petro did so despite a steady drop in crude oil prices during the relevant period (\n   <em>\n    e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38), and despite the fact that Petro's \"spot market price available to its customers\n   as a function of market price was below plaintiff's ceiling price and below the price defendant continued to charge the plaintiff\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 43). Donnenfeld also alleges that Petro quoted his son a $2.35 per gallon ceiling price in early December 2015, but charged Donnenfeld his contractual $2.899 per gallon ceiling price that month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Finally, Donnenfeld alleges that his daughter, who was a party to a ceiling price agreement with a different home heating oil provider in the region, was charged steadily decreasing prices during the relevant period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Petro asserts that these allegations fail to establish that Donnenfeld's delivered price did not vary based on \"market conditions\" including the factors identified in the Ceiling Price Contract as affecting those conditions-namely, \"product availability, wholesale costs, and other factors.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. C.) The Court concludes, however, that these allegations are sufficient to state a plausible breach of contract claim that survives a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Several courts in this district and others have allowed breach of contract claims involving similar contractual language and supporting factual allegations to proceed past motions to dismiss. In\n   <em>\n    Oladapo v. Smart One Energy, LLC\n   </em>\n   , for example, the at-issue contract provided that the plaintiff's monthly gas prices would be determined by the defendant \"at its sole discretion, in response to changing gas market conditions.\" No. 14 CV 7117-LTS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20344976\">\n    2016 WL 344976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2016). The plaintiff argued that the defendant breached the contract by charging prices unrelated to gas market conditions, as supported by the allegations that the gas rates charged to the plaintiff increased despite declines in gas prices in the marketplace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court denied a motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. It concluded that the contract was \"susceptible, when read in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, to interpretation as an undertaking to set prices in a manner reflective of actual gas market prices,\" and that plaintiff's allegations were \"sufficient, at the pleading stage, to support an inference of breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Yang Chen v. Hiko Energy, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the at-issue contract provided that the plaintiffs' monthly gas and electricity charges would reflect wholesale costs and other \"market-related factors.\" No. 14 CV 1771 VB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207389011\">\n    2014 WL 7389011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 29, 2014). The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant breached the contract by charging rates that did not reflect wholesale costs and \"other market related factors,\" based on the alleged fact that the prices charged by the defendant were higher than a competitor's prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court concluded that those allegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Mirkin v.

Conn. July 5, 2016). The plaintiff's breach of contract claim alleged that the defendant \"did not actually base its rates on those conditions, as demonstrated by the failure of the charged rates to track wholesale market rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court concluded that such allegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court reaches the same conclusion here. Petro represented that Donnenfeld's monthly price would be \"based on market conditions ... including but not limited to, product availability, wholesale cost and other factors.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. C.) This language, when read in the light most favorable to Donnenfeld, can be readily interpreted as a promise that Donnenfeld's price would decline when market prices did. The allegations briefly detailed above are sufficient, at this stage, to plausibly allege a breach of that promise.

Compl. \u00b6 4.) Donnenfeld asserts that this statement constituted a misrepresentation that ceiling price plan customers would save money on home heating oil if market prices fell, which induced him to enter into the Ceiling Price Contract. These alleged misrepresentations are the same contractual representations that Donnenfeld alleges Petro breached-namely, that, under a ceiling\n   price plan, his oil prices would decline with market conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In his opposition, Donnenfeld additionally argues that Petro employees, including Mike Perna, made oral misrepresentations during telephone calls. However, plaintiff's only allegations to that effect are entirely conclusory. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5 (\"[Representatives of Petro advise customers ... both orally and in writing that ceiling price customers will reap the benefits when market rates fall.\").) These vague allegations do not satisfy Rule 9(b), and thus cannot salvage the fraudulent inducement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the fraudulent inducement claim is granted. Because the Court does not believe that a claim for fraudulent inducement would necessarily be futile, however, it will grant plaintiff an opportunity to amend the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   F.

A failure to do so will result in a dismissal of that claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The term \"renewal\" is not defined in any of the written agreements. To the extent Petro relies on the legal meaning of that term, courts have defined that term differently than Petro does here. For example, as one court explained, \"[r]enewal normally involves 'a continuation of the relationship on essentially the same terms and conditions as the original contract.' \"\n    <em>\n     D.S. Am. (E.), Inc. v. Chromagrafx Imaging Sys., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7846514\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/873/786/#p794\">\n     873 F.Supp. 786\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 794 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Williams Petroleum Co. v. Midland Coops., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"552736\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/815/#p819\">\n     679 F.2d 815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 819 (10th Cir. 1982) ). Here, the Ceiling Price Contract involved substantially different terms from the Fixed Price Contract. Thus, any legal meaning of the word \"renewal\" does not unambiguously support Petro's position.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Donnenfeld also argues that the contractually shortened statute of limitations is unenforceable and, in any event, does not apply to these claims. He further argues that, even if the one-year limitations period does apply, it should be equitably tolled. Because the Court cannot determine on this motion whether the provision even applied to the Ceiling Price Contract, it does not reach these additional arguments at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Petro makes much of the allegation that it charged Donnenfeld less than the ceiling price for the first two months of the contract. That allegation, however, does not foreclose the claim that Petro breached the contract in those months or in the remaining months.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Some courts have dismissed similar breach of contract claims.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Windley v. Starion Energy, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 14 cv 9053,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20197503\">\n     2016 WL 197503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2016). As explained in\n    <em>\n     Oladapo\n    </em>\n    , those cases involved contracts with \"discretionary language alone or in combination with references to numerous factors other than market prices.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20344976\">\n     2016 WL 344976\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1. Here, all of the factors listed in the Ceiling Price Contract are market-related. Donnenfeld's allegations that his prices did not vary with market prices are accordingly sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Although this claim is entitled \"Fraudulent Concealment/Nondisclosure\" in the complaint, the allegations center on inducement. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Am. Compl. \u00b6 77 (\"These statements were made with the intent to induce customers, such as Donnenfeld, and did induce him to switch from the Fixed Price Plan to the Ceiling Price Plan.\").) Moreover, the parties' briefing on the motion to dismiss focuses on fraudulent inducement. The Court analyzes the claim accordingly.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Petro argues that Donnenfeld should not be given an additional opportunity to amend this claim because the claim was previously dismissed with leave to re-plead in the District of New Jersey. As discussed above, that opinion focused primarily on personal jurisdiction. Moreover, it did not specifically address any deficiencies in the fraudulent inducement claim. Accordingly, the Court disagrees that Donnenfeld should not be given an opportunity to amend the claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
