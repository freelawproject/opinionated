(\u201cOlympia\u201d), appeals the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of appellee First Nationwide Bank (\u201cFirst Nationwide\u201d) on its cross-claim in the amount of $1,219,779.51, the unpaid balance due on Olympia\u2019s promissory note, and a foreclosure upon the real property securing the note. Olympia also appeals the award of attorney fees for First Nationwide\u2019s legal efforts in obtaining the judgment and effecting foreclosure proceedings. Olympia argues that there were material issues of fact arising from its claims that First Nationwide\u2019s earlier acceptance of late installment payments on the note operated as an estoppel or waiver of subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>defaults, and that First Nationwide acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d in failing to give reasonable time to cure the defaults and in failing to properly account for proceeds of a trust account applied to the partial satisfaction of the note. Olympia also claims that attorney fees were improperly awarded because the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d does not permit the prevailing party to recover attorney fees in the absence of statutory authorization despite a contractual provision allowing same. For the reasons hereinafter discussed, we find that summary judgment was properly granted and we affirm the judgment below in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This case originated on February 4, 1987, when the Treasurer of Cuyahoga County filed a complaint for collection of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties and interest, foreclosure and equitable relief against Olympia and other interested defendants, including First Nationwide, mortgagee of the real property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">First Nationwide filed its initial answer on March 30, 1987 and an amended answer and cross-claim on January 29, 1988, respectively. First Nationwide subsequently filed its second amended answer and cross-claim against Olympia on December 4, 1989. First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim sought judgment on the Olympia note and foreclosure of the mortgage securing the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">On February 12, 1990, Olympia filed its answer to the second amended cross-claim and admitted the execution and delivery of the note, the mortgage and other loan documents evidencing the debt, the security and Olympia\u2019s obligation thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">On October 18, 1990, First Nationwide filed its motion for summary judgment on the second amended cross-claim. Following briefing by the parties, on April 30, 1991, the trial court granted First Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">After further briefing on damage issues raised by Olympia, on November 15, 1991 the trial court entered an amended judgment entry in favor of First Nationwide in the amount of $1,177,301.21, together with statutory interest plus attorney fees and costs to be determined at a subsequent hearing. First Nationwide and Olympia subsequently reached an agreement and executed an agreed judgment entry stipulating $32,500 as the amount of attorney fees and costs which was entered on December 3, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">On December 16, 1991, cross-defendants-appellants Olympia and Dan Horwitz, Trustee, filed separate notices of appeal. On April 8, 1992, this court ordered case Nos. 62936 and 62937 consolidated for record, briefing, hearing and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The facts relating to this appeal are primarily contained in the voluminous exhibits attached to First Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Olympia\u2019s brief in opposition to same.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">On December 28, 1979, First Nationwide<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purchased from the city of Solon, Ohio an \u201cindustrial development first mortgage revenue note\u201d (hereinafter \u201cnote\u201d) in the amount of $1,400,000. Solon then loaned the proceeds to Olympia Associates under a loan agreement pursuant to which Olympia Associates agreed to pay the note in accordance with its terms. In order to secure its obligations under the loan agreement, on the same date, Olympia Associates also executed and delivered an \u201copen end mortgage and security agreement\u201d (\u201cmortgage\u201d). Solon concurrently executed and delivered to First Nationwide an assignment of all of its right, title and interest in the loan agreement and mortgage. These documents were filed with the Cuyahoga County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On December 28, 1979, Olympia Associates and First Nationwide also entered into an agreement pursuant to which Olympia Associates unconditionally guaranteed payment of the note in full (\u201cguarantee agreement\u201d). In order to secure its obligations to First Nationwide under the guarantee agreement, Olympia Associates simultaneously executed and delivered to First Nationwide an \u201copen end mortgage and security agreement\u201d (\u201cguarantee mortgage\u201d), which was recorded with the Cuyahoga County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">On December 28, 1979, Dan Horwitz, trustee, also deposited $100,000 with First Nationwide pursuant to a pledge agreement which granted power of attorney to First Nationwide to withdraw and apply the aforementioned $100,000 from the trust account to payment of principal and interest upon Olympia Associates\u2019 default under the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">By deeds dated November 3, 1983, Olympia Associates transferred its mortgaged property to cross-defendant-appellant Olympia. In connection with the transfer of the mortgaged property, Olympia Associates, First Nationwide and Olympia entered into an \u201cassumption agreement without release of the original borrower\u201d (\u201cassumption agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Olympia expressly assumed and agreed to pay the unpaid principal balance of the note, together with interest due and owing. The deeds and assumption agreement were recorded with the Cuyahoga County Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The mortgage and guarantee mortgage both contain the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cAs security * * * [Olympia] does hereby * * * mortgage * * * all of the real properties * * * described * * * in Exhibit A attached [to the Mortgage and Guarantee Mortgage respectively] * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cAs further security [Olympia] does hereby grant a security interest in * * * and set over unto [First Nationwide] the additional real and personal property of [Olympia] * * * described in Exhibit B attached * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201cUpon the occurrence of any such Event of Default which has not been timely cured, * * * the balance of the Loan Payments with accrued interest shall * * * upon declaration to such effect delivered by [First Nationwide to Olympia] become and be immediately due and payable * * *. Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default [First Nationwide] may exercise [its right to] proceed to protect and enforce its rights under this Mortgage * * * by a suit in equity * * * for any foreclosure hereunder * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u201cEvent of default\u201d is defined in both the mortgage and the guarantee mortgage to include the failure to make full and prompt payment of the principal and interest on the note when due.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">On November 1, 1988, Olympia stopped making the loan payments required under the note. Pursuant to the note, mortgage and guarantee mortgage, First Nationwide had the right upon default in such payments to accelerate and call due the balance of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Because Olympia had failed to make any loan payments since November 1988, First Nationwide filed its second amended cross-claim against Olympia on December 4, 1989. First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim sought judgment on the full balance of the note outstanding and sought foreclosure of the mortgage on the scheduled properties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court granted summary judgment in favor of First Nationwide on November 15, 1991 and subsequently awarded attorney fees and costs, from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">We address Olympia\u2019s assignments of error in the order presented.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">\u201cI. The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant Olympia Fitness Center, Inc. by granting summary judgment [in favor of] defendantappellee First Nationwide Bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In order to sustain summary judgment on its second amended cross-claim against Olympia, First Nationwide had the burden of establishing, through proper evidentiary materials, that there was no genuine issue of material fact, that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that the evidence viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, would lead reasonable minds to but one conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Allen v. R.G. Indus. Supply </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 229, 234, 611 N.E.2d 794, 799. An analysis of the evidence before the trial court demonstrates that First Nationwide met its burden and that its motion for summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On October 13, 1990, First Nationwide filed its motion seeking summary judgment on its December 4, 1989 second amended cross-claim. The motion was properly supported by Olympia\u2019s answer, which admitted the execution, delivery, filing and recording of the note, mortgage and relevant loan documents. The affidavit of First Nationwide\u2019s loan person, Erma J. O\u2019Brien, further established that Olympia was in default on its monthly principal and interest payments since November 1, 1988 and that the unpaid balance due on Olympia\u2019s Note was $1,219,799.51 plus interest at 8.5 percent per annum from November 1, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As previously noted, the note and mortgage define \u201cevent of default\u201d to include the failure to make full and prompt payment of the principal and interest on the note when due, giving First Nationwide the right to accelerate and declare the entire balance due and owing and foreclose on the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Under Ohio law, once a default in payment has occurred under the terms of a note, and once the note has been accelerated, the holder of the note is entitled to judgment. <em>King v. Safford </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 587; <em>Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. v. Curtis </em>(1880), 35 Ohio St. 357; <em>Bradfield v. Hale </em>(1902), 67 Ohio St. 316, 65 N.E. 1008; <em>Evilsizor v. Speckbaugh </em>(App.1949), 55 Ohio Law Abs. 353, 88 N.E.2d 296. See, also, <em>McClelland v. Bishop </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 113; <em>Rinehart v. Connecticut Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(App.1931), 10 Ohio Law Abs. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">First Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment and supporting documentation established <em>prima facie </em>all of the elements of its second amended cross-claim for judgment on the note and foreclosure on the property securing the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In opposing First Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Olympia could not rest upon its pleadings or allegations, but had to produce evidence showing genuine issues of material fact. Civ.R. 56(E). Mere conclusory and unsupported allegations do not satisfy this burden. <em>Mathis v. Cleveland Pub. Library </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 199, 202, 9 OBR 511, 514-515, 459 N.E.2d 877, 880; <em>Stibora v. Greater Cleveland Bowling Assn. </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 107, 113, 577 N.E.2d 1175, 1178-1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Olympia did not produce any evidence to controvert the material facts establishing First Nationwide\u2019s right to summary judgment on its second amended cross-claim. Significantly, Olympia did not dispute its failure to make loan payments since November 1988 and it did not deny that it was in default of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>loan obligations. Furthermore, Olympia did not present any evidence to dispute the balance due and owing to First Nationwide based on the O\u2019Brien affidavit and the supporting loan history.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Although Olympia did not dispute the material facts establishing First Nationwide\u2019s prima facie right to judgment and foreclosure, it, nevertheless, argued that factual issues relating to certain affirmative defenses precluded the entry of summary judgment. Olympia specifically argued then, and argues now, that the defenses of waiver, estoppel and \u201cbad faith\u201d bar First Nationwide from recovering on its second amended cross-claim, and the existence of genuine issues of material fact relating to these defenses, rendered summary judgment improper. These factual defenses may be briefly described as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">1. First Nationwide\u2019s previous acceptance of late loan payments from Olympia during earlier defaults;</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">2. First Nationwide\u2019s failure to provide Olympia with a reasonable time to \u201ccure\u201d its defaults; or permit Olympia to seek alternative financing;</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">3. First Nationwide\u2019s filing and subsequent refusal to dismiss its January 1988 cross-claim after Olympia \u201ccured\u201d all of the deficiencies First Nationwide requested and upon which First Nationwide\u2019s 1988 default notice and cross-claim were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">4. First Nationwide\u2019s failure to properly account for the application or disposition of the trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">We will address each of these contentions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">1. First Nationwide\u2019s Past Acceptance Of Late Loan Payments</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Olympia claims that First Nationwide \u201cregularly accepted\u201d late loan payments and therefore waived, or is estopped from pursuing, the default and foreclosure remedies it sought. Olympia cites its loan payment history, which shows that between October 1, 1983 and November 16, 1987, First Nationwide accepted payments which were made an average of sixty-two days past their scheduled due dates. Olympia further relies on First Nationwide\u2019s acceptance of thirteen additional loan payments after the filing of First Nationwide\u2019s January 29, 1988 cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">Even if these facts are assumed to be true, they do not deprive First Nationwide of its right to summary judgment as they are immaterial to First Nationwide\u2019s December 4,1989 second amended cross-claim and do not support a waiver or estoppel defense as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">It is true that First Nationwide\u2019s acceptance of the late loan payments preNovember 1988 may have operated as a waiver of First Nationwide\u2019s right to pursue remedies based upon defaults which those payments were aimed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201ccure.\u201d However, First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim was based on defaults occurring <em>since </em>November 1988, not the prior \u201ccured\u201d defaults. It is undisputed that Olympia made no payments <em>for </em>periods<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after November 1,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Olympia\u2019s brief does not dispute, and as its loan payment history confirms, that Olympia made its last loan payment to First Nationwide in November 1988. First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim was filed a full year <em>after </em>Olympia\u2019s last loan payments and the motion for summary judgment was filed almost two years <em>after </em>the last payment. The fact that First Nationwide accepted late loan payments earlier is not material to First Nationwide\u2019s right to judgment on its second amended cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">First Nationwide\u2019s past acceptance of late loan payment through November 1988 does not, as a matter of law, constitute a waiver- or estoppel from asserting its right to accelerate the note and foreclose on Olympia\u2019s loan and mortgaged property as a result of Olympia\u2019s subsequent default in making loan payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">All of the loan documents upon which First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim and motion were based included \u201canti-waiver\u201d provisions similar to that set forth in \u00a7 6.3 of the guarantee agreement. This section states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201cNo delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default * * * shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, and any such right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient * * *. In the event any provision contained in this Agreement shall be breached by any party and thereafter duly waived by the other party * * * such waiver shall be limited to the particular breach so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other breach hereunder. No waiver, amendment, release or modification of this Agreement shall be established by conduct, custom or course of dealing, but solely by an instrument in writing duly executed by the parties hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">To the same effect, see mortgage, Article Fifteenth; guarantee mortgage, Article Fourteenth. These are customary provisions in loan agreements to allow <em>ad hoc </em>acceptance of late or delinquent payments without establishing a continuing waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">It has been consistently held that a mortgagee\u2019s past acceptance of late loan payments does not constitute a waiver of the mortgagee\u2019s right to accelerate and foreclose on a loan following a subsequent default where the relevant loan documents contain \u201canti-waiver\u201d provisions similar to those in the loan documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>in this case. See, <em>e.g., Philmon v. Mid-State Homes, Inc. </em>(1968), 245 Ark. 680, 484 S.W.2d 84; <em>McCool v. Decatur Cty. Bank of Greensburg </em>(Ind.App.1985), 480 N.E.2d 596; <em>Kirkham v. Hansen </em>(Me.1990), 583 A.2d 1026; <em>First Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Stone </em>(Ind.App.1984), 467 N.E.2d 1226; <em>Postal S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Freel </em>(1984), 10 Kan.App.2d 286, 698 P.2d 382. See, also, <em>Farm Credit Serv. v. Will </em>(July 17, 1991), Medina App. No. 1870, unreported, 1991 WL 131490; <em>Frank B. Thomas Trust v. Imperial 100 Natl., Inc. </em>(Mar. 28, 1990), Summit App. No. 14202, unreported, 1990 WL 34872.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Appellant cites <em>Westinghouse Credit Corp. v. Shelton </em>(C.A.10, 1981), 645 F.2d 869, in an effort to convince this court that this should not be the law in Ohio. <em>Westinghouse Credit </em>is, however, readily distinguishable from this case as it did not involve the foreclosure on real property and is based upon the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), which has no application to transactions involving real property. See R.C. 1309.04(1) (expressly excluding real property transactions from coverage under Ohio\u2019s adaptation of the UCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">First Nationwide\u2019s acceptance of late loan payments at an earlier date is not material to its right to insist on prompt and timely payment at a later date where the loan documents themselves make clear there has been no waiver. Therefore, the trial court properly rejected Olympia\u2019s \u201cpast payment/waiver\u201d defense to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">2. Olympia\u2019s Claim That First Nationwide Failed to Give it Time to Cure its Default</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Olympia also claims that First Nationwide\u2019s filing of its January 1988 cross-claim deprived Olympia of a reasonable time to \u201ccure\u201d its default by securing replacement financing or liquidating the mortgaged property. According to Olympia, issues of fact relating to this alleged \u201cfailure\u201d precluded the entry of summary judgment. Once again, Olympia overlooks the fact that First Nationwide\u2019s October 18, 1990 motion for summary judgment was based on its second amended cross-claim and Olympia\u2019s admitted default in making any loan payments for periods <em>after </em>November 1, 1988. Whether or not First Nationwide gave Olympia sufficient time to \u201ccure\u201d the defaults existing prior to November 1988 is irrelevant to First Nationwide\u2019s rights arising from Olympia\u2019s subsequent defaults beginning in November 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">As evidenced by the proceedings and record in this case, Olympia cannot complain of lack of opportunity to cure its post-November 1988 defaults. Olympia was on notice of First Nationwide\u2019s intentions when it received service of First Nationwide\u2019s December 4, 1989 second amended cross-claim and the October 1990 motion for summary judgment. These pleadings provided Olympia with ample notice of First Nationwide\u2019s intention to accelerate the debt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>foreclosure on Olympia\u2019s loan as a result of Olympia\u2019s failure to make any loan payments since November 1988. <em>Nixon v. Buckeye Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. </em>(App.1934), 18 Ohio Law Abs. 261, 263-264. The trial court did not enter a final judgment in First Nationwide\u2019s favor until November 15, 1991 \u2014 three years after Olympia\u2019s last payment. During this time, Olympia made no payments on its loan for post-November 1988 periods, and did not tender any such payments, in an effort to \u201ccure\u201d the defaults upon which First Nationwide\u2019s right to judgment and foreclosure rested. On the face of this record, Olympia\u2019s \u201clack of opportunity to cure\u201d defense lacks any factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">3. Olympia\u2019s \u201cBad Faith\u201d Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Olympia contends that First Nationwide\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d in the performance of contractual duties is recognized as a distinct tortious cause of action entitling an injured party to damages proximately resulting. See <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Said </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 690, 692, 590 N.E.2d 1228, 1230-1231, and fn. 1. However, Olympia\u2019s answer to First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim contains no \u201cbad faith\u201d counterclaim or affirmative defense against First Nationwide. Therefore, its' alleged applicability as a defense to First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim has been waived. <em>Houser v. Ohio Historical Soc. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 77, 79, 16 O.O.3d 67, 68, 403 N.E.2d 965, 966; <em>King v. Branch Motor Express Co. </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 190, 193-198, 24 O.O.3d 250, 252-255, 435 N.E.2d 1124, 1127-1130. Even if Olympia\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d defense is not considered waived, the facts upon which it is based do not create any issues of <em>material </em>fact which would deprive First Nationwide of the judgment entered in its favor. As discussed previously, First Nationwide\u2019s past acceptance of late payments, and its conduct relating to Olympia\u2019s pre-January 1988 default, are not material to Olympia\u2019s subsequent defaults post-November 1988, which were the subject of First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim and the 1990 motion for summary judgment. As a matter of law, Olympia\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d defense cannot defeat First Nationwide\u2019s right to seek judgment on the note and foreclose on its security when there has been no payment for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Olympia\u2019s reliance on <em>KM.C. Co., Inc. v. Irving Trust Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1985), 757 F.2d 752, is misplaced. Olympia argues that First Nationwide\u2019s power to accelerate and foreclose on Olympia\u2019s loan and mortgaged property is subject to a standard of \u201cgood faith.\u201d Olympia then argues that the combination of the preNovember 1988 facts underlying its \u201cbad faith\u201d defense create an issue of material fact. We disagree. <em>KM.C. </em>involved a financing agreement subject to the provisions of the UCC which imposes a duty of good faith on all UCC-governed transactions. See R.C. 1301.09 (Ohio\u2019s codification of UCC 1-203). First Nationwide\u2019s second amended cross-claim against Olympia is, however, based upon a transaction involving real property. Real property transactions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>expressly <em>excluded </em>from coverage under the UCC. R.C. 1309.04(1). Therefore, the duty of good faith announced in <em>K.M.C. </em>does not apply to the facts in this case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In any event, Ohio courts have not uniformly accepted the holding in <em>K.M.C. </em>A lender\u2019s decision to enforce its contract rights is not considered an act of \u201cbad faith.\u201d <em>Bennco Liquidating Co. v. Ameritrust </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 646, 621 N.E.2d 760; <em>First Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. of Akron v. Chelton &amp; Rabe </em>(1989), 57 Ohio App.3d 137, 567 N.E.2d 298; <em>Third Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Binder </em>(June 18, 1987), Montgomery App. No. 9995, unreported, 1987 WL 12965. In <em>Kham &amp; Nate\u2019s Shoes No. 2, Inc. v. First Bank of Whiting </em>(C.A.7, 1990), 908 F.2d 1351, it was held that a bank\u2019s refusal to advance additional funds under an otherwise sufficient line of credit did not constitute \u201cbad faith\u201d where the bank had no contractual obligation to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1358. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Kham </em>court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201cFirms that have negotiated contracts are entitled to enforce them to the letter, even to the great discomfort of their trading partners, without being mulcted for lack of \u2018good faith.\u2019 Although courts often refer to the obligation of good faith that exists in every contractual relation, e.g., UCC \u00a7 1-201; <em>Jordan v. Duff &amp; Phelps, Inc., </em>815 F.2d 429, 438 (7th Cir.1987), this is not an invitation to the court to decide whether one party ought to have exercised privileges expressly reserved in the document. \u2018Good faith\u2019 is a compact reference to an implied undertaking not to take opportunistic advantage in a way that could not have been contemplated at the time of drafting, and which therefore was not resolved explicitly by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201cAlthough Bank\u2019s decision left Debtor scratching for other courses of credit, Bank did not create Debtor\u2019s need for funds, and it was not contractually obliged to satisfy its customer\u2019s desires. The Bank was entitled to advance its own interests, and it did not need to put the interests of Debtor and Debtor\u2019s other creditors first. To the extent <em>K.M.C., Inc. v. Irving Trust Co., </em>757 F.2d 752, 759-63 (6th Cir.1986), holds that a bank must loan more money or give more advance notice of termination than its contract requires, we respectfully disagree. First Bank of Whiting is not an eleemosynary institution. It need not throw good money after bad, even if other persons would catch the lucre.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357-1358. See, also, <em>Fasolino Foods Co. v. Banca Nazionale del Lavaro </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 961 F.2d 1052, 1056-1057.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The undisputed facts in this case demonstrate that First Nationwide did nothing more than stand on its rights to require payment of Olympia\u2019s contractu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>al obligations according to its terms. That can not be \u201cbad faith\u201d or a defense to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">4. The Trial Court\u2019s Finding as to the Unpaid Loan Balance</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">First Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment was supported by the affidavit of Erma O\u2019Brien, a loan officer. It attested to a true and accurate copy of Olympia\u2019s loan payment history, including the application of all payments to the loan and the balance due and owing to First Nationwide, which was attached to and incorporated in Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Olympia provided the trial court with no evidence to dispute the O\u2019Brien testimony or documentation which supported the application of loan payments and the outstanding balance of $1,219,779.51 owed by Olympia. Nevertheless, Olympia claims that the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment based on this evidence should be reversed because issues of fact exist as to whether First Nationwide applied certain funds deposited into a trust account against the balance due on Olympia\u2019s Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In opposing First Nationwide\u2019s motion and' the O\u2019Brien affidavit, Olympia had to produce evidence showing a genuine issue of material fact. Mere conclusory and unsupported allegations, do not satisfy this burden. <em>Stibora v. Greater Cleveland Bowling Assn. </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 107, 113, 577 N.E.2d 1175, 1178-1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Olympia\u2019s claim that the trust account funds were not properly applied to Olympia\u2019s loan is not supported by any evidentiary materials. While it is true that funds were withdrawn from the trust account and First Nationwide lacked knowledge as to the specific disposition of those funds, the fact remains that First Nationwide presented proper evidence showing the application of <em>all </em>payments (from whatever source) to Olympia\u2019s note and the loan account. Olympia presented no evidence to contradict First Nationwide\u2019s duly sworn and authenticated loan history. There is no claim asserted in this case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that First Nationwide breached any duties in the handling of the trust account. If so, that would be grounds for a cause of action for breach of trust independent of this suit on the note and the mortgage foreclosure. The trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment based upon the uncontroverted evidence will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Assignment of Error I is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">\u201cII. The trial erred to the prejudice of Olympia by awarding attorney fees to [First] Nationwide in this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Olympia\u2019s second assignment of error challenges the award of attorney fees to First Nationwide. An analysis of the facts in this case reveals the court properly awarded First Nationwide an amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs stipulated to be $32,500. This issue is governed by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Nottingdale Homeowners\u2019 Assn., Inc. v. Darby </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 32, 514 N.E.2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In <em>Nottingdale, </em>a nonprofit condominium association was awarded attorney fees when it prevailed in a foreclosure action against a condominium unit owner who refused to pay his monthly maintenance fees. The trial court entered the award of attorney fees based on a clause contained in the association\u2019s \u201cdeclaration of condominium ownership\u201d which provided for attorney fees in the event of a foreclosure. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court held, at paragraph one of syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cProvisions contained within a declaration of condominium ownership and/or condominium by-laws requiring that a defaulting unit owner be responsible for the payment of attorney fees incurred by the unit owners\u2019 association in either a collection action or a foreclosure action against the defaulting unit owner for unpaid common assessments are enforceable and not void as against public policy so long as the fees awarded are fair, just and reasonable as determined by the trial court upon full consideration of all the circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The <em>Nottingdale </em>decision was quoted and followed by this court in <em>First Fed. Sav. Bank v. W.S.B. Invest., Inc. </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 277, 285, 586 N.E.2d 1159, 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">As in <em>Nottingdale, </em>Olympia\u2019s and First Nationwide\u2019s guarantee agreement in this case also contained a contractual provision requiring Olympia to pay First Nationwide all reasonable attorney fees it incurred in enforcing payment and foreclosure rights. Section 2.7 of the guarantee agreement states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cThe Borrower hereby expressly waives notice in writing, or otherwise, from the Mortgage Assignee or the holders, at any time or from time to time, of the Project Note of their acceptance and reliance on this Agreement. The Borrower agrees to pay all costs, expenses and fees, including to the extent permitted by law, all reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be incurred in enforcing this Agreement, whether the same shall be enforced by suit or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Olympia does not dispute the contractual provision, nor does it dispute the reasonableness of the amount of fees and expenses to which it stipulated. Therefore, the only pertinent issue is whether the fees are permitted by law under the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nottingdale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Olympia argues that <em>Nottingdale </em>does not apply because its holding does not expressly allow the award of attorney fees \u201cin a commercial foreclosure action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Olympia further relies upon <em>Sorin v. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 177, 75 O.O.2d 224, 347 N.E.2d 527, to support its argument that Ohio continues to follow the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d which does not permit a prevailing party to recover attorney fees absent statutory authorization or the institution of proceedings in \u201cbad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Olympia\u2019s reliance on the American rule and <em>Sorin </em>as authorities prohibiting the contractually based award of attorney fees is misplaced. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Nottingdale, </em>the American rule provides \u201c \u2018that attorney\u2019s fees are not ordinarily recoverable in the absence of a statute <em>or enforceable contract providing therefor.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Nottingdale, </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 34, 514 N.E.2d at 704. The <em>Nottingdale </em>court further stated that <em>Sorin </em>does not support \u201cthe conclusion that parties may not <em>contract </em>under circumstances like those of this case for the payment of attorney fees.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 35, 514 N.E.2d at 705. In reaching this conclusion, the court expressly rejected Olympia\u2019s current contention that attorney fees can only be awarded upon a showing of statutory authority or \u201cbad faith,\u201d and not upon contract, because such a rule would \u201cstand the law of contracts on its proverbial head. We decline to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 514 N.E.2d at 705. Significantly, the court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cIt has long been recognized that persons have a fundamental right to contract freely with the expectation that the terms of the contract will be enforced. This freedom \u2018is as fundamental to our society as the right to write and to speak without restraint.\u2019 * * * Government interference with this right must therefore be restricted to those exceptional cases where intrusion is absolutely necessary, such as contracts promoting illegal acts. No such necessity exists in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cIn sum, this court will not interfere with the right of the people of this state to contract freely and without needless limitation. <em>A rule of law which prevents parties from agreeing to pay the other\u2019s attorney fees, absent a statute or prior declaration of this court to the contrary, is outmoded, unjustified and paternalistic.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 514 N.E.2d at 705-707.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The Stark County Court of Appeals, in following <em>Nottingdale, </em>recently extended the award of contractually based attorney fees to a ease involving a <em>commercial </em>transaction. In <em>GMS Mgt. Co., Inc. v. K &amp; K Indus., Inc. </em>(Apr. 29, 1991), Stark App. No. CA-8279, unreported, 1991 WL 70154, the landlord of a shopping center successfully sued its tenant for unpaid maintenance fees and was awarded attorney fees pursuant to a provision in the lease. On appeal, the appellate court explicitly held that attorney fees are recoverable in a <em>commercial transaction:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201cAlthough <em>Nottingdale </em>was specifically limited to a non-commercial transaction, we believe that it would be illogical to hold unenforceable a contractual provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in a commercial transaction where there is no evidence of unequal bargaining positions and no evidence of compulsion or duress. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s award to appellant and against tenant should have triggered the attorney fee provision in Section 38 of said lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Nottingdale </em>was also followed and expanded recently in <em>Hilb, Rogal &amp; Hamilton Agency of Dayton, Inc. v. Reynolds </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 330, 335-336, 610 N.E.2d 1102, 1106, where the court of appeals reversed a trial judge\u2019s refusal to enforce the payment of attorney fees for breach of an employee covenant not to compete. The court stated at 335-336, 610 N.E.2d at 1106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cNor does this court find that the holding in <em>Nottingdale </em>is limited to situations where the provision for attorney fees is found in declarations of condominium ownership and/or condominium bylaws in noncommercial circumstances, although the syllabus of the case specifically refers to such a situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\"><em>(6 </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201cThe court in <em>Nottingdale </em>specifically pointed out that a majority of the states as well as the United States Supreme Court have already recognized the contract exception to the American Rule, and that the basis for enforcing the provision lies in the concept of freedom of contract. Thus, when the syllabus is read in conjunction with the text of the case, it is evident that the court intended to leave the freedom to contract in the hands of contractors without government interference. This intention, combined with the general holding of the case that a provision for reimbursement of <em>reasonable </em>attorney fees is enforceable, leads to the conclusion that such provisions in other contracts are indeed enforceable. We find no public policy which would contradict the enforcement of such a provision in the employment agreement in the present case. Accordingly, we find the appellants\u2019 first, second, third, fifth, and sixth assignments of error well taken.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">This court has followed the holding of <em>Nottingdale </em>in awarding attorney fees allowed by contractual provisions. See <em>First Fed. Sav. Bank v. WSB Invest., Inc. </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 277, 586 N.E.2d 1159; <em>Georgetown of the Highlands Condominium Owners Assn. v. Yelsky </em>(Nov. 21, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 59410, unreported, 1991 WL 244471.
