Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">This is an appeal by petitioners-appellants Richard and Maryanne Creamer from a judgment entered on December 18, 1992, by the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County, Juvenile Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The Creamers are licensed foster parents and Kendra Dunn Franklin, a dependent minor child, was placed in the Creamers\u2019 care by the Marion County Children Services Board (\u201cMCCSB\u201d), which had temporary custody of Kendra. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In accordance with its amended case plan, MCCSB filed a motion seeking to \u201caccept the permanent voluntary surrender\u201d of the rights of Kendra\u2019s natural mother and proceed with the adoption of Kendra into a permanent familial home. On August 24, 1992, the Creamers filed a \u201cmotion to be made parties\u201d and a \u201cmotion for legal custody\u201d of Kendra. On October 6, 1992 a hearing was held. On December 18, 1992, the trial court denied the Creamers\u2019 motion to be made parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It is from this judgment that appellants now appeal and assign three assignments of error, of which the first is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellants [sic ] motion to be made parties because its decision violates the plain meaning of section 2151.353(A)(3), O.R.C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">R.C. 2151.353(A)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201c(A) If a child is adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the court may make any of the following orders of disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\"><em>6i </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201c(3) Award legal custody of the child to either parent or to any other person who, <em>prior to the dispositional hearing, </em>files a motion requesting legal custody of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Here, the Creamers concede that they did not file their motion for legal-custody of Kendra prior to the dispositional hearing; however, they assert that the trial court erred because it did not review its dispositional order pursuant to R.C. 2151.417(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">R.C. 2151.417(A) states that a court \u201cmay\u201d review its prior dispositional order. The word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive, and thus it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to review its prior order. See <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834. Absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion, we will not disturb its judgment denying review of its prior dispositional order. The Creamers fail to point specifically to error in the record in this regard and none plainly appears. In any event, even if the trial court chose to review its dispositional order, the Creamers would not automatically become parties in MCCSB\u2019s action as that determination would also be within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">Because we have found it unnecessary to address appellant\u2019s claim of party status within the terms of R.C. 2151.353(A)(3), we do not do so. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>note that in the usual case of foster child placement, as here, the foster children have not come to the attention of the prospective foster parents until after placement of the children with them by a children services board or other agency which has gained custody of the children as a result of a prior dispositional hearing. Therefore, logic implies neither intention of the legislature to require inclusion of foster parents within the purview of R.C. 2151.353(A)(3) nor constitutional compulsion that they be included by judicial <em>fiat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying appellants <em>[sic </em>] motion to be made parties because appellants are entitled to party status within the meaning of Juvenile Rule 2(16) and the case law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The Creamers argue that the trial court abused its discretion, and thus erred, by denying their motion because Juv.R. 2(16) entitles them to be parties to the proceedings. No rights are created by Juv.R. 2, which merely defines certain terms used throughout the Ohio Rules of Juvenile Procedure. Juv.R. 2(16) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201c \u2018Party\u2019 means a child who is the subject of a juvenile court proceeding, his spouse, if any, his parent * * * and, in appropriate cases, his custodian, guardian or guardian ad litem, the state and any other person specifically designated by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The Creamers\u2019 contention that they are \u201centitled\u201d to party status pursuant to the \u201cany other person specifically designated by the court\u201d language contained in Juv.R. 2(16) is unpersuasive. Juv.R. 2(16) affords a procedural device permitting a trial court to include individuals not specifically otherwise designated a party but whose presence is necessary to fully litigate an issue presented in the action. Thus the court may protect and adjudicate all legitimate claims, protect all interests appearing, avoid multiple litigation and conserve judicial time in the orderly administration of justice. However, it is clear Juv.R. 2(16) allows a trial court to exercise its sound discretion in determining whether to designate a person an additional party. This rule does <em>not </em>mandate that the court include any other persons not already specifically designated by the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Thus, the Creamers are not \u201centitled\u201d to party status merely because they wish to become parties. The Creamers could only have become parties if the trial court designated them as parties necessary to fully litigate the MCCSB action. The trial court need not have made that determination and did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Therefore, because the record does not show that the trial court abused its discretion in not permitting the Creamers to intervene as parties, we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellants [sic ] motion to be made parties because appellants have standing to be heard in this matter, and the trial court\u2019s ruling deprives them of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Despite language contained in this assignment of error that might be construed otherwise, the Creamers essentially argue that the trial court\u2019s judgment denying their motion is based upon their lack of standing, which they claim is error depriving them of due process of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The trial court, in denying the Creamers\u2019 motion after hearing, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201cThe Court believes it would set bad precedent for foster parents, selected by and representing the Children Services Board to come in conflict with that Board. The Court further finds that it is not in the best interests of the child in this case to grant the motion. The motion to be made parties is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Clearly, the trial court did not base its decision on the issue of whether the Creamers had standing in this matter and thus appellants\u2019 assignment of error does not address the record. Although not required, the trial court clearly stated its rationale in denying the Creamers\u2019 motion, which does not, by any reasonable interpretation, implicate the Creamers\u2019 standing. The record shows that the trial court considered the Creamers\u2019 motion and all memoranda submitted, conducted a hearing on the motion and then journalized its judgment denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">After review, we find no trial court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AS1\">Evans, P.J., and Shaw, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\">. R.C. 2151.417(A) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-15\">\"Any court that issues a dispositional order * * * may review at any time the child\u2019s placement or custody arrangement * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-17\">.
