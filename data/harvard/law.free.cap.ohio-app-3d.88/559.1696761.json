The following errors have been assigned for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">\u201cI. The probate court erred in concluding the second clause of testator\u2019s will not to have constituted a valid residuary clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">\u201cII. The probate court erred in not vacating the transfer of burial lots, as said lots do not pass under the general residuary clause contained in a testator\u2019s will, but descend to the heirs of the testator as intestate property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">The record reveals the following facts pertinent to this appeal. Clifford Derifield (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe decedent\u201d) died in May 1985. The decedent left four adult children as heirs at law and no surviving spouse. On August 16,1985, Lois Hopper, one of decedent\u2019s daughters, made application with the court below to probate her father\u2019s last will and testament. The will was admitted into probate and, subsequently, the estate was relieved from administration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The assets of the estate were then, presumably, transferred or delivered to Lois Hopper, who was named sole beneficiary in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>On March 5, 1992, Noah Dean Hopper, the surviving spouse of Lois Hopper and appellee herein, made application to reopen the estate and to have himself appointed \u201csuccessor commissioner.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee sought to have the decedent\u2019s interest in several burial lots at Highland Memorial Gardens in South Point, Ohio, transferred to himself as his wife\u2019s heir. The lower court granted the application and, on May 18, 1992, approved the distribution and transfer of those lots to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">On July 8, 1992, Lonnie Nixon, another of decedent\u2019s daughters and appellant herein, filed a motion to vacate the transfer. Appellant argued that the burial lots would descend to all the decedent\u2019s heirs rather than pass by testamentary bequest to a residual beneficiary. Appellee filed a memorandum contra, arguing that the clear intent of the decedent was for all property, including interests in burial lots, to pass to Lois Hopper. On August 19, 1992, the lower court issued its decision, holding that burial lots do not pass under a residuary clause in a will. However, the court reasoned, Lois Hopper was bequeathed \u201ceverything\u201d in the decedent\u2019s estate and did not acquire the lots through a \u201cresidual\u201d bequest. The court then concluded that the lots had been properly transferred to Lois Hopper and that appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the transfer should be denied. A judgment to that effect was entered on September 9, 1992, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The method by which ownership interests in burial lots pass, at death, to successive generations is a topic which has received little treatment und\u00e9r the law of Ohio or that of other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, the general rule appears to be that burial lots do not pass under a general or residuary clause in a will but rather pass to the heirs at law of the testator as if he had died intestate. See 14 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1979) 355, Cemeteries and Dead Bodies, Section 52; see, also, Annotation (1969), 26 A.L.R.3d 1425, 1426-1427. The lower court relied on this rule in reaching its decision and both parties agree that it is a correct statement of the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The real conflict between the parties is whether the decedent\u2019s bequest to Lois Hopper was residual in nature so as to bring such rule into play. Both assignments of error address this issue and we shall consider them together. At the outset, it is not entirely clear to us that the disposition of this case would depend on the testamentary provision being characterized as \u201cresiduary\u201d or non-residuary. The rule that burial-lot interests pass as if by intestate succession is said to apply to <em>both general and residuary devises. </em>See Annotation, <em>supra, </em>26 A.L.R.3d at 1426-1427. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such characterization is crucial to the outcome of this case, we note the following portion of the decedent\u2019s will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my property, real and personal, owned by me at the time of my death or over which I may have power of disposition, I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved daughter, Lois Ann Hopper, to be hers absolutely and forever, if she survives me by at least two (2) months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The words \u201call the rest, residue and remainder\u201d are generally indicative of a residuary clause in a will. See 32 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1981) 280, Decedent\u2019s Estates, Section 787. The lower court correctly defined such a clause as one which disposes of that part of the testator\u2019s estate which remains after satisfaction of all previous bequests and devises. See <em>Collins v. Patton </em>(App.1952), 64 Ohio Law Abs. 518, 519, 113 N.E.2d 100, 102. The court then apparently carried this definition one step further and reasoned that a clause could not properly be deemed \u201cresiduary\u201d unless there was some other devise or bequest specified in the will. It was noted that there were no other bequests in the decedent\u2019s will and, therefore, Lois Hopper took \u201ceverything\u201d in the estate rather than the \u201cremains\u201d of the estate. The court then concluded that the decedent\u2019s bequest to his daughter was not a \u201cresiduary\u201d clause. Appellant now argues that the lower court was operating under too stringent a definition of \u201cresiduary clause\u201d by requiring the existence of some other bequest in addition to that clause disposing of the residual estate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Generally speaking, a residuary clause disposes of all the testator\u2019s estate for which there has not been some previous disposition. See <em>Newman v. Newman </em>(P.C.1964), 94 Ohio Law Abs. 321, 332, 28 O.O.2d 154, 160, 199 N.E.2d 904, 912. A residuary legatee can just as easily be one who takes the entire estate as one who takes the remaining estate after numerous specific bequests. Although a residuary clause, in a strict sense, would seem to presuppose prior particular bequests or devises, a bequest of \u201call\u201d of the testator\u2019s property or estate is also treated as a residuary clause. <em>Jackson v. Jackson </em>(1975), 217 Kan. 448, 455-456, 536 P.2d 1400, 1407; see, also, <em>In re Hogan\u2019s Will </em>(Sup.Ct.1962), 37 Misc.2d 806, 810-811, 237 N.Y.S.2d 361, 366; <em>In re Armstrong\u2019s Estate </em>(1943), 347 Pa. 23, 25, 31 A.2d 528, 529; <em>Goforth v. Goforth </em>(1941), 202 Ark. 1017, 1021, 154 S.W.2d 819, 822. This is also the consensus of other authorities. See, <em>e.g., </em>4 Page, Wills (1961) 373, Section 33.48 (gift of testator\u2019s <em>entire </em>estate is said to be a residuary clause); 80 American Jurisprudence 2d (1975) 601, Wills, Section 1540.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">An examination of decedent\u2019s will in light of these principles clearly shows that Lois Hopper was the residual legatee. Ownership interests in burial lots, as aforesaid, do not pass under the residuary clause of a will. Rather, they pass to the heirs at law of the testator as if he had died intestate. The lower court erred in not vacating the previous transfer of such interests to appellee. Accordingly, the two assignments of error are sustained, the judgment is reversed, and this cause is remanded to the probate court for farther action to vacate the previous transfer of the burial lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-7\">Peter B. Arele, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b631-8\">Harsha, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-16\">. The law at the time of decedent\u2019s death allowed an estate to be relieved from administration if, among other things, the value of its assets were less than $25,000. See R.C. 2113.03. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>record in the cause <em>sub judice </em>indicates that the decedent's assets were valued at just over $12,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. A \"commissioner\u201d is an individual appointed by the probate court to carry out distribution of assets after an estate is relieved from administration. See R.C. 2113.03. Lois Hopper was so appointed below and appellee sought to be appointed \"successor commission[er]\u201d on the reopening of the estate as her surviving spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\">. The seminal case in this area of the law is <em>In re Waldron </em>(1904), 26 R.I. 84, 58 A. 453, wherein the Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded that, legally, burial lots have been shorn of so many of the ordinary attributes of property as to raise a presumption that they are not intended to be passed under a general devise. The court noted that burial lots are usually acquired for the family and \u201c[a] sort of trust attaches to the land for the benefit of the family.\u201d <em>Id., </em>26 R.I. at 86, 58 A. at 454. Neither a widow nor a child can be excluded from it for want of title, yet such a result might follow if the tenure was like that of other real estate. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 58 A. at 454.87, 58 A. at 454. These principles have been applied under Ohio law, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Persinger v. Persinger </em>(C.P.1949), 54 Ohio Law <em>Abs. </em>295, 300-301, 86 N.E.2d 335, 338, <em>and </em>have been adopted in other jurisdictions as well. See Annotation (1969), 26 A.L.R.3d 1425, 1428. Although there is authority for the proposition that interests in burial lots may pass to a designated legatee if <em>specifically mentioned </em>in the will, see <em>Waldron, supra, </em>26 R.I. at 85, 58 A. at 453, there is no such specific reference in the will before us and, accordingly, we do not address the issue. Suffice it to say that, if the general rule is applicable in this case, the decedent's four children would have each taken an undivided one-quarter interest in the remaining burial lots. Each child of the decedent then has a right, independent of the consent of brother or sister, to be buried in the remaining family lot(s). <em>Persinger, supra, </em>54 Ohio Law Abs. at 302, 86 N.E.2d at 339. However, the burial of a nonfamily member may require consent by all cotenants in the lot(s). <em>Id.; </em>see, also, <em>Lewis v. Walker </em>(1894), 165 Pa. 30, 30 A. 500.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b631-9\">Harsha, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AxE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">I concur in judgment only since I am not totally convinced in the wisdom and binding nature of the general rule that burial plots pass to the heirs at law rather than general or residual legatees. However, since the parties here appear to be content with such a rule, we need not address its application in this jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
