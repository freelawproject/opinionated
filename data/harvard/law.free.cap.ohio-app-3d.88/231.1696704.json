Because of the issue raised in this appeal, this case is transferred from the accelerated calendar to the regular calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">The facts, as stipulated, are as follows. Monica resides with her minor daughter from a prior relationship, Christina Lopez; Monica\u2019s boyfriend, Roberto Martinez; and Monica and Roberto\u2019s minor daughter, Stephanie Martinez. Christina is a recipient of ADC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>During part of the year, Roberto is employed in seasonal work. During that time, he and Stephanie are excluded from Christina\u2019s ADC assistance group. During the part of the year that Roberto is unemployed, he receives unemployment compensation. Effective January 1992, the Defiance County Department of Human Services determined that Roberto and Stephanie should be included in Christina\u2019s ADC assistance group and that Christina\u2019s ADC benefits should be reduced when Roberto is receiving unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Monica appealed the decision of the Defiance County Department of Human Services and a state welfare hearing was held. The state hearing officer determined that the reduction in the ADC benefits was proper. Monica filed an administrative appeal, which was overruled. Monica then appealed to the Defiance County Court of Common Pleas. The Defiance County Court of Common Pleas disagreed with the administrative agency and department of human services and determined that there was no evidence in the record to support the administrative agency\u2019s decision and that the decision was, therefore, contrary to law. It is from this judgment that ODHS asserts the following assignment of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cThe Defiance County Court of Common Pleas was in error when it determined that federal and state law do not require half-siblings of a child receiving ADC to be included in the assistance unit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(A)(38) where such half siblings are not independently ADC eligible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">This appeal centers on whether a half-sibling can be included in a child\u2019s ADC assistance group if there are no facts presented that the half-sibling is dependent other than the fact that the half-sibling\u2019s father receives unemployment compensation. ODHS argues that the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation should be adhered to, that a half-sibling should be included in an assistance group for another child when the half-sibling\u2019s parent receives unemployment compensation. Monica argues that ODHS\u2019s interpretation of the federal and state statutes relating to ADC benefits is inconsistent with the language of these statutes and that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Before examining the statutes involved, we must note that, although we are reviewing a decision of the trial court involving the decision of an administrative agency, we do not apply an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard as this matter\u2019s only issue involves a question of law. Thus, we are permitted to apply our own determination as to the application and interpretation of the law involved. <em>In re Raymundo </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 262, 586 N.E.2d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Moreover, since we are called upon to review an interpretation of the law, we must give effect to the language as intended by Congress and the Ohio legislature, as that intention is implemented by and through the respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>agency. See <em>Sullivan v. Everhart </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 83, 110 S.Ct. 960, 108 L.Ed.2d 72, and <em>Jones Metal Products Co. v. Walker </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 173, 58 O.O.2d 393, 281 N.E.2d 1. Likewise, if the statute is ambiguous, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is also given due deference. <em>Sullivan, supra; Jones Metal Products, supra. </em>This is because the agency, in exercising the day-to-day responsibility of implementing the intention of Congress, has acquired \u201csubstantial expertise.\u201d <em>Jones Metal Products, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Thus, necessary to this appeal is a recitation of the relevant portions of the federal law which implements ADC benefits for recipients in each state. Section 602(a)(38), Title 42, U.S.Code, states the persons to be included in a child\u2019s assistance group in order to determine the amount of benefits the child should receive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201c(a) Contents</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201cA State plan for aid and services to needy families with children must\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\"><em>U % </em>^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201c(38) provide that in making the determination [of eligibility] 'with respect to a dependent child * * * the State agency shall * * * include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">\u201c(A) any parent of such child, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\u201c(B) any brother or sister of such child, if such brother or sister meets the conditions described in clauses (1) and (2) of section 606(a) of this title or in section 607(a) of this title,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">\u201cif such parent, brother, or sister is living in the same home as the dependent child, and any income of or available for such parent, brother, or sister shall be included in making such determination and applying such paragraph with respect to the family * * *[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Our first determination under this statute is whether Stephanie is a sister of Christina, pursuant to Section 602(a)(38)(B). Section 206.10(a)(1)(vii)(B), Title 45, C.F.R., provides some insight into this determination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">\u201c(vii) For AFDC only, in order for the family to be eligible, an application with respect to a dependent child must also include, if living in the same household and otherwise eligible for assistance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-14\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-15\">(B) Any blood-related or adoptive brother or sister[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">Therefore, as Christina is related by blood to Stephanie, Christina is a sister of Stephanie.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Our next determination is whether Stephanie meets the conditions of Sections 606(a) or 607(a), Title 42, U.S.Code, and, therefore, falls into Christina\u2019s assistance group. The relevant provision is Section 607(a), Title 42, U.S.Code, as it pertains directly to unemployment compensation. It states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201c(a) \u2018Dependent child\u2019 defined. The term \u2018dependent child\u2019 shall, notwithstanding section * * * [42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 606(a) ], include a needy child who meets the requirements of * * * [42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 606(a)(2)], who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the unemployment (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) of the parent who is the principal earner, and who is living with any of the relatives specified in section * * * [42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 606(a)(1) ] in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his (or their) own home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Thus, if a child is deprived of her parent\u2019s support or care by reason of the parent\u2019s unemployment, the child is a dependent child and must be included in the [half] sibling\u2019s assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">ODHS argues that if Stephanie\u2019s father is unemployed, that fact alone is sufficient to conclude that she is a dependent child. Monica argues that since Stephanie is not deprived of Roberto\u2019s support or care by reason of his unemployment, because Roberto receives unemployment compensation which supports Stephanie, Stephanie should not be deemed a dependent child, pursuant to Section 602(a)(38), Title 42, U.S.Code. We agree with the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In <em>Orris v. Sullivan </em>(C.A.9, 1992), 974 F.2d 109, a similar situation was presented to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. A woman and her two daughters lived with a man and the man and woman had a son in Hawaii. The man was injured at work and began receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. After the man began receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the Hawaii Department of Human Services discontinued the woman\u2019s AFDC benefits because the benefits exceeded the group\u2019s standard of need. A question was presented whether the man and the son should be included in the woman\u2019s and daughters\u2019 ADC family filing unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">While the matter <em>sub judice </em>involves a parent being unemployed and <em>Orris </em>involved a parent being unable to work because of a physical injury, a statute analogous to Section 607, Title 42, U.S.Code, applies to determine whether a child is dependent. That statute is Section 606(a), Title 42, U.S.Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">\u201c(a) The term \u2018dependent child\u2019 means a needy child (1) who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the * * * physical * * * incapacity of a parent, and who is living with his father * * * in a place of residence maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, and (2) who is (A) under the age of eighteen[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Applying this statute to the facts, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201cFather\u2019s injury constituted a \u2018physical incapacity\u2019 as defined by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(l)(iv), and this incapacity resulted in Son being labelled a \u2018deprived\u2019 child under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a)(1). As a deprived child who was under the age of eighteen and a blood-related sibling of Orris\u2019 two daughters, Son had to be included in the Orris household family filing unit as a \u2018dependent\u2019 child for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a)(1) and (2)(A). Because Son was included in the family filing unit, Father also had to be included therein as the parent of an AFDC-eligible child under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(38)(A), and any income received by Father had to be attributed to the household pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(38).\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Thus, analogizing the facts of the matter <em>sub judice </em>to <em>Orris, </em>we find that Stephanie and her father Roberto should have been included as part of Christina\u2019s assistance group. Roberto\u2019s unemployment results in Stephanie being labelled a \u201cdeprived\u201d child pursuant to Section 607(a), Title 42, U.S.Code. Thus, as a deprived child who is under the age of eighteen Stephanie must be included in Christina\u2019s assistance group as a \u201cdependent\u201d child.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Although Momea argues that Stephanie is not dependent because her father supports her with his unemployment compensation funds, we disagree that federal or state law requires such a finding to be made after a child is included in an assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">First, it is clear that Section 607(a), Title 42, U.S.Code, does not explicitly require a separate finding that any children that might be included in a dependent\u2019s assistance group are needy once the parent of that child has become unemployed. More important, Congress, in enacting and regulating, through its administrative agencies, both the ADC benefits and unemployment compensation benefits, was well aware of a need for a balance between the two assistance statutes. If Congress had intended for human services departments to consider unemployment compensation benefits in determining who belongs in an ADC applicant\u2019s assistance unit, it certainly would have spelled out that consideration in the ADC statutes. Thus, we can assume from the absence of consideration in the ADC calculation of such a prominent piece of legislation as unemployment compensation (or workers\u2019 compensation) that omission of the consideration was intentional. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the absence requires us to consider only whether a parent has become unemployed. If a parent of a child has become unemployed, the child is a \u201cdependent\u201d child for purposes of calculating ADC.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Since Stephanie\u2019s father is unemployed, she is a \u201cdependent\u201d child and part of Christina\u2019s assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Ohio law is in conformity with this conclusion. The administrative regulations governing the calculation of ADC do not require that if a child is labelled a \u201cdependent\u201d child by reason of the parent\u2019s unemployment the department of human services then consider the child\u2019s need if the child\u2019s parent is receiving unemployment compensation. Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 5101:1-21 and 5101:1-3-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">To determine who belongs in the child\u2019s assistance unit, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-21-011(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201c(I) The following steps are used in determining the standard filing unit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\u201c(1) The standard filing unit is determined by first deciding for which child(ren) assistance is requested. The child for whom assistance is requested must be considered eligible by meeting the age and deprivation requirements of ADC eligibility. Income is not a factor at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201c(2) Add to the standard filing unit siblings living in the household who also meet the age and deprivation requirements and who are not specifically excluded. \u2018Sibling\u2019 means any and all blood-related or adoptive brothers and sisters. Income is not a factor at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201c(3) Add to the standard filing unit the parent(s) living in the household who are not specifically excluded. * * * Income is not a factor at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">\u201c(4) This group is considered to be the standard filing unit or the assistance group. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">\u201c(5) ADC eligibility is determined for the standard filing unit as a whole. The income and resources * * * of all people included in the assistance unit are used in determining eligibility for ADC and the amount of the ADC assistance payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Thus, pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 21\u2014011(I)(2), Stephanie must meet the same age and deprivation requirements as Christina to be included in Christina\u2019s assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">From the facts presented in the record and as there is no dispute about the age requirement by the parties, we find that Stephanie meets the age requirement for ADC eligibility. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-3-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">The deprivation requirement is stated in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-3-011:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-16\">\u201cDeprivation exists when the child has only one legal parent or when the child has lost the support or care of one or more of the legal parents as a result of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-17\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201c(D) Unemployment of a legal parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Also, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-3-15 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201c(A) Deprivation of parental support or care exists when the parent who is the principal earner is unemployed and is the parent -with whom the child is living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Therefore, a sibling can meet the deprivation requirement stated in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 21\u2014011(I)(2) if her legal parent is unemployed. Stephanie\u2019s legal parent, Roberto, is unemployed; therefore, she meets the deprivation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Since Stephanie meets the age and deprivation requirements of Ohio Adm. Code 5101:1-21-011(I)(2), she is included in Christina\u2019s assistance group. Moreover, any funds received by siblings are not to be considered by ODHS when determining the persons to be included in the assistance group, as the regulations state that \u201c[finc\u00f3me is not a factor\u201d in the process of determining who is included in the individual\u2019s assistance group. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-21-011.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Although Ohio requires that individuals be needy to receive ADC, the determination of need applies only to the individual receiving the benefits, not to persons who make up the individual\u2019s assistance group. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-3-20. This regulation requires that \u201can individual or family\u201d be in need of financial assistance to be eligible for ADC. This regulation applies to the person or family receiving the aid, not to the determination of who is considered part of the individual\u2019s assistance person for purposes of calculating need. The financial resources of the assistance group determine the ADC applicant\u2019s \u201cneed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Thus, the legislature of this state and Congress determined that the need requirement be applied only to the one requesting aid, and that it not be a factor in determining the composition of the applicant\u2019s assistance group. Therefore, need of the applicant is considered, but only after the assistance group has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">For these reasons, we decline to follow the trial court\u2019s reasoning in its judgment entry, or the reasoning by the court in <em>Fridley v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv., </em>Marion County C.P. No. 91CI-463, unreported, and <em>Peacock v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(Feb. 19, 1993), Marion County C.P. No. 92-CI-171, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">For the above stated reasons, the judgment of the Defiance County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-14\">Evans, P.J., and Thomas F.
