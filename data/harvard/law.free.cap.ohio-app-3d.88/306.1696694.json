Flora, Jr., appeals a judgment of the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas dismissing his appeal of a decision rendered by defendant-appellee, the Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201ccommission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The record indicates that appellant is an employee of defendant-appellee, Cincinnati Milacron, Inc. (\u201cMilacron\u201d). On July 8, 1988, appellant sustained an industrial injury to his lower back while working at Milacron\u2019s Batavia plant. Appellant filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and was awarded such benefits from August 12, 1988, through October 16,1988, after which he returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On December 7, 1989, appellant filed an application to reactivate the claim, alleging that on September 17, 1989, he had aggravated the injury while mowing his lawn. The application was denied by Milacron and the commission. The commission hearing officer found that appellant had sustained an intervening injury while mowing his lawn and that the injury was \u201cmore than a mere aggravation\u201d of the injury that appellant suffered on July 8, 1988. The hearing officer\u2019s decision was affirmed throughout the administrative appeal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On March 20, 1992, appellant filed an appeal with the trial court pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, challenging the commission\u2019s denial of his request to reactivate the claim. On July 21, 1992, Milacron filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. On September 23,1992, the trial court issued a decision granting summary judgment in favor of Milacron. The court found that, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, the commission\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s application to reactivate his claim was not appealable to the common pleas court. The trial court entered judgment in accordance with its decision on October 30, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Appellant brings the instant appeal, setting forth the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Appellant contends that the issue before the commission was appealable to the common pleas court and that the trial court therefore erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Milacron. Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, which is adverse to the party against whom the motion is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. Civ.R. 56; <em>Wills v. Frank Hoover Supply </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 186, 26 OBR 160, 497 N.E.2d 1118; <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">R.C. 4123.519, governing appeals to the court of common pleas, provides in part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">\u201c(A) The claimant or the employer may appeal a decision of the industrial commission or of its staff hearing officer made pursuant to division (B)(6) of section 4121.35 of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted or in which the contract of employment was made if the injury occurred outside the state, or in which the contract of employment was made if the exposure occurred outside the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, a claimant can appeal only those decisions that involve the claimant\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund. <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 236, 594 N.E.2d 609. However, those decisions that do not reach an employee\u2019s right to participate in the system are considered to involve \u201cthe extent of the injury\u201d and are therefore not appealable to a court of common pleas. <em>Id.; Felty v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 241, 602 N.E.2d 1141, 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In the case at bar, we find that the commission\u2019s decision reached the right of appellant to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system. The commission found that appellant\u2019s September 1989 injury was caused by an intervening, non-work-related accident that was more than a mere aggravation of his prior condition. As such, the commission made a factual determination that appellant did not sustain the disability as a result of the work-related accident. Such a finding goes to appellant\u2019s right to participate in the system and it is therefore appealable to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.519. See <em>Felty, supra, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 239, 602 N.E.2d at 1145, citing <em>Keels v. Chapin &amp; Chapin, Inc. </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 112, 34 O.O.2d 249, 214 N.E.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Milacron claims that the decision does not impinge upon appellant\u2019s right to seek benefits for the initial injury, and states that in fact, appellant continued to receive benefits after the commission\u2019s denial of his claim for reactivation. We find no evidence of such payments in the record. In any event, the practical effect of the commission\u2019s decision is a finding that appellant\u2019s current condition is not work-related. We find that such determination relates to appellant\u2019s right to participate and not merely to the extent of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The decision of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to the trial court to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of appellant\u2019s appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.519.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-10\">Koehler, P.J., Walsh and Hofstetter, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b377-11\">Edwin T.
