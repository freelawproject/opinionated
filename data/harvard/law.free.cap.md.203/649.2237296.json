J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATh\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The petitioner, James De Lisle, was convicted on a charge of violating the narcotic laws and sentenced to serve five years in the Maryland Penitentiary. He is applying for leave to appeal from a denial of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>by Judge Manley of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The following complaints ar\u00e9 set out by the petitioner: (1) that he was tried and convicted without benefit of counsel; (2) that the evidence used against him was secured by an illegal search and seizure; (3) that the narcotic which he was charged with using had been prescribed by a medical doctor; and (4) that the penalty was in excess of the maximum provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">As to the petitioner not having the \u201cbenefit of counsel\u201d, it has been held that a petitioner for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>has the burden of establishing that for want of counsel \u201can ingredient of unfairness operated actively in the process that resulted in his confinement\u201d. <em>Martucci v. Warden, </em>202 Md. 648, 96 A. 2d 490; <em>Anglin v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 665, 95 A. 2d 89; <em>Knott v. Warden, </em>200 Md. 658, 90 A. 2d 177. Petitioner here does not allege that he requested counsel to be appointed. <em>Anglin v. Warden, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Concerning the use of evidence illegally obtained, Art. 27, Sec. 368 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1951) provides that Art. 35, Sec. 5 of the Code, known as the \u201cBouse Act\u201d, is inapplicable in prosecutions for narcotic laws violations. The point cannot in any event be raised on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Petitioner\u2019s claim that a doctor prescribed the narcotic goes to the question of the sufficiency of the evidence \u2014 a matter which cannot be considered on <em>habeas corpus. Carroll v. Warden, </em>202 Md. 644, 92 A. 2d 449; <em>Sykes v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 662, 93 A. 2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The section cited by petitioner to show that the maximum penalty, is three years has been amended. Inasmuch as Chapter 466 of the Acts of 1951 -now makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>possible a maximum sentence of five years in cases of first violations of the narcotics law, the petitioner\u2019s last contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
