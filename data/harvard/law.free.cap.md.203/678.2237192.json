He now contends in his application for leave to appeal from a denial of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial and further, of his right to exercise peremptory challenges in the selection of the jury. His claim of denial of a speedy trial was presented to this Court in his appeal from the judgment and sentence of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and held to be without merit. <em>Harris v. State, </em>194 Md. 288. Both contentions were made in a previous application for the writ, unsuccessful below, with leave to appeal denied here. <em>Harris v. Warden, </em>199 Md. 685, <em>certiorari </em>denied, 344 U. S. 931, 96 L. Ed. 1340. See also <em>Harris v.
