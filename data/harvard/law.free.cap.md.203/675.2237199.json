See Sections 1 and 30, Article 59, 1951 Code. Petitioner has had three sanity hearings in the past two years. See Section 20, Article 59, 1951 Code. Petitioner\u2019s present contention seems to be that the writ should issue as a matter of right. Section 7, Article 42, 1951 Code provides, in effect, that there is no right of appeal from a denial of the writ unless the petitioner is detained \u201cas a result of a prosecution for a criminal offense.\u201d Inasmuch as petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>is not so detained, \u201cthis Court has no jurisdiction on appeal * * <em>Miller v. Superintendent, </em>198 Md. 659, 80 A. 2d 898; <em>Miller v. Superintendent, </em>190 Md. 741; <em>Bailey v.
