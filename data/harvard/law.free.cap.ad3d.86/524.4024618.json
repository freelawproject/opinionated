The plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that he sustained certain injuries to the lumbar region of his spine as a result of the subject accident. The defendant, among other things, provided competent medical evidence establishing, prima facie, that the alleged injuries to the lumbar region of the plaintiffs spine did not constitute a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) <em>(see Perl v Meher, </em>74 AD3d 930 [2010]; <em>Gonzales v Fiallo, </em>47 AD3d 760 [2008]).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">However, in opposition, the plaintiff provided competent medical evidence raising a triable issue of fact as to whether the alleged injuries to the lumbar region of his spine constituted a serious injury under the permanent consequential limitation of use and/or significant limitation of use categories of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d) <em>(see Dixon v Fuller, </em>79 AD3d 1094, 1094-1095 [2010]). Furthermore, contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s determination, he provided a reasonable explanation for the cessation of his medical treatment <em>(see Abdelaziz v Fazel, </em>78 AD3d 1086 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Mastro, J.E, Florio, Leventhal, Belen and Cohen, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
