The events of that night resulted in Vasher being shot by the father of one of the girls<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and convicted by a jury of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The evidence at trial showed that defendant performed various acts of sexual penetration on all three girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">At trial the prosecution called all three victims, several of their parents, the officer in charge of the case, and the doctor who had examined one of the victims. Vasher took the stand in his own defense. During direct examination, Vasher denied having assaulted the children. He claimed that he always treated them as he would his own children. On cross-examination, Vasher said that on the basis of the Bible, he believed fourteen was an acceptable age for a girl to bear children. However, he denied that he had said young, girls should be initiated into sex by their own family members. On rebuttal, the prosecution called Sherry Culkar, the mother of one of the victims. She testified that Vasher had told her that it used to be common practice for family members to introduce young girls to sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, finding that the prosecutor\u2019s questions violated the statutory ban against inquiry into religious freedom, that certain testimony outlining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>defendant\u2019s sexual philosophy was both more prejudicial than probative and inadmissible character evidence, and that certain rebuttal testimony was improper. The people sought leave to appeal, which we granted. 447 Mich 987 (1994). We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We turn first to the statutory ban against inquiry into religious beliefs. On cross-examination, Vasher was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\"><em>Q. </em>But you do believe in having sex with young children, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\"><em>A. </em>No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\"><em>Q. </em>Mr. Vasher, haven\u2019t you time and time again expressed your philosophy to a number of people that children should be taught by either their father, their brother, their uncle or their grandfather what it is like to have sex?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\"><em>A. </em>No, ma\u2019am, never.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\"><em>Q. </em>You never said that to anyone, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\"><em>Q. </em>Have you told people, sir, that anything over twelve, it is too late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\"><em>Q. </em>Well, how young would you go, Mr. Vasher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\"><em>A. </em>I think according to the Bible the Blessed Virgin was fourteen when she conceived Christ. And I believe that God makes no mistake. Apparently, fourteen is an adequate age for a woman to produce a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-18\"><em>Q. </em>And fourteen, then, is an adequate age for you to engage in sexual relationships with a child,. is that true, is that your statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-19\"><em>A. </em>If there was a love relationship, and they were wanting to get married, I think that would be between the two consenting adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-20\"><em>Q. </em>So, if you loved a fourteen year old, then you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>.would have sex with her, is that what you are telling us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><em>A. </em>No. I am not saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\"><em>Mr. Cripps: </em>Your Honor, at this point, we all know we are here on a charge involving very young children. His feelings about young .adults having premarital sex or whatever is not relevant, to the charge in relation to small children here. I am afraid we are getting far afield. I would like to lodge an objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\"><em>Ms. Diehl: </em>I think we are talking about having sex with minor children, which is against the law. And I think it is very relevant if his philosophy is he thinks there is nothing wrong with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\"><em>The Court: </em>I will sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\"><em>Q. (By Ms. Diehl): </em>You know who Sherry Culkar is, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\"><em>Q. </em>She was married to your son, Frank, Jr., is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\"><em>A. </em>They lived together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\"><em>Q. </em>They lived together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\"><em>Q. </em>Did you tell her that girls of thirteen should have sex with men in the family such as uncles, fathers, grandfathers so they know what sex is like, know what good sex is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-15\"><em>Q. (By Ms. Diehl): </em>Did you tell Sherry Culkar that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-16\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-17\"><em>Q. </em>Did you tell Sherry Culkar it is a right or duty of a father, grandfather, uncle to instruct young females?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-18\"><em>A. </em>No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-19\"><em>Q. </em>You have a sister by the name of Miss Philomena Hart?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-20\"><em>A. </em>Hurd. Yes. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-21\"><em>Q. </em>Did you tell her that anything over twelve years old is too old for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-22\"><em>A. </em>No, I certainly haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>Q. </em>Do you know Shirley Byers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\"><em>Q. </em>Did you voice to her your philosophy concerning young girls being that they should have sex at the time their period starts or it is too late; and the best person to teach a young girl sex was her father, brother or uncle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\"><em>A. </em>No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Vasher argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that any questioning about Vasher\u2019s \"sexual philosophy\u201d was forbidden after Vasher\u2019s nonresponsive answer that his belief that fourteen was \"an adequate age for a woman to produce a child\u201d was based on the Bible. This one statement was the only reference made in this context of any religious belief held by Vasher. MCL 600.1436; MSA 27A.1436 provides: \"No witness may be questioned in relation to his opinions on religion, either before or after he is sworn.\u201d The threshold question is whether these questions have no reference to \"opinions on the subject of religion . . . .\u201d <em>People v Jenness, </em>5 Mich 305, 319 (1858).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Clearly, the prosecutor\u2019s question \"how young would you go\u201d was not designed to elicit defendant\u2019s religious beliefs. Vasher\u2019s answer, phrased in terms of the Bible and the Virgin, does bring in his religion. This nonresponsive answer does not itself create error requiring reversal. A prosecutor has no duty to caution a witness to refrain from discussing religion in an answer. <em>People v Sommerville, </em>100 Mich App 470, 487; 299 NW2d 387 (1980). However, defendant did not open himself to questioning about his religious beliefs by making this voluntary statement. <em>People v Bouchee, </em>400 Mich 253; 253 NW2d 626 (1977). Here the followup questions by the prosecutor did not refer to Vasher\u2019s interpretation of the Bible, but instead focused on what Vasher believed was an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>age </em>for a girl to begin sexual relations. Therefore, we find no impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We wish to make clear that we in no way alter the rule set forth in <em>People v Hall, </em>391 Mich 175; 215 NW2d 166 (1974), that the Legislature has forbidden that questions on the subject of religion be asked during the course of a criminal proceeding. However, a subject does not become taboo when a- witness makes a nonresponsive answer referring to religious beliefs. Fpr example, if a witness says he is truthful because his religion forbids him to lie, this answer does not preclude questioning him further about and even impeaching him on his veracity. See in contrast, the lines of questioning in <em>People v Jenness, supra </em>(a witness for the prosecution was asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel whether she believed in God, and whether she had at one time disavowed a belief in a Supreme Being), <em>People v Hall, supra </em>(the prosecutor asked the defendant whether he believed in the Supreme Being), and <em>People v Bouchee, supra </em>(the prosecutor asked the defendant if he was a member of any church and followed that up by asking which church it was, the Court asked the defendant whether accepting the Bible would stop him from having sexual relations with a woman to whom he was not married, and the prosecutor asked a defense witness, a minister, whether the defendant was a religious man and further questioned him regarding whether he was a practicing Christian).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Because defendant was not questioned concerning his religious beliefs, MCL 600.1436; MSA 27A.1436 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The Court of Appeals found that the evidence showing defendant had said it was acceptable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>family members to initiate young girls into sexual activity was more prejudicial than probative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MRE 403 provides: \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is <em>substantially </em>outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By omitting this key concept of \"substantially outweighed,\u201d the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of admissibility to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In this context, prejudice means more than simply damage to the opponent\u2019s cause. A party\u2019s case is always damaged by evidence that the facts are contrary to his contentions, but that cannot be grounds for exclusion. What is meant here is an undue tendency to move the tribunal to decide on an improper basis, commonly, though not always, an emotional one. In the pungent phrase of Judge Sloan in <em>State v Rollo, </em>221 Or 428, 438; 351 P2d 422 (1960), the party \"is entitled to hit as hard as he can above, but not below, the belt.\u201d McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 185, p 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The Court of Appeals apparently felt that the evidence concerning defendant\u2019s sexual philosophy was unfairly prejudicial because it might lead the jury to believe that defendant acted in conformity. Evidence presents the danger of unfair prejudice when it threatens the fundamental goals of MRE 403: accuracy and fairness. Gold, <em>Federal Rule of Evidence 403: Observations on the nature of unfairly prejudicial evidence, 58 </em>Wash L R 497 (1983). The perceived danger here is that the jury would decide that this evidence is more probative of a fact than it actually is. The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>seems to have concluded that the jury would be shocked by the heinous nature of defendant\u2019s expressed sexual philosophy to the extent that it would conclude that anyone capable of holding such beliefs surely also would be capable of acting on them. Our review of the record convinces us that the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from the admission of this evidence was minimal. The probative value was not substantially outweighed by its prejudice. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The Court of Appeals also found that the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding defendant\u2019s sexual philosophy were designed to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility by attempting to show that he possessed a bad general character. The Court of Appeals found that these questions were \"an attempt to show that he possessed repugnant beliefs and that he acted consistently with those beliefs.\u201d This line of analysis is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Defendant introduced evidence that he had a close, grandfatherly, loving relationship with the girls and that this precluded him from ever harming them. On direct examination defendant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\"><em>Q. </em>Now, you heard allegations of sexual activity between you and one or two of these children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">Did you at any time on that date or any date have any sexual activity with [either of the children]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\"><em>A. </em>None whatsoever. I love those children like they are my own. They call me grandpa, Paw-Paw Frank, because they love me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\"><em>Q. </em>Are you telling the Jury . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\"><em>A. </em>(Interposing): They wasn\u2019t forced to call me Paw-Paw Frank. They did it of their own volition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Q. </em>Are you telling the Jury the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u2022 <em>A. </em>Absolutely. I am a Born Again Christian. I do not lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\"><em>Mr. Cripps: </em>No further questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Once a defendant has placed his character in issue, it is proper for the prosecution to introduce evidence that the defendant\u2019s character is not as impeccable as is claimed. <em>People v </em>Johnson, 409 Mich 552, 558-560; 297 NW2d 115 (1980). Defendant attempted to establish that he was a loving family man who would not consider molesting young girls; the prosecution was entitled to rebut this. On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to rebut the defendant\u2019s assertion of good character by questioning the defendant about his views regarding sex with family members and young girls. Such rebuttal testimony is admissible under MRE 404(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Finally, we consider whether the Court of Appeals was correct in finding certain rebuttal testimony was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">On rebuttal, the prosecution called Sherry Culkar, who had previously lived with Vasher\u2019s son and is the mother of one of the victims. The disputed testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\"><em>Q. (By Ms. Diehl): </em>And what is Mr. Vasher\u2019s philosophy about having sex with young children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\"><em>A. </em>From what I understand, when we all lived in the house on Lincoln Street, when [the victim] was first born, he told me about way back in the olden days, the farmers and the Indians used to break the children, so that in later life they would know whether they got a fair deal or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\"><em>Q. </em>Did he tell you it was the right and duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>fathers, grandfathers, uncles to instruct young females so they would know what good sex was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\"><em>A. </em>Exactly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The Court of Appeals held that this violated either the rule that extrinsic evidence may not be used to impeach a witness on a collateral matter, citing <em>People v Teague, </em>411 Mich 562, 566; 309 NW2d 530 (1981), or the rule that the prosecutor may not divide the evidence on which the people rest their case, citing <em>People v Losey, </em>413 Mich 346, 352; 320 NW2d 49 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">A party is free to contradict the answers that he has elicited from his adversary or his adversary\u2019s witness on cross-examination regarding matters germane to the issue. As a general rule, however, a witness may not be contradicted regarding collateral, irrelevant, or immaterial matters. 98 CJS, Witnesses, \u00a7\u00a7 632-633, pp 649-655 and <em>People v McGillen No 1, </em>392 Mich 251; 220 NW2d 677 (1974). Here, the rebuttal evidence was narrowly focused on refuting defendant\u2019s denial that he had told Ms. Culkar about his belief that it was acceptable for family members to initiate young girls into, sexual activity. This in turn was in direct response to defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination in which he stated that he had not had sexual activity with the young girls because \"I love those children like they are my own. They call me grandpa, Paw-Paw Frank, because they love me.\u201d Because this was a matter so closely bearing on defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, it was not error for the prosecutor to have impeached defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Next we turn to the question whether this evidence should have been introduced on direct examination rather than on rebuttal. The longstanding rule is that it is not proper to divide the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>on which the people propose to rest their case, and nothing that tends to prove the commission of the crime itself or its immediate surroundings can be classed as rebutting evidence under ordinary circumstances, if at all. <em>People v Quick, </em>58 Mich 321, 323; 25 NW 302 (1885). The purpose of this general rule is to prevent the prosecution from \"sandbagging\u201d the defendant by introducing new, substantive evidence on rebuttal that should have been introduced in its case in chief. <em>People v Bennett, </em>393 Mich 445; 224 NW2d 840 (1975). This rule is generally aimed at preventing the unfair ordering of proofs. <em>People v Dyson, </em>106 Mich App 90, 97; 307 NW2d 739 (1981). As the <em>Dyson </em>Court recognized, \"the <em>Bennett </em>opinion is aimed at the ruse of eliciting a 'denial\u2019 of some statement not properly in the case so as to interject an issue under the guise of rebutting the 'denial.\u2019 The 'denial\u2019 by the defendant is used as a spring board for introducing substantive evidence on a collateral matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. Here, however, we have already recognized that the rebuttal testimony did not concern a collateral matter, but, instead focused on evidence that was material and relevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">This Court has stated<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that when the rebuttal testimony at issue was a simple contradiction of the defendant\u2019s testimony that directly tended to disprove the exact testimony given by the. witness, it was proper rebuttal testimony. <em>People v Sutton (After Remand), </em>436 Mich 575, 597, n 23; 464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>NW2d 276 (1990). Here, the rebuttal evidence was properly limited to being a simple contradiction that refuted a specific statement made by the defendant on cross-examination. <em>People v Sutton, supra; People v McGillen No 1, supra </em>at 266-267. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the evidence to be admitted. <em>People v Utter, </em>217 Mich 74, 83; 185 NW 830 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-5\">Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"> When Milford Anderson was told of an assault by defendant on his daughter, he went to talk to defendant, taking along his .22 caliber rifle. After some conversation, Anderson shot defendant in the groin. Anderson was eventually convicted of careless discharge of a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\"> The Court of Appeals said: \"Finally, whatever probative value the sexual philosophy evidence possessed, it was outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> Rebuttal is limited to the refutation of relevant and material evidence \u2014 hence evidence bearing on an issue properly raised in a case. <em>[Bennett, </em>393 Mich 449.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> In his dissent, Justice Cavanagh asserts that the \"Court\u201d did not make this statement. This is a misstatement; Chief Justice Brickley expressly joined in Justice Boyle\u2019s analysis \"regarding admissibility of defendant\u2019s responses and further questioning resulting therefrom.\u201d <em>People v Sutton (After Remand), </em>436 Mich 575, 600; 464 NW2d 276 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b634-6\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO8R\">I dissent. The majority holds that Sherry Culkar\u2019s testimony was admissible because the defendant put his character at issue by testifying that he would not have molested the victims because he loved them. The majority concludes that inquiry into specific acts of conduct, and proof thereof by extrinsic evidence, was proper as rebuttal. However, in the majority\u2019s stampede to affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction, it entirely ignores this Court\u2019s precedent and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the Rules of Evidence, specifically MRE 405 and 608(b). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The majority contends that the defendant opened the door to this similar acts evidence when he testified that he loved the victims and would not hurt them. MRE 404(a)(1) provides that character evidence may be used to establish \"a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same . . . .\u201d Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>before the prosecution may offer rebuttal testimony, the defendant must actually put some aspect of his character at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">In this case the defendant did not call any character witnesses in the traditional sense. His only \"character witness\u201d was himself. Ordinarily, if the defendant chooses to inject his own character into the trial, he does so by introducing witnesses who testify to his good character. In this case, the majority claims that he put his character at issue when he testified that he loved the victims and did not molest them. I am suspicious of the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s professed love of the victims somehow put his character at issue. Absent more direct testimony unambiguously placing defendant\u2019s character at issue, I conclude that it was not properly at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Nevertheless, even assuming that the defendant somehow put his character at issue, thereby permitting some form of rebuttal, the majority conveniently ignores that MRE 405 specifically dictates the forms that such rebuttal may take:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to <em>reputation </em>or by testimony in the form of an <em>opinion. </em>On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into reports of relevant specific instances of conduct. [MRE 405(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Therefore, once a defendant puts his character at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>issue, the only evidence the prosecutor may use on rebuttal is opinion or reputation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The case at bar is similar to <em>People v Champion, </em>411 Mich 468; 307 NW2d 681 (1981), a unanimous decision of this Court. In that case, the defendant put his character at issue by calling two witnesses who testified regarding the defendant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and for being a law-abiding citizen. The prosecutor did not cross-examine the defendant\u2019s witnesses about any specific acts of misconduct. Instead, he called another witness to rebut the testimony of the character witnesses by recounting specific instances of conduct. In finding this procedure improper under MRE 405(a), this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">The prosecutor may cross-examine the defendant\u2019s witness \"to test his knowledge and candor . . ., and for that purpose he may be asked if he has heard of specific acts of misconduct.\u201d <em>People v Rosa, </em>268 Mich 462, 465; 256 NW 483 (1934). <em>The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal witness may testify only as to reputation, however. </em>In this case, the prosecutor reversed the procedure permitted under MRE 405(h) by inquiring into specific instances of conduct in examination of a rebuttal witness. <em>[Id. </em>at 471 (emphasis added); see also <em>People v Whitfield, </em>425 Mich 116, 131; 388 NW2d 206 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-6\"><em>Champion </em>reestablished<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the rule that rebuttal witnesses may only give reputation or opinion testimony._</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>With no discussion or analysis, the majority cavalierly casts aside over seventy years of this Court\u2019s precedent along with the Rules of Evidence by holding that specific instances of conduct may be used on rebuttal to establish character. This conclusion is legally erroneous as established by MRE 405(a), <em>Whitfield, Champion, supra, </em>and <em>People v Powell, </em>223 Mich 633; 194 NW 502 (1923). The use of specific instances of conduct on rebuttal is clearly prohibited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The majority also holds that the testimony of Sherry Culkar was admissible to \"refute[] a specific statement made by the defendant on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 506. This holding, in turn, fails to discuss MRE 608(b), which prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes unless the evidence is probative of truthfulness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADx\">Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 credibility . . . may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified. [MRE 608(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">This evidentiary rule codified the long-established common-law practice that when a cross-examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>attorney questions a witness regarding <em>a </em>collateral matter, the attorney is bound by the answer given. <em>People v Hillhouse, </em>80 Mich 580, 585; 45 NW 484 (1890); <em>Hamilton v People, </em>46 Mich 186, 188; 9 NW 247 (1881). The rationale behind this rule has long been recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">The use of extrinsic evidence to contradict is more restricted due to considerations of confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue consumption of time, and unfair prejudice raised by the introduction of so-called collateral matters. If a matter is considered collateral, the testimony of the witness on direct or cross-examination stands \u2014the <em>cross-examiner must take the witness\u2019 answer; extrinsic evidence, i.e., evidence offered other than through the witness himself, in contradiction is not permitted. </em>[1 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 49, pp 182-183. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">A matter generally is held to be collateral if the party offering it would not be allowed to offer it in the case in chief. <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, the majority holds that the rebuttal evidence is admissible because it contradicts the defendant\u2019s professed love of the children.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">Here, the rebuttal evidence was narrowly focused on refuting defendant\u2019s denial that he had told Ms. Culkar about his belief that it was acceptable for family members to initiate young girls into sexual activity. This in turn was in direct response to defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination in which he stated that he had not had sexual activity with the young girls because \"I love those children like they are my own. They call me grandpa, Paw-Paw Frank, because they love me.\u201d Because this was a matter so closely bearing on defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>not error for the prosecutor to have impeached defendant. <em>[Ante </em>at 504.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In essence, the majority argues that whether the defendant had a loving relationship with the victims was a fact of consequence. However, the defendant\u2019s feelings are not at issue. Nowhere is it claimed that the defendant\u2019s feelings for the victims somehow motivated him to commit these offenses. Thus, whether the defendant loved the children is irrelevant to guilt or innocence. Love for a victim simply says nothing about guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">. Even assuming that defendant\u2019s love of the victims was somehow relevant, the testimony regarding defendant\u2019s belief that young girls should have sex with their older male relatives does nothing to rebut the proposition that he loved these children. No matter how repulsive the defendant\u2019s beliefs are, they have nothing to do with his feelings for the victims. That a defendant holds an abhorrent belief does not logically make it more or less likely that he loves or hates those whom the belief affects. Indeed, the alleged beliefs of the defendant are directed against those whom the defendant would presumably love the most: his own family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s beliefs were directed towards newly or nearly pubescent girls. This has little relevance to the three-year-old complainant in this case. Neither the majority nor the prosecutor argues that the defendant was implementing his beliefs with these girls, probably because it stretches credulity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The rebuttal testimony of Culkar could not have been introduced by the prosecutor in his case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>chief because it is not relevant to a material issue<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the prosecutor could prove independently of its use as rebuttal evidence. Accordingly, the prosecutor was bound by the defendant\u2019s answer that he never told anyone that children should have sex with their male relatives, because this was a collateral matter, and a witness may not be impeached with extrinsic evidence on collateral matters. <em>People v Teague, </em>411 Mich 562, 566; 309 NW2d 530 (1981). While the majority pays lip service to this rule, citing <em>People v McGillen No 1, </em>392 Mich 251; 220 NW2d 677 (1974),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and other authority, it fails to follow that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">For example, the majority represents that \"[t]his Court has stated that when the rebuttal testimony at issue was a simple contradiction of the defendant\u2019s testimony that directly tended to disprove the exact testimony given by the witness, it was proper rebuttal testimony. <em>People v Sutton (After Remand), </em>436 Mich 575, 597, n 23; 464 NW2d 276 (1990).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 505-506. This ignores the fact that the lead opinion in <em>Sutton </em>was signed by only three justices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Chief Justice Brickley concurred in the result reached by Justice Boyle only because he held that defendant had waived the substantive issue by failing to object. Had he reached the substantive issue, the Chief Justice indicated that he would have joined Justice Levin\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">The record before us has been sufficiently developed for the Court to rule on whether the prosecutor\u2019s question on cross-examination was in fact error. On this issue I agree with Justice Levin that the question itself constituted error because it was an attempt by the prosecutor to use defendant\u2019s postarrest, post<em>-Miranda </em>[v <em>Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966)] silence for impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">However, I concur in the result reached by Justice Boyle because defendant waived any claim of error. <em>I join in her analysis to the extent that defendant\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s question on cross-examination pointing to a post-Miranda period waived any claim of error as to the question posed. </em>I therefore also agree with Justice Boyle\u2019s analysis regarding admissibility of defendant\u2019s responses and further questioning resulting therefrom. <em>[Id. </em>at 600. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Contrary to the belief of the majority, it is clear that Chief Justice Brickley believed that because the defendant failed to object, no relief was available. It is equally clear, however, that had an objection been raised, he would have signed Justice Levin\u2019s opinion. Properly understood, Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s concurring opinion simply reaffirms the long-established rule that a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>object at the trial level will preclude subsequent appellate review in most circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Thus, the \"Court\u201d did not make the statement attributed to it; Justices Boyle, Griffin and Riley did. It is axiomatic that it takes a majority of the participating justices to speak for the \"Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals because the asserted evidentiary errors were not harmless. The defendant\u2019s conviction should be overturned because of the improper use of specific instances of conduct and their proof by extrinsic evidence on rebuttal. Having disposed of the case on this basis, I see no need to reach the issue of religion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> While I agree that sometimes the testimony of a witness may \"open the door\u201d on a pertinent trait of character, courts should be extremely reluctant to find that such is the case lest the Pandora\u2019s box of character evidence be opened every time the prosecutor draws a statement from a witness that arguably relates to a character trait.
