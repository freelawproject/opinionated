Instead, we hold that where a convicted defendant dies pending appeal, the appeal should be dismissed, absent collateral consequences not presented here, and the underlying conviction and accompanying compensatory sentencing sanctions should stand. Purely penal sanctions, however, should be abated ab initio because they no longer continue to serve a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">On September 20, 1990, defendant Louis Peters entered a plea of no contest to four counts of burning dwelling houses, MCL 750.72; MSA 28.267; two counts of burning real property, MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268; four counts of burning insured property, MCL 750.75; MSA 28.270; and one count of conspiracy to burn insured property, MCL 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1) and MCL 750.75; MSA 28.270. At sentencing, defendant was ordered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>serve three years\u2019 probation, to pay a criminal fine of $10,000, and to pay $400,000 in restitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The restitution was to be divided between the victims, the City of Detroit ($140,000) and Michigan Basic Property Insurance Association ($260,000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because defendant was suffering from terminal lung cancer, he was not ordered to serve time in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Defendant appealed the amount of the restitution order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, during the pendency of his appeal, defendant died. On notification of defendant\u2019s death, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for entry of an order dismissing the case ab initio.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied the prosecutor\u2019s motion for rehearing, and we denied the prosecution\u2019s leave to appeal the denial of rehearing at that time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On remand, the trial court abated the criminal conviction and $10,000 fine, but held that the $400,000 order of restitution survived the abatement ab initio of the criminal case. The trial court relied on art 1, \u00a7 24 of the Michigan Constitution, which guarantees a crime victim\u2019s right to restitution, and the reasoning of <em>United States v </em>Dudley, 739 F2d 175 (CA 4, 1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Defendant, by his attorney, appealed the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>court\u2019s ruling regarding the order of restitution. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that an order of restitution must be vacated when a defendant\u2019s criminal conviction is abated ab initio because of defendant\u2019s death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The prosecution appealed the abatement of the order of restitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reverse and reinstate the order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">There is no federal constitutional right to an appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the perception of appeal as the opportunity to finally determine a convicted defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence is one source of the rule of abatement ab initio. Despite this perception, it is well established in the federal system that, once convicted, a criminal defendant is no longer presumed innocent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Art 1, \u00a7 20 of the Michigan Constitution does provide for an appeal of right from a criminal conviction. Even given this appeal of right, a criminal conviction in Michigan also destroys the presumption of innocence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A convicted criminal defendant must prove error requiring reversal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is also interesting to note that the appeal of right has recently been limited.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the recent constitutional amendment does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not apply in this case, we find that the appeal of right was personal to the defendant and, therefore, died with him.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In literal application, abatement ab initio erases a criminal conviction from the beginning on the theory that all injuries resulting from the crime \" 'are buried with the offender.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The reasoning behind abatement ab initio varies among jurisdictions ascribing to the rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Some jurisdictions distinguish between appeals of right and discretionary review when applying the rule. Those jurisdictions that have rejected the rule of abatement ab initio may dismiss the appeal,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> abate the appeal,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> allow the appeal to proceed notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s death,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or substitute a personal representative for the defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">This Court\u2019s treatment of appeals from criminal convictions on the defendant\u2019s death has varied. In <em>People v Elauim, </em>393 Mich 601; 227 NW2d 553 (1975), this Court abated ab initio the indictment of a defendant who died pending his appeal from a conviction for first-degree murder. The <em>Elauim </em>Court relied on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Durham v United States, </em>401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>US 481; 91 S Ct 858; 28 L Ed 2d 200 (1971). In <em>Durham, </em>a criminal defendant\u2019s indictment was abated following his death.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, in other cases this .Court has dismissed appeals from criminal convictions that were interrupted by the death of the defendant, apparently allowing' the; convic-. tions to remain intact.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We take this opportunity to clarify our position on abatement ab initio. Where a defendant dies pending an appeal of a criminal conviction, we hold that the appeal should be dismissed, but the conviction retained. The conviction of a criminal defendant destroys the presumption of innocence regardless of the existence of an appeal of right. We therefore find that it is inappropriate to abate a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Further, it is better policy to allow the litigation to end and the presumptively valid conviction to stand than it is to allow the convicted defendant\u2019s survivors to pursue litigation ad infinitum, in an effort to clear the deceased defendant\u2019s name. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>agree with the rationale offered by the Indiana Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">The presumption of innocence falls with a guilty verdict. At that point in time, although preserving all of the rights of the defendant to an appellate review, for good and sufficient reasons we presume the judgment to be valid, until the contrary is shown. To wipe out such a judgment, for any reason other than a showing of error, would benefit neither party to the litigation and appears to us likely to produce undesirable results in the area of survivor\u2019s rights in more instances that it would avert an injustice.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Finally, we see no state interest, under the facts presented in this case, that can be served by allowing an appeal to proceed when the defendant is not available for trial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Given our decision to dismiss an appeal and retain the conviction where a criminal defendant dies with an appeal pending, we now consider the status of fines, penalties, and orders that may accompany a criminal conviction. The majority of jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have found that the resolution turns on the purpose the fine, penalty, or order is to serve. Typically, jurisdictions have identified two purposes for the sanctions associated with a criminal conviction: penal and compensatory.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The majority of jurisdictions abate or dismiss sanctions that are primarily pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>nal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, where the intent behind a fine or order is to compensate the victim, the fine'or order may survive the death of the offender.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although the distinction between penal and compensatory is helpful, it is not always clear. Indeed, with almost any sanction, it is possible to identify both penal and compensatory purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In this case, we address whether an order of restitution should abate on the death of defendant. Although defendant argued that the order was a penalty because it would force him to pay a large sum of money, the order was designed to compensate the City of Detroit Fire Department and Michigan Basic for their combined costs of approximately $456,000. Pursuant to stipulation by the parties, a substantial portion of those costs were to be recouped by the victims through restitution. However, the fact that defendant, now his estate, will experience some- \"financial pain\u201d does not transform the restitution order into a primarily penal sanction. Erasing the order of restitution or even attempting to divine the portion of the order that the trial judge acknowledged he hoped would cause some \"financial pain\u201d is inconsistent with the Michigan Constitution and the Michigan Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act. These laws authorized the payment of restitution, because the victims had suffered significant losses as a result of defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The Michigan Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act was enacted in 1985 in response to growing recognition of the concerns of crime victims. The act codifies a crime victim\u2019s right to restitution, while leaving to the discretion of the sentencing judge the form the restitution will take:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>[T]he court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of a crime, shall order, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law or in addition to any other penalty required by law, that the defendant make full or partial restitution to any victim of the defendant\u2019s course of conduct that gives rise to the conviction, or to the victim\u2019s estate.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In 1988, after the enactment of the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act, Michigan\u2019s Constitution was amended to further enumerate the rights of crime victims.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> These laws underscore the rights of crime victims and the compensatory nature of restitution in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">At sentencing in this case, the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s office, on behalf of the Detroit Fire Department, and Michigan Basic, on its own behalf, presented evidence of defendant\u2019s financial victimization of them. The prosecutor requested $179,106.24 to cover the costs incurred by the Detroit Fire Department in extinguishing the fires that were the subject of the defendant\u2019s no contest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>plea. Michigan Basic reviewed a decade of records involving claims in which defendant was a named insured and discovered that it had paid defendant approximately $800,000 as a result of ninety fires. In twenty-five of those fires, involving payments of approximately $277,000, arson was suspected.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> After some discussion off the record, the parties orally stipulated to and the trial court adopted a $400,000 restitution figure.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">On the basis of some language employed by the trial judge,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> counsel for defendant argued on appeal that the restitution order was primarily penal. The Court of Appeals apparently agreed. We find that the Court of Appeals and defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>sel\u2019s narrow focus on a few comments made by the trial judge fails to account for the totality of the trial judge\u2019s considerations at sentencing. There is no doubt that an order of restitution would cause this defendant financial pain, but financial pain does not automatically render the order primarily penal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The order of restitution was issued under the authority of the Michigan Constitution and the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act. Art 1, \u00a7 24 and the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act were intended to enable victims to be compensated fairly for their suffering at the hands of convicted offenders. It is clear that the Court of Appeals did not recognize that the trial court intended that the order of restitution defray the financial loss suffered by the victims, Michigan Basic, and the Detroit Fire Department. Once the amount of restitution was decided, the trial judge emphasized that the proration of the restitution between the victims was . a matter for them to decide and not a concern for the court or defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Counsel for defendant cross appealed the voluntariness of the plea, arguing that it would be improper to allow a challenged order of restitution to stand. The Court of Appeals did not address the voluntariness of the plea, and we denied leave to appeal that issue. However, the logic that supports dismissing the appeal also supports enforcing the order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-9\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\"> 448 Mich 851 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> 393 Mich 601; 227 NW2d 553 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> Defendant was also ordered confined to his home for the first year of probation, to pay for the associated costs of that confinement, and not to practice real estate during his probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"><em> </em>The City of Detroit estimated that it had expended approximately $179,106.24 fighting the fires that were the subject of defendant\u2019s convictions.

In other words, I would uphold our prior decision in <em>People v Elauim, </em>393 Mich 601; 227 NW2d 553 (1975). However, I would take this opportunity to confine Elauim\u2019s application to cases in which the defendant dies pending his <em>appeal of right </em>In cases in which the defendant dies pending a <em>discretionary appeal, </em>I would hold that such an appeal should be dismissed as moot, and that the conviction and collateral consequences of the conviction should stand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">When a defendant dies while his appeal of right is pending, I believe that the defendant\u2019s <em>appeal </em>and <em>conviction </em>should be abated for the reason endorsed by some federal courts, and by the instant Court of Appeals panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">The Supreme Court may dismiss the petition without prejudicing the rights of the deceased petitioner, for he has already had the benefit of the appellate review of his conviction to which he was entitled of right. In contrast, when an appeal has been taken from a criminal conviction to the court of appeals and death has <em>deprived the accused of his right to [an </em>appellate] <em>decision, the interests of justice ordinarily require that he not stand convicted without resolution of the merits of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>his appeal, which is an \"integral part of </em>[our] <em>system for \u00f1nally adjudicating [his] guilt or innocence.\u201d Griffin v Illinois, </em>351 US 12, 18; 76 S Ct 585, 590; 100 L Ed 891 (1956). <em>[United States v Moehlenkamp, </em>557 F2d 126, 128 (CA 7, 1977). Emphasis added. See also <em>United States v Asset, </em>990 F2d 208, 210-211 (CA 5, 1993); <em>United States v Oberlin, </em>718 F2d 894 (CA 9, 1983); <em>United States v Pauline, </em>625 F2d 684, 685 (CA 5, 1980); 205 Mich App 312, 317; 517 NW2d 773 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">When a defendant dies while his appeal of right is pending, I believe that any <em>further sanctions or orders arising from the defendant\u2019s conviction </em>should be abated for the following reasons stated by the instant Court of Appeals panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">In contrast to the holding in <em>[United States </em>v] <em>Dudley </em>[739 F2d 175 (CA 4, 1984)], we hold that a restitution order is dismissed when it is based on a criminal conviction that is abated ab initio. We arrive at this conclusion by considering the rationale behind the principle of abatement, which provides that a defendant should not stand convicted when death deprives the defendant of the right to an appellate decision. <em>[United States v Asset, supra </em>at 210-211.] This rationale is based on the premise that the resolution of an appeal can reverse a conviction. It is obvious that an appellate decision can also reverse those orders arising from a conviction such as a restitution order. Furthermore, the importance of an appellate decision is apparent in the Michigan Constitution, which declares that criminal defendants have a right to appeal. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20. With this in mind, we believe that the principle of abatement extends to a restitution order where a defendant\u2019s death prevents an appeal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">In order to abide by defendant\u2019s right to appeal, we dismiss the restitution order because appellate review is not possible. Although the victim has a right to restitution, this right does not entitle the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>victim to restitution imposed by an order that is not subject to appellate review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">In addition, we disagree with the analysis in <em>Dudley </em>that a restitution order survives abatement ab initio of the underlying conviction on the ground that the primary purpose of restitution is to compensate the victim. Restitution under MCL 780.766(2); MSA 28.1287(766X2) is part of the court\u2019s sentence, see <em>[People </em>v] <em>Schluter </em>[204 Mich App 60; 514 NW2d 489 (1994)], and is dependent upon the existence of a conviction. If the conviction is void, then the restitution order also becomes void because a victim\u2019s right to restitution remains dependent on a conviction. Thus, we are not convinced that a restitution order\u2019s compensatory purpose determines whether the order survives abatement ab initio of the underlying conviction. [205 Mich App 319-320.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Obviously, I have a fundamental difference of opinion with the majority concerning the significance of a convicted defendant\u2019s constitutional right to an appeal. I cannot accept the majority\u2019s position that considerations of judicial economy are more important than assuring a proper appellate resolution of the guilt or innocence of a convicted defendant. (\"[I]t is better policy to allow the litigation to end and the presumptively valid conviction to stand than it is to allow the convicted defendant\u2019s survivors to pursue litigation ad infinitum, in an effort to clear the deceased defendant\u2019s name.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 521.) In my view, the interest of justice requires deference to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to an appeal when the defendant dies during the pendency of an appeal of right. While I am aware that a victim has a constitutional right to restitution and that a convicted defendant is no longer presumed innocent, I also believe that when the issues are compensation stemming from a conviction versus a final adjudication of a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, notions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>of fundamental fairness demand giving priority to the latter guarantee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Because the defendant in this case died during the pendency of his appeal of right, I would abate the entire criminal cause \u2014 including the restitution order stemming from the conviction. The decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> The majority of federal courts likewise distinguish between appeals of right and discretionary appeals, and apply the abatement ab initio rule to abate at least the appeal and conviction when the defendant dies pending an appeal of right. See <em>United States v Davis, </em>953 F2d 1482 (CA 10, 1992); <em>Clarke v United States, </em>286 US App DC 256; 915 F2d 699 (1990); <em>United States v Williams, </em>874 F2d 968 (CA 5, 1989); <em>United States v Schumann, </em>861 F2d 1234 (CA 11, 1988); <em>United States v Mollica, </em>849 F2d 723 (CA 2, 1988); <em>United States </em>v <em>Wilcox, </em>783 F2d 44 (CA 6, 1986); <em>United States v Littlefield, </em>594 F2d 682 (CA 8, 1979); <em>United States v Bechtel, </em>547 F2d 1379 (CA 9, 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> The majority misreads the Court of Appeals analysis of the compensatory component to the restitution order. The majority indicates that the reason that the Court of Appeals abated the restitution order in this case was because the Court considered the order to be \"primarily penal.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The Court of Appeals explicitly acknowledged both the compensatory and penal qualities of a restitution order. (\"This Court has recognized that the purpose of restitution is to compensate the injured party. ... In addition, a- restitution order authorized under statute has punitive aspects.\u201d 205 Mich App 319.) However, the Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to determine which qualities predominated in the instant order because the Court\u2019s analysis of the abatement rule\u2019s application to the order did not turn upon the purpose of the order. Instead, the Court emphasized the relationship between the conviction and the restitution order. Recognizing that the conviction had to be abated under its understanding of the abatement doctrine, and further recognizing that the restitution order in this case was based on that conviction, the Court concluded that the restitution order likewise had to be abated. See, i.e., \"If the conviction is void, then the restitution order also becomes void because a victim\u2019s right to restitution remains dependent on a conviction.\u201d 205 Mich App 320. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, whether the restitution served a compensatory or penal purpose was not the dispositive factor under the Court of Appeals analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
