It was a clear day. Shortly before the accident, the defendant and Bobby Osborne engaged in a drag race on Jennings Road in Genesee County. The defendant was driving a blue Pontiac Trans Am. Osborne was driving a Chevrolet Z-28 Camaro.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Even after the drag race ended and Mr. Osborne had stopped at the side of the road, the defendant continued to drive extremely fast. The most complete description of the accident comes from witness Daniel Frederick, who was traveling southbound \u2014 the same direction as the defendant \u2014 in the far right lane. Earlier, he had passed between the defendant\u2019s car and Mr. Osborne\u2019s car as they were preparing for their race. He essentially stated that the victim, who checked for traffic before entering the road, jogged across the southbound lanes a safe distance in front of his car, which was traveling the legal speed limit. When the victim reached the northbound lanes, he was struck by the defendant\u2019s southbound car, which had been traveling at about twice the speed limit and had swerved into the northbound lanes in an attempt to avoid him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\"><em>A. </em>I noted that the blue car was closing the gap between our cars, you know, rapidly, and I, ah, noted that he also, as I traveled down I noted that he cut over one lane. In other words, he went into the \u2014 still in the southbound lanes, but heading\u2014 he was in the west whereas he was in the east lane cornin\u2019 up from behind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\"><em>Q. </em>So he is in the center?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes, that\u2019s correct. And I continued down to the baseball players \u2014 the two guys playing base<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ball. I didn\u2019t see the ball go. I assume they were hit \u2014 earlier I had seen them hit a ball, so I assumed that they were . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\"><em>Q. </em>Well, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t assume. Just tell what you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\"><em>A. </em>I saw a guy \u2014 there was probably, oh, a car- and-a-half, two cars ahead of me and I saw the guys that was playin\u2019 ball in front of my car. He had an adequate amount of time. I didn\u2019t even have to slow up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\"><em>Q. </em>How many car lengths is this now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\"><em>A. </em>I would estimate probably about two car lengths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\"><em>Q. </em>How long are you calling a car length?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\"><em>A. </em>All right, let\u2019s say car lengths would be \u2014 let\u2019s say \u2014 well, actually it would be more than that. I would say probably 30 feet anyways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\"><em>Q. </em>So he runs into your lane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\"><em>A. </em>I think that would be a better explanation. A jog \u2014 kind of a slowish jog into the street. Like I said, he had plenty of time to get in front of my car. I noted that he looked at me and seen he had time and ran . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">\u25a0 <em>Q. </em>Okay, you saw him look at you. You looked to the left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\"><em>A. </em>Yeah, he looked in my direction and saw my car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-16\"><em>Q. </em>Was that before he entered the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-17\"><em>A. </em>Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-18\"><em>Q. </em>Now he enters Jennings Road and he goes where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-19\"><em>A. </em>Continues on across the street. Now he goes into the next lane, which would be the \u2014 still in the southbound lanes, and he went into the\u2014 which would be the westbound lane \u2014 excuse me, the western lane, and . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-20\"><em>Q. </em>You would have been in lane number 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-21\"><em>A. </em>I would have been in lane number 1. Okay. The baseball player cut in front of my car, going from 1 towards 2. All right . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Q. </em>What did you see happen when he was in lane 2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><em>A. </em>I glanced in my rear view mirror and the blue car was rapidly closing the gap. He was in the same lane as. the young man runnin\u2019 \u2014 or joggin\u2019. At that time the blue car.veered to the left to avoid him. He went over into what would be the northbound lanes, probably one-and-one-half lanes, so he was probably \u2014 his car \u2014 he had probably\u2014 from the driver\u2019s wheel I would say he had like maybe two feet before he would have hit the curb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\"><em>Q. </em>But where was the person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\"><em>A. </em>Okay, in the second lane he glanced over this way to the left, but he was still running. He ran\u2014 continued to run, saw the blue car, and did like\u2014 the best way I can describe it it would be a momentary pause or stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">He would be in \u2014 by now he was in \u2014 probably what would be lane 3. In other words, he would have been in the northbound lanes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\"><em>Q. </em>He would have crossed the center line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\"><em>Q. </em>After he did that little pause what did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\"><em>A. </em>After he did the pause he looked and then he just took a step?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\"><em>Q. </em>And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">The right front fender of the defendant\u2019s car hit the victim, Greg Amman, whom the parties stipulated had a blood alcohol content of 0.09 percent by weight, \"and kind of rolled him along the side, and at the post \u2014 around the door post it threw him off and he sort of slid ending up almost in the center line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">The evidence supporting the verdict establishes that the defendant was driving approximately ninety miles an hour when the right front fender of his car struck the decedent, and seventy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>eighty miles an hour a quarter to half a mile down the road. Mr. Frederick testified that the car struck the victim just as Mr. Tims had completed passing him. At that time, he was traveling at forty-five miles an hour himself, and the defendant was traveling at ninety miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">John Gough testified that as he was traveling northbound on the inside (west)'lane of Jennings Road about one-half to one-quarter mile south of the accident, \"I seen a body flying through the air, a blue Trans Am goin\u2019 \u2014 well, after I seen the body cornin\u2019 in my lane, so I come to a stop, and the Trans Am went by me on the right and another car went by me on the left \u2014 a silver Camaro.\u201d Mr. Gough, a thirty-two-year-old former drag racer, estimated that the blue Trans Am was traveling severity to eighty miles an hour at the time it passed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Two separate sets of recently made skid marks were observed at the scene of the accident: a set of marks sixty-one feet long, crossing the center line, and a set of skid marks twenty-nine feet long, following those. Officer Caterer testified that the gap between the two sets of skid marks could be caused by one of two factors: \"the fading of the brakes or the fact that the tire was locked and sliding but just not merely making a mark on that concrete surface,\u201d which he had previously explained does not show skid marks well.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">An accident reconstruction expert who was asked about the minimum speed necessary to produce a skid mark sixty-one feet long<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> answered that a car must be traveling at a minimum speed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of about thirty-nine to forty-three miles an hour.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The figure of thirty-nine to forty-three miles an hour appears to be calculated with the assumption that the defendant\u2019s car stopped at the end of sixty-one feet. As stated previously, however, the defendant did not stop either when he struck the victim or at the end of the first skid mark, and instead drove on at a speed of between seventy and eighty miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. Instead, he claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \" 'a substantial\u2019 cause of the fatal accident.\u201d Defense counsel, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>argued in closing that the victim darted out in front of the defendant\u2019s car and that the defendant could not have avoided the accident, had requested an instruction that the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \"the\u201d cause of the accident. The Court of Appeals agreed that the instruction was erroneous, and reversed. 202 Mich App 335, 339-340; 508 NW2d 175 (1993). We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 445 Mich 862 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>PEOPLE v KNEIP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">At approximately 1:50 a.m. on August 25, 1990, Steven Barnes was killed when defendant Kneip\u2019s vehicle struck him. Mr. Barnes, a barefoot pedestrian, clad only in a pair of shorts and carrying his tennis shoes \u2014 one in each hand \u2014 was slowly crossing Haggerty Road near Cherry Hill Road in Canton Township. This area was dark and was not illuminated by artificial lighting. Mr. Barnes had reached the left-turn lane when defendant\u2019s vehicle approached. Defendant, who was driving south on Haggerty Road, proceeded into the left-turn lane in order to negotiate a left turn, when his vehicle struck Mr. Barnes. Defendant was not speeding, and there is no. indication that he was driving erratically. However, he was drunk. Thus, his ability to react properly was impaired. A blood alcohol test administered three hours after the accident revealed that defendant had a blood alcohol level of 0.18 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">A witness of the accident examined Mr. Barnes immediately after the impact and determined that he was still breathing. As a result of the impact, he was thrown from the left-turn lane into the middle of the northbound lane of Haggerty Road. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>His head was pointing east toward the curb, and his feet were pointing west toward the center lane of Haggerty Road. As the witness knelt over Mr. Barnes, a second car approached. The witness tried to flag the car down, but it drove over Mr. Barnes, causing severe internal injuries and narrowly avoiding contact with the witness. Expert testimony indicated that both sets of injuries were severe and independently could have resulted in Mr. Barnes\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Defendant was tried in a bench trial before Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court Judge Michael F. Sapala. The judge recognized that a conflict exists regarding the proximate cause element.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>He ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\"When a number of factors contribute to produce an injury, one actor\u2019s negligence will not be considered a proximate cause of the harm unless it was a substantial factor in producing the injury.\u201d\u2122</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">The defendant\u2019s conduct, then, was without question a substantial cause of the death of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The court rendered an oral opinion, finding that defendant\u2019s negligence was \"a\u201d proximate cause of Mr. Barnes\u2019 death. He also noted that Mr. Barnes\u2019 contributory negligence of walking in the left-turn lane of an extremely dark road, although not considered an affirmative defense, and the negligence of the second driver both were \"factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>leading to the death of the deceased . . . Defendant was sentenced to five years probation, with the first year to be spent on a tether. The tether option was subsequently removed, leaving the remaining sentence intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction. Although the panel believed that \"a\u201d proximate cause is the appropriate standard, it was obligated by Administrative Order Nos. 1990-6 and 1993-4 to follow <em>Tims. </em>We granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 446 Mich 866 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Because the causation element for negligent homicide and involuntary manslaughter is defined by the common law, we must examine the case law of Michigan and foreign jurisdictions regarding the proximate cause elements of these crimes. Involuntary manslaughter, of which defendant Kneip was convicted, is proscribed by MCL 750.321; MSA 28.553, which does not specifically define the offense. \"Involuntary manslaughter is the unintentional <em>killing of another </em>without malice\u201d in combination with a specified culpable act or mental state, <em>People v Beach, </em>429 Mich 450, 477; 418 NW2d 861 (1988) (emphasis added), which includes a causation component. We construe the causation element in accordance with its common-law meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Negligent homicide, of which defendant Tims was convicted, is also proscribed by statute. See MCL 750.324; MSA 28.556. Although the statute includes a causation element, it provides no guidance regarding the scope of that element. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the scope and necessary connection between the act and injury has been left to common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The common-law causation element is comprised of two components, cause-in-fact or proximate/ legal cause. In order to convict a defendant of a criminal negligence offense, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a factual cause of the fatal accident. Current Michigan practice is to instruct the jury that a defendant\u2019s conduct must be \"a substantial cause,\u201d which appears to combine two verbal formulas employed in other jurisdictions: that a defendant\u2019s negligence must be a \"but for\u201d cause, or that it must be a \"substantial factor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Although a cause-in-fact relationship is often sufficient, cases arise in which the death is so remote from the defendant\u2019s conduct that it would be unjust to permit conviction. In such a case, the question for the jury is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was the proximate or legal cause of the decedent\u2019s death. See, e.g., <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 198; 148 NW 400 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">in '</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 CLAIM OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Each defendant raises the same arguments: he may be convicted only if his conduct was \"the\u201d cause of death, and his conviction was erroneous because the trier of fact determined only that his culpable conduct was \"a\u201d cause. The rule urged by the defendants, if accepted, would mean that the negligence of either the victim or a third party, if it was also a proximate cause of death, would be a complete defense._</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The defendants\u2019 arguments were accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeals in <em>Tims. </em>Although agreeing with the view that the defendant\u2019s conduct need only be \"a\u201d substantial cause of the accident, the majority reluctantly concluded that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>People v Barnes, supra, People v Townsend, </em>214 Mich 267, 275; 183 NW 177 (1921), and <em>People v Layman, </em>299 Mich 141, 145; 299 NW 840 (1941), held that a defendant\u2019s culpable conduct must be \"the\u201d cause of death, as opposed to \"a\u201d cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Although we recognize that this Court has created a conflict on this issue, we are precluded from resolving it. No conflict exists on the issue within the Michigan Supreme Court. According to our Supreme Court, in order for a defendant to be convicted of vehicular homicide, his conduct must be \"the proximate cause\u201d of the death. [202 Mich App 339-340 (Marilyn Kelly, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On this basis, the Court found that the jury instructions were error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">We agree with the Court of Appeals understanding that the proper test is \"a\u201d cause. There is no support in this Court\u2019s decisions for the contrary view, and no policy justification for its adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The phrase \"the proximate cause\u201d is a legal colloquialism reflecting the reality that, particularly in homicide cases, there is almost invariably only one <em>culpable </em>act that could be considered a direct cause \u2014 a knife being stabbed, a gun being fired, or a car driven recklessly. The phrase does not imply that a defendant is responsible for harm only when his act is the sole antecedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The suggestion that the presence of an additional \"cause\u201d of death could be a complete defense to negligent homicide is inconsistent with accepted notions of responsibility. Acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>such a proposition would require, for example, that if an infant died because it was locked in a hot car on a sunny day, and the child was left there by two parents rather than one, neither could be found criminally responsible. Similarly, if a guest died in a hotel fire that began because another guest was setting off firecrackers in a room, the latter guest\u2019s extremely culpable conduct would be excused or mitigated if it turned out that, unknown to him at the time, another person doing the same thing also set a fire accidentally at the other end of the hotel. Such examples illustrate the basis for the sound proposition embodied in the doctrine of \"a\u201d substantial cause, that joint equal causes do not excuse culpable behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\"><em>PEOPLE v TIMS: </em>THE ACTS OF THE VICTIM</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The other \"causal factor\u201d in <em>Tims </em>was the alleged negligence of the victim. The defendants\u2019 proposed rule, if accepted, would make the negligence of the victim a complete defense in prosecutions of negligent homicide and vehicular manslaughter. Our Court, however, has long held that although a victim\u2019s contributory negligence is a factor to consider in determining whether the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the victim\u2019s death, it is not a defense. In <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 195 (adopting <em>State v Campbell, </em>82 Conn 671; 74 A 927 (1910), we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\"The rule of law concerning contributory negligence by the injured person, as a defense in civil actions for damages for personal injuries, had no application to this case. The State was required to prove the alleged unlawful act of the accused and its consequences, but not that the deceased exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>cised due care <em>to avoid the </em>consequences of that unlawful act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We reaffirmed that rule in <em>People v Campbell, </em>237 Mich 424; 212 NW 97 (1927), in which we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because the trial court excluded evidence of the victim\u2019s conduct that was relevant in determining whether the defendant was negligent. In the process, we noted that, although the victim\u2019s negligence is admissible for that purpose, it is not a defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">The defendant . . . testified that he was keeping a lookout, but that he assumed that no person would be walking out in that part of the highway where he was driving. The deceased were not crossing the highway. . . . Considering the darkness, the misty atmosphere, the slippery condition of the pavement, their position in the highway, the fact that there was a safer place to walk, and their knowledge of the fact that automobiles would be constantly overtaking them from the rear, were the deceased, at the time of the accident, using ordinary care for their own safety? <em>If they were not, that fact would not be a defense, </em>but it would be an important factor in the case which the defendant would be entitled to have the jury consider. <em>[Id. </em>at 431. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">This longstanding Michigan rule is no aberration. It appears to be the universal rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>In <em>Tims, </em>the trial court properly instructed the jury that it \"must consider the conduct of Mr. Amman in determining whether the driving of Mr. Tims was a substantial cause of the accident.\u201d Because the alleged negligence of the victim, if established, would not have required acquittal, it was proper to instruct the jury that the defendant\u2019s conduct need only be \"a\u201d proximate cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\"><em>PEOPLE v KNEIP: </em>THE ACTS OF A THIRD PARTY</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\"><em>Kneip </em>involves not only possible negligence by the victim, but also by a third party. It is equally well established that the negligent act of a third party is not a defense, but is only one factor to be considered in ascertaining whether the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Townsend, </em>although not controlling in this case, affirms the rule that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>contributory negligence of a third party is not a defense. The defendant, who had driven while intoxicated, struck a tree. His passenger died in the hospital. The defendant objected to the jury instructions in his trial for involuntary manslaughter, which stated that the medical treatment received by the decedent was a defense only if it was grossly negligent. In affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction, this Court recounted that a defendant\u2019s act may be the cause of death even if ordinarily (as opposed to grossly) negligent treatment contributed to the death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Defendant cannot exonerate himself from criminal liability by showing that under a different or more skilful treatment the doctor might have saved the life of the deceased and thereby have avoided the natural consequences flowing from the wounds. Defendant was not entitled to go to the jury upon the theory claimed unless the medical treatment was so grossly erroneous or unskilful as to have been the cause of the death, for it is no defense to show that other or different medical treatment might or would have prevented the natural consequences flowing from the wounds. [214 Mich 279.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The Court quoted from a treatise in which the rule of law was \"well stated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\"He who inflicted the injury is liable even though the medical or surgical treatment which was the direct cause of the death was erroneous or unskilful, or although the death was due to the negligence or failure by the deceased to procure treatment or take proper care of the wound. The same is true with respect to the negligence of nurses or other attendants. This rule is sometimes stated with the qualification that the wound must have been mortal or dangerous; but it is usually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>held that the defendant is liable, although the wound was not mortal.\u201d [Id. at 278-279.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>Kneip, </em>the other \"causal factor\u201d was the unidentified car that ran over the victim after he was struck by the defendant. The expert testimony, however, was that the victim would have died whether or not he had been struck by the second car. '</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">THE POSITION OF THE DISSENTING OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">We are apparently unanimous in rejecting the defendants\u2019 only claim of error. The signers of the dissenting opinion would nevertheless reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Tims </em>by establishing and applying retrospectively a rule that has not been asked for by the parties or addressed by any court at any stage of this litigation: that a \"defendant\u2019s conduct sufficiently dominated the other contributing factors ... to be fairly deemed a criminal proximate cause . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">We note that, like the defendants\u2019 proposed rule, the dissenters\u2019 proposed requirement also fails the test of common sense. Insofar as it requires that a \"defendant\u2019s conduct dominate[] other contributing factors,\u201d the justices would apparently forbid any conviction where a death was jointly caused by independent but identical acts, such as parents who leave their child in a hot car to suffocate. From both a common-sense and a legal perspective, we cannot discern any reason that a defendant whose negligent conduct causes the death of a person should be excused by virtue of the fact that another person was also negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">To the extent that the proposed requirement is intended to prevent drivers from being convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>for homicide for accidents that they could not have avoided, the law has prevented this unjust result for at least a century. The exacting rules of criminal causation dictate that a driver is not in fact or law the cause of a deceased\u2019s death unless the proofs are such that a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant could have avoided the accident. Absent such proofs, the defendant is entitled to dismissal of the charge, a directed verdict, or an order reversing the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The rule that a defendant may not be convicted for a crime that he could not have avoided has long been settled. For example, <em>Queen v Dalloway, </em>2 Cox 273 (CC, 1847) (summarized in Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law [3d ed], p 787), involved the death of a child who suddenly ran out in front of a horse-drawn vehicle and was killed. The jury was charged that if, by the utmost care on his part, the driver could not have prevented the accident, he must be acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">This Court adopted the same rule in 1914. See <em>People v Barnes, supra. </em>That case involved the death of a young woman, Mary Robb, who was fatally injured when she was struck by the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant testified that as he drove within a few feet of two girls, \"the Robb girl got in front of the machine.\u201d Id. at 183. The trial judge instructed the jury that if the defendant was driving in excess of ten miles an hour,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">then he may be found guilty of manslaughter, even though he made the best endeavor possible under such speed to avert the accident, and even though Mary Robb, in bewilderment, or heedlessness, or carelessness, ran in front of the automobile .... <em>[Id. </em>at 189.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">We reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\"the charge of the court eliminated all necessary connection between the speed of the car and the death of Mary Robb.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. \"From aught that appears in this record, the injury might have occurred just the same if the respondent had been running 9 miles an hour as it would were he running 11 miles an hour.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">[W]ould it be claimed here that, because respondent was by one mile per hour exceeding the legal speed limit, he would be responsible for the death of Mary Robb, if in her excitement and confusion she jumped in front of the car at a time when it was physically impossible for the respondent to stop it before inflicting the injury? Would the mere fact that a car was being operated slightly in excess of the legal speed limit make a respondent guilty of manslaughter if a person wilfully threw himself in front of the car and received injury? To ask these questions is to answer them in the negative. <em>[Id. </em>at 195-196.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">By claiming that it has established this principle for the first time, the dissent would invite attacks on convictions obtained under settled rules that presented the identical concept to factfinders, albeit in different words than those now decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Despite protestations to the contrary, the dissent incorrectly advances the notion that a victim\u2019s negligence can be a defense to negligent homicide under certain circumstances, rather than simply a factor for the jury to consider. Thus it appears that the dissent holds that unless defendant\u2019s act is found to \"sufficiently dominate\u201d other causes, a defendant would apparently be entitled to acquittal even if a jury finds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(1) the defendant was negligent,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">(2) the -victim would not have died but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(3) the death was a foreseeable risk of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The established rule' is that the negligence of the victim, if any, should be considered in making determinations 2 and 3. The negligence of the victim is grounds for acquittal only when it shows' that the defendant was not negligent or did not cause the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Where the jury finds that those requirements are satisfied, the conduct of the victim is not a defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">THE OSTENSIBLE JUSTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The dissent attempts to justify the claimed need for a new rule with the claim that \"the criminal standard [for causation] should remain higher [than the civil standard].\u201d <em>Post </em>at 118. This argument is a non sequitur; the dissent fails to explain why the longstanding criminal standard for causation should be heightened simply because the civil standard has been lowered (by the replacement of the contributory negligence defense with comparative negligence). The relevant rules of criminal causation have been the same for more than a century, and the dissenting opinion has failed to point to any circumstances, actual or hypothetical, in which they would allow an unjust conviction. In sum, the dissenting opinion fails to provide a single reason to change these rules and thereby reverse the conviction in Tims._</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The dissenting opinion relies heavily on <em>Commonwealth v Root, </em>403 Pa 571; 170 A2d 310 (1961), for the proposition that criminal causation rules must be amended because they are tied to tort notions of proximate cause that have been liberalized substantially. See <em>post </em>at 119-122. This premise is simply incorrect. As a matter of historical fact, the rules of causation in criminal cases are not tied to the rules of causation in civil cases. For that reason, among others,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the rules of criminal causation have not changed a whit in the face of expanding civil liability. The relevant rules have been the same for at least a century. First, the defendant\u2019s conduct must be a cause of the harm sine qua non. See, e.g., <em>People v Barnes, supra. </em>Second, the harm must be a foreseeable risk of the defendant\u2019s conduct. See, e.g., <em>People v Rockwell, </em>39 Mich 503 (1878) (the defendant hit the victim and left him lying in a field where a horse later trampled him to death; the conviction was reversed because the death was unforeseeable). In particular, the rule that the dissenting opinion would change \u2014 that foreseeable negligence by the victim is not a defense \u2014 seems to have been settled before 1930. See anno: <em>Negligent homicide as affected by negligence or other misconduct of the decedent, </em>67 ALR 922 (collecting cases holding that a victim\u2019s negligence is no defense to negligent homicide).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">To the extent that <em>Commonwealth v Root, supra, </em>holds that a victim\u2019s contributory negligence can be a defense, and this is the commentators\u2019 read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ing of that case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is no longer the law even in Pennsylvania. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v Long, </em>425 Pa Super 170; 624 A2d 200 (1993) (holding that the victim\u2019s intoxication was not a defense to homicide as long as the victim\u2019s death is the natural and foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s actions). Even if other jurisdictions have \"followed the <em>Root </em>rationale,\u201d <em>post </em>at 121-122, the dissenting opinion does not point to any jurisdiction holding that a victim\u2019s negligence can be a defense. As examples, the dissenting opinion cites decisions from New York and Maryland. Both states, however, follow the rule that the negligence of the victim is not a bar to criminal liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>People v Cruciani, </em>36 NY2d 304, 306; 367 NYS2d 758; 327 NE2d 803 (1975); <em>People v Joseph, </em>11 Misc 2d 219, 237; 172 NYS2d 463 (1958); <em>Wilson v State, 74 </em>Md App 204, 213; 536 A2d 1192 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\"><em>Root </em>has been criticized on other grounds as well. Regarding <em>Root </em>and <em>Commonwealth v Redline, </em>391 Pa 486; 137 A2d 472 (1958), Professor LaFave explains that \"to the extent that these cases rely wholly or in part upon the requirement of legal cause as a means of limiting these doctrines, they tend to distort the meaning of legal cause.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (2d ed), \u00a7 3.12(h), p 298. _</p>\n<p id=\"AOt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">HARMLESS ERROR ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Despite the fact that a majority of this Court has rejected the only claim of error in <em>Tims, </em>it appears that a new trial will be ordered. The Court in <em>Tims </em>is equally divid\u00e9d because of harmless error analysis by the dissenting justices that is factually incorrect and contrary to the standard but recently endorsed by five members of this Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even though we do not agree with the dissent\u2019s proposed rule for proximate causation, we note that the instructions, arguments, and verdict show that the jury in <em>Tims </em>made the finding necessary to satisfy that test. Consequently, the conviction should be reinstated even under the dissent\u2019s test.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The dissent would hold that its standard of criminal causation is satisfied when the trier of fact finds that the defendant should have been able to avoid the accident. It would affirm the conviction in <em>Kneip </em>because the trial judge satisfied its requirement by virtue of making the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\"In this case, there was nothing wrong with the defendant\u2019s car; the headlights were functional. In other words, all reasonably prudent drivers must be able to drive, and in fact drive in a manner so as to avoid hitting pedestrians in the roadway; even if a pedestrian\u2019s presence is unexpected; except, of course, where you truly have a case of an individual darting in front of a car as it approaches; where you have a pure accident. That\u2019s not the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\"I find that although the area is clearly dark, and at the time of the impact there was no meaningful street or store lighting; <em>the defendant should have easily been able to avoid the deceased; especially when he was not speeding, or indeed when he was probably under the speed limit.\u201d [Post </em>at 127-128. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">This same finding was also made by the trier of-fact in <em>Tims. </em>The question whether the defendant should have been able to avoid the victim was the primary focus of the trial. Counsel repeatedly argued that his client should not be convicted because he could not have avoided the accident.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury was instructed that it must not convict the defendant if the accident was unavoidable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">Slight negligence is characterized by acts which are not naturally or inherently dangerous to life, which only an extremely careful person would have foreseen as likely to produce injury to another. <em>The fact that an accident occurred is not in itself any evidence of negligence. Whatever is unavoidable by the exercise of due and reasonable care is not a crime. </em>Slight negligence is not a crime. It is that degree or kind of negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>which is below or less than ordinary negligence. In this case if you find that a defendant was negligent, but his negligence was only slight negligence, then you must return a verdict of not guilty. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Anticipating this instruction, Mr. Tims\u2019 attorney incorporated it into his argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the jury was specifically instructed that it should consider the victim\u2019s negligence, if any, in determining whether the defendant was the cause of the accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The jurors\u2019 decision to convict in the face of these instructions and arguments compels the conclusion that they rejected the defendant\u2019s argument and found that the defendant could have avoided the victim with the exercise of reasonable care.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because of this finding, which is sufficient to satisfy the dissent\u2019s \"new\u201d requirement, any technical imperfection in the instructions was not error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">Jury instructions are reviewed as a whole rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>than examined piecemeal to establish error. <em>People v Watkins, </em>178 Mich App 439, 450; 444 NW2d 201 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds 438 Mich 627; 475 NW2d 727 (1991).

However, the dissent misinterprets our reliance on Mr. Gough\u2019s testimony. We accept, without qualification, the scientific evidence and accident reconstructionist\u2019s expert testimony. The expert testimony presents an opinion on the basis of hypothetical facts that were not in existence in the present case. Namely, in the hypothetical example, the defendant\u2019s vehicle came to a stop when he struck the victim. However, in the present case, Mr. Gough witnessed the accident and testified that defendant\u2019s vehicle did not, in fact, come to a stop when he struck the victim, but instead, continued beyond the point of impact. The source of our disagreement with the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the facts rests with its failure to appreciate the distinction between the expert\u2019s response to the hypothetical example and the facts as they exist in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\"> Judge Sapala stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">There is a serious conflict in the State of.

Where there are multiple independent causes contributing to the victim\u2019s injury or death, so that the defendant\u2019s conduct alone would not have caused the death, we would not impose liability for criminal negligence unless the defendant\u2019s conduct sufficiently dominated the other contributing factors, to be fairly deemed a criminal proximate cause, and the injury was reasonably foreseeable from the defendant\u2019s negligence.

On remand, we would direct the trial court to instruct the jury that it should <em>also </em>find that the defendant\u2019s negligence sufficiently dominated the victim\u2019s negligence, in order to find that the defendant was a criminal proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In <em>People v Kneip, </em>even though the trial court erroneously relied on a civil law test for causation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>we find that the trial judge\u2019s opinion from the bench essentially found that the defendant\u2019s gross negligence sufficiently dominated the victim\u2019s negligence to be fairly treated as a criminal proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. The second driver\u2019s negligence was a reasonably foreseeable intervening event that does not relieve the defendant of criminal liability. Therefore, we concur with the majority in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and reinstating the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A. <em>PEOPLE v TIMS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">On July 9, 1989, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Greg Amman was killed when the defendant\u2019s vehicle struck him. The facts were vigorously contested at trial. Shortly before the accident, the defendant and Bobby Osborne had engaged in a drag race on Jennings Road, between Pierson and Pasadena Roads, in Mt. Morris Township. Various lay witnesses estimated that the vehicles were traveling at speeds between seventy and ninety miles an hour, however, one witness testified that the codefendant\u2019s vehicle stopped about a quarter of a mile before the scene of the accident. A police officer testified that the words \"Finish\u201d had been marked in white paint on Jennings Road approximately 1,578 feet before the point of impact. The officer further testified that the road dipped down and then back up, with the highest point in the road being the point of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The victim ran onto Jennings Road to retrieve a whiffle ball, into the path of the defendant. The victim\u2019s view of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was blocked by another vehicle. Likewise, the defendant\u2019s view of the victim was blocked by the same vehicle. The defendant attempted to avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>victim, but failed. An accident reconstruction expert testified that skid marks indicated that the defendant was, at a minimum, traveling between thirty-nine and forty-three miles an hour \"at the beginning of the skid.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The expert\u2019s conclusion was based in part on his finding that the victim\u2019s body slid twenty-seven feet from the point of impact to its final resting place. The expert testified that in accident reconstruction, the procedure is to work backward from the information that is collected at the scene. Therefore, he concluded that in order for a human body to slide twenty-seven feet on the then-current road conditions, the defendant\u2019s vehicle would have been traveling at a minimum speed of twenty-two miles an hour.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>posted speed limit was forty-five miles an hour. At the time of his death, the victim had a blood alcohol level of 0.09 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The defendant was charged with second-degree murder. The prosecution\u2019s theory was that the codefendants had intentionally engaged in a drag race, exhibiting a wanton disregard that a death or great bodily harm would occur, and that the drag race caused the death. The defense theory was that the race had ended before the impact with the victim, that the accident was unavoidable, and that the victim\u2019s own negligence led to his death. After a four-day jury trial, the trial court instructed the jury regarding the causation element of each of the degrees of homicide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Each of these degrees of homicide require a finding . . . that the conduct of Mr. Tims was a substantial cause of the fatal accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The defendant had objected to the instruction, arguing that it was necessary for the jury to find that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \"the\u201d substantial cause of the accident. The defendant was convicted of the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was sentenced to sixteen to twenty-four months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The defendant appealed as of right to the Court of Appeals. The panel felt constrained to follow <em>People v Layman, </em>299 Mich 141, 145; 299 NW 840 (1941), <em>People v Townsend, </em>214 Mich 267, 275; 183 NW 177 (1921), and <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 199; 148 NW 400 (1914), stating that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Court\u2019s holdings in those cases required that the defendant\u2019s conduct be \"the\u201d proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The panel reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \"a\u201d rather than \"the\u201d substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death. We granted the pros-' ecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">B. <em>PEOPLE v KNEIP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On August 25, 1990, at approximately 1:50 a.m., Steven Barnes was killed when the defendant\u2019s vehicle struck him. The victim, a barefoot pedestrian, clad only in a pair of shorts and carrying his tennis shoes \u2014 one in each hand \u2014 was crossing Haggerty Road near Cherry Hill Road in Canton Township. This area was not illuminated by artificial lighting. The victim had reached the left-turn lane when the defendant\u2019s vehicle approached. The defendant, who was driving south on Haggerty Road, entered the left-turn lane in order to make a left turn, when his vehicle struck the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The defendant was not speeding, and there is no indication that he was driving erratically. However, he was drunk.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">As a result of the impact, the victim was thrown from the left-turn lane into the middle of the northbound lane of Haggerty Road. His head was pointing east toward the curb, and his feet were pointing west toward the center lane of Haggerty Road. A witness to the accident examined the victim immediately after the impact and deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>mined that he was still breathing. As the witness knelt over the victim, a second car approached. The witness tried to flag the car down, but it drove over the victim, causing severe internal injuries. The expert testimony indicated that both sets of injuries were severe and independently could have resulted in the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The defendant was tried in a bench trial. The trial court recognized that a conflict existed regarding the proximate cause element and applied the standard used in civil cases. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\"When a number of factors contribute to produce an injury, one actor\u2019s negligence will not be considered a proximate cause of the harm unless it was a substantial factor in producing the injury.\u201d\u00ae</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">The defendant\u2019s conduct, then, was without question a substantial cause of the death of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">It also noted that the victim\u2019s contributory negligence of walking in the left-turn lane of an extremely dark road, although not considered an affirmative defense, and the negligence of the second driver, both were \"factors leading to the death of the deceased . . . .\u201d The defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He was sentenced to five years probation, with the first year to be spent on a tether. The tether option subsequently was removed, leaving the remaining sentence intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, stating that it was obligated to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Tims.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In both <em>Tims </em>and <em>Kneip, </em>the trier of fact merely determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor of the victim\u2019s death. The prosecutor in <em>Kneip </em>argues that the terms \"substantial\u201d factor and \"proximate\u201d cause are interchangeable. We disagree. We believe that the \"but for\u201d and \"substantial factor\u201d cause-in-fact tests are merely the first step in determining causation. Finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor, or a but-for cause of the victim\u2019s injury is not the end of the inquiry: \"[T]he substantial factor test is one of exclusion only. What was not a substantial factor in causing harm was not a proximate cause thereof. What was a substantial factor may have been a proximate cause\u2014 or it may not.\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 780. As in tort, criminal law requires a second level of inquiry into proximate causation, which is often labeled some type of reasonably foreseeable or natural and probable result test. Proximate cause is the inquiry into whether the defendant <em>should </em>be held legally liable for the cause-in-fact result of his conduct. Specifically, is it just or fair to hold this defendant criminally liable for negligent conduct when other contributing factors played a significant role in bringing about the result? That is the issue facing us in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We believe the Court of Appeals confused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>issue by focusing on whether the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \"the sole\u201d proximate cause. There can be situations in which more than one person\u2019s conduct is properly charged as a proximate cause. For instance, where two or more individuals are acting in concert, such as in a conspiracy or an aiding and abetting situation, each actor\u2019s conduct is fairly imputed to the other actors. Likewise, where two or more individuals\u2019 autonomous actions coincide by chance, and each person\u2019s conduct <em>alone </em>could have caused the result, then each person may be charged independently. In either of these situations, each person\u2019s conduct can be fairly charged as a proximate cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The grey area arises when a result happens as a consequence of a combination of independent events. Then we believe that the proximate cause inquiry is whether this defendant\u2019s conduct, as a substantial factor in bringing about a reasonably foreseeable resulting injury, sufficiently dominated the other causal factors, to be fairly deemed a <em>criminal </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The prosecutor in <em>Tims </em>argues that causation should be the same in civil and criminal law contexts. Likewise, the trial court in <em>Kneip </em>used a civil law standard for causation. The defendants and the defense amicus curiae<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> counter that the criminal standard should remain higher. We agree because a mere finding that the defendant\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>duct was a substantial factor, as required by tort law, is insufficient in the criminal context.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The <em>Tims </em>prosecutor has failed to recognize that tort causation principles should not determine criminal causation. Because criminal penalties are generally far more burdensome to defendants than tort remedies, we believe that the causation standards that we use to impose criminal liability should remain more demanding. Moreover, as the defense amicus curiae points out, unlike tort law, which apportions liability among the responsible parties, criminal law is an all-or-nothing decision of guilty or not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The majority contends that an instruction that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor is sufficient. <em>Ante </em>at 95. In tort law, the required finding that the actor was a substantial factor is merely a test to find that the actor contributed in a measurable way to the resulting harm. Even minim\u00e1l causes will be held accountable for corresponding portions of the resulting harm. In sharp contrast, we believe that minimal causes should not be subject to criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In <em>People v Harding, </em>443 Mich 693, 738; 506 NW2d 482 (1993) (Cavanagh, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), it was noted that \"[a] more demanding standard is warranted because the potential deprivation of personal rights is obviously much more extreme in criminal, as opposed to tort, actions.\u201d That opinion cited <em>Commonwealth v Root, </em>403 Pa 571, 575, 580; 170 A2d 310 (1961), which had held that a more direct proximate cause connection is required in criminal homicide prosecutions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Our Court of Appeals adopted the <em>Root </em>reasoning in <em>People v </em>Scott, 29 Mich App 549, 554-555; 185 NW2d 576 (1971). The <em>Scott </em>panel quoted from <em>Root </em>at 574:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\"While precedent is to be found for application of the tort law concept of 'proximate cause\u2019 in fixing responsibility for criminal homicide, the want of any rational basis for its use in determining criminal liability can no longer be properly disregarded. When proximate cause was first borrowed from the field of tort law and applied to homicide prosecutions in Pennsylvania, the concept connoted a much more direct causal relation in producing the alleged culpable result than it does today. Proximate cause, as an essential element of a tort founded in negligence, has undergone in recent times, and is still undergoing, a marked extension. More specifically, this area of civil law has been progressively liberalized in favor of claims for damages for personal injuries to which careless conduct of others can in some way be associated. To persist in applying the tort liability concept of proximate cause to prosecutions for criminal homicide after the marked expansion of <em>civil </em>liability of defendants in tort actions for negligence would be to extend possible <em>criminal </em>liability to persons chargeable with unlawful or reckless conduct in circumstances not generally considered to present the likelihood of a resultant death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The <em>Scott </em>panel concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">Although neither party is able to cite authority which requires that the defendant\u2019s criminally negligent act be the only direct and proximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>cause of the ensuing homicide, <em>this Court </em>feels that the reasoning proffered by the Pennsylvania court in <em>Commonwealth v Root, supra, </em>constitutes the <em>better </em>standard. In criminal prosecutions there must be a more direct causal connection between the criminal conduct of the defendant and the homicide charged than is required by the tort liability concept of proximate cause. <em>[Id. </em>at 558. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Here, the <em>Tims </em>panel struggled with whether to apply <em>Scott </em>or <em>People v Dolen, </em>89 Mich App 277; 279 NW2d 539 (1977), which stated that \"a\u201d proximate cause was sufficient. <em>Tims </em>at 337. A careful reading of <em>Dolen </em>reveals that the <em>Dolen </em>panel <em>approved </em>of the <em>Root </em>reasoning that criminal liability requires a more direct causal connection than civil liability. <em>Id. </em>at 281-282.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Dolen, </em>the panel found that in reaching a guilty verdict, the jury must have concluded that the other driver was <em>not </em>a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because there was only one cause of the victim\u2019s death, the <em>Dolen </em>panel did <em>not </em>decide what jury instructions would have been necessary had the jury found that both drivers were proximate causes of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">A more recent Pennsylvania court summarized post <em>-Root </em>applications of the principle that criminal proximate cause requires a higher standard than civil proximate caus\u00e9. <em>Commonwealth v Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>menter, </em>410 Pa Super 9; 598 A2d 1300 (1991).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <em>Rementer </em>court instructively explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">It is difficult to draw a bright line between causation in the criminal law and in the tort law. Certain principles can, however, be ascertained. In order to impose criminal liability, causation must be direct and substantial. Defendants should not be exposed to a loss of liberty based on the tort standard which only provides that the event giving rise to the injury is a substantial factor. Although typically the tort context refers only to substantial and not to direct and substantial as in the criminal context, the additional language in the criminal law does not provide much guidance. Therefore, criminal causation has come to involve a case-by-case social determination; i.e., is it just or fair under the facts of the case to expose the defendant to criminal sanctions. In other words, was the defendant\u2019s conduct so directly and substantially linked to the actual result as to give rise to the imposition of criminal liability or was the actual result so remote and attenuated that it would be unfair to hold the defendant responsible for it? <em>[Id. </em>at 18-19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Other jurisdictions have likewise followed the <em>Root </em>rationale.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We believe that we should remain in their ranks.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The longstanding rule is that while the victim\u2019s contributory negligence is not an affirmative defense, it <em>is </em>a factor in determining whether the defendant caused the resulting harm.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We have no intention of altering that doctrine. However, fairness dictates that the prima facie causation element, particularly in criminal negligence cases, requires more than the mere finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a factor contributing to the resulting harm. We believe that in criminal negligence cases, when the defendant\u2019s conduct alone could not have independently resulted in the harm, the trier of fact must determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\u2019s conduct sufficiently dominated other contributing factors to be fairly deemed a criminal proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Although the precise language may change from case to case, this idea is certainly not new. In <em>Barnes, </em>the Court considered whether the victim\u2019s death was \"a direct and natural result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 196. In <em>Townsend, </em>the trial court instructed the jury that the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>death must have been \" 'a direct and natural result\u2019 \u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 277. In <em>Layman, </em>the trial court instructed the jury that \" 'Proximate cause means the direct cause ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. All these cases required more than a mere finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a significant factor in causing the death; they required that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a direct cause of the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In the instant case, the defendants each were found to be a substantial factor in the resulting deaths. However, under the longstanding precedent in this state, the triers of fact were further required to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was a direct cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">A Pennsylvania case addressed this concept. <em>Commonwealth v Molinaro, </em>429 Pa Super 29; 631 A2d 1040 (1993). There, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\"In a criminal case, you are not to concern yourselves with the actions of the victim. Contributory negligence of the victim is not a defense to a criminal charge of homicide by motor vehicle if you find that the defendant\u2019s actions were a substantial factor in causing death.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The appellate court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">At no point was the jury instructed that the victim\u2019s conduct should be considered in connection with the causation issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">This instruction contains an inaccurate statement of the applicable law. Under the case law, the jury must be instructed to consider the victim\u2019s actions in connection with the causation determination, where the evidence indicates that those actions may have contributed to the accident. <em>[Id. </em>at 35-36.

We believe that the jury can best determine whether it is fair, on the facts before it, to impose criminal liability on a negligent defendant by instructing the jury that it must find that the defendant\u2019s negligence sufficiently dominated the other contributing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In <em>Tims, </em>the actions of independently acting individuals combined to result in the victim\u2019s death: the victim\u2019s negligence and the defendant\u2019s negligence. Therefore, the cause-in-fact test is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>factor in bringing about the victim\u2019s death. The trial judge instructed the jury about negligent, homicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">Another lesser included offense is the crime of negligent homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">To establish that Mr. Tims is guilty of that crime the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, first, that Mr. Tims was driving a motor vehicle on or about July 9, 1989, in Genesee County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">Second, that he was driving in a careless or negligent manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">Third, that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a <em>substantial cause </em>of an accident resulting in fatal injuries to Mr. Amman![<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The defendant adequately preserved his objection to the instructions during the conference discussing jury instructions by arguing that the instructions should require that the jury find that the defendant was \"the\u201d substantial cause of the death. The trial judge failed to adequately instruct the jury about proximate cause. We find that this was error requiring reversal because it was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The inadequate instruction pertained to an essential element, and, if properly instructed, the jury may have reached a different verdict because we cannot conclude that it necessarily found that the defendant\u2019s negligence sufficiently dominated the victim\u2019s negligence to be fairly treated as a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>proximate cause of the death.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We remand for a new trial. On remand, we direct the trial court to further instruct the jury that it must also find that the defendant\u2019s negligence sufficiently dominated the victim\u2019s negligence, to be fairly treated as a criminal proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death, if that death was also reasonably foreseeable from the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In Kneip, the actions of three independent persons combined to result in the victim\u2019s death: the victim\u2019s negligence, the defendant\u2019s gross negligence, and the second driver\u2019s subsequent negligence. Again, we would apply the substantial-factor test to the original collision between the defendant\u2019s car and the victim. This collision set in motion a \"but-for\u201d chain of events, whereby the victim was struck again by the second driver. This intervening collision was exactly the type of injury that is reasonably foreseeable from the first collision. Consequently, the <em>negligence </em>of the second driver would not qualify as a superseding cause that would cut off the first driver\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">At the bench trial, the trial court applied the tort law standard<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and concluded \"the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial cause of the death.\u201d However, the trial court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">In this case, there was nothing wrong with the defendant\u2019s car; the headlights were functional. In other words, all reasonably prudent drivers must be able to drive, and in fact drive in a manner so as to avoid hitting pedestrians in the roadway; even if a pedestrian\u2019s presence is unexpected; except, of course, where you truly have a case of an individual darting in front of a car as it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>proaches; where you have a pure accident. That\u2019s not the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">I find that although the area is clearly dark, and at the time of the impact there was no meaningful street or store lighting; the defendant should have easily been able to avoid the deceased; especially when he was not speeding, or indeed when he was probably under the speed limit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Even though the trial court erroneously used a tort law analysis, we would find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the trial court has essentially determined that the victim\u2019s death was reasonably foreseeable, and that the defendant\u2019s gross negligence sufficiently dominated the victim\u2019s negligence to be fairly treated as a criminal proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Unlike <em>Tims, </em>here we can actually assess the facts as determined by the trial court. The court found that open intoxicants and empty beer cans were in the defendant\u2019s car, that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.10 percent, and it emphasized that \"[t]he defendant made no effort to aid the deceased.\u201d In contrast with <em>Tims, </em>the court also found \"that the defendant did not brake his vehicle until or after impact.\u201d Additionally, unlike <em>Tims, </em>\"there were no skid marks.\u201d We conclude that the defendant\u2019s grossly negligent conduct sufficiently dominated the victim\u2019s negligence of walking across the road without looking. We are most persuaded by the findings of the trial court: that the defendant was drunk; that he failed to brake, even though he should have seen the victim (unlike <em>Tims); </em>and that he failed to make any attempt to assist in moving the victim out of the path of oncoming traffic after the accident. Therefore, we concur with the majority in reversing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstating the conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> 202 Mich App 335; 508 NW2d 175 (1993); unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 10, 1994 (Docket No. 144608). .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> The prosecution\u2019s expert testified that there were skid marks as long as sixty-one feet. He further testified that with the concurrent road conditions, a vehicle traveling forty miles an hour would need up to eighty-eight feet to stop. The lead opinion summarily rejects this scientific evidence as incredible, apparently claiming to have a better appreciation of the scene than the expert witness who arrived shortly after the accident occurred. Further, the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the testimony of John Gough should be qualified by the conflicting testimony that the Camaro had pulled off the road a quarter of a mile before the accident. <em>Ante </em>at 90. Because of its conflict with other \"direct\u201d testimony, Mr. Gough\u2019s testimony should be given cautionary reliance. Moreover, it is clear that the jury rejected the argument that the defendant was traveling \"approximately ninety miles an hour at the point\u201d of impact because it acquitted the defendant of second-degree murder and of gross negligence manslaughter. Because of the wide disparity in the evidence between twenty-two miles an hour and ninety miles an hour, the lead opinion\u2019s pronouncement that the verdict establishes that the true speed was ninety miles an hour is difficult to understand. If the jury truly believed that the defendant was traveling at a speed of ninety miles an hour, it would have rationally returned a verdict of malicious or grossly negligent conduct. Its finding of merely ordinary negligence conduct is fundamentally at odds with the lead opinion\u2019s characterization of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> The expert testified in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">We know that the pedestrian essentially had no velocity on the access of Jennings Road.
