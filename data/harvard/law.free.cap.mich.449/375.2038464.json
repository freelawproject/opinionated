The Minimum Standards<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> require appellate counsel to raise all claims of \"arguable legal merit,\u201d and a failure to raise an arguable claim does not establish the proper test for assessing whether a defendant has established \"cause\u201d excusing a procedural default in postconviction proceedings. The definition proposed is inconsistent with the purpose and language of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, with federal authority defining ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel as cause, and with our holding in <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298; 521 NW2d 797 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">However, we disagree with Justice Cavanagh that \"federal habeas corpus jurisprudence should play only a limited role in defining the standards imposed by MCR 6.508.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 402. As Justice Cavanagh notes, federal habeas corpus review and MCR 6.508 share the paramount goal of promoting finality of judgments. <em>Post </em>at 404. Moreover, in both the federal and state systems, the constitution guarantees only a fair trial, not a perfect one. <em>Murray v Carrier, </em>477 US 478; 106 S Ct 2639; 91 L Ed 2d 397 (1986); <em>People v Bahoda, </em>448 Mich 261, 292-293, n 64; 531 NW2d 659 (1995). While it is true that the state can create its own procedural rules, we presumably chose to model MCR 6.508 after the federal habeas corpus statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>because it serves important state interests. As the Supreme Court has observed, the exhaustion doctrine,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> promotes the legitimate interest of this state in enhancing the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of our own criminal process by assessing and resolving appellate issues shortly after trial. <em>Murray v Carrier, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We also believe that Justice Cavanagh has failed to advance a persuasive reason why the habeas corpus standard articulated in <em>Gray v Greer, </em>800 F2d 644 (CA 7, 1985), not passed upon by the Court of Appeals, should be adopted here. As the Court now assumes for itself the role of adding judicial gloss to the terms.\"significant and obvious,\u201d the approach marks at least a partial repudiation of the limiting purpose of MCR 6.508. The burdens on trial courts passing on postconviction claims will be clearly expanded to the extent of. demonstrating compliance with <em>Gray </em>and, in fact, may be further expanded. The observation that the strategic decisions of counsel will be respected \"if such discretion was actually exercised,\u201d invites the argument that a <em>Ginther </em>hearing with appellate counsel must be held to determine that question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Post </em>at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The Rules of Criminal Procedure \"are to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d MCR 6.002. The specific purpose for creating the postconviction procedure was to provide finality of judgments affirmed after one full and fair appeal and to end repetitious motions for new trials. MCR 6.508(D) is identical to the federal standards for habeas corpus relief under 28 USC 2255. Postconviction relief is provided for the extraordinary case in which a conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Requiring appellate lawyers to function at a level of objectively reasonable performance encourages lawyers to accept assignments and to diligently serve their clients, as well as promoting the goal of finality in judgments. Where a procedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment mandates that the state bear the risk of the constitutionally deficient performance. However, where the state has afforded a full and fair opportunity to reliably determine guilt and an appeal of right, assisted by constitutionally adequate counsel at public ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>pense, all institutional and public interests support the conclusion that proceedings should come to an end unless the defendant\u2019s conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">When ineffective assistance of counsel, based on a failure to raise viable issues, is the justification for excusing procedural default, the movant must establish ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v Washington, supra, </em>or that \"some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d <em>Murray v Carrier, supra </em>at 488. MCR 6.508 is based on federal precedent and Michigan\u2019s standard for ineffective assistance of trial counsel is the same as the federal standard. <em>People v Pickens, supra. </em>\"Attorney error short of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute cause for a procedural default even when that default occurs on appeal rather than at trial.\u201d <em>Murray </em>at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Defining ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as the failure to raise any arguable claim would impair the independence of the profession. And because failure to raise all colorable claims will expose appellate lawyers to malpractice suits and grievances, the approach would inevitably result in flooding the appellate courts with non-meritorious claims on direct appeal. Moreover, because in hindsight, the number of claims of arguable legal merit is virtually limitless, it is predictable that lawyers either will decline representation that will expose them to grievances and civil sanctions, or will suggest that funding units should underwrite the cost of malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The ultimate effect would profoundly destabilize the finality of judgments beyond what occurred under the previous procedure, and exponentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>increase the burdens on appellate counsel, the Court of Appeals, and trial courts presiding in collateral matters. Such an approach is neither commanded by the constitution nor justified by sound public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The commentary to MCR 6.508 states that the \"cause and prejudice\u201d standard is based on the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>Wainwright v </em>Sykes, 433 US 72; 97 S Ct 2497; 53 L Ed 2d 594 (1977), and <em>United States v </em>Frady, 456 US 152; 102 S Ct 1584; 71 L Ed 2d 816 (1982). In Wainwright, the United States Supreme Court held that the \"[respondent's failure to make timely objection under the Florida contemporaneous-objection rule to the admission of his inculpatory statements, absent a showing of cause for the noncompliance and some showing of actual prejudice, bars federal habeas corpus review of his <em>Miranda[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72 (reporter\u2019s syllabus).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">While <em>Wainwright </em>adopted the cause and prejudice standard, it left \"open for resolution in future decisions the precise definition . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. Similarly, in <em>Frady, supra, </em>the Court applied the cause and prejudice standard but found \"it unnecessary to determine whether Frady ha[d] shown cause\u201d and \"refrained from giving 'precise content\u2019 to the term 'prejudice\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Frady </em>at 168, citing <em>Wainwright, supra </em>at 91. Thus, while laying the groundwork for the cause and prejudice standard, <em>Wainwright </em>.and <em>Frady </em>offered limited guidance regarding the proper definition of either term.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">However, in <em>Strickland, </em>the United States Supreme Court clearly held that to receive collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the defendant must meet a two-pronged test of both cause and prejudice. In addressing the \"cause\u201d prong of the test, <em>Strickland </em>held that the defendant must show that counsel \"made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. In evaluating whether counsel was ineffective, \"(jjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d and the court should restrain from second-guessing trial strategy. <em>Id. </em>at 689. \"There are countless ways to provide effective assistance,\u201d and \"[ejven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, with regard to defaults that occur at trial, error or inadvertence is not cause for procedural default in postconviction proceedings. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><em>Strickland </em>dealt with allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel as cause (and prejudice) for procedural defaults in collateral proceedings. In <em>Murray, </em>the Supreme Court also definitively held that a failure to assert a claim on appeal whether from \"ignorance or inadvertence rather than from a deliberate decision,\u201d does not constitute cause for purposes of postconviction relief. <em>Id. </em>at 487. \"Attorney error short of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute cause for a procedural default even when that default occurs on appeal rather than at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492. In <em>Murray, </em>the Supreme Court dismissed the respondent\u2019s habeas corpus petition because the respondent failed to show cause for not raising his ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. In reaching its decision, the Court squarely addressed the standard for \"cause\u201d and, applying <em>Strickland, </em>held that \"cause\u201d for appellate default could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>established only by proving ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>or by showing that some factor external to the defense precluded counsel from previously raising the issue. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Where trial or appellate counsel\u2019s performance is constitutionally defective, procedural defaults will not bar a remedy for manifest injustice. However, the vestigial definition of \"cause\u201d contended for would transform postconviction proceedings into the \"main event\u201d of the criminal justice system, with significant cost to the entire system and to the public interest. If a defendant received a fair trial, was represented at trial and on appeal by a constitutionally adequate lawyer, no legitimate interest is served in excusing procedural default. .</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The appellant contends that standard 9 of the Minimum Standards is the proper test for whether the defendant has shown \"cause.\u2019.\u2019 <em>Post </em>at 412-413. Standard 9 requires an appellate attorney to assert every claim of \"arguable legal merit.\u201d Thus, an appellate attorney\u2019s failure to raise an issue on direct appeal that would not have succeeded had it been raised, would excuse a procedural default under MCR 6.508(D). The Minimum Standards dictate only whether an attorney who is listed on the roster of attorneys at the Appellate Assigned Counsel Administrator\u2019s office is eligible for assignments. The standards are simply the vehicle adopted by this Court to assure a standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>performance by certain attorneys who seek to represent clients at state expense. They do not establish the definition of \"cause\u201d in collateral relief. Unlike the Minimum Standards, \"the purpose of the effective assistance guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is not to improve the quality of legal representation .... The purpose is simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The commentary to standard 9 states that it is based on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Garcia, </em>398 Mich 250; 247 NW2d 547 (1976). Just last term, however, we held that \"the Michigan Constitution does not afford greater protection than federal precedent with regard to a defendant\u2019s right to counsel when it involves a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>People v Pickens, supra </em>at 302. In reaching our decision we stated, <em>\"Garcia, </em>therefore, does not stand for the proposition that the Michigan Constitution was intended to grant stronger protection than federal authority with regard to the standards applied to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312-313. Thus, contrary to the understanding of the drafters of standard 9, our holding in <em>Garcia </em>does not suggest a departure from federal precedent, but rather embodies the federal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Defining \"cause\u201d as any deviation from compliance with an exact set of standards was considered and rejected in the context of trial counsel performance in <em>Strickland. </em>The Court refused to adopt a \"particular set of detailed rules for counsel\u2019s conduct,\u201d finding that no specific set of standards \"can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 688-689.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Likewise, requiring appellate counsel to raise every arguably meritorious issue would undermine the strategic and discretionary decisions that are the essence of skillful lawyering. A fair trial defended by constitutionally competent trial counsel and reviewed with the representation of constitutionally competent appellate counsel is a final judgment, subject to reversal only in the extraordinary circumstances set forth in the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Inherent in the definition of \"arguable legal merit\u201d is the notion that attorneys will disagree about what issues are \"arguable.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By adopting a standard of arguable merit, the Minimum Standards encourage lawyers representing indigent clients on appeal to err on the side of presenting all colorable claims for relief. Although the standard undoubtedly imposes a tax on the resources of the Court of Appeals, it is arguable that the burden is justified by the institutional need to assure that appellate attorneys paid by the taxpayers of Michigan do not err on the side of underrepresentation. It is one thing, however, to encourage lawyers to raise claims on direct appeal that conceivably might succeed, and quite another to say that failure to raise all such claims is constitutionally defective. If failure to raise a claim of \"arguable legal merit\u201d constituted \"cause\u201d in collateral proceedings, the standard would constitute a frontal attack on the finality of judgments that the Rules of Criminal Procedure were adopted to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>without any benefit to the notion that collateral proceedings are intended as extraordinary protection against unreliable fact finding and unjust convictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The standard does, not consider the presumption of competence inherent in the wide range of reasonable appellate assistance, nor does it address the fact that for purposes of appeal, as at trial, the constitution does not guarantee a perfect process, but rather one that is not constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Before October 1, 1989, the procedure for collateral review of criminal convictions in Michigan did not make any provision for finality of judgments. As a consequence, defendants could, and did, repeatedly seek relief without limitation. To create a uniform system of procedure, Michigan Court Rules 6.501 <em>et seq. </em>were enacted. The rules present a carefully balanced scheme that liberally permits \u25a0the assertion of claims on direct appeal,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> whether timely or not, while at the same time introducing a concept of finality to discourage repeated trips up and down the appellate ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In explaining the proper standard for collateral postconviction relief, the drafters of proposed rule 7.404, later adopted as MCR 6.508, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">The collateral postconviction remedy provided by subchapter 7.400 should be regarded as extraordinary. Lacking any statute of limitations, this remedy has the potential for seriously undermin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ing the state\u2019s important interest in the finality of criminal judgments. Such a cost is appropriate only to prevent manifest injustice. Stated differently, collateral postconviction remedies should have a narrower role than direct appeal; errors that may warrant appellate reversal of a conviction may not warrant postconviction relief. [Proposed Rules of Criminal Procedure, 428A Mich 50 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Specifically addressing ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims, the drafters stated that \"ineffective assistance of counsel, as opposed to mere attorney oversight, establishes cause for failure to raise the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The rules are designed to encourage raising legal issues on initial appeal rather than in post-conviction review. The United States Supreme Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">[A rule which is designed to afford] the opportunity to resolve the issue shortly after trial, while evidence is still available both to assess the defendant\u2019s claim and to retry the defendant effectively if he prevails in his appeal . . . promotes not only the accuracy and efficiency, of judicial decisions, but also the finality of those decisions .... <em>[Reed v Ross, </em>468 US 1, 10; 104 S Ct 2901; 82 L Ed 2d 1 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">MCR 6.508 was adopted to insure that the finality of criminal judgments was not diminished. Mandating that all appellate attorneys must raise all claims of arguable legal merit will tax judicial resources on direct and postconviction attack, and reintroduce a multiplicity of postconviction proceedings. Neither the guarantee of a fair trial nor a direct appeal entitles a defendant to as many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>attacks on a final conviction as ingenuity may devise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The facts of this case present a paradigm of the situation MCR 6.508 seeks to remedy. It has been eight years since defendant, assisted by a different lawyer than trial counsel, sought relief through direct appeal. The appeal followed a three-day jury trial at which defendant was convicted of felony murder. On direct appeal, appellate counsel raised two issues: that the jury instructions were unclear and overly broad, and that it was error for the prosecutor to inform the jury that defendant\u2019s alleged codefendant had' already been tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Defendant here claims that his appellate counsel was ineffective for not arguing that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to three statements made in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. To excuse this double procedural default defendant must \"show that [trial] counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the representation so prejudiced the defendant as to deprive him of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Pickens, supra </em>at 303. Defendant must also show that appellate counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">While not insurmountable, it is clear that this burden is highly demanding. As Justice Brennan explained in <em>Kimmelman v Morrison, </em>477 US 365; 106 S Ct 2574; 91 L Ed 2d 305 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>In order to establish ineffective representation, the defendant must prove both incompetence and prejudice. <em>[Strickland, </em>supra] at 688. There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance falls within the \"wide range of [reasonable] professional assistance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 689; the defendant bears the burden of proving that counsel\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy. <em>Id. </em>at 688-689. The reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance is to be evaluated from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the alleged error and in light of all the circumstances, and the standard of review is highly deferential. <em>Id. </em>at 689. <em>[Id. </em>at 381.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Since \"[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 689, unless consideration is given to counsel\u2019s overall performance, before and at trial, it will be \"all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Ibid. [Id. </em>at 386.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Dealing with the defaults in reverse order, we first observe that under the deferential standard of review, appellate counsel\u2019s decision to winnow out weaker arguments and focus on those more likely to prevail is not evidence of ineffective assistance. <em>Jones v Barnes, </em>463 US 745, 752; 103 S Ct 3308; 77 L Ed 2d 987 (1983). Nor is the failure to assert all arguable claims sufficient to overcome the presumption that counsel functioned as a reasonable appellate attorney in selecting the issues presented. The question is whether a reasonable appellate attorney could conclude that the comments made by the prosecutor were not worthy of mention on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Since, as discussed next, two of the three comments were not improper statements of law and all were followed by proper instruction, it is evident that the improper comments argument was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The claimed ineffective performance of trial counsel, is based on three instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct where trial counsel\u2019s failure to object subjected each alleged error to the claim of forfeiture on direct appeal,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see <em>People v </em>Duncan, 402 Mich 1; 260 NW2d 58 (1977). The question is whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the following three points during a three-day trial constituted constitutionally deficient performance: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s alleged implication that first-degree murder is satisfied if the murder occurred during the course of the robbery without fully explaining that there must be malice sufficient for murder itself and a separate intent to commit the underlying felony, (2) the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that \"not caring\u201d or \"careless disregard\u201d would satisfy the specific intent required for assault with intent to murder, and (3) the prosecutor\u2019s use of \"we know\u201d in referring to the evidence produced at trial, allegedly implying that he knew something more than produced at trial, that the evidence was abundantly clear, or simply that the jury should suspend its fact-finding powers in deference to the prosecutor\u2019s judgment. All instances of alleged defective performance occurred during closing argument. It is not disputed that all were followed by correct jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Although we find no \"cause,\u201d we analyze each of the claims separately to provide guidance to the bench and bar.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Defendant claims trial counsel erred in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Review of the relevant statements in the record indicate that the prosecutor did not misstate the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Whether the persons had the gun in their right hand or their left hand, whether there were fifteen bullets fired or twenty-two bullets fired may not matter. If you believed that Lee Griffin died during the robbery or an attempted robbery, that Mr. Reed shot the fatal shot or was responsible for it being fired, it would still be murder in the first degree, felony murder. If he shot Mr. Moore intending to kill, intending what happened, he\u2019s guilty of assault with intent to murder. If he was just holding and pulled out his weapon on the participants at this bar, he\u2019s guilty of assault with intent to rob being armed. If he\u2019s holding a gun in his hand, he\u2019s guilty of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">For murder in the first degree, the Judge is going to define that there has to be a loss of life. Mr. Griffin lost his life. It had to be caused by an act of the Defendant. Being shot was the act that caused his death. And there had to be a mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>state, a mental state of either wanting to kill or disregarding the consequences of the activity, not caring what happened, in this case, shooting a person, to the extent of shooting at the vital organs, that kind of not caring \u2014 I\u2019m going to help my friend, I\u2019m going to shoot you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">You don\u2019t have to intend \"I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d All you have to do is, \"I\u2019m going to shoot him. I don\u2019t care if this bullet kills or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">And it has to be done during an attempted robbery. This certainly was an attempted robbery. Even if Mr. Sharp may have been the one more intimately involved in the whole event \u2014 he\u2019s taken care of \u2014 look at Mr. Reed\u2019s responsibility, and his shooting Mr. Griffin with disregard for what\u2019s going to happen, causing the fatal wound while a robbery is going down is murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">And the Court has to instruct you on murder in the second degree. That\u2019s just a killing with a wrongful intent, a wrongful state of mind, whether part of a robbery or not. That\u2019s murder in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">But the killing when you\u2019re trying to advance a robbery is first, murder in the first degree. Not that it\u2019s planned or premeditated or cold-blooded, but that it\u2019s done during the robbery. That\u2019s murder in the first degree. And for that we charge Mr. Reed for being involved in that act of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">And we know that he also shot Mr. Moore twice, in the chest and in the arm. First in the arm would make sense. If he\u2019s holding the gun the way he said, he would shoot him in the arm which has the gun in it, which caused him to let go of the arm [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">Then he shot him in the chest, for which we charge him with assault with intent to murder, intent to kill; the Defendant didn\u2019t care what happened when he shot him. He shot him in the chest, which is a pretty serious place. He\u2019s lucky. He was shot twice in the trunk and survived. Mr. Griffin was shot once in the trunk and he died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>I think the fact that one man died shows that the intent was to kill, to not care, not caring what the results would be. And again, Mr. Moore said that Mr. Reed was the one who was shooting at him. \"I looked up and I saw him shooting at me. The second and third wounds that I received came from Mr. Reed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The prosecutor argued that shooting at Mr. Griffin\u2019s vital organs satisfied the malice required for second-degree murder. He did not misstate the law or lessen the burden of proof regarding the malice requirement for murder.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The prosecution concedes that the trial prosecutor misstated the intent requirement of assault with intent to murder charge. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQmX\">Then he shot him in the chest, for which we charge him with assault with intent to murder, intent to kill; the Defendant didn\u2019t care what happened when he shot him. He shot him in the chest, which is a pretty serious place. He\u2019s lucky. He was shot twice in the trunk and survived. Mr. Griffin was shot once in the trunk and he died.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We are not bound to accept such a concession, and it may well be that the prosecutor was correctly arguing that an intention to kill may be inferred from circumstances. Nonetheless, assuming arguendo the correctness of the concession, an intent to kill is necessary to convict of assault with intent to murder. <em>People v Taylor, </em>422 Mich 554, 567-568; 375 NW2d 1 (1985). We find that counsel was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ineffective in failing to object because, at the time of trial, <em>Taylor </em>was not yet decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Counsel is not ineffective for taking a position that, while objectively reasonable at the time, is later ruled incorrect. <em>McMann v Richardson, </em>397 US 759, 770-771; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 L Ed 2d 763 (1970). The question is whether the position when taken was objectively reasonable pursuant to the standard set forth in <em>Strickland, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We ar\u00e9 mindful of the <em>Strickland </em>Court\u2019s warning that \"it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful [or later deemed incorrect], to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The final claim is that trial counsel erred in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of the term \"we know\u201d in summing up the evidence in his closing argument.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This claim is based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>theory that trial counsel should have objected during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument because the prosecutor was impermissibly vouching for- the credibility of the witnesses. We believe a claim of this type is precisely the type of trial decision the United States Supreme Court cautioned against second guessing in postconviction collateral proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">First, as a matter of law, the argument did not constitute improper vouching. It is not here disputed \"that the prosecutor may not vouch for the character of a witness or place the prestige of his office behind them.\u201d <em>People v Bairefoot, </em>117 Mich App 225, 229; 323 NW2d 302 (1982); see also <em>People v Bahoda, supra; People v </em>Cowell, 44 Mich App 623; 205 NW2d 600 (1973). The record must be read as a whole, however, and the allegedly impermissible statements judged in the context in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>which they are made. <em>People v Duncan, supra </em>at 15-16. As noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Cowell, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">A statement cannot be taken out of context. Just as jury instructions must be read as a whole, so must the remarks of the prosecutor. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks must be evaluated in light of the relationship or. lack of relationship they bear to the evidence admitted at trial. <em>[Id. </em>at 627.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s comments \"does not turn on whether or not any magic words are used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628. The crucial inquiry is not whether the prosecutor said \"We know\u201d or \"I know\u201d or \"I believe,\u201d but rather whether the prosecutor was attempting to vouch for the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Read as a whole, and in the context of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s use of \"we know\u201d does not show an attempt to place the credibility of his office behind the case or a suggestion that he possessed extrajudicial information on which defendant should be convicted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, the prosecutor was-asserting that \"we know,\u201d on the basis of the evidence presented at trial and inferences drawn from that evidence, that the propositions advanced had been established.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>You should disregard anything said by an attorney which is not supported by the evidence or by your own general knowledge and experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Second, trial strategy supports counsel\u2019s decision not to object. Objecting would have' invited an overruling by the trial judge and risked jury disapproval. At best, trial counsel might have obtained a direction to the prosecutor to rephrase his summary, or a charge that the lawyer\u2019s arguments were not evidence. Trial counsel had to balance this meager benefit against the potential that the jury would believe defense counsel did not want them to hear the prosecutor\u2019s analysis of the evidence. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to object was a quintessential example of trial strategy. None of the omissions alleged, standing alone or together, falls below an objective standard of reasonable performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Finally, we observe that if the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>is satisfied because a reasonable attorney would have objected, in this collateral proceeding, the defendant could not fulfill the prejudice prong. See also <em>People v Pickens, supra. </em>The <em>Strickland </em>formulation of ineffective assistance includes both a performance component and a prejudice component. Both prongs of the test must be fulfilled and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">a court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed. <em>[Id. </em>at 697.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">To establish prejudice, \"a criminal defendant . . . must show 'that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u2019 <em>Lockhart v Fretwell, </em>506 US 364, 369; 113 S Ct 838; 122 L Ed 2d 180 (1993), quoting <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 687.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Defendant in this case received a fair trial and there are no circumstances that undermine confidence in the reliability of the factfinder\u2019s determination of guilt. Given the well-established proposition that jurors are presumed to follow the law, an alleged misstatement of the law by the prosecutor is presumptively not harmful, since the trial judge instructed the jury properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Moreover, a witness who was himself shot twice by Mr. Reed, testified that he saw defendant fatally shoot the victim during the attempted robbery, and three witnesses identified defendant as being in the bar at the time of the shooting. Another witness for the people testified that he drove defendant to the bar on the day in question, that defendant was armed with a .38 caliber revolver, and that when defendant returned to the car, either the defendant or Sharp said \"I had to shoot the dude.\u201d A man working on a freezer identified defendant as the man with a revolver in his hand who ordered him out of the bathroom after the shots were fired. There was no prejudice or manifest injustice so that the good cause requirement should be waived._</p>\n<p id=\"A25\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that appellate counsel did not fall below the standard of <em>Strickland </em>by failing to claim that trial counsel was ineffective.

I write separately, however, to emphasize my belief that federal habeas corpus jurisprudence should play only a limited role in defining the standards imposed by MCR 6.508.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The primary motivation behind the writ of habeas corpus is to provide a mechanism whereby state prisoners can seek redress of their federal rights. A federal habeas corpus claim is based on the theory that the prisoner is being held in violation of the federal constitution or federal law and, thus, his imprisonment is unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. 28 USC 2254(a). Nevertheless, federal courts are increasingly reluctant to interfere with state court judgments because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>concepts of comity and federalism; thus, habeas corpus relief is sparingly granted. <em>Coleman v Thompson, </em>501 US 722, 730-731; 111 S Ct 2546; 115 L Ed 2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">As the New Jersey Supreme Court has recently, and unanimously, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">It would be a bitter irony indeed if our courts, in an attempt to accommodate the [United States] Supreme Court\u2019s retrenchment of federal habeas corpus review, were artificially to elevate procedural rulings over substantive adjudications in post-conviction review, at a time when the Court\u2019s curtailment of habeas review forces state prisoners to rely increasingly on state post-conviction proceedings as their last resort for vindicating their state and federal constitutional rights. <em>When appropriate, the procedural bars imposed by Rules 3:22-4, 3:22-5, and 3:22-12 may be asserted to preclude post-conviction relief, but their use should not be shaped or in\u00f1uenced in the slightest by the federal courts\u2019 restrictive standards for allowing or disallowing habeas review. [New Jersey v Preciose</em>, 129 NJ 451, 477; 609 A2d 1280 (1992). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Thus, the curtailment of habeas corpus review is based on a theory of federalism that subordinates the vindication of federal constitutional rights to a state\u2019s enforcement of its procedural rules. <em>Id. </em>at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">It seems evident to me that the concepts of comity and federalism are simply inapplicable to MCR 6.508. Therefore, the more prominence these concepts gain in federal habeas corpus jurisprudence, the less that jurisprudence should influence our interpretation of MCR 6.508. MCR 6.508 is intended to force a defendant to bring all his appellate claims in his appeal of right, thereby promoting the finality of judgments, and is not concerned in the least with comity or federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>This is not to say that federal habeas corpus jurisprudence is of no use whatsoever. The limited usefulness of that jurisprudence in interpreting the meaning of \"good cause\u201d is evidenced by the citation in the committee notes of MCR 6.508 of <em>United States v Frady, </em>456 US 152; 102 S Ct 1584; 71 L Ed 2d 816 (1982), and <em>Wainwright v Sykes, </em>433 US 72; 97 S Ct 2497; 53 L Ed 2d 594 (1977). However, the committee citations of these cases surely do not mean that it also was adopting every future federal case that expanded or restricted those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Although the concepts of comity and federalism have no place in interpreting MCR 6.508, that rule shares at least one goal in common with habeas corpus review: finality of judgments. Consequently, I believe that the Court should embrace the very reasonable approach adopted in <em>Gray v Greer, </em>800 F2d 644 (CA 7, 1985), because it protects both the state\u2019s interest in finality of judgments and the defendant\u2019s interest in the effective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In <em>Greer, </em>petitioner Gray sought habeas corpus relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, essentially the claim defendant Reed makes in the case at bar. In resolving the petitioner\u2019s claim, that court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">Were it legitimate to dismiss a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal solely because we found it improper to review appellate counsel\u2019s choice of issues, the right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal would be worthless. When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on failure to raise viable issues, the district court must examine the trial court record to determine whether appellate counsel failed to present <em>signi\u00f1cant </em>and <em>obvious </em>issues on appeal. Significant issues which could have been raised should then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>be compared to those which were raised. Generally, only when ignored issues are <em>clearly </em>stronger than those presented, will the presumption of effective assistance of counsel be overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">A reviewing court can evaluate appellate counsel\u2019s choice of issues on appeal by examining the trial record and the appellate brief. While it is true that decisions which were arguably correct at the time will not be \"second-guessed,\u201d a reviewing court must initially determine whether such decisions were, in fact, strategic. <em>[Id. </em>at 646. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Under <em>Greer, </em>therefore, only those issues that are both significant and obvious can be a basis of relief. Any such issues must be presented in defendant\u2019s brief, and citation of the record must be included. <em>Greer </em>also incorporates a respect for the strategic decisions of counsel if such discretion was actually exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Finally, I also wish to point out that this- Court need not even reach the issue whether defendant has shown good cause because it is evident that he has not suffered actual prejudice. As observed in <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984), and implicitly adopted by this Court in <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298; 521 NW2d 797 (1994), a defendant must show both good cause and prejudice to substantiate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. But,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">a court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. ... If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed. <em>[Strickland, </em>466 US 697.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Therefore, if it is clear that there is no actual prejudice, then there is no need to determine whether good cause has been shown. A defendant needs to prove both \u2014 thus a failure to meet one dooms relief. \"Actual prejudice\u201d is defined by MCR 6.508(D)(3)(b)(i) to mean that the defendant must show a reasonably likely chance of acquittal if not for the alleged error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, the errors asserted would not have altered the verdict of guilty. Because the defendant cannot show actual prejudice, it is unnecessary to determine whether he can show good cause. His conviction should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-7\">Mallett, J., concurs with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\"> Of course, MCR 6.508(D)(3)(b) (ii), (iii), and (iv) provide other definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b534-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APN\">I concur in part i of Justice Cavanagh\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-9\">Levin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ami\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Following affirmance by the Court of Appeals of his convictions of first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder, attempted armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defendant Albert Reed filed a motion for postappeal relief from judgment.

The Court of Appeals did not consider on the merits the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct or the allegations or finding by the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that the trial lawyer was ineffective.

Unless the first appellate lawyer is Groucho Marx, his own ineffectiveness is not an issue that will be raised by him on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Because the Court of Appeals did not consider the allegations or findings of prosecutorial misconduct and trial lawyer ineffectiveness, and did not consider whether Reed showed actual prejudice, I would not and do not address those issues. This Court should not bypass the trial court and Court of Appeals by resolving issues not addressed by those courts. Because the judge\u2019s findings on the actual prejudice issue are inadequate, this Court should remand to the trial court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Reed\u2019s convictions stemmed from his role in what had apparently been a botched robbery , attempt that took place at the Trafile Light Lounge in the City of Detroit on March 24, 1982. Reed and a codefendant, Keith Sharp \u2014 who had been tried before Reed and found guilty, but not of murder\u2014 had been driven to the lounge by a friend of Sharp\u2019s, who saw- that both were armed when they entered his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">After he and Reed had been in the lounge for awhile, Sharp went over to the bar. His demeanor disturbed one of the bartenders, who went to the back room to inform her boss, the decedent bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>owner, Lee Griffin, that a patron was causing a disturbance. Sharp went to the back room, where he was met at the swinging doors by Johnny Ray Moore, a friend of Griffin\u2019s, who had been with him in the back room. Sharp announced a robbery and began shooting. He and Moore struggled for Sharp\u2019s gun, a nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun. Moore was shot once in the chest. Their struggle led them to the bar area.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Griffin followed Moore out of the back room. When Moore appeared to have Sharp subdued, Sharp yelled for help. Griffin asked Moore to give him Sharp\u2019s gun and to let Sharp up. Moore testified that as he turned to hand Sharp\u2019s gun to Griffin, he heard three or four more shots, from a different gun, coming from behind him. He looked to see Reed standing over him, shooting at him. Reed shot Moore once in the arm and once in the chest. Griffin slumped over on Moore. Sharp got up, stepped on Moore\u2019s chest, retrieved the nine millimeter handgun, and he and Reed left the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">No witness other than Moore saw Reed shoot a gun. Numerous nine millimeter casings and slugs were found in the bar, and one .38 caliber casing was found near the pool table. Reed had been standing near the pool table, according to Moore, and had been armed with a .38 caliber handgun according to the person who had driven Reed and Sharp to the bar. No slugs were recovered from Griffin\u2019s body or from Moore, with the result that there is no evidence that any of the recovered casings or slugs matched either of the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Griffin died of his wounds. Moore was hospitalized with his injuries for five days, and still carries one of the bullets that entered his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The judge found that the prosecutor committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>misconduct that denied Reed a fair trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Reed\u2019s trial lawyer had failed to object, and failed to ask for curative instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Reed\u2019s first appellate lawyer had failed to raise the issues of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffectiveness of the trial lawyer on direct appeal, on which the judge based her conclusion that the first appellate lawyer had not acted as reasonably competent counsel. Those errors, she said, \"were serious enough to constitute a miscarriage of justice and should have been raised by appellate counsel despite trial counsel\u2019s failure to object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The Court of Appeals disagreed with the judge, finding that Reed had not shown the good cause that MCR 6.508(D)(3)(a) requires for failing to raise issues that could have been raised on direct appeal. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, for Reed to show good cause for having failed to raise an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, he had to show that his first appellate lawyer had been ineffective. The Court had held that the requirements of <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 689; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>would apply to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Following <em>Jones v Barnes, </em>463 US 745; 103 S Ct 3308; 77 L Ed 2d 987 (1983),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals said that \"appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise every conceivable issue does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel..\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Counsel must be allowed to exercise reasonable professional judgment in selecting those issues most promising for review.

The errors (see text preceding n 18) appear on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b541-13\"> (1) The prosecutor argued facts not in evidence by exhibiting a photograph of Sharp, in which he appeared younger than Reed, thus implying that Reed was the ringleader and an experienced criminal; (2) the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence by stating in opening argument that shells matching Sharp\u2019s gun were found in the bar, when no such evidence was introduced at trial; (3) the prosecutor erred in placing Sharp\u2019s conviction before the jury; (4) the trial court gave improper instructions on the elements of assault with intent to murder; and (5) the trial lawyer and former appellate lawyer rendered ineffective assistance as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b541-14\"> Sharp appeared younger than Reed in a photograph displayed to the jury. The judge said that this would not, without other misconduct, \"lead to an inference that the defendant was a bad man or experienced criminal,\u201d even if that had been, in fact, what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>prosecutor intended the jury to infer. Since there had been no other related misconduct at Reed\u2019s trial \u2014 nothing in the nature of his having a prior record, of which there is no evidence, or references to other illegal acts committed by Reed, of which there is no evidence\u2014 the prosecutor having said that Sharp may have made mistakes because he was the younger of the two did not deprive Reed of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement in opening argument that shells matching Sharp\u2019s gun were found in the bar when no such evidence was presented at trial did not deprive Reed of a fair trial. The evidence, presented by numerous witnesses, that Sharp had been present and that he had been shooting his gun, was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Sharp\u2019s conviction had been erroneously placed before the jury. Since this had been litigated on direct appeal, this issue was not appropriately before the judge in the motion for relief from judgment, and she properly noted that she could not grant relief on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The judge also disagreed with Reed\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s instructions on the offense of assault with intent to commit murder were erroneous. The trial judge had instructed the jury that the requisite intent was intent to kill. There was no case law to support Reed\u2019s contention that the instruction on manslaughter but not second-degree murder could have led the jury to infer that it could convict Reed of assault with intent to commit murder if it found that his intent in shooting Moore was to commit great bodily harm or was done with wilful and wanton disregard of the likelihood that death or great bodily harm would occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\"> In <em>Murray v Carrier, </em>n 12 <em>supra, </em>p 483, Carrier had abandoned any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In the instant case, an issue is whether there was effective assistance of counsel. The United States Supreme Court said: \"So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is <em>not constitutionally ineffective </em>under the standard established in <em>Strickland v Washington </em>[466 US 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984)], we discern no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default\u201d under state law. <em>Murray v Carrier, supra, </em>p 488. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\"><em>Murray v Carrier </em>does not circumscribe this Court\u2019s authority to decide what constitutes procedural default under Michigan law and procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\"> <em>Aaron </em>requires that the prosecutor show malice in connection with the killing, in addition to the mental state necessary to commit the underlying felony. After <em>Aaron, </em>\"felony murder\u201d in Michigan is murder committed as a direct result of the commission or attempt to commit a felony, with one of the recognized forms of malice (intent to kill, intent to cause great bodily harm, or wanton and wilful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of one\u2019s acts will cause death or great bodily harm), not a killing that occurred during the course of a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\"> In <em>People v Taylor, </em>422 Mich 554, 567; 375 NW2d 1 (1985), this Court held that the mental state .required to convict of assault with intent to murder was actual intent to kill. No lesser intent provides the requisite mental state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\"> The judge cited <em>People v Cowell, </em>44 Mich App 623, 627; 205 NW2d 600 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em> </em>The judge cited <em>People v Humphreys, </em>24 Mich App 411, 418; 180 NW2d 328 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The judge\u2019s characterization of the identity of the shooter of the fatal shot as the central issue in the trial might not be correct because Reed may have been subject to liability as an aider or abetter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> The prosecutor argues that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct at Reed\u2019s trial, and Reed therefore was not prejudiced by any failure to object to statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The prosecutor argues that all the instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct in the form of misstatements of the law and prosecutorial vouching did not constitute misconduct when the statements are viewed in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s entire closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">The prosecutor argues that the prosecutor\u2019s use of \"we know\u201d as a preface to many of his remarks during closing argument was not an instance of vouching where there was evidence to support his arguments. He disagrees with the judge\u2019s characterization of the identity of the shooter as the central issue in controversy, because Moore\u2019s testimony on that issue was undisputed \u2014 no other witness contradicted that statement, and most were not in a position to see who was shooting whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The prosecutor, when using \"not caring\u201d as a proper mental state for murder when recounting the felony-murder rule, was describing the third form of malice attendant to murder, that of wilful and wanton disregard of the natural likelihood that one\u2019s actions would cause death or great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The prosecutor posits that, when viewed in its entirety, the prosecutor\u2019s definition of the malice requisite to a finding of murder was adequate. Also, the judge gave proper instructions on the felony-murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Finally, the prosecutor argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement of the elements of the crime of assault with intent to murder, while erroneous, was cured by the instructions given by the judge. The prosecutor argues that the law at that time was in a state of flux with regard to the mental state requisite to a finding of assault with intent to murder, and notes that <em>People v Taylor </em>would not be decided until two years after the prosecutor made his closing argument at Reed\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">Reed maintains that the judge correctly assessed the effect of the prosecutorial errors in his closing argument \u2014 that they lessened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, and that there was no sound trial strategy for the trial lawyer having failed to object or request curative instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
