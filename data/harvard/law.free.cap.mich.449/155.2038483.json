We hold that the policy is unambiguous, that the destruction of the building does not fall within the scope of the policy, and thus affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff Heniser and his wife purchased a vacation home in Honor, Michigan. The couple lived in the house intermittently throughout the years until their divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Heniser retained possession of the property after the divorce, but in November, 1988, sold the property on a land contract. At the time of the sale, the property was insured by defendant-appellee Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company under a homeowner\u2019s policy that expired September, 1989. Heniser did not inform Frankenmuth of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">In January, 1989, the property was destroyed, by fire. Heniser filed an insurance claim with Frankenmuth under his homeowner\u2019s policy seeking $20,000 for the building, $24,500 for personal property and $7,200 for related cleanup expenses. Frankenmuth denied coverage, terminated the policy, and returned the unearned premium to Hen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>iser. Frankenmuth contended that Heniser\u2019s claim was barred because of fraud and false swearing with regard to the cash value of the personal property damaged by fire, and that the damage to the building was not covered by the policy because Heniser did not and could not reside at the property, as required by the contract,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at the time of the fire.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>b. that part of any other building; where you reside and which is shown as the \"residence premises\u201d in the Declarations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">Heniser then filed suit against Frankenmuth, alleging that it had breached its insurance contract. In response, Frankenmuth asserted the aforementioned defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary disposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both motions were denied, and the Court of Appeals denied interlocutory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Following mediation, the case was tried without a jury before Judge Robert A. Benson. At the close of testimony, Judge Benson held that because Heniser did not reside at the property at the time of the fire, the policy did not provide coverage for the loss of the building. Judge Benson also found that Frankenmuth had not carried its burden of proving fraud by clear and convincing evidence. On appeal, the parties stipulated to the facts and agreed that the only issue is whether the definition of \"residence premise\u201d provides coverage for destruction of the building.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the holding<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the policy did not cover the destruction of the building. 201 Mich App 70; 506 NW2d 247 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>We granted leave to appeal on July 22, 1994. 445 Mich 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Plaintiff contends that the insurance policy is ambiguous regarding whether the policy covered his loss, even though he did not, and could not,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reside at the insured premises at the time of the fire. Plaintiff advances three arguments in support of claimed ambiguity: (1) the definitions section of the policy and the conditions section of the policy are internally inconsistent; (2) it is unclear whether he had to reside at the insured premises only at the time the policy was entered into or whether he had to reside at the insured location throughout the term of the policy; (3) an exclusion from coverage was deceptively placed in the definitional section.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Ambiguous provisions in an insurance contract are construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage. <em>Group Ins Co of Michigan v Czopek, </em>440 Mich 590; 489 NW2d 444 (1992); <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602, 624; 398 NW2d 411 (1986). Where the policy is clear, however, \"courts are bound by the specific language set forth in the agreement.\u201d <em>Cottrill v Michigan Hosp </em>Service, 359 Mich 472, 476; 102 NW2d 179 (1960); <em>Raska v Farm Bureau </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Mut Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). Terms in an insurance policy must be given their plain meaning and the court cannot \"create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>UpJohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197, 206; 476 NW2d 392 (1991). An insurer is free to define or limit the scope of coverage as long as the policy language fairly leads to only one reasonable interpretation and is not in contravention of public policy. <em>Raska, supra </em>at 361-362. If these prerequisites are fulfilled, the policy will be enforced as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Heniser has not, and cannot, demonstrate that the policy covers the destruction of the building.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The policy in this case, read as a whole, is unambiguous and does not cover the loss because the property was not a \"residence premises\u201d at the time of the loss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Our conclusion that the policy is unambiguous is further strengthened by the language Heniser included in the land contract when he sold the property. The land contract states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">Said Purchaser shall promptly pay, when due, all taxes and assessments of every nature, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>shall become a lien on said premises after the date hereof, and shall, during the continuance of this contract, keep insured the buildings now on said premises or which shall hereafter be placed thereon in the name of said Seller against loss by fire and windstorm, in such company or companies and for such amount as the Seller shall approve, and forthwith deposit all policies of insurance with the Seller, with loss, if any, payable to the Seller, as his interest may appear under this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Heniser included this language to protect himself in case the property was destroyed before the purchasers completed payment. This language indicates Heniser understood that his existing insurance policy would not cover the property after he sold it, and strengthens our conclusion that the policy in question does not cover the destruction of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The policy is not internally inconsistent. Although the conditions section of the policy requires the insured to notify the insurer of any \"changes in title or occupancy of the property during the term of the policy\u201d before recovering for any loss, this provision does not conflict with the definitions section mandate that the insured reside at the property. The requirement in the conditions section simply allows the insurance company to guarantee that the insured had an insurable interest in the property at the time of the loss or to coordinate coverage with other potential insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">While the definition of \"reside\u201d may be ambiguous in other contexts, there is no ambiguity in this case. The Court of Appeals, in interpreting the term \"resides\u201d in the Michigan Freedom of Infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>mation Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in the Child Custody Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has found the term to have two different meanings: a legal or technical meaning and a general or popular meaning. <em>Curry v Jackson Circuit Court, </em>151 Mich App 754; 391 NW2d 476 (1986); <em>Kubiak v Steen, </em>51 Mich App 408; 215 NW2d 195 (1974). In some contexts, the legal term means something more than actual physical presence; it includes the intent to live at that location at sometime in the future, a meaning similar to the legal concept of domicile. <em>Id. </em>at 413. In other contexts, the term requires actual physical presence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The policy of interpreting ambiguities in a contract against insurers is rooted in the fact that insurers have superior understanding of the terms they employ, which should not bind relatively unsophisticated insureds. This goal is not furthered by allowing insureds to employ a sophisticated version of a term to create a claim of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Finally, any ambiguity created by the fact that the law ascribes multiple meanings to the term \"reside\u201d is irrelevant because Mr. Heniser fails under either standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mr. Heniser admits that he did not actually live at the insured premises at the time of the fire and that he did not intend to live there in the future. Accordingly, Mr. Heniser did not \"reside\u201d at the insured premises under either definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The policy is also clear that if Mr. Heniser did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>not \"reside\u201d at the insured property at the time of the loss, the property is not a \"residence premises,\u201d as defined by the policy, and the policy does not cover the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Mr. Heniser alternately contends that several courts have found similar language to require only that the insured fulfill the policy requirement at the time the policy was entered. In these cases, the language was viewed as an affirmative warranty and not a continuing warranty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Reid v Hardware Mut Ins Co of Carolinas, Inc, </em>252 SC 339; 166 SE2d 317 (1969); <em>Ins Co of North America v Howard, </em>679 F2d 147 (CA 9, 1982). Mr. Heniser and the author of the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals rely heavily on the South Carolina Supreme Court opinion in <em>Reid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In <em>Reid, </em>the insureds purchased a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy that described the insured premises as a \"one story frame constructed, approved roof, <em>owner occupied, </em>one family dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342 (emphasis added). While the policy was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>effect, the Reids sold the home and the buyer assumed the mortgage. The policy was not transferred, however, and the Reids remained the named insureds. Five months after the sale, while the insurance policy was still in effect, the house was destroyed by fire. When the Reids filed a claim of loss with the insurer, the company refused to pay contending, among other things, that the policy did not cover the home because it was no longer \"owner occupied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343. The trial court found in favor of the Reids, and on appeal, the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed. In concluding that \"owner occupied\u201d was only an affirmative warranty that the Reids occupied the home at the time the policy was issued, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">Thus, a description of a house in a policy of insurance, as \"occupied by\u201d the insured, is a description merely and is not an agreement that the insured should continue in the occupation of it. <em>Joyce v Main Ins Co, </em>45 Me 168 [(1858)]. <em>O\u2019Niel v Buffalo Fire Ins Co, </em>3 NY 122 [(1849)]. A statement in an insurance policy that the property is occupied by the insured as a dwelling for himself and family, is not a warranty that it shall continue to be so occupied but is only a warranty of the situation at the time the insurance is effected. <em>German Ins Co </em>[of <em>Freeport, </em>Ill] <em>v Russell, </em>65 Kan 373; 69 P 345; 58 LRA 234 [(1902)]. <em>[Id. </em>at 346-347.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed a situation similar to <em>Reid </em>in <em>Ins Co of North America v Howard, supra. </em>The insureds had purchased a homeowner\u2019s policy covering the \"described residence <em>owned and occupied </em>by the insured exclusively for residential purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148 (emphasis added). After the death of Mr. Howard, Mrs. Howard moved most of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>her possessions to another residence and began to rent the home. Two weeks after Mrs. Howard rented her home, it burned. Mrs. Howard filed a claim under the policy, and the company denied coverage, contending that because Mrs. Howard had rented the home, it was no longer \"owned and occupied by the insured.\u201d The district.court agreed with the insurer but, on appeal, the court of appeals reversed. Relying on <em>Reid, supra, </em>the Ninth Circuit stated that the policy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">contains a representation that the insured is the homeowner and occupant and that the insurance is not being purchased by a third party. It does not impose a condition requiring the policyholder to continue to live at the residence. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The court went on to conclude that if an insurer wishes to terminate coverage upon rental of the home, the policy must give the insured unequivocal notice of this condition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Because <em>Reid </em>and <em>Howard </em>are distinguishable from this case, a different result is warranted. Unlike the language in <em>Reid </em>and <em>Howard, </em>the phrase \"where you reside\u201d in the policy before us is not a warranty but a statement of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"AN-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">The policy language, and the context in which the language is found in the policy before us, differs from that in either <em>Reid </em>or <em>Howard.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The language at issue is found in the definitions section. \"[W]here you reside\u201d is not used to describe the dwelling but is an independent part of the definition of \"residence premises.\u201d To be' a \"residence premises\u201d the insured must reside at the insured premises <em>and </em>the property must be shown as the residence premises in the declarations portion of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Were we to accept the argument that this definition is merely an affirmative warranty, we would freeze coverage at the time the policy is entered into and render subsequent events irrelevant. Applying this method of contract interpretation to other definitions in the policy before us illustrates the unreasonable result of such an approach. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>example, the policy between Heniser and Frankenmuth states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\"Insured\u201d means yo\u00fa and residents of your household who are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">a. your relatives; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">b. other persons under the age of 21 and in the care of any person named above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">If the definition of \"insured\u201d does not govern the scope of the policy on a continuing basis, an insured\u2019s relatives, who live with the named insured on the date the policy is entered into would continue to be covered by the policy even if they moved out of the insured premises the day after the policy is issued. The analysis becomes even more strained as applied to the definition of \"insured location.\u201d The policy defines an \"insured location\u201d as, among other things, \"individual or family cemetery plots or burial vaults of an insured . . . .\u201d Thus, relatives who lived at the insured premises on the day the policy was entered into would have their burial vault covered until the policy expires, even if they are no longer residents at the insured premises. We conclude that the definitions are properly viewed as establishing whether the property at issue is covered by the policy at the time of the loss and not as warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We agree with those courts that have found the exact language of this policy to unambiguously require the insured to reside at the insured premises at the time of the loss. The Georgia Court of Appeals recently interpreted identical policy language and found that the policy set forth two requirements: that the insured reside at the property at the time of the loss, and that the property be described as the residence premises in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>declarations portion of the policy. <em>Georgia Farm Bureau Mut Ins v Kephart, </em>211 Ga App 423; 439 SE2d 682 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In <em>Kephart, </em>the plaintiff and her husband purchased a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy that contained the same definition of \"residence premises\u201d as the policy before us. The couple\u2019s marriage deteriorated, and the plaintiff moved out of the house. In October, 1990, the couple was divorced, and in November, 1990, fire destroyed the home in which the ex-husband was living. The plaintiff filed to recover for the loss, but the insurance company denied coverage, arguing that Kephart did not \"reside\u201d at the premises at the time of the loss. The Georgia Court of Appeals agreed with the insurance company and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Because the evidence established that Kephart did not live at the house ... at the time of the fire, and the policy unambiguously required her, as named insured, to live at the \"residence premises\u201d in order for coverage to be effective, no coverage existed for Kephart\u2019s claim.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] <em>[Id. </em>at 425.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">A different panel of the Georgia Court of Appeals subsequently decided that similar language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>was merely a description of the property. <em>Hill v Nationwide Mut Fire Ins Co, </em>214 Ga App 715; 448 SE2d 747 (1994). However, the difference between the policy language in <em>Hill </em>and the language of the policies in <em>Kephart </em>and the instant case, combined with the rationale employed by both panels, fortifies our decision that the contract before us does not employ the term \"residence\u201d as merely a description of the property. The policy in <em>Hill </em>defined \"residence premise's\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">the one- or two-family dwelling, other structures and grounds; or that part of any other building <em>where you live, </em>shown as the residence premises on the Declarations. <em>[Id. </em>at 715. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The policy language in <em>Hill </em>is similar to that found in <em>Howard. </em>The language following immediately after the word \"building\u201d is not preceded by a comma or a semicolon, and the connector \"and\u201d does not precede the requirement that the property must also be shown as the \"residence premises\u201d in the declarations. In reaching its decision, the court in <em>Hill </em>specifically relied on the difference in punctuation and the lack of the word \"and\u201d to distinguish the language in <em>Hill </em>from the policy language at issue in <em>Epps v Nicholson, </em>187 Ga App 246; 370 SE2d 13 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The policy in <em>Epps </em>defined \"residence premises\u201d as \"the one or two family dwelling, other structures, and grounds or that part of any other building where you reside and which is shown as the 'residence premises\u2019 in the Declarations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. The <em>Epps </em>court found the policy unambiguous and held that the policy \"contained two requirements for coverage: first, the dwelling must be the place where the insured resides; and second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the dwelling must be shown as the 'residence premises\u2019 in the Declarations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. The second requirement was fulfilled, but because the property was rented and the insured did not reside at the insured premises, the policy did not provide coverage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Finally, in contrasting the policy language used in <em>Hill </em>with the language used in <em>Kephart </em>(the exact language found in this policy), the <em>Hill </em>court stated that the policy language and sentence structure found in <em>Kephart </em>\"clearly require that whether the covered premises is 'a. the one family dwelling . . .\u2019 or 'b. that part of any other building,\u2019 the insured must reside there.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Hill, supra </em>at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The policy language in this case is different from that in <em>Hill </em>and akin to the language analyzed in <em>Epps </em>and <em>Kephart. </em>The policy language following the word \"building\u201d is preceded by a semicolon and the word \"and\u201d connects the requirement that the insured reside at the premises and the requirement that the property be shown as the \"residence premises\u201d in the declarations. Thus, we find that the policy does not cover the destruction of the building unless the insured resides at the insured premises when the loss occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Heniser\u2019s final contention, that the definition of \"residence premises\u201d deceptively places a coverage exclusion in the definitions section of the policy, is without merit. Heniser\u2019s reliance on <em>Powers v DAIIE, supra, </em>and <em>Transamerica Ins Corp of America v Buckley, </em>169 Mich App 540; 426 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>696 (1988),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is misplaced. Both of these cases dealt with a situation in which the insurer purported to extend coverage in one portion of the policy and excluded such coverage in another section, or where the insurer defined certain terms in variance with their common meaning. That is not the case in the policy between Heniser and Frankenmuth.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The definition of \"residence premises\u201d does not vary from its common meaning. This term is clearly defined on page two of the policy and there is no contrary definition elsewhere in the policy. The terms used in the definition of \"residence premises\u201d are clear. As noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Curry, supra, </em>the general or popular definition of \"reside\u201d requires actual occupancy, unlike the legal meaning that allows an intent to occupy the property in the future to suffice. The term \"reside\u201d is clear to most laypersons and, in a homeowner\u2019s policy, ambiguity is not created by reference to legal theories outside the frame of reference of the ordinary insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">To determine whether an insured is entitled to insurance benefits, we employ a two-part analysis. \"First, we determine if the policy provides coverage to the insured. If it does, we then ascertain whether that coverage is negated by an exclusion.\u201d <em>Buczkowski v Allstate Ins Co, </em>447 Mich 669, 682; 526 NW2d 589 (1994). It is the insured\u2019s burden to establish that his claim falls within the terms of the policy. <em>Arco Industries Corp v American Motorists Ins Co, </em>448 Mich 395; 531 NW2d 168 (1995). <em>Harvey Oil Co v Federated Mut Ins Co, </em>837 F Supp 242, 244 (WD Mich, 1993). As explained above, once Heniser ceased to \"reside\u201d at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>insured premises, the policy no longer covered the property, and we need not examine whether the policy excludes coverage. Policy .exclusions are based on the presumption that the insured already has established that the policy covers the property in question. The question then becomes whether this particular loss is excluded from coverage for some reason. In this case, the policy did not apply, and destruction of the building, regardless of the cause, would not have been covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Coverage in this case is predicated on two separate requirements: the insured must reside at the insured premises, and the premises must be listed in the declarations section. We find that this policy admits of but one interpretation and is not ambiguous or fatally unclear. See <em>Allstate Ins Co v Goldwater, </em>163 Mich App 646, 648; 415 NW2d 2 (1987). Heniser did not \"reside\u201d at the premises at the time of the fire.

The policy language in <em>Trutanich </em>defined \"residence premises\u201d as \"the one or two family dwelling and separate structures or that part of any other building where you reside, and shown in the Declarations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. As explained below, this language is significantly different from the policy language in this case. The <em>Trutanich </em>court did not find the language ambiguous, but concluded that either \"where you reside\u201d only modified \"part of any other building\u201d and not \"family dwelling,\u201d or that even if it did modify \"family dwelling\u201d it was still \"insufficient to take the house out of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Trutanich </em>court relied heavily on <em>Howard, supra, </em>and cited the proposition found in <em>Howard </em>that if the insurer intended for coverage to terminate on the rental of the property, the exclusion should be clearly delineated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b295-5\"> Both <em>Reid </em>and <em>Howard </em>found the language in the respective policies to he merely descriptive of the structure covered by the policy. It is crucial, however, to closely examine the exact policy language and context in which the language is used. In <em>Reid </em>at 342, the policy described the building insured as a \"one story frame constructed, approved roof, owner occupied, one family dwelling.\u201d The \"owner occupied\u201d language was in a list of statements describing the building covered by the policy. Read in context, it is clear that \"owner occupied\u201d was simply a description of the dwelling in the same way that stating the building had an \"approved roof \u201d merely commented on the structure at the time the policy was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Likewise, in <em>Howard, </em>the policy stated that it covered the \"described residence owned and occupied by the insured exclusively for residential purposes.\u201d Again, the \"owned and occupied by the insured\u201d language is reasonably understood as merely a description of the dwelling insured. The language immediately follows the term residence and is not set off by any punctuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><em>Howard </em>is further distinguishable in that the court was concerned that the policy did not clearly indicate that rental of the insured property could terminate coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 149. While it might not occur to an insured that rental of his property could affect his homeowner\u2019s policy, it is a vastly different case when the insured sells the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> In <em>Kephart, </em>two judges concurred specially, stating that the special conditions found in the policy, requiring the \"residence premises [to be] the only premises where the named insured or spouse maintains a residence\u201d further strengthened the decision that the insured had to reside at the insured premises at the time of the loss. <em>Id. </em>at 424. The concurrence rejected the insured\u2019s argument that because the special conditions were written , in the present tense, the requirements only had to be fulfilled at the time the policy was entered. In rejecting this argument, the concurring judges noted that neither the common law or the legislature required there to be an express warning that coverage depended on the continued compliance with the policy requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The absence of the exclusive residency condition in the present policy does not alter our decision that the definition of \"residence premises\u201d unambiguously requires the insured to reside at the insured premises when the loss occurs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"> We express no opinion on how we would interpret the policy language found in <em>Hill.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\"> Heniser erroneously relies on <em>Yahr v Garcia, </em>177 Mich App 705; 442 NW2d 749 (1989), for support of this proposition as well.

I would hold that the policy provides coverage although the dwelling was sold before the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The policy issued by defendant, Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance, states that the insurer covers \"the dwelling on the residence premises shown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the Declarations.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \"Residence premises\u201d is defined as the \"one-family dwelling\u201d \"where you reside and which is shown as the 'residence premises\u2019 in the Declarations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The house owned by plaintiff, Richard J. Heniser, was a one-family dwelling, and it was shown in the Declarations. Heniser, however, sold the dwelling, November 1, 1988, on land contract, between September 28, 1988, when the homeowner\u2019s policy was renewed for an additional year, and January 12, 1989, the date of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The majority holds that the \"policy is unambiguous,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that \"where you reside\u201d speaks not only as of the date the renewal certificate of insurance was issued by the insurer or the date it became effective, September 28, 1988, but also unambiguously as of the date of the fire, January 12, 1989, with the result that because Heniser ceased to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>reside at the dwelling described in the Declarations after he sold the dwelling on land contract, the dwelling was no longer covered for fire as residence premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The words \"where you reside\u201d are in the present tense. Had Heniser read the homeowner\u2019s policy when he received the renewal certificate, as this Court has cautioned insureds to do, he would understandably have concluded that the dwelling was insured because that is where he resided at the time he received the renewal certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In the unlikely event that it then crossed Heniser\u2019s mind to think about whether he would be insured were he to sell the dwelling at some future date \u2014 as it happened a few months later \u2014 he, a layman not seeking to find a hidden meaning, would again understandably have concluded that the dwelling would be covered throughout the one-year renewal term.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">If \"where you reside\u201d were truly \"unambiguous\u201d as the majority holds, there would be no need to add \"at the time of the loss\u201d following \"reside\u201d or \"residence premises\u201d in the majority opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The words \"at the time of the loss\u201d do not appear in the policy. The majority points to no other words that \"unambiguously\u201d indicate that \"where you reside\u201d speaks as of the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>loss rather than as of the date a certificate or a renewal certificate of insurance is issued or becomes effective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The differing views expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Court of Appeals, and in the cases relied on by the dissenting Court of Appeals judge and the majority in this Court, also suggest that the meaning of \"where you reside,\u201d and whether those words speak as of an indefinite future date of loss, is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The homeowner\u2019s policy of insurance does not require an insured to notify the insurer of a change in occupancy or of a sale. The insured is only obliged, within sixty days <em>after a \u00f1re loss, </em>and then only after the insurer so requests, to notify the insured of \"changes in title or occupancy of the property during the term of the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">We all agree that \"where you reside\u201d speaks unambiguously \u2014 and means that the insured must actually reside in the dwelling \u2014 as of the date a certificate or renewal certificate of insurance is issued or becomes effective. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \"where you reside\u201d also speaks unambiguously as of some indefinite future date, following issuance of the certificate or renewal certificate \u2014 requiring the insured to actually reside in the dwelling on the future date\u2014 when a fire loss may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">I conclude that because \"where you reside\u201d is present tense, and an ordinary layman insured who receives a renewal certificate and then resides in the insured dwelling who reads the policy when issued would understandably conclude he is covered for fire loss throughout the one-year term of the policy, and because the policy does not oblige the insured to notify the insurer of a change of occupancy until <em>after a \u00f1re </em>loss, it is at least ambiguous whether \"where you reside\u201d speaks as of an indefinite future date after issuance requiring the insured to actually reside in the dwelling when a fire loss may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Because, as the majority acknowledges, \"[a]mbiguous provisions in an insurance contract are construed against the insurer and in - favor of coverage,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the ambiguity whether \"where you reside\u201d speaks as of an indefinite future date, and means that coverage is eliminated unless the insured continues to reside in the dwelling when a fire loss occurs, should be resolved in favor of providing coverage protective of Heniser\u2019s substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tial insurable interest in the dwelling although he had sold the dwelling on land contract before the fire.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Frankenmuth has offered no underwriting reason necessitating or justifying automatic cancellation of coverage upon a sale.

The standard policy does not provide that coverage is eliminated in the event of a change of ownership of the insured property. The standard policy provides, rather, that a fire insurer is not liable for loss \"while a described building, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty consecutive days . . . .\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The majority\u2019s reading of the homeowner\u2019s policy as eliminating coverage upon a sale of the dwelling \u2014 although the dwelling continues to be occupied \u2014 adds a condition of coverage not set forth in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In <em>FBS Mortgage Corp v State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co of Bloomington, </em>Illinois, 833 F Supp 688 (ND Ill, 1993), the homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage for a dwelling in language paralleling the language of the instant homeowner\u2019s policy, including the definition of \"residence premises\u201d as the dwelling \"where you reside.\u201d The insurer denied coverage because neither insured person had resided in the dwelling during an eight-month period before the fire. One of the insureds had transferred her interest to the other insured, and the transferee-insured had been arrested and incarcerated in the Cook County Jail until after the fire. The court concluded that \"residence premises\u201d was ambiguous with respect to the insured\u2019s claim, and that the construction urged by the insurer was unenforceable because it compromised the public policy set forth in the standard fire insurance policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The only provision of the standard fire policy that bears on the extent of coverage following a sale of the property is the \"insurable interest\u201d provision, providing explicitly, what the law would imply, that the obligation of the insurer shall not \"in any event [be] for more than the interest of the insured.\u201d The homeowner\u2019s policy similarly provides that the insurer is not liable beyond the amount of the insured\u2019s interest at the time of loss.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The provision in the homeowner\u2019s policy regarding insurable interest thus parallels a similar provision in the standard fire insurance policy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>And the provision in the homeowner\u2019s policy requiring the insured to notify the insurer after loss of changes in title or occupancy parallels a similar provision in the standard fire policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The homeowner\u2019s policy, consistent with the standard fire policy, thus reduces coverage only to the extent the homeowner ceases as a result of a sale to have an insurable interest. Heniser clearly had a substantial insurable interest represented by title to the dwelling and the land contract seller\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The essential insurance act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> provides that a homeowner insurer \"shall not refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure, or <em>limit the coverage </em>available to an eligible person [defined as an 'owner-occupant\u2019<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] for home insurance, except in accordance with underwriting rules\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>added) that are put in writing, filed with the Commissioner of Insurance, and applied uniformly.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The act permits a homeowner insurer to terminate insurance \"due to reasons which <em>conform </em>to the underwriting rules of the insurer\u201d (emphasis added), effective not earlier than thirty days after notice to the insured of a specific reason for termination that so \"conforms\u201d to the underwriting rules of the insurer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Frankenmuth did not refuse to insure or refuse to continue to insure Heniser\u2019s dwelling. Rather, it issued a renewal homeowner\u2019s insurance certificate to then owner-occupant Heniser in September, 1988, over a month before he sold the dwelling on land contract and three and a half months before the fire. Owner-occupant Heniser, however, may have ceased to be an owner-occupant within the meaning of the essential insurance act when he sold the dwelling on land contract and ceased to occupy the dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Nor did Frankenmuth avail itself of the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>sion in the essential insurance act permitting termination of coverage by notifying Heniser that his homeowner\u2019s insurance was terminated because he had vacated the dwelling after selling it on land contract. Frankenmuth claims rather that it can \"limit the coverage available\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to Heniser by the \"where you reside\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The essential insurance act permits a homeowner insurer to adopt an underwriting rule based on \"[t]he <em>unoccupancy </em>of a dwelling for more than 60 days, if there is evidence of an <em>intent to vacate or keep the premises vacant or </em>unoccupied, as to the applicant or <em>insured.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The construction of \"where you reside\u201d urged by Frankenmuth and adopted by the majority conflicts with the foregoing provision of the essential insurance act. Both address the same subject matter: elimination of coverage upon unoccupancy and vacation of the dwelling or intent to vacate by the insured. The construction adopted by the majority conflicts with the statute because a homeowner insurer may not adopt an underwriting rule permitting it to refuse to insure or renew or terminate coverage simply because the owner-occupant has vacated the premises; the underwriting rule only may provide for elimination of coverage if there has also been \"unoccupancy of a dwelling for more than.60 days.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The construction adopted by the majority also conflicts with the essential insurance act because it eliminates coverage without the thirty days\u2019 written notice to the insured required by the essential insurance act, after a homeowner\u2019s policy has been issued to an eligible owner-occupant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>stating a reason for termination that \"conforms\u201d to such a permitted underwriting rule.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Such notice of termination is critical because it would have put Heniser, in the instant case, on notice of the need to obtain alternative insurance, and would have provided adequate time for him either to require the land contract purchaser to obtain his own homeowner\u2019s policy or other fire insurance, as required by the land contract, showing Heniser as an additional insured as land contract seller, or to obtain in his own name a standard fire insurance policy to protect his insurable interest as land contract seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">This summary disposition record does not justify elimination of Heniser\u2019s insurance coverage.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It does not appear whether Frankenmuth\u2019s underwriting rules provide that it will not insure or renew insurance where there has been such unoccupancy and vacation of the dwelling or intent to vacate by the insured, and whether such an underwriting rule has been filed with the Commissioner of Insurance.

Under any proper view of the law, a homeowner is entitled to be given specific and unequivocal notice in the insurance policy that his coverage will be forfeited upon his rental of his home so that if a death in the family, other changes in family or economic circumstances, or even just a desire to change his way of life, causes him to move from his home, he may make whatever other insurance arrangements are necessary to protect the assets which often represents all the remaining proceeds of a lifetime of labor.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The majority states that <em>Reid </em>and <em>Howard </em>are distinguishable because of the differences in the insurance policy language in those and the instant cases, and that \"the phrase 'where you reside\u2019 in the policy before us is not a warranty but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>statement of coverage.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)

Paralleling the definition in the instant case, \"residence premises\u201d was defined as \"the one or two family dwelling and separate structures or that part of any other building <em>where you reside, </em>and shown in the Declarations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

The definition of \"residence premises\u201d was \"the one- or two-family dwelling, other structures and grounds; or that part of any other building <em>where you live, </em>shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>as the residence premises on the Declarations.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The court contrasted the language in <em>Hill </em>with the <em>Epps </em>language, noting differences in punctuation and grammar.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The court also distinguished <em>Hill </em>from <em>Kephart </em>on the basis that the policy language was different and the <em>Kephart </em>policy contained the special provision requiring that the residence premises be the insured\u2019s sole residence.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In these cases, the Georgia courts, by couching their analyses in terms suggesting that the meaning is obvious and clear, protected their interpretation without having to offer reasoned justification.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The extent to which the cases relied on by the majority have made fact-specific distinctions is evidenced by the Georgia court\u2019s strained attempt to distinguish its decision in <em>Hill </em>from its decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>in <em>Epps </em>and <em>Kephart. </em>Were the clauses at issue in those cases truly unambiguous, there would have been no need to resort to analysis concerning the placement of conjunctions and colons.

The majority argues that \"Heniser included this language\u201d to protect himself against loss by fire, and that the inclusion of this language \"indicates Heniser understood that his existing insurance policy would not cover the property after he sold it . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">Heniser did not include this language. It is standard boilerplate language in the printed land contract that he and the purchaser signed. This is not a case of an owner who did not recognize the need to insure the property from loss by fire. Heniser had purchased a homeowner\u2019s policy. There is no reason to suppose that if he in fact \"understood that his existing insurance policy would not cover the property after he sold it\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> that he would not have obtained substitute insurance either by seeking to enforce the land contract provision or otherwise obtaining insurance to protect his interest._</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Frankenmuth was not a party to the land contract, and the language of the land contract has no bearing on the meaning of the language of the homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">For reasons that probably do not appear on this record, when Heniser entered into the land contract he did not require the purchaser to provide evidence of fire insurance, which would generally be in the form of a homeowner\u2019s policy with a loss-payable clause added showing that Heniser was an additional insured as the land contract seller. Heniser\u2019s failure to require proof of insurance might have been attributable to ignorance on his part, which would be especially understandable if he was not represented by counsel. His or his counsel\u2019s ignorance or neglect tells us nothing about the correct construction of \"where you reside\u201d in homeowner\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The majority\u2019s construction of \"where you reside\u201d leads to harsh results not mandated by any rule of construction or underwriting risk. A homeowner\u2019s policy ceases to apply if an uninformed homeowner vacates the dwelling without causing policies of insurance to be rewritten. This is a windfall to insurers, to be availed of adventitiously. In the instant case, it was a fallback from its unsuccessful effort to withhold payment on factual grounds.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b320-8\">Mallett, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> The policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">Coverage a - Dwelling</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">We cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">1. the dwelling on the residence premises shown in the Declarations, including structures attached to the dwelling ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-13\"> The policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-14\">DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-15\">8. \"residence premises\u201d means: \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-16\">a. the one family dwelling, other structures and grounds; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-17\">b. that part of any other building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-18\">where you reside and which is shown as the \"residence premises\u201d in the Declarations.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-19\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\"> The majority writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">The policy is also clear that if Mr. Heniser did not \"reside\u201d at the insured property <em>at the time of the loss, </em>the property is not a \"residence premises,\u201d as defined by the policy, and the policy does not cover the loss. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 163-164.

The conjunctive \"and\u201d does not, however, appear in the instant clause. To the contrary, the instant clause includes a disjunctive \"or,\u201d which is not present in the <em>Epps </em>clause at all. Additionally, the inclusion of the semi-colon in the instant clause clearly shows that \"where you live,\u201d without any intervening punctuation, is only intended to modify \"that part of any other building.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 717.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> Id. at 718.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in <em>Nancarrow v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>932 F2d 742, 744 (CA 8, 1991), held for the insurer where the house was abandoned by the insured, the policy had been canceled for nonpayment of the premium (the plaintiff contending that the cancellation was ineffective), and no one having lived in the house for a number of years.
