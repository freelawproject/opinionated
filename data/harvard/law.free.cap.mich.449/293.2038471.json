In particular, plaintiffs contend that they were compelled to accept early payment of their retirement benefits and are therefore exempt from coordination of these benefits under MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d). We hold that plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of this statutory provision is erroneous and that MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d) does not preclude coordination where an employee is required to accept early pension benefits. We therefore affirm the disposition of . these cases by the Court of Appeals and remand them to the hearing referees for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">On February 8, 1985, Stroh Brewery Company announced its plan to close its brewery and to permanently lay off all brewery employees effective December 31, 1985. As a result of the plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>closing, Stroh liquidated its employee pension plan and paid its employees pension benefits. Plaintiff Riss, age fifty-three at the time, received $64,505.13 in a lump sum. Plaintiff Drouillard, then age fifty-four, received $52,748.03 in a lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">At the time the liquidation plan was announced, the contract plan administrator for the pension fund conducted meetings to explain the effect of the liquidation. Different classes of employees were invited to the meetings (salaried, hourly, able and disabled employees), and defendant prepared pension distribution applications for all employees. Riss attended one of these meetings; Drouillard did not attend the meetings and instead received his pension distribution information by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">At these assemblies the contract plan administrator gave all employees several forms, including a benefit election form. This form provided the employees with two choices regarding their pension benefits. First, employees could have their pension monies held in a trust, which would then be transferred to an insurance annuity until the employee requested distribution. Second, employees could take receipt of their pension benefits either in the form of a single lump-sum payment or rolled over into an individual retirement account. It is significant to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they were told that it would be in their best interests to reject the trust option.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Defendant\u2019s contract plan administrator testified that he instructed Stroh\u2019s employees that if they left their pension monies in the trust it would earn no interest and therefore it was not wise to leave the money in the trust. It is disputed whether the plan administrator told the employees that they had the option of leaving the money in the trust. However, he did advise that persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>with questions about the effect of payouts on their worker\u2019s compensation benefits should seek legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Paul Drouillard began working for Stroh\u2019s as a general laborer on June 4, 1956. At some point during the late 1960\u2019s or early 1970\u2019s, Drouillard injured his back while at work. He occasionally aggravated this injury, and he sometimes missed work as a result. On February 19, 1985, Drouillard slipped and fell on oil and allegedly sustained injuries to his neck, right shoulder, back, and musculoskeletal system. Drouillard never returned to work after this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Drouillard received worker\u2019s compensation benefits from defendant from February 20, 1985 until June 26, 1985. He filed a petition for continuing worker\u2019s compensation on July 2, 1985. On November 20, 1985, Drouillard received the lump-sum pension payment of $52,748.03 from the trust fund. In March, 1986, the magistrate found that Drouillard had sustained an aggravation of his preexisting degenerative arthritic condition and granted an open award of worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The magistrate held that Stroh could coordinate Drouillard\u2019s medical and social security benefits, but held that Stroh provided insufficient proof to allow coordination of pension benefits. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board submitted an order reversing the magistrate in this regard, stating that the worker\u2019s compensation payments were subject to coordination in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 354(l)(d) and 354(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Gerald Riss began work for the Stroh Brewery Company on April 2, 1956. During his employment he sustained injuries to his back, right shoulder, and wrist. Riss injured his back in 1957, 1965, and 1975. In 1965, his injuries required surgery, and he missed six months of work, returning to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>restricted light-duty work. In 1973, Riss injured his shoulder, which also required surgery; however, he did not miss work at that time. In 1973, and again in 1982, Riss sustained injuries to his wrist. From 1982 to 1985, this injury became progressively worse. However, he continued to work through May 28, 1985. He had surgery on his wrist two days later and was unable to return to work before Stroh closed the plant on May 31, 1985. Riss received benefits from May 31, 1985, through July 30, 1985. After recuperating from the wrist surgery, Riss was capable of returning to restricted work, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In May, 1988, Riss was granted an open award of worker\u2019s compensation by the hearing referee. The hearing referee allowed Stroh to \"coordinate sickness and accident benefits, unemployment benefits, and pension benefits received by plaintiff, in accordance with the [worker\u2019s compensation] act.\u201d The wcab opined that the funds were set aside for retirement and' because Riss did not retire, but instead was terminated, and because Stroh had shut down the plant, the payments were not for retirement. Instead, the board classified the benefits as \"severance benefits] involuntarily received,\u201d which are not within the purview of the coordination language of \u00a7 354. 1991 WCABO 761, 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The Court of Appeals consolidated these cases and affirmed the wcab determination in <em>Drouillard </em>and reversed the wcab determination in <em>Riss. </em>See <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>199 Mich App 67; 501 NW2d 229 (1993). Citing <em>Barr v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>189 Mich App 549; 473 NW2d 716 (1991), the Court determined that the lump-sum payouts were subject to the coordination language of the worker\u2019s compensation act. <em>Drouillard, supra </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">Worker\u2019s compensation is one unit in a loosely connected system of wage-loss protection that also includes unemployment compensation, social security old-age, disability, and survivors benefits, aid to families with dependent children, and general assistance. <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 654; 375 NW2d 715 (1985). Such wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to employees a portion of wages lost because of three major causes of wage loss: physical disability, unemployment, and old age. The crucial operative fact is that of wage loss; the cause of the wage loss merely dictates the category of legislation applicable. See, generally, 4 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 97, p 18-9 (1995 Supp, p 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Because most social legislation in Michigan was implemented in unrelated fragments, failure to coordinate resulted in an accumulation of benefits. For example, before coordination, it was not unusual for an employee to collect both unemployment and worker\u2019s compensation benefits at the same time. However, if an employee undergoes a period of wage loss, it does not follow that he should receive multiple wage-loss benefits simultaneously. An employee can experience only one wage loss and, in any logical or coherent system, should receive only one wage-loss benefit at any one time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">As part of the 1981 amendments of the worker\u2019s compensation act, the Legislature added \u00a7 354, which provides for the coordination of wage-loss benefits. The purpose of this legislation was to prevent duplicate wage-loss payments while main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>taining suitable wage-loss benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The coordination of worker\u2019s compensation and early pension benefits pursuant to \u00a7 354 presents a complicated set of issues previously only considered by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Plaintiffs concede that under MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d), pension benefits ordinarily are subject to coordination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the statute itself provides exceptions. For example, subsection 354(l)(e) allows the employer to reduce the proportional amount of the pension where the employee has also contributed to the pension. Additionally, subsection 354(14) prohibits an employer from co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ordinating a disability pension plan that was in existence on March 31, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Plaintiffs contend that they are exempted from coordination by MCL 418.354(12); MSA 17.237(354X12). In reference to this provision, plaintiffs contend that subsection 354(12) precludes coordination in all cases in which an employer \"compels\u201d employees to accept early retirement or pension benefits. We first note that it is not clear that plaintiffs were compelled to accept early retirement benefits. It is apparent that plaintiffs were told that the more expedient course would be to accept their pension benefits. However, it is also true that this was general advice to a disparate audience and plaintiffs were specifically instructed to seek legal advice if they had questions. However, even accepting arguendo plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they were compelled to accept early pension benefits, we believe that the conclusion that subsection 354(12) thereby precludes coordination only follows from a forced reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Murphy v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>447 Mich 93, 98; 523 NW2d 310 (1994). It has long been an accepted principle of statutory construction, in discerning the legislative will through its enactments, to construe a statute so as to give full effect to all its provisions. See, e.g., <em>Malonny v Mahar, </em>1 Mich 26 (1847). Subsection 354(12) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\"><em>Nothing in this section </em>shall be considered to compel an employee <em>to apply </em>for early federal social security old-age insurance benefits or <em>to apply </em>for early or reduced pension or retirement benefits. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">As indicated by the emphasized language, we be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>lieve a clue to the proper interpretation of subsection 354(12) can be found in the language \"Nothing in this section\u201d and \"to apply.\u201d A plain and straightforward interpretation of this provision shows that the Legislature was addressing something less than is claimed by the plaintiffs. This statute clearly and unambiguously provides that Michigan\u2019s coordination statute <em>itself </em>should not be interpreted to compel application for early pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">This interpretation is supported by reading subsection 354(12) in conjunction with the rest of the coordination statute. In fact, this Court is so required; in the interpretation of statutes, effect must be given, if possible, to every word, sentence and section and, to that end, the entire act must be read to be an harmonious and consistent enactment as a whole. <em>Dussia v Monroe Co Employees Retirement System, </em>386 Mich 244, 248; 191 NW2d 307 (1971). Subsection 354(3) provides that employers shall be notified of an employee\u2019s eligibility for social security benefits and that employees shall apply for social security benefits when eligible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Subsection 354(4) provides that an employer can withhold worker\u2019s compensation benefits until an employee timely applies for social security benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In light of these two provisions, subsection 354(12), and particularly its \"Nothing in this section\u201d language, manifestly means that an employer cannot withhold worker\u2019s compensation benefits in order to \"compel\u201d an employee to apply early for social security or pension benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Legislature could have, but did not, easily written the statute to read clearly and unambiguously as the plaintiffs would like: \"Coordination of benefits will not apply if the employer compels the employee to receive early or reduced pension, retirement or other benefits that can be coordinated.\u201d We believe that subsection 354(12) was intended only to void any inference that \u00a7 354 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>itself might permit or encourage employers to coerce early application for social security or pension benefits by withholding worker\u2019s compensation. It was not written to apply to all cases in which an employee is required or \"compelled\u201d to accept early retirement benefits. To have written the statute in such a manner would defeat the twin purposes of the coordination statute, i.e., the elimination of duplicative wage-loss benefits while maintaining a suitable level of wage-loss payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Contrary to the argument of the plaintiffs, MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d) was intended only to void any inference that Michigan\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation coordination statute might permit or encourage employers to coerce early application for social security or pension benefits by withholding worker\u2019s compensation. We therefore affirm the disposition of these cases by the Court of Appeals and remand them to the hearing referees for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-7\">Levin, Boyle, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> The legislative history of MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Coordination of benefits has been a major concern of employers for years. Public Act 357 coordinated workers\u2019 compensation with unemployment compensation (effective January 1, 1982) but failed to address coordination with Social Security and other insurance and pension plans. By coordinating workers\u2019 compensation benefits with Social Security and other benefits, Senate Bill 595 would provide a major savings to employers in the cost of workers\u2019 compensation while maintaining adequate benefit levels for disabled workers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">From its creation in 1912, workers\u2019 compensation in Michigan has been intended as a means of protecting an employee\u2019s ability to earn wages by replacing wages lost because of a disability resulting from an on-the-job injury. Since 1912, other public and private wage replacement insurance programs have appeared with the result that many employees now receive wage-loss benefits from two, three, or four different programs providing a total wage \"replacement\u201d greater than the wages the employee earned while on the job, while employers who must contribute to these programs find themselves paying more than once to replace the wages of a single employee. Such a situation is contrary to the basic philosophy of Michigan\u2019s wage-loss system and discourages some disabled employees from returning to work. Coordination of benefits, as proposed in Senate Bill 595, would reduce the overlap between the various public and private wage replacement programs while ensuring adequate wage-loss benefits to injured employees. [Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 595, adopted as 1981 PA 203, Coordination of Benefits, Supporting Arguments (January 7, 1982).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> <em>Barr v Stroh Brewery </em>is the only published Michigan opinion that addresses a fact pattern similar to that presented in this case. In <em>Barr, </em>the plaintiff was receiving worker\u2019s compensation when Stroh divested itself of the plaintiff\u2019s employing unit and terminated its pension plan for those employees. The plaintiff was informed of his options, which included immediately, receiving a pension of slightly more than $600 per month or having an amount of money equal to his share in the pension plan rolled over into an ira. The plaintiff selected the second option and received a draft for over $56,000, rolling over $30,000 into an ira and keeping the balance. The Court of Appeals held that all of the monies paid to an employee from a pension fund when an employer closes its business are subject to coordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The application of the coordination statute in the context of pension benefits is confused by prior, conflicting Court of Appeals actions. In <em>Knox v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, issued August 18, 1992 (Docket No. 129690), the plaintiff received a lump-sum check from the liquidated pension fund that he then rolled over into an ira. The magistrate in that case disallowed coordination, ruling that a lump-sum payout that was rolled over into an ira is not subject to coordination until the plaintiff receives the payout as taxable income. The wcac affirmed and the Court of Appeals denied the defendants\u2019 delayed application for leave to appeal. Conversely, in <em>Lemke v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, issued July 23, 1992 (Docket No. 130194), the Court of Appeals peremptorily reversed a wcac decision refusing to coordinate a lump-sum payment that was immediately rolled over into an ira, and then remanded <em>Lemke </em>to the wcac for further proceedings consistent with <em>Barr.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\"> The relevant subsections of MCL 418.354(1); MSA 17.237(354X1) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">This section is applicable when either weekly or lump sum payments are made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to section 351, 361, or 835 with respect to the same time period for which . . . pension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the employer, are also received or being received by the employee.

See MCL 418.301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(301) <em>et seq. </em>Before January 1, 1982, the payment of worker\u2019s compensation benefits had no effect on other employee benefits. However, in December, 1981, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 354, which allows an employer to coordinate worker\u2019s compensation benefits with other benefits.

Where a statute is plain and unambiguous in its terms, the courts have nothing to do but to obey it. <em>Mull v Equitable Life Ins Co, </em>444 Mich 508, 514, n 7; 510 NW2d 184 (1994); <em>Gardner-White Co v State Bd of Tax Administration, </em>296 Mich 225, 230; 295 NW 624 (1941). When different statutes address the same subject, courts must endeavor to read them harmoniously and give them reasonable effect. <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 568; 495 NW2d 539 (1993). Further, it has long been recognized that the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act is remedial in nature and should be construed in a liberal and humanitarian manner in favor of the employee. <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 191; 312 NW2d 640 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The coordination-of-benefits provisions were designed in part to prevent an employee from receiving duplicate benefits. Defendant contends that if it is not allowed to coordinate benefits, plaintiffs would, in essence, receive more than they are entitled to under the worker\u2019s compensation scheme.- The history of \u00a7 354 demonstrates a desire on the part of the Legislature to protect worker\u2019s compensation benefits while remedying a recurring dual-benefits payment quandary that had existed since the enactment of the worker\u2019s compensation statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">Coordination of benefits has been a major concern of employers for years. Public Act 357 coordinated workers\u2019 compensation with unemployment compensation (effective January 1, 1982) but failed to address coordination with Social Security and other insurance and pension plans. By coordinating workers\u2019 compensation benefits with Social Security and other benefits, Senate Bill 595 would provide a major savings to employers in the cost of workers\u2019 compensation <em>while maintaining adequate bene\u00f1t levels for disabled workers.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">From its creation in 1912, workers\u2019 compensation in Michigan has been intended as a means of protecting an employee\u2019s ability to earn wages by replacing wages lost because of a disability resulting from an on-the-job injury. Since 1912, other public and private wage replacement insurance programs have appeared with the result that many employees now receive wage-loss benefits from two, three, or four different programs providing a total wage \"replacement\u201d <em>greater than the wages the employee earned while on the </em>job, while employers who must contribute to these programs find themselves paying more than once to replace the wages of a single employee. Such a situation is contrary to the basic philosophy of Michigan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>wage-loss system and discourages some disabled employees from returning to work. Coordination of benefits, as proposed in Senate Bill 595, would reduce the overlap between the various public and private wage replacement programs <em>while ensuring adequate wage-loss bene\u00f1ts to injured employees. </em>[Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 595, adopted as 1981 PA 203, Coordination of Benefits, Supporting Arguments (January 7, 1982). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Therefore, there was a dual purpose to the enactment of the coordination statute. First, the legislation was crafted to provide employers major savings in worker\u2019s compensation costs. Second, the emphasized excerpts show the specific intent to protect adequate wage-loss benefits to injured employees. Thus, coordination of benefits must not be allowed at the expense of the worker\u2019s compensation act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Defendant argues that \u00a7 354(12) is an intrinsic statutory construction aid rather than a limitation on an employer\u2019s right to coordinate benefits. We disagree. The language of the statute itself gives no indication that \u00a7 354(12) was designed to be a proviso that only clarifies the remainder of the statute. Instead, the contrary is true. A proviso is generally added as a clause that limits the operation of the rule and removes special cases from the general enactment. Such clauses generally are set apart from the general enactment and are to be strictly construed. 1A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 20.22, p 110. Thus, for \u00a7 354(12) to be considered a proviso, it would have had to been drafted to address special cases only.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Moreover, it is clear from the history of SB 595 that the Legislature intended to protect the interest employees have in their pension benefits. On submission, the House of Representatives amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u00a7 354(12) and added the language \"or to apply for early or reduced pension or retirement benefits.\u201d 1981 Senate Journal 2575. The original bill contained reference only to federal social security old-age insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Federal social security old-age insurance and pension plans are aimed at meeting the income needs of individuals post retirement. Conversely, worker\u2019s compensation benefits are designed to provide replacement wages during an employee\u2019s disability status. Clearly, the Legislature recognized the different wage replacement purposes of these social welfare programs and intended to separate current wage-loss benefits from future wage-loss benefits. This fundamental difference in purpose lends further support to the notion that the benefits, in these circumstances, should not be coordinated. Thus, it is clear that the Legislature was specifically concerned with protecting pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">A reading of the statute as a whole indicates that \u00a7 354(12) was meant to apply to all cases in which an employer compels employees to accept early retirement or pension benefits. Section 354(12) was specifically designed to. protect an employee\u2019s interest in future wage-loss benefits and to prohibit an employer from coordinating worker\u2019s compensation benefits where an employee is compelled to accept an early pension payout. We believe this was the intent of the legislation and accordingly would apply \u00a7 354(12) to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">There have been several cases concerning \u00a7 354 and the coordination of worker\u2019s compensation benefits, but relatively few have considered coordinating worker\u2019s compensation benefits with pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>sion benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Barr v Stroh Brewery, </em>however, is a case that arose under comparable circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Barr, </em>the plaintiff was injured and was receiving worker\u2019s compensation benefits. During the plaintiff\u2019s disability, Stroh Brewery divested itself of the plaintiff\u2019s employment unit and terminated its pension plan with those employees. As a result, the plaintiff was given the option to receive an immediate monthly pension or to have an amount of money equal to his share in the pension plan rolled over into an individual retirement account. The plaintiff received a draft for $56,642, rolled over $30,000 into an ira, and retained the balance. The Court of Appeals allowed Stroh to coordinate worker\u2019s compensation benefits with the retained balance without addressing the application of \u00a7 354(12).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The present case is different from <em>Barr </em>in two respects. First, the event giving rise to the liquidation was different in each case. Because of this, the plaintiff in <em>Barr </em>was not a party to the liquidation that is central to the dispute in this case. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the present facts indicate that plaintiffs were compelled to accept the payout, leaving them without a rational choice. There is no indication in <em>Barr </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>plaintiff alleged he was compelled to take an early pension payout.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Moreover, in <em>Barr, </em>the plaintiff was given the opportunity to begin receiving a monthly pension. Riss\u2019 and Drouillard\u2019s choices consisted of receiving the pension benefits in a lump sum or electing not to take such a distribution. Stroh\u2019s pension fund administrator testified about two dispositive facts that effectually left plaintiffs without a meaningful choice: first, that if they did not accept the payout, their money would not accrue interest. Second, if an employee chose not to receive such a payout, the money would be transferred to an insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Maine is the only other state that has statutory language similar to that at issue in the present case. The Me Rev Stat Ann, tit 39-A, \u00a7 221(8), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">Nothing in this section may be considered to compel an employee to apply for early federal social security old-age insurance benefits or to apply for early or reduced pension or retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In <em>Jordan v Sears Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>651 A2d 358 (Me, 1994), the Supreme Court of Maine was asked to interpret the legislative intent of its coordination of benefits statute. The plaintiff suffered a compensable back injury and, because of his inability to work, was forced into early retirement. Sears gave the plaintiff approximately $22,000 in funds that Sears had paid into the plaintiff\u2019s pension account, and that the plaintiff immediately rolled it over into an ira. Subsequently, Sears filed a petition to coordinate benefits. The court held that an employer is not entitled to a coordination of compensation benefits when an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>employee rolls pension benefits over into an ira until those funds are distributed from the ira.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We do note, however, that the <em>Jordan </em>court held that the statutory language found at \u00a7 221(8) provides protection against the mandatory coordination of benefits where the employee is forced into early retirement. <em>Id. </em>at 361, n 3. We also recognize that the Michigan provision, \u00a7 354(12), was designed to protect a worker\u2019s earned pension benefits that are designed for retirement and are not intended to replace current wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The presentation of the employees\u2019 options in the liquidation meetings not only distinguishes this case from <em>Barr, </em>but it also should be determinative of the outcome. At the meetings, each employee was presented with the following forms that were prepared in advance by the contract plan administrator: (1) an application for benefits, (2) a benefit election form, (3) an election for payees of lump-sum distributions, and (4) a waiver form. The benefit election form provided the employees with two options. First, the employee could elect a joint and survivor annuity. Second, an employee could revoke any joint and survivor annuity and take the distribution in a single payment or it could be rolled into an individual retirement account.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The administrator explained that the law required that a married employee elect a joint and survivor annuity, unless spousal consent for another option was obtained. Significantly, none of the forms indicated that the employees could leave their money in the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">It was suggested to the employees that it would be in their best interests to accept lump sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>instead of leaving their money in trust. At the remand hearing-, defendant\u2019s contract plan administrator, Dean Holefca, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">What I was trying to differentiate is that if you left the money in the trust it would accumulate dust. <em>It would not earn any interest. </em>And, therefore, it was not wise to leave the money in the trust. Therefore, they really didn\u2019t have, in that respect, in that regard, or it <em>would be foolish to leave the money in the trust. </em>That was the point I was trying to make. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">With respect to the consequences of leaving the money in the fund, Mr. Holefca testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\"><em>Q. </em>Tell us what would happen to their vested pension benefit if they did not apply for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\"><em>A. </em>If they did not apply for their benefit, and because it is the intention of Stroh Brewery Company to terminate the Plan, then any participant\u2019s benefits who are not paid because of failure to apply for the benefit, those benefits would have been given to a third part[y]; i.e., an insurance company and the obligation to pay the benefits would pass from the Stroh Retirement Plan to the insurance company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In fact, no provisions were made by the plan to establish and maintain a trust in which employees could leave their benefits. Moreover, it is unknown whether the insurance company was to establish some sort of trust under which the employees\u2019 money would remain in trust and accumulate interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">There also appears to be some dispute concerning whether the plan administrator even told the employees that they had the option of leaving the money in trust. For example, Holefca testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Q. </em>Did you tell any of these people, the Stroh\u2019s terminated employees, when you had the meetings that you had with them, or in your letters to them, did you tell them they could just leave the money in the plan and they did not have to elect any of the options you mentioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\"><em>A. </em>I did at the meetings; that\u2019s correct. But, I also told them, at these meetings, that if they left the money in the plan it would accrue no interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\"><em>Q. </em>You have testified in a number of these Stroh\u2019s cases for Workers\u2019 Compensation; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\"><em>Q. </em>The last time you did you also agree that you remember testifying in the case of <em>Gilbert Shane v Stroh Brewery Company; </em>is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\"><em>Q. </em>That was within a year after these events occurred with the Stroh\u2019s shutdown, and the meetings that you had; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\"><em>Q. </em>Do you recall saying at that time; being asked the question, \"Did you tell any of these people, when you had these meetings, or in your letter to these people, <em>did you tell them they could just leave their money there and they didn\u2019t have to elect one of these </em>options?\u201d Answer, <em>\"No, I did not. \u201d </em>Did I read that correctly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\"><em>A. </em>You read that correctly. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">From this dialogue, we conclude that plaintiffs either were not informed that leaving the money in trust was an option or operated under the assumption that monies left in trust would not accumulate interest. Indeed, it is these facts that necessitate the determination that Stroh Brewery is not entitled to coordinate plaintiffs\u2019 benefits under \u00a7 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>As the wcab stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">Also, MCL 418.354(12) [MSA 17.237(354X12)] states in terms that the employer may not compel the employee to apply for early retirement benefits, and if defendant did not do so in this case, what did it do? If plaintiff had any other choice than to draw out his pension benefits at once or take them over time, that choice does not appear here. His job ended and he was out of work. We agree completely with plaintiff\u2019s briefed argument that coordination of benefits, designed, as everybody connected with the Act well knows, to prohibit \"double dipping\u201d and unjust enrichment by employees, could not be applied when an employee was forced into early \"retirement,\u201d when a plant closed ending his employment. Obviously, that is what Section 354(12) is telling us in plain words, though defendant does not mention it either. [1991 WCABO 761, 771.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In this regard, we agree with the wcab. Section 354(12) \"is telling us in plain words\u201d that the act \"could not be applied when an employee was forced into early 'retirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). However, while Stroh itself may not have been directly responsible for compelling plaintiffs to accept the lump-sum payment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> plaintiffs were nevertheless compelled within the meaning of the statute. A clear reading of the statute indicates that \u00a7 354(12) is to be viewed from the perspective of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Simply stated, the focus of the inquiry is whether plaintiffs were compelled to accept an early pension payout, not whether defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>actually the compelling party. Indeed, like other social welfare programs, worker\u2019s compensation is a no-fault system.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">In 1912, Michigan along with most of the other states, adopted a worker\u2019s compensation act. The new remedy was essentially a no-fault system, under which a worker no longer had to prove negligence on the part of the employer and the employer\u2019s three defenses were eliminated. The intent of the law was to require an employer to compensate a worker for any injury suffered in the course of the worker\u2019s employment, <em>regardless of the existence of any fault. </em>[Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan: Law &amp; Practice (2d ed), p 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Thus, the relationship of Dean Holefca to the defendant is irrelevant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> except that defendant is nevertheless obligated to pay worker\u2019s compensation to the plaintiffs as long as they remain disabled. A literal reading of the coordination statute prohibits the compulsion of an early pension payout. See <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 658; 375 NW2d 715 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The question before us then is whether the employer is allowed to coordinate benefits pursuant to \u00a7 354(l)(d) or whether the closing of the brewery and the subsequent liquidation of the pension plan <em>compelled </em>the employees to accept an early pension payout that would provide the exception outlined in \u00a7 354(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>at 276, defines \u201ccompel\u201d as follows: \u201cto force or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>drive, esp. to a course of action .... Compel implies an external force; <em>it may be a persuasive urging from another person or a constraining reason or circumstance </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We would apply this definition to the occurrences in the present case. While plaintiffs were not forced to take the lump-sum payment and were given the option of leaving their accumulated monies in the pension fund, such a choice would have been irrational because any money not received would not have accumulated interest. Indeed, the contract plan administrator either did not inform the employees of this option or made it seem such a poor choice that any rational person would have begrudgingly accepted an immediate lump-sum payout. The word compel, as used in the statute, is not so inflexible as to suggest that the company would have had to force the employees to accept only one undesirable option. Instead, under the limited circumstances presented here, we would construe compel to mean the absence of a rational choice. Thus, for the purposes of the statute, plaintiffs were compelled to accept an early payout of pension benefits, which \u00a7 354(12) expressly prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">An employer may liquidate a pension plan, and lump-sum payments are subject to the provisions of the coordination statute if the liquidation is properly administered. However, in our opinion, the plaintiffs in this case had no meaningful choice other than to accept these lump-sum payouts. The option of leaving their money in trust was represented as a poor choice. Moreover, the employees were led to believe that the value of their pensions would not be left intact. In essence, the employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>were told that their money would not earn interest. This fact represents a very real compulsion for employees to apply for a distribution. Because plaintiffs were compelled to accept lump-sum payouts, defendant should not be able to coordinate plaintiffs\u2019 worker\u2019s compensation benefits with their pension benefits. Accordingly, we would reverse both cases.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-4\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\"> This is the second time that this case has reached this Court.
