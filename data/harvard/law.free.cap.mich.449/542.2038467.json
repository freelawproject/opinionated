Plaintiff seeks recovery from defendant Hilti, Inc., on the basis of Hilti, Inc.\u2019s, status as: (1) the nonmanufacturing seller or distributor of the drill (seller theory), (2) the apparent manufacturer of the drill, or (3) the subsidiary corporation of the manufacturer of the drill.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In this appeal, we are asked to decide whether the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s apparent-manufacturer theory and parent-subsidiary theory of liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons explained herein, we decline to adopt the apparent-manufacturer doctrine, and we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>regarding- the summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s parent-subsidiary theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">PACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Plaintiff, Eric Seasword, was injured by a power drill while working for his employer on January 4, 1984. A plate attached to the drill bore the name and address of defendant, Hilti Incorporated. Imprinted in the drill itself were the words \"hilti\u201d and \"Made in Liechtenstein.\u201d The drill was designed and manufactured by Hilti A.G., a Liechtenstein corporation who was not made a defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In his amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that the drill was' defective in its design and that Hilti, Inc., was subject to liability because it sold, distributed, and held itself out as the manufacturer of the drill.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Defendant denied plaintiff\u2019s allegations and moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) and MCR 2.116(C)(10). To support the denial that it sold the injurious drill, defendant submitted a sworn affidavit from its in-house counsel, stating that the drill had been \"designed and manufactured by Hilti A.G. and sold f.o.b. at its place of origin.\u201d The affidavit further stated that Hilti A.G. was a foreign corporation, based in Liechtenstein and \"distinct and separate\u201d from Hilti, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">In response to the motion for summary disposition, plaintiff asserted, for the first time and as an additional theory, that defendant could be liable as a subsidiary of Hilti, A.G., the manufacturer._</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>On August 11, 1988, the trial court granted summary disposition for defendant on all counts, including plaintiff\u2019s parent-subsidiary claim. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Court of Appeals, in an unpublished decision, . reversed the summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s seller theories of liability because it concluded that defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant did not sell the drill.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It affirmed the summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s parent-subsidiary theory because plaintiff presented no evidence creating an issue of fact on that claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On remand from this Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals also rejected plaintiff\u2019s apparent-manufacturer theory, finding it inconsistent with Michigan\u2019s products liability law and explaining that it would impose strict liability on a nonmanufacturing seller.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Having retained jurisdiction on remand, we now address the issues that plaintiff has submitted for review of which the most jurisprudentially significant is whether we should supplement Michigan\u2019s products liability jurisprudence with an apparent-manufacturer doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">A. HOLDING OUT</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The apparent-manufacturer theory, also referred to as the \"holding out theory,\u201d is based on 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 400, p 337, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">One who puts out as his own product a chattel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>manufactured by another is subject to the same liability as though he were its manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">This theory simply permits a factfinder to \"transfer\u201d the manufacturer\u2019s liability to that separate entity holding itself out as the manufacturer. When the doctrine applies, the nonmanufacturer is, in reality, substituted for the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The Model Uniform Product Liability Act (upla)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and many states have adopted some form of the apparent-manufacturer theory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the context of the upla and contemporary product liability laws of many other states, the apparent-manufacturer doctrine serves the purpose of assuring that some entity in the product enterprise remains answerable for injuries caused by defective products.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We believe, however, that Michigan\u2019s existing theories of seller liability and related tort doctrines, including piercing the corporate veil and successor liability, as well as laws of agency, fraud, and misrepresentation, preclude the need for an apparent-manufacturer doctrine and diminish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>doctrine\u2019s utility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because nonmanufacturing sellers in Michigan continue to be answerable for design defects under existing tort theories, we find it unnecessary to adopt an <em>additional </em>theory under which nonmanufacturing sellers could be accountable for injuries caused by an allegedly defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Accordingly, while the apparent-manufacturer doctrine' serves important interests, not the least of which are accountability, protecting consumer expectations, and deterring abuse of corporate structures to evade tort liability, we believe that those objectives are adequately accomplished by existing laws and therefore do not necessitate an apparent-manufacturer doctrine. Thus, we decline to supplement our current products liability jurisprudence with the apparent-manufacturer doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">B. PARENT-SUBSIDIARY THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s related theory of liability is premised on the alleged parent-subsidiary relationship between defendant and the manufacturer of this drill. We believe that the summary disposition of that claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">It is a well-recognized principle that separate corporate entities will be respected. <em>Wells v Firestone, </em>421 Mich 641, 650; 364 NW2d 670 (1984). Michigan law presumes that, absent some abuse of corporate form, parent and subsidiary corporations are separate and distinct entities. See, e.g., <em>Herman v Mobile Homes Corp, </em>317 Mich 233, 243; 26 NW2d 757 (1947); <em>Gledhill v Fisher &amp; Co, </em>272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Mich 353, 357-358; 262 NW 371 (1935). This presumption, often referred to as a \"corporate veil,\u201d may be pierced only where an otherwise separate corporate existence has been used to \"subvert justice or cause a result that [is] contrary to some other clearly overriding public policy.\u201d <em>Wells, supra </em>at 650; <em>Helzer v F Joseph Lamb Co, </em>171 Mich App 6, 9; 429 NW2d 835 (1988). More specifically, Michigan courts have generally required' that a subsidiary must \"become 'a mere instrumentality\u2019 of the parent\u201d before its separate corporate existence will be disregarded. <em>Maki v Copper Range Co, 121 </em>Mich App 518, 524; 328 NW2d 430 (1982). See also <em>Shirley v Drackett Products Co, </em>26 Mich App 644; 182 NW2d 726 (1970).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">This law makes it clear that in order to state a claim for tort liability based on an alleged parent-subsidiary relationship, a plaintiff would have to allege: (1) the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship, and (2) facts that justify piercing the corporate veil. Plaintiff\u2019s parent-subsidiary theory is fatally deficient with respect to the second element.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">While plaintiff\u2019s pleadings lack any indicia of a parent-subsidiary theory of liability, plaintiff did disclose that theory in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition and the trial court considered it. Specifically, in opposition to summary disposition, plaintiff alleged that Hilti, Inc., was a subsidiary of Hilti A.G., the admitted manufacturer. Accepting that allegation as true, plaintiff has not stated a claim based on a parent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>subsidiary relationship because plaintiff has alleged no facts, nor offered any proof that defendant and Hilti A.G. have abused their presumably separate and distinct corporate forms. Absent such allegations or facts, plaintiff has failed to state a valid claim of parent-subsidiary liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Plaintiff characterizes the disposition of its parent-subsidiary theory as a \"stealth\u201d motion for summary disposition. When a covert theory of liability is uncovered by a stealth motion for summary disposition and that theory is <em>legally </em>insufficient, the interest of fairness sought to be advanced by pretrial procedure is not offended. Summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) was properly granted on plaintiff\u2019s parent-subsidiary theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">We vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals, but affirm its earlier decision to the extent that it held that the summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s parent-subsidiary theory of liability was proper. Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b677-7\">Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b677-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATz\"><em>(separate </em>opinion).
