A month later, on February 5, 1991, Garcia moved for dismissal of McCord\u2019s appeal to the wcac from the magistrate\u2019s decision asserting that McCord had \"refused and denied payment of medical benefits required by the terms of the award\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contrary to \u00a7 862(2), which provides that the filing of a claim for review of a magistrate\u2019s decision \"shall not operate as a stay of providing medical benefits\u201d awarded by the magistrate, and that medical benefits shall be paid from and after the date of the award until final determination of the appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>McCord responded to Garcia\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating that it had \"considered all requests for payment of medical benefits and [had] paid those which were reasonable and necessary in accordance\u201d with the magistrate\u2019s decision, and had \"denied payment on other requests which are not reasonable or necessary . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> McCord did not specify which \"requests for payment\u201d had been paid, and which had been denied, nor did it specify why a particular request was not reasonable or necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">McCord asserted that \u00a7 862(2) provides only for furnishing medical benefits \"required by the terms of the award,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the magistrate\u2019s award in the instant case \"does not provide the terms by which medical benefits would be required,\u201d and that the award provided \"no guidance\u201d concerning \"which medical providers and care and treatment [were] necessary or which amount was reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The wcac, on June 20, 1991, ordered McCord to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>provide it within thirty days \"an affirmation of the bills that have been received, the date the medical services were provided, and a showing that the bills have been paid pursuant to the magistrate\u2019s order of January 22, 1989, awarding reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to plaintiff\u2019s back. <em>Failure to provide timely compliance with MCL 418.862(2) shall subject defendants\u2019 appeal to dismissal.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">McCord did not provide the affirmation of bills received and dates medical services were provided, and did not show that such bills had been paid. Rather, McCord responded on July 17, 1991, to the wcac order by filing a motion to remand and consolidate or hold in abeyance, stating that disputes had arisen concerning the portion of the award requiring payment of reasonable and necessary medical expenses, and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">What expenses or treatment are \"reasonable and necessary\u201d were not spelled out in the Magistrate\u2019s decision and, therefore, has [sic] been a matter of differing interpretation. Defendant submits that it has paid all \"reasonable and necessary\u201d expenses since the date of the Magistrate\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">McCord\u2019s motion noted that a hearing was scheduled for July 31, 1991, on its application for a hearing objecting to the reasonableness and necessity of the medical expenses being claimed by Garcia. The motion continued that \u00a7 315<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>that all fees and charges for treatment were subject to the health care services rules, that those rules provide for resolving disputes between carriers and health care providers,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that rule 1904(6),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> concerning the continuation of medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>benefits during an appeal, provides for expedited treatment accorded to sixty-day cases when a carrier files an application to stop or limit its liability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The wcac, on August 30, 1991, denied the motion for remand and consolidation or to hold in abeyance, and granted Garcia\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to comply with \u00a7 862(2) and the wcac\u2019s order of June 20, 1991.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, holding that the wcac has the implied authority to dismiss for noncompliance with \u00a7 862(2), citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419; 258 NW2d 414 (1977).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The majority said that when McCord \"refused to pay the medical bills as required\u201d by the magistrate\u2019s and wcac\u2019s orders, it subjected itself \"to the possibility of a dismissal as stated in the commission\u2019s order.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">One of the judges on the panel dissented. He said that if the only question presented was whether. the wcac, \"under its implied power to enforce \u00a7 862(2),\u201d could properly dismiss an appeal by an employer who ignores a magistrate\u2019s order requiring payment of medical benefits, he would join in the majority. He dissented because \u00a7 315 contemplates that the employer\u2019s insurance carrier will \"monitor closely medical treatment for injured workers with an eye to detecting both charges in excess of the schedules of maximum fees promulgated by the agency and any over-utilization.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The dissenting judge said that the \"problem in this case\u201d was that the magistrate\u2019s order was not \"clear enough to make apparent what medical expenses are required.\u201d It \"merely recapitulates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the statutory language\u201d that obligates the employer to pay reasonable and necessary medical expenses under \u00a7 315, \"albeit confining that obligation to plaintiff\u2019s back condition. The award does not indicate what particular medical treatment ought to be included, nor does it provide criteria from which it could reliably be determined by the appellants, either in advance or in retrospect, that a particular prognosticated treatment, prosthetic, or prophylactic is within the magistrate\u2019s concept of 'reasonable and necessary\u2019 medical treatment related to plaintiff\u2019s back.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">McCord notes that \u00a7 862(2) does not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>provide that the wcac may dismiss an employer\u2019s appeal for failure to continue to provide medical benefits \"until final determination of the appeal,\u201d and contends that it lacks such power. We agree with the Court of Appeals, for essentially the same reasons set forth in <em>McAvoy, </em>that the wcac has the implied authority to dismiss appeals for noncompliance with \u00a7 862(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the order of the wcac dismissing McCord\u2019s appeal because \u00a7 862(2) and rule 1904(6) required McCord\u2019s insurer to continue to provide medical benefits awarded by a magistrate during the pendency of an appeal until a different order was entered by a magistrate, the wcac, the Court of Appeals, or this Court. Rule 1904(6), paralleling \u00a7 862(2), provides in effect that the insurer\u2019s filing of an application to stop or limit its liability does not operate as a stay, but entitles the insurer to expedited treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Nor do we find the award to be ambiguous because it does not spell out the precise treatment that is within the ambit of \"[a]ny and all reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to plaintiff\u2019s back et sequelae.\u201d Four doctors, three of whom were specialists who had treated Garcia and one of whom appears to have coordinated the treatment, testified concerning their findings and the treatments they had administered. Their testimony provided context for the language of the order, \"reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to plaintiff\u2019s back et sequelae.\u201d McCord\u2019s insurer was obliged to \"continue to provide,\u201d until a different order was entered by a magistrate, the wcac, the Court of Appeals, or this . Court, treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ments for Garcia\u2019s back that were similar to those that her physicians, before the award, had provided as described in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Magistrates do not ordinarily, if ever, spell out in an initial award of worker\u2019s compensation the particular treatments to be administered by an injured worker\u2019s physicians. The hearing, as here, may have concluded over a year before the award was entered. The patient, as here, may have moved from one physician to another. Different physicians often recommend and administer different treatments for the same ailment. The worker\u2019s condition may have worsened or improved, requiring a change in treatment. A magistrate\u2019s award cannot properly be faulted as ambiguous because it does not spell out the precise treatments to be administered in the future by the worker\u2019s physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Section 315(4) provides that a worker\u2019s compensation insurer shall not pay a provider of medical services for any excessive charges or unjustified treatment, and that a provider shall return payments for excessive charges or unjustified treatment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Section 315 further provides that fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>other charges for medical treatment of injured workers shall be subject to rules promulgated by the Department of Management and Budget.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Health care services rules were so promulgated, and provide a process for resolving disputes between insurers and providers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We agree with the dissenting judge that \u00a7 315 contemplates that worker\u2019s compensation insurers will police compliance with health care services rules by withholding payment when they conclude that the charges are excessive or the treatment is not necessary. When a dispute arises, it is to be resolved according to the dispute resolution provisions. Ordinarily, disputes are resolved without a hearing, sometimes through mediation, and, in a relatively small number of cases, following a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Seventy to eighty percent of all claims are paid voluntarily by worker\u2019s compensation insurers or self-insured employers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In those cases, the procedures set forth in subsections 1 through 5 of rule 1904<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for resolving insurer/provider disputes are applicable, and the insurer may, indeed, withhold payment until the dispute is resolved in accordance with those procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">When, however, compensation and medical benefits are not paid by the insurer or self-insured voluntarily, subsection 6 of rule 1904 contemplates that, after an award of compensation and medical benefits has been entered by a magistrate, the insurer or a self-insured employer will provide medical benefits until another order is entered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>a magistrate, the wcac, the Court of Appeals, or this Court, relieving the insurer or the employer of its obligation to make payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Where benefits are not paid voluntarily, and benefits are awarded, a number of years generally will have elapsed between the injury and the entry of an award. Section 862(2) provides that medical \"[bjenefits accruing prior to the award shall be withheld until final determination of the appeal.\u201d It is thus only in the relatively smaller number of cases in which a m\u00e1gistrate enters an award and a dispute arises concerning medical benefits accruing after the award that the insurer is required to make payments and cannot withhold payment until an adjudication of disputes that arise after entry of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The strictures of subsection 6 of rule 1904 harmonize the language added by 1985 PA 103, providing that an appeal to the wcac \"shall not operate as a stay of providing medical benefits required by the terms of the award,\u201d with the earlier enacted language of \u00a7 315, providing that a health care provider shall not receive, and an insurer shall not pay, charges deemed by the carrier to be excessive or for unjustified treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In the instant case, McCord, a year after the magistrate\u2019s award was entered in 1990, filed, on January 8, 1991, a \"petition to stop benefits,\u201d on the basis of reports of physicians who had examined Garcia in November, 1990, asserting that further medical treatment was not reasonable or necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">This, thus, is not a case in which an insurer asserted that a particular treatment was unnecessary or that a particular charge was excessive, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>even that ambiguity of an award left it in doubt regarding the extent of its responsibility. In the instant case, McCord\u2019s insurer asserted, rather, that no further medical treatment was necessary. Section 315 and the health care services rules do not contemplate that an insurer, after an award has been entered, can withhold all payment for medical benefits absent a determination by a magistrate or an appellate tribunal that no further medical treatment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">If an insurer, simply by filing a petition to stop benefits, could deny a worker \u2014 found by a magistrate after a full hearing to have been disabled and entitled to compensation and medical benefits \u2014payment of medical benefits until another hearing and determination by a magistrate or an appellate tribunal whether further medical treatment was justified, \u00a7 862(2), providing that \"[a] claim for review . . . shall not operate as a stay of providing medical benefits required by the terms of the award,\u201d would be deprived in many cases of meaningful effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We do not wish to be understood as saying that the wcac could not, in the exercise of discretion, refrain from dismissing an appeal where the insurer has timely sought a hearing \u2014 which, because of scheduling or other unavoidable difficulty, has been unduly delayed \u2014 respecting a claim that particular treatments, as distinguished from all medical care and treatment, are unnecessary or that particular charges are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">McCord did not, following the wcac\u2019s order of June 20, 1991 \u2014 req\u00fairing an affirmation of the bills received and paid \u2014 respond by showing that it had paid all bills except specifically identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>bills. McCord claimed, rather, that all charges from and after October, 1990, were unnecessary and excessive because physicians had reported to it, on the basis of examinations in November, 1990, that in their opinion no further care or treatment was justified. Although McCord\u2019s petition to stop benefits was not filed until January, 1991, it refused to pay anything at all in respect to any bill for care or treatment rendered from and after October, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Neither \u00a7 315 nor the health care services rules empower an employer to so ignore an order of a magistrate awarding medical benefits. The petition to stop benefits filed by McCord in January, 1991, was just that \u2014 a petition, not an order of a magistrate or appellate tribunal authorizing the suspension or stoppage of payment for all medical care or treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We conclude, on the facts and circumstances of this case, that the wcac did not abuse its discretion in dismissing McCord\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b160-10\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b160-11\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\"> 201 Mich App 697; 506 NW2d 912 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\"> The order and subsequent orders also directed defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company, McCord\u2019s insurer, to pay the benefits, and to take other actions.

This will then predictably create a situation, unless reversed, in which neither employees as a class, nor insurance carriers as a group, have any particular incentive under this construction of the act to challenge the necessity for or charge \u2014within limits fixed by regulation \u2014 made for any medical service, because reimbursement from the general fund is guaranteed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">The majority finds support for its position in Rule 1904(6), but the obligation imposed by the rule is in turn derivative, once again, being based on the requirement imposed \"by the terms of an award to provide medical benefits.\u201d The rule, like the statute, is written in general terms, but can only be properly understood to apply to terms of a magistrate\u2019s award to provide medical benefits that are definite, where the requisite certainty is measured by whether the award can be made judicially enforceable under \u00a7 863. <em>[Id., </em>pp 712-713.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The dissenting judge would have reversed and remanded to the wcac for a determination of the appeal on the merits, or to permit further remand to the magistrate for clarification of the order, or for joinder with McCord\u2019s request for a hearing concerning the propriety of the charges. <em>Id., </em>pp 715-716.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> If a carrier determines that a health facility or health care provider has made any excessive charges or required unjustified treatment, hospitalization, or visits, the health facility or health care provider shall not receive payment under this chapter from the carrier for the excessive fees or unjustified treatment, hospitalization, or visits, and shall be liable to return to the carrier any such fees or charges already collected.
