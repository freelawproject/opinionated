D. Smith had. agreed for plaintiff Hamner to erect the1 granary on her land and that it was tacitly understood between said Hamner and said Smith that said granary should be the property of Hamner, because there is no evidence to the effect that he had such consent and no evidence that it was understood that the granary should be the property of said Hamner; on the contrary, the facts show in said findings that the rental value of said land far exceeded the value of all the improvements that said Hamner had put thereon, nor is there any evidence as to his intention in respect to said granary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-13\">There was no evidence rhat L. D .Smith made any agreement with Hamner in respect to the erection of the granary. Hor was there any evidence that Hamner and Smith tacitly understood that the granary should be the property of plaintiff Hamner. On the contrary it was shown by Hamper\u2019s testimony that he was practically without a rental contract and without authority to make the improvements except at his oivn risk. On this point Hamner testified on cross-examination that he had no contract with Mrs. L. D. Smith or agreement by which he was to be permitted to remove the granary from the land on which it was situated. The facts would tend to show that he had no such authority, because his testimony on the subject was substantially as follows: That all of the taxes and improvements for which he had paid for the seven years that he had occupied Mrs. Smith\u2019s land amounted in the aggregate to $2100; and the reasonable rental value of the same land for the same period amounted to $6300; and that therefore the outlay that he made on the land lacked $4200 of equaling the rental value of the land. He had paid no rent. Muir v. Jones, 19 Law. Rep. Ann., 443.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-14\"><em>W. T. Allen </em>and <em>Geo. E.

We can not say as a matter of law that Hamner did not own the building because he did not have title to the land. The circumstances were such that the judge might have inferred consent of the owner of the land for Hamner to place the building there for use during his occupancy of the land and to remove it when he should surrender possession. The question of fact was conclusively settled by the Court of Civil Appeals. All other questions are determined against plaintiff in error in our opinion filed this day in the case of Insurance Company of Forth America v. W. D. Wicker.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
