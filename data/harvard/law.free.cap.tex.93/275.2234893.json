On defendant\u2019s appeal this was reversed and judgment rendered for appellant, a dissenting opinion being filed, and the case was then referred to the Supreme Court upon certificate of dissent. For majority and dissenting opinions, in the Court of Civil Appeals, see <em>21 </em>Texas Civil Appeals, <em>622.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-8\">W. P. <em>Gibbs </em>and <em>Albert Stevenson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AES\">Briefly stated, York\u2019s contention is that Lasater\u2019s death before notice and qualification created no vacancy in said office, and, he being the incumbent by virtue of his former election, no vacancy existed in said office, in legal contemplation, and therefore the Commissioners Court had no authority of law to appoint appellant Maddox to fill such vacancy. Said York also contends that though he turned said office and the affairs thereof over to appellant Maddox upon his said appointment and qualification, he did not in legal contemplation abandon said office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">In view of the organic law as laid down by our - Constitution, article 16, section 30, which expressly declares that \u201cthe duration of all offices not fixed by this Constitution shall never exceed two years,\u201d appellant contends that York\u2019s term of office by his former election in 1896 expired at 6 o\u2019clock on the day of Lasater\u2019s election to said office in 1898, on which occasion the people having the right to pass the title to said office, passed it by their votes from York to Lasater; the canvassing the vote and issuing certificate, notice, etc., being simply the- system of judicial machinery set in motion for the purpose of ascertaining and determining, not who should be elected, but who had been elected, or rather had received the title to said office from the people or voters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-10\">That Lasater was alive and eligible and a creature competent to receive the title to said office at the time of his election is not disputed; and having such title, and dying at any time after such election, the office (being other than inheritable property) at once became, vacant, and it devolved upon the Commissioners Court to fill such vacancy by appointment, as provided by the Constitution, article 5, section <em>23, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>which seeks to make special provision for the office of sheriff, and provides that \u201cthere shall be elected by the qualified voters of each county a sheriff who shall hold his term of office for two years; whose duties, perquisites, and fees of office shall be provided by the Legislature, and vacancies in whose office shall be filled by the commissioners court until the next general election for State or county officers.\u201d Here we find both of the above sections of the Constitution leveled directly at the tenure of the office in question, both of which settle it at a period of two years and no more, and no authority is conferred upon the Legislature to extend the term; while article 16, section 17, of the Constitution provides that \u201call officers within this State shall continue to perform the duties of their offices until their successors shall be duly qualified\u201d (not elected and qualified), showing clearly that the right to the office can not possibly pass to one person for a longer period than two-years at one time; while the last named article makes provision for a \u201ctenure at sufferance\u201d until an owner can qualify.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">While it is true that article 4890, Revised Statutes, says \u201cthere shall be elected by the qualified voters of each county one sheriff who shall hold his office for two years and until his successor shall be elected and qualified,\u201d yet to the extent that article may be tortured into a construction extending the title, tenure, or term of the office in question beyond the period of two years, it.is wholly without constitutional authority;, and as Judge Barton says in Kenner v. Spears, 53 Southwestern Reporter, 247, involving this identical question (a parallel ease to the one-at bar, decided by the Court of Chancery Appeals of Tennessee since the trial of this case, which was affirmed orally by the Supreme Court of that State), \u201cthe Legislature can not place a construction upon the Constitution which will be binding upon the courts.\u201d See also State v. Brewster, 9 N. E. Rep., 849.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">It is also held in Wright v. Adams, 45 Texas, 134, that \u201cwhen the-duration or term of an office is a question of doubt, that interpretation should be placed upon it which limits such tenure to the shortest time and returns to the granting power the opportunity to choose again.\u201d And while our Constitution does not fix a day certain for the beginning, and ending of a term of office, and that of Tennessee does, and goes further than ours in that it provides that an officer shall hold his office-until his successor is duly \u201celected and qualified,\u201d yet in the case of State v. Spears, 53 Southwestern Reporter, 247, the courts of Tennessee, in construing that Constitution and statute thereunder, say in effect that the sentence, \u201cevery officer shall hold his office until his successor is elected and qualified,\u201d only imposes upon the incumbent the duty of occupying the office and discharging the duties thereof beyond his term until a successor can be provided. The same doctrine is held by our courts upon these questions in State v. Cocke, 54 Texas, 486; Flatan v. State, 56 Texas, 93; State v. Owens, 63 Texas, 262.; Wright v. Adams, 45 Texas, 140, and State v. Catlin, 84 Texas, 52.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">The main point relied on, however, by counsel for appellee in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>court and in the Court o \u00a3 Appeals, was that on account of article 4894, \u00a1Revised Statutes, there was no \u201cvacancy\u201d in the office of sheriff of Palo Pinto County when appellant was appointed, Lasater having died before .\u201creceiving notice of his election, and before having qualified.\u201d Or to use the familiar argument and the exact language of counsel for appellee, that \u201ca man can not vacate an office he has never been inducted into, nor can he pull off a coat he has never had on, nor can he vacate a house he has never been in,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">In the case of State v. Spears just decided by the Court of Chancery Appeals of Tennessee, and approved by the Supreme Court of that State, this question is decided adversely to the contention of appellee. See 53 S. W. Rep., 247. There the court says that \u201cthe insistence of counsel for defendant is based upon a confusion of thought as to when a vacancy occurs,\u201d etc. There the sheriff-elect, John. Rowan, died without qualifying or entering upon the. duties of the office. The question of \u201cvacancy or no vacancy\u201d was directly raised, and decided adversely to the contention of the appellee in this cause. It is true that Rowan received notice of his election, but we submit that the matter of notice is immaterial, and that the title to the office passed by the election of Lasater, and that he could have obtained the office had he lived, even though no notice was ever issued and he had been compelled to resort to the courts for the same. The case of the State v. Owens, 63 Texas, 261, and other Texas cases decide this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">It was not competent for the Legislature of Texas to extend the term of the office, and the instance of a \u201cvacancy\u201d indicated by article 4894, Sayles\u2019 Statutes, is but one instance, and is only directory.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-7\"><em>William Veal, J. T. Daniels, </em>H. <em>E. Bradford, </em>and <em>Greene &amp; Stewart, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae1\">The chief question, if indeed not the only one in the case, was whether, under the admitted facts, there existed a vacancy in the office of sheriff of Palo Pinto County at the time appellant was appointed by the Commissioners Court. If there existed a vacancy in said office at said time, then the appointment of Maddox was valid and the court's charge to the jury to find for plaintiff was wrong; but if, as we contend, there existed no vacancy in said office, the appointment of Maddox was a nullity and the court's charge was correct. The admitted facts show that Lasater, the sheriff elect, died without qualifying and without receiving any legal notice of his election, and under this proof we respectfully contend no vacancy in the office existed, for it is almost universally held that in the absence of some statutory provision on the subject, the failure of one elected to an office, for any cause, to qualify does not create a vacancy in such office. Hamilton v. State, 51 S. W. Rep., 219; Kimberlin v. State, 29 N. E. Rep., 773; Commonwealth v. Hanley, 9 Pa. St., 513; Baird v. Tilton, 37 Cal., 614; People v. Whitman, 10 Cal., 38; Tradway v. Lusk, 18 Mo., 333; 19 Am. and Eng. Enc. of Law, p. 432, and note 5, 433, and notes 1, 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-8\">If, as we contend, no vacancy existed in said office,, what relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>or attitude does the appellee York occupy with regard to the same? We think this question is one of easy solution, for the Constitution of the State, as well as the statute, expressly provides that he shall continue to perform the duties of his office until his successor is duly qualified. Article 16, section 17, of the present State Constitution reads as follows: \u201cAll officers within this State shall continue to perform the duties of their offices until their successors shall be duly qualified.\" And article 4890, Revised Statutes, reads as follows: \u201cThere shall be elected by the qualified voters of each county one sheriff, who shall hold his office for two years, and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.\" Under the foregoing provisions of the Constitution and the statute we do not think there is any room for doubt or quibble that appellee is to-day, and has all the time been, the lawful sheriff of Palo Pinto County and entitled to receive and enjoy the fees and emoluments of said office. The mere fact that an official had failed and refused to perform the duties of his office would not in itself create a vacancy, but would simply be grounds upon which a forfeiture of the office and a vacancy therein might be judicially declared. Honey v. Graham, 39 Texas, 1; Page v. Hardin 8 B. Mon., 648; State v. Pritchard, 36 N. J. L., 117; Cronin v. Stoddard, 97 N. Y., 271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-5\">In support of our contention as set out in appellee\u2019s brief and the dissenting opinion of Judge Hunter that a sheriff\u2019s term of office under the Constitution and laws of this State is for two years and until the election and qualification of his successor, we beg to submit the following additional authorities: State v. Harrison, 113 Ind., 434; Scott v. State, 151 Ind., 556; Culbert v. Linkhauer, 142 Ind., 94; Drew v. Rodgers, 118 Cal., 393; Baker v. Murphy, 30 Ore., 405; People v. Edwards, 93 Cal., 153.; People v. Hamond, 66 Cal., 654.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b294-6\">WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"APj\">Appellee York instituted this action to recove! of appellant Maddox the title and possession oE the office of sheriff of Palo Pinto County. The rights of the parties depend upon the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Prior to the general election held in Fovember, 1898, York was the sheriff of that county and was a candidate for re-election, but was defeated bjr one Lasater. After the election and before the receipt of official notice of the result, Lasater died. The Commissioners Court declared the office vacant and proceeded to fill it by appointing appellant, who qualified and took and held possession until ousted by the judgment of the District Court in favor of appellee. Upon appeal from this judgment, the Court of Civil Appeals reversed it, two of the justices holding that the appointment made by the Commissioners Court was vklid, while the other justice dissented, holding that appellee was entitled to the office until a successor had been elected and qualified, and that, therefore, there was no vacancjq and hence no. power of appointment in the Commissioners Court. The question thus at issue has been certified to this court for determination, and the answer is tha', the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>decision of the majority is correct and properly construes the provisions of the Constitution controlling the subject, in accordance with previous opinions of this court. The fullness of the discussion in the majority and dissenting opinions, and in the case of State v. Cocke, 54 Texas, 482, renders it unnecessary for us to write further on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
