J.</author>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that County Court erred at sentencing by failing to ask defendant if he wished to make a statement prior to the pronouncement of sentence <em>(see, </em>CPL 380.50). We have held that where, as here, no objection was made to the sentencing court\u2019s oversight, the error has not been preserved for review <em>(see, People v Vega-Freire, </em>148 AD2d 851), and we find no basis for the exercise of our discretion to reverse in the interest of justice <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Casey, Weiss, Mikoll and Yesawich, Jr., JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
