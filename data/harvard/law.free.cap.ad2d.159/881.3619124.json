The report was based on a random frisk conducted at the yard gate by Correction Officer W. Young, who authored the report. The frisk of petitioner revealed \"what was believed to be (7) seven rolled marijuana cigarettes\u201d in petitioner\u2019s right sock. Correction Officer L. Distel performed two NIK<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> tests, both of which identified the substance in the cigarettes as marihuana. Based on the misbehavior report, the statement of Correction Sergeant B. Binkley corroborating that report and Distel\u2019s test report, petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 120 days in special housing unit with loss of privileges. On administrative appeal, the determination was modified to 90 days in special housing unit and loss of privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The sequential positive results of the two tests, when coupled with Young\u2019s personal observation and the reports of the officers also identifying the substance as marihuana, provided substantial evidence on which to base the determination <em>(see, Matter of Darnell v Kuhlmann, </em>145 AD2d 852). Accordingly, the determination appealed from should be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Determination confirmed, and petition dismissed, without costs. Mahoney, P. J., Casey, Weiss, Levine and Harvey, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-8\"> A color-reactive chemical test which employs the Duquenois-Levine Regeant System (7 NYCRR 1010.5 [d] [Test E]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
