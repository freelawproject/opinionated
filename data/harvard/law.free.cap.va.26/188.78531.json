McVeigh was a resident citizen of the city of Alexandria, a member of the mercantile firm of C. A. Baldwin &amp; Co., and president of the Bank of the Old Dominion located in that city. He was re-elected in January 1861, and again in his absence in January 1862. As president he from time to time collected the interest upon the bonds of the state held by the bank. In May 1861 he left the city of Alexandria, and took up his residence in the city of Richmond, where he remained until after the close of the war, and the firm of C. A. Baldwin &amp; Co. also removed to the same city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-9\">In July 1865 McVeigh addressed a written communication to the stockholders of the Bank of the Old Dominion, in which he says: We have been permitted again to meet together to transact business connected with this bank, and I beg here to submit a statement of my doings during the four years absent. Being separated from the board of directors by military armies, I had to act upon my best judgment and upon the judgment of others with whom I advised. ' As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>president of this bank, and as I considerered it my duty to do, I collected, &amp;c., mentioning two sums of money which he collected from the state for interest due on bonds of the state held by the .Bank of the Old Dominion, and deposited on the same day in the Bank of Virginia to the credit of the first named bank; and stating that he paid, by his checks upon the Bank of Virginia, such banks as he could learn had balances against the Bank of the Old Dominion. In relation to these sums there was no controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">He then proceeds to state that on the 18th of February 1868 he collected from the treasurer the interest due on the state bonds held by the bank, up to the 1st of January 1863, being $26,697, and that he invested, by the advice of W. GL Cazenove, one of the directors of the bank, $26,500 in a Confederate convertible or call certificate, bearing six <em>per cent, </em>interest; and the balance he deposited in the Bank of Virginia to the credit of the Bank of the Old Dominion. This loan to the Confederate government continued until that government advertised for the return of all call loan certificates bearing six <em>per cent, </em>interest, by a certain day for payment, or they would become permanent six <em>per cent, </em>stocks; and then the certificate was presented, and the amount with interest paid in Confederate money; at which time a law of the state imposing a tax of one <em>per cent, </em>was immediately to take effect, and a law passed by the Confederate government, soon to take effect, of thirty-three and one-third <em>per cent, </em>tax on all Confederate currency held by banks or individuals. In order to avoid this heavy tax he made various efforts to lend out the money, but without success. As a last resort he placed it in bank to the credit of C. A. Baldwin &amp; Co., of which he was a member, with the understanding that said firm was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>pay the bank the same kind of currency on call or demand with six <em>per cent., </em>so that the same should stand with C. A. Baldwin &amp; Co. on the same terms as. it did with the Confederate government. In his testi- ... &amp; mony given in this case he says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7o\">At that time Baldwin &amp; Co. and McVeigh had more of Confederate currency than they knew what to do with, and frequently lent out large sums to such persons as they could get to take it; and they would at any time have paid any call made upon them by the bank or for its use, for the said sum of $26,500 and interest: and that said sum, with its accumulated interest, was invested by said C. A. Baldwin &amp; Co., together with their own funds, in tobacco and other things which were destroyed by fire that occurred at Columbia, South Carolina, at Charlotte, Eorth Carolina, and in the city of Richmond on the Bd of April 1865, at all which places the said firm had stored the said tobacco and other goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-9\">This investment was not made for the bank, but at the individual risk of McVeigh, he determining to continue the amount as a six <em>per cent, </em>investment to the bank payable any day.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-10\"><em>John Howard, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-11\"><em>Claughton, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-12\">Staples, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AG_\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">This is an action of assumpsit'brought in the Circuit court of the city of Richmond by the \u201cBank of the Old Dominion\u201d against William 1ST. McVeigh, to recover certain money belonging to the plaintiff', which as is alleged,was collected by the defendant in the year 1863. During the trial instructions were asked for by plaintiff and defendant respectively, which were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>fused by the court; and in lieu thereof certain other instructions given; to which both parties excepted. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff; to which the defendant applied for and obtained a writ of error and <em>supersedeas. </em>It is not necessary to consider , . <em>L . </em>the various questions presented by these instructions. It will be sufficient to examine the two main grounds upon which defendant relies for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The first of these is, that the defendant in the year 1861 having left the city of Alexandria, where the bank was situated, having permanently located within the Confederate lines, his official connection with the bank as president was thereby dissolved, and his relations to that institution thereafter were those of a public enemy; and consequently no contract, express or implied, could arise between the parties during the existence of such hostile relations, and no action can be maintained against the defendant for any act done by him as president or agent of said bank during that period. In order fully to comprehend the doctrine here asserted, it is necessary to give some attention to the evidence. It appears from the defendant\u2019s own admissions, that although residing within the Confederate lines after the 11th of June 1861, he undertook to act as president of said bank; and in that character he collected from the state money belonging to the plaintiff. We must suppose that he honestly entertained the opinion that he had the right so to do. Any other supposition would be a direct imputation upon his good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">After the close of the war, in July 1865, the defendant addressed a communication to the stockholders of the bank, in which he gives a history of his official conduct during the period of his separation from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>institution, and his reasons for collecting the funds belonging to it. He states that being separated from the board of directors by military forces he had to act Up0n pis pest judgment, and upon the judgment of others with whom he advised. As president of the x bank he collected in November 1861 of the state treasurer fifteen hundred and seventy-five dollars, being balance of interest due the bank 1st July 1861. On the 4th January 1862 he collected eight thousand one hundred and ninety dollars, the interest to January 1862; which several sums, after the payment of certain claims against the bank, were deposited to its credit in the bank of Virginia. And on the 8th of February 1863 he collected twenty-six thousand six hundred and ninety-seven dollars, the interest due on the state bonds up to the 1st of January 1863, and invested the same, or nearly the same, amount in a Confederate convertible or call certificate, bearing six per <em>cent, </em>interest. The present controversy is in reference to this latter sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Now the position assumed in the instructions and in the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel is, that the-defendant\u2019s office or agency was abrogated by the war\u2014that the act of the defendant as president, in collecting plaintiff\u2019s money, was null and void\u2014that this act could not be ratified after the war by the plaintiff or defendant, so as'to create a cause of action <em>ex contractu </em>against the defendant. Conceding all this, how does it relieve the defendant of the obligation to account to the plaintiff for money collected without authority, and appropriated to the defendant\u2019s individual use and benefit. It is a matter of no sort of consequence that he was not authorized to act as president: having undertaken to do so, he cannot set up the illegality of his own conduct to avoid the just responsibility arising out of the agency he assumed. It has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>been held m several cases, where money is received by , \u201e \u201e ........ . . an agent by force of a contract which is illegal, he cannot protect himself from accounting for what was so received by relying upon the illegality of the transaetion in which it was paid to him. <em>Sharp </em>v. Taylor, 2 Phil. Ch. R. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In <em>Terrant </em>v. Elliott, 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 3, the defendant, an insurance broker, having effected an illegal insurance for the plaintiff, and received the amount of a loss, endeavored to defend himself against the claim of his principal by showing the illegality of the insurance; but it was held the plaintiff was entitled to recover. <em>McBlair </em>v. Gibbes, 17 How. U. S. R. 236; <em>Kinsman </em>v. Parkhurst, 18 How. U. S. R. 289; 7 Rob. Prac. 455-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\"><em>A fortiori </em>does this principle apply, where the plaintiff is entirely free from censure, and the illegality of the transaction, if it be such, is attributable to the defendant alo\u00f1e.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">The learned counsel argued this branch of the case upon the theory, that war <em>ipso facto </em>operates as a confiscation of the title to all property belonging to alien enemies, and that any person appropriating or holding such property cannot be required to account for the same to the former owner after peace is restored. But clearly war has no such effect. While it gives to the government authority to confiscate the property of an enemy, it does not itself confiscate, nor confer upon individuals such authority. If the government does not exercise the power, the title remains unchanged. During the existence of hostilities, the owners\u2019 remedies for its protection or recovery are suspended; but so soon as peace is restored, these remedies revive as fully and effectually as though they had never been disturbed. This is the doctrine everywhere sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the comity of states. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Hylton, </em>3 Dallas\u2019 R. 199, 226; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>8 Cranch\u2019s R. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"AfQ\">The learned counsel insists, however, that the defendant being a mere tort feasor, the action against him ought also to have been in tort. But it is well settled, that in cases of this sort the plaintiff has his election of remedies. He may, if he ple&amp;ses, waive the tort and sue in assumpsit. Indeed assumpsit is the appropriate remedy whenever the defendant has received plaintiff\u2019s money, which in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain. 1 Rob. Prac. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The defendant\u2019s second ground of defence is contained in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth instructions, offered by him, and rejected by the court. The main proposition asserted in these instructions is, that the defendant having acted in good faith in collecting the money from the state and investing it in Confederate call certificates, the said certificates became thereby the property of the bank, and the defendant is not responsible in this suit for any loss or damage which the bank may have sustained by reason of the action of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">It will be observed that the proposition here asserted leaves out of view the important fact established by the evidence, that after the defendant had converted the certificates into treasury notes, as required by the Confederate government, he deposited the money in bank to the credit of C. A. Baldwin &amp; Co., of which firm he was a member; and subsequently the entire amount, together with the other funds of the said firm, was invested in tobacco and other articles. This investment, as the defendant states, was made at his individual risk, he being confident it would pay him the interest, and save to the bank the heavy Confederate tax. He further states that the articles so pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>chased were destroyed by fires that occurred at Columbia, Charlotte and the city of Richmond, at which places the said firm had stored the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">It .thus appears that the fund did not perish upon the hands of the defendant, but was loaned by him to a firm of which he was a member, and was invested by that firm in private trade and speculation. It may be that the goods were destroyed, but we have no means of ascertaining the circumstances under which the destruction occurred. We do not know whether it might not have been prevented by the exercise of due care-and diligence: whether considerable profits may not have been realized from this fund by previous investments. Upon these points the record furnishes no information; no inquiry was asked upon the subject; no issue made up. The defendant nowhere as sers that the money was wholly lost by him. He does not say that no profits were realized from its use; nor does he rest his defence upon the destruction of the property. Ho such ground is taken in the instructions or in the argument. The learned counsel was too well satisfied it could not be maintained. The defendant having appropriated the plaintiff\u2019s money, having invested it in trade and speculation, must of course account for it, however unfortunate the speculation may have proved. The defendant is to be regarded simply as a borrower of the fund. His use of it, whether .judicious or otherwise, whether profitable or not, cannot affect the right of the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The case is wholly unlike that of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>20 Gratt. 197. There the fund was in the hands of a commissioner acting under the order of a court of chancery. He did not appropriate a dollar of it to his own use; but deposited it in bank, where it perished with the fall of the Confederate government.</p>\n<p id=\"A-h\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Nor does the case bear any resemblance to that of <em>Pidgeon </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>21 Gratt. 251. In that case the money was also deposited in bank; was so marked as to ke easily identified as the property of the plaintiff; and so remained in the bank until the termination of' . the war, and the consequent destruction of the currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The defendant is charged only with the value of the Confederate notes at the time they were appropriated by him; and with this we think he has no just cause of complaint. The verdict and judgment, however, bear interest from the 1st day of April 1864. The interest ought to be computed only from the close of the-war; for the plain reason, that plaintiff and defendant were, until that date, residents of hostile sections. To this extent the judgment must be amended and affirmed, with costs to the defendant in error. In thus affirming it, we see no reason to impute any blame to the defendant. He seems to have acted throughout with a conscientious regard for what he considered the best interests of the bank. But his motives, however conscientious, cannot exonerate him from liability for his collection and appropriation of money belonging to the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Judgment amended and appirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
