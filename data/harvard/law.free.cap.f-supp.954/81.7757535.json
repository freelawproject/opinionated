In 1991, IBM suffered the most negative results in its 80-year history, culminating in fourth quarter losses of $4.95 per share. <em>See </em>Def.Exh. 4, at Inside Cover &amp; 30 (1991 IBM Annual Report). The first three quarters of 1992 brought further bleak announcements of multi-billion-dollar \u201crestructuring charges,\u201d massive layoffs, downgrading of debt, and other bad news. <em>See e.g., </em>Def.Exh. 30 (IBM Press Release 9/29/92); Def.Exh. 13 (IBM Press Release 3/4/92). Nevertheless, IBM management repeatedly proclaimed that the company had no plans, nor foresaw any need, to reduce its customary quarterly dividend of $1.21 per share. <em>See, e.g., </em>Def.Exh. 4, at 6 (statement of IBM Chairman John F. Akers in 1991 IBM Annual Report); Def.Exh. 52, at 5-6 (statement of IBM Chief Financial Officer Frank Metz). Since IBM\u2019s strong dividend was a mainstay of its market position, such pronouncements presumably bolstered the price of IBM stock; but they appeared warranted, as the IBM Board of Directors continued to declare the $1.21 dividend for each quarter of 1992. <em>See </em>Def.Exhs. 10, 19, 26, 68 (IBM Board of Directors Meeting Minutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Following declaration of the fourth quarter dividend on October 27, 1992, IBM comment <em>on </em>the future of its dividend ceased. Growing market skepticism about IBM\u2019s continuing ability \u25a0 to maintain the $1.2 1 level of dividend \u2014 skepticism publicly voiced by prominent market analysts as early as February, 1992, <em>see, e.g., </em>Def.Exhs. 12, 15, 17, 40-41, 44 \u2014 now went unchallenged. Then, on December 15, 1992, IBM announced that it was \u201cunsure of its ability to maintain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dividend at current levels\u201d into 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Def.Exh. 130 (IBM Press Release 12/15/92). The same day, the price of IBM stock dropped substantially. <em>See </em>Steven E. Livingston, \u201cStocks Slip as Investors Bash IBM,\u201d <em>Wall St.J., </em>Dec. 16,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The next day, December 16, 1992, the first of the class actions consolidated into this litigation was filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As subsequently incorporated in the Consolidated And Amended Class Action Complaint filed February 26, 1993 (the \u201cComplaint\u201d), plaintiffs, consisting of all purchasers of IBM securities between September 30, 1992 and December 14, 1992 (the \u201cclass period\u201d), alleged that IBM\u2019s management knew by the former date what the company announced on December 15 and that, accordingly, public statements made by high-level IBM executives between September 30, 1996 and October 15, 1996 reconfirming the prior company announcements regarding the dividend level were false or materially misleading. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Now, however, after extensive discovery, it is clear beyond genuine dispute that these later management statements were neither false nor misleading, nor otherwise actionable,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To begin with, management statements about dividends come qualified with the inherent limitation that the declaration and determination of dividends are historically the prerogatives of the Board of Directors. <em>See, e.g., Burton v. Exxon Corp., </em>583 F.Supp. 405, 415 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (\u201cA decision to declare a dividend is a matter ordinarily addressed to the discretion of the board of directors.\u201d). In the case of a New York corporation such as IBM, these limitations have the force of law, for New York prohibits its corporations from guaranteeing dividends, <em>see Lindgrove v. Schluter &amp; Co., </em>256 N.Y. 439, 444, 176 N.E. 832 (1931), and instead directs each company\u2019s board of directors \u201cto exercise an impartial judgment in reference to the declaration of dividends, and to declare them only when, under the existing circumstances, a declaration will seem best to serve the corporate interests.\u201d <em>Id. See also Kennedy v. Kennedy, </em>22 Misc.2d 924, 91 N.Y.S.2d 294, 304 (Sup.Ct.1949) (\u201cThe declaration of dividends rests in the uneoerced discretion of the Board of Directors at the time of declaration or refusal to declare.\u201d).<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d ease such as this, reasonable investors must be deemed to have knowledge of such elementary legal principles. To suppose otherwise would be to suppose that the otherwise efficient marketplace posited by the fraud on the market theory takes no account of publicly available information . regarding acknowledged and binding legal principles \u2014 a suggestion wholly at odds with the assumptions on which the fraud on the market approach is premised. <em>See Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 245-47, 108 S.Ct. 978, 990-92, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). The market may not be Berle but it knows black-letter corporate law.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In this context, any statement of a company executive, or even a member of the Board, from which an investor might infer the likelihood of a particular level of dividend continuing in the future comes inherently qualified as to time and authority. No matter how couched, it is, at best, a short-term prediction by someone who lacks both actual and apparent authority to make the relevant decision. Even if wrong, such statements of opinion are not actionable. <em>Hershfang v. Citicorp, </em>767 F.Supp. 1251, 1256 (S.D.N.Y.1991) (\u201cStatements about future events that are plainly expressions of opinion and not guarantees are not actionable under the federal securities law\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., San Leandro Emergency Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Companies, </em>75 F.3d 801, 811 (2d Cir.1996); <em>Friedman v. Mohasco Corp., </em>929 F.2d 77, 79 (2d Cir.1991). Here, however, the statements made by IBM\u2019s management during the class period (as well as before) were right, as the Board, within weeks or even days of each such statement, approved continuation of the dividend at the customary level. <em>See </em>Def.Exh. 68 (dividend of $1.21 for fourth quarter of 1992 declared on October 27,1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Turning to specifics, there are just four public statements made during the class period on which plaintiffs purport to rely in their response to defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>See </em>PI.Mem., at 6, 8-9. <em>See generally, In re Seagate Technology II Sec. Litig., </em>1995 WL 66841, at *4 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 8, 1995) (\u201cIn a securities class action lawsuit, liability cannot attach- to statements made either before or after the class period.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first of these statements was made by Frank A. Metz, Jr., IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President for Corporate Finance and Planning, on September 30, 1996, <em>i.e., </em>a day after IBM announced large new restructuring changes and layoffs. Metz, in the statement relied on by plaintiffs, tells a group of market analysts: \u201cSo I will say again what I\u2019ve said before. I have no plan, no desire, and I see no need to cut the dividend.\u201d Pl.Exh. 12, at 20. Legal context quite aside, no reasonable investor could regard this statement as more than a short-term assurance, for it is immediately preceded by the statement that \u201cWhether or not we earn the dividend this year, we\u2019ll see,\u201d <em>id., </em>and followed by the statement that \u201cwe have to get back to an earnings level that does cover our dividend. But I see no short-term problem at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As Metz correctly predicted, the Board, despite poor third-quarter earnings, voted the full dividend for the fourth quarter of 1992, four weeks after this statement. <em>See </em>Def.Exh. 68 (IBM Board of Directors Minutes of Meeting 10/27/92).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The same is true of the second statement on which plaintiffs rely, in which Metz, on October 15,1992 (the same day that IBM announced the below-expectation earnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>for the third quarter), told market analysts on a conference telephone call that: \u201cI\u2019ll say again what I\u2019ve said time and time before. We have no plans nor need to do anything about the dividend.\u201d Pl.Exh. 17, Tapes 1 &amp; 2, at 5. As with similar previous statements, this statement, to the extent it can even be regarded as a statement of fact, was entirely true: there was no plan to reduce the dividend <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and no economic necessity to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Equally important, however, is the inherent short-term time frame of the statement, which Metz himself made evident by immediately adding to the above-quoted statement the words that despite \u201cthe third quarter earnings ... below our expectations in terms of cash flow____ we fully expect our cash flow ... [to be] sufficient to cover the dividends in 1992.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. In the event, the 1992 dividends were covered just as Mr. Metz had predicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The third statement, attributed to James H. Clippard, IBM Director of Investor Relations (who, unlike Metz, was not even a member of the Board), was made as part of the same conference call with analysts on October 15. Specifically, Clippard is quoted as telling the analysts at one point: \u201cSo, we\u2019re not \u2014 despite your anxiety \u2014 concerned about being able to cover the dividend for quite a foreseeable time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. But in literally the next breath, Clippard goes on to make clear that what he means by \u201cquite a foreseeable time\u201d is <em>\u201cthis </em>particular quarter and <em>maybe </em>the fourth quarter and <em>maybe </em>the first part of next year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the statement could hardly be viewed by any reasonable investor as anything more than a highly qualified, very short-term prediction, bespeaking caution about everything except the current quarter \u2014 in which, indeed, the Board declared the customary dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The final statement on which plaintiffs rely, also made by Clippard on the same analysts conference call, can best be understood by quoting the question to which it responds: \u201cJim, since as you point out you can\u2019t forecast sales and you can\u2019t forecast economic environment but you still believe that even if you don\u2019t have any major changes, the economy \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to cover the dividend next year?\u201d Pl.Exh. 17, Tapes 3 &amp; 4, at 8. To this, Clippard responded: \u201cMichael, I think from your planning point of view the answer to that is yes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. Given the numerous qualifications and cautionary statements in this exchange, no reasonable investor could possibly read Clippard\u2019s response as some kind of false statement of fact, as opposed to a much-qualified opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">What it comes down to is this: From January through October of 1992, the management of IBM, although beset by unprecedented economic problems of which the market was made fully aware, publicly manifested belief that the company\u2019s Board would continue to declare the company\u2019s customary dividend for the immediate future. The Board responded by doing precisely that. It even continued to fund the dividend for the fourth quarter of 1992 despite the company\u2019s anemic third quarter earnings, layoffs, and charges. In the face of the continuing decline, however, management prudently ceased making public statements about any aspect of the 1993 dividend until, on December 15, they appropriately informed the public of the fact that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>further decline had now placed in doubt continuation of the dividend at the previous level into the new year.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><em>None of </em>this remotely smacks of fraud. While IBM\u2019s conduct could not prevent the filing of the inevitable class actions as soon as the market reacted to its December 15, 1992 announcement, the undisputed proof of the company\u2019s conduct \u2014 now placed fully before the Court as a result of years of discovery \u2014 legally entitles the company to summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the Clerk is directed to enter judgment on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">. On January 26, 1993, IBM declared a dividend for the first quarter of 1993 of $.54 per share. Def.Exh. 132 (IBM Board of Directors Meeting Minutes 1/26/93).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. In this rush to the courthouse, one can only wonder at how fully the dictates of Rule 11, Fed.R.Civ.P., were complied with. Some four years later, at oral argument before this Court, lead counsel for the plaintiffs candidly volunteered that the lawsuits might well have been subject to dismissal at the outset. Tr. 12/5/96 at 106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">. It follows that the Complaint\u2019s fall-back theory \u2014 that, as a result of expectations created by earlier management statements, IBM had a duty to warn investors by September 30, 1996 of the growing threat to the dividend <em>(see </em>Complaint, at \u00b6 34) \u2014 must also fail. <em>See generally, In re Convergent Technologies Securities Litigation, </em>948 F.2d 507, 516 (9th Cir.1991). As for plaintiffs\u2019 strained attempt in their summary judgment response papers to craft still a third, and wholly independent, theory of liability premised on IBM\u2019s alleged overstatement of third-quarter earnings, this must fail as well. The new theory must be rejected on the merits, since IBM\u2019s stated third-quarter earnings \u2014 already well below market expectations \u2014 were not materially greater than those plaintiffs claim should have been announced. Independently, the new theory must be rejected because of its patent, and prejudicial, untimeliness. While this Court, in affirming Magistrate Judge Fox\u2019s discovery orders, gave leave to plaintiffs to pursue their contention, however implausible, that the alleged understatement of third-quarter earnings might itself provide a basis for plaintiffs\u2019 claim that IBM's management knew by the start of the class period that the level of the dividend was in jeopardy, the Court at no time understood plaintiffs to be claiming that their lawsuit could stand, independent of anything to do with the dividend, on a theory that a different class of plaintiffs was defrauded by the alleged understatement of third-quarter earnings. Indeed, when defendant moved before Magistrate Judge Fox to strike portions of plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s report relating to the third quarter earnings on the ground that they went well beyond the pleadings, plaintiffs represented that the alleged earnings deficiencies were offered, not as an independent basis for liability, but simply as further evidence of IBM\u2019s knowledge that it could not continue to support the dividend. <em>See </em>Tr. 3/1/96, at 7 (oral argument before Magistrate Judge Fox)., These representations were accepted as true arid binding, both by Magistrate Judge Fox and later by this Court, in denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike. <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>In re IBM Securities, </em>Master File No. 92 Civ. 9076, at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. To the same effect, see IBM\u2019s own Certificate of Incorporation. Def.Exh. 21, at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. It is unclear whether plaintiffs also seek to rely on a statement by IBM Director of Investor Relations James Clippard, in which, after announcing various new restructuring changes and other \"bad news,\u201d Clippard, in response to a request to \"address the dividend,\" stated that \"obviously the dividend is safe.\u201d Def.Exh. 31. While made on September 29, 1992, this statement was made after the close of the market and therefore arguably might be included in the class period; but in failing to so assert, plaintiffs appear to have waived this contention. In any event, the statement, when placed in its proper context as referred to above, can only be regarded as a short-term prediction and not as a perpetual guarantee. Moreover, plaintiffs have adduced no evidence to contradict defendant's showing that Clippard\u2019s statement was made in the even more limited factual context of responding, accurately, to a false market rumor that IBM was about to reduce the fourth quarter dividend. <em>See </em>Def. 3(g) Statement, at \u00b6 39; Tr. 12/5/95, at 36-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">. Despite years of discovery, plaintiffs have failed to unearth anything that could reasonably be called a \u201cplan\" by the IBM Board to cut dividends prior to December, 1992. The most they can point to is a nascent proposal (\"Project Pacers\u201d) formulated earlier in 1992 by Robert Ripp, IBM's Treasurer, to cut IBM\u2019s dividend commitment, but not the dividend itself, by dividing IBM common stock into a new common and preferred stock, each with a separate dividend. <em>See </em>Def. 3(g) Statement \u00b6\u00b6 13-16. Quite aside from the fact that this proposal would not have reduced the total level of dividend, Project Pacers was never adopted by management or even presented to the IBM Board, let alone put into effect. <em>See </em>Def.Exh. 139, at 83-84 (Ripp Dep.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b147-14\">. In 1992, IBM began the year with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, <em>see </em>Def.Exh. 4, at 31 (1991 IBM Statement of Cash Flows), and ended the year with even greater cash balances of $4.4 billion, <em>see </em>Def.Exh. 134, at 41 (1992 IBM Statement of Cash Flows). Such cash flows were more than sufficient to cover the 1992 dividend payments, which totaled $2.76 billion for the year, <em>id., </em>and to fund the dividend at the same level into 1993 if the Board had chosen to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b148-15\">. The judgment also includes those claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 and asserted by those class plaintiffs who participated in IBM\u2019s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the \"DRIP Plan\"), for the simple reasons that the DRIP Plan was not an initial public offering and the DRIP Plan Manual was not a prospectus \u2014 both of which are prerequisites for liability under that section. <em>See Glamorgan Coal Corp. v. Rainer\u2019s Group PLC, </em>1995 WL 406167, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. July 10, 1995). Additionally, counsel for the sub-class of plaintiffs in the consolidated action, <em>Teachers Retirement Sys. of La. v. IBM Corp., </em>No. 93 Civ. 6122, whose claims were brought pursuant to Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r) and Sections 517.241 and 517.301 of the Florida Securities Act, has previously consented to dismissal of those claims, both orally (telephone conference with the Court and counsel on December 9, 1996) and in writing (letter dated December 13, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
