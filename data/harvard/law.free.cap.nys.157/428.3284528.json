Cheever, deceased. The assets of the estate consist of personal property only. The questions presented arise out of the opposing contentions of the plaintiff, the widow of the testator, and the defendant Gertrude Cheever Porter, daughter and only child of the testator by Ms first wife, both beneficiaries under the trusts created by the will. It appears that on June 21, 1884, the testator\u2019s father executed a trust deed, under which the testator became the life beneficiary of the income of a certain block of corporate stock. The trust deed conferred a power of appointment upon the testator in the following terms: \u201cTo pay over and divide the said 250 shares of stock, or the proceeds thereof, to and among such person or persons as the said John D. Cheever may by his last will and testament, duly proved and admitted to probate, give and bequeath the same specifically, or, if the said John D. Cheever should not give and bequeath the same specifically, or should he die intestate, then to pay over and divide the said 250 shares of stock, or the proceeds thereof, to and among those persons who would then be entitled to take the personal estate of the said John 1).

Cheever may direct or appoint by a last will and testament, duly proved and admitted to probate, or in default of such specific directions or appointment, then to pay over or deliver the said shares of stock, or the proceeds thereof, to or among the person or persons who would be entitled to take the personal estate of the said John D.

Oheever, if living, otherwise to her heirs at law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">Plaintiff: contends that these provisions of the will are void, so far as it is sought thereby to exercise the powers of appointment under the trust deeds. It is claimed that the testator had no authority to exercise his powers of appointment by creating under his will a trust of the property conveyed under the trust deeds and that he had no authority to confer upon his daughter a power of appointment in respect of such property. It is further claimed that the attempted exercise of the powers operates to suspend the absolute ownership of this property for a longer period than during the continuance and until the termination of two lives in being at the time of the creation of the respective powers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The defendant Gertrude Oheever Porter was born after the execution of her grandfather\u2019s deed of trust and before that of her grandmother\u2019s trust deed. The property covered by the deed of trust of June, 1884, consists of 71 shares of the stock of the Okonite Company and that covered by the deed of trust of January, 1904, of 527 shares of the stock of the same company. The powers of appointment given in each deed of trust are substantially alike, and are general beneficial powers under which the grantee was authorized to dispose absolutely by will of the property embraced in the trust deeds to any person whomsoever. Cutting v. Cutting, 86 N. Y. 522.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-10\">In Sugden on Powers (3d Am. Ed.) c. 40, p. 535, it is said \u201cthat although the power must not be exceeded, nor its directions evaded, yet where there is no prohibition, everything which is legal and within the limits of the authority should be supported, and therefore that the power to appoint a fee, but with no prohibition against giving a less estate, ought to be held to authorize \u25a0any legal limitation within the scope of the power which may be served out. of the fee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-11\">In Butler v. Heustis, 68 Ill. 594, 18 Am. Rep. 589, it is said: \u201cThe law seems to be well settled by authority, where a party has the power to appoint a fee, if there are no words of positive restriction a less estate may be appointed.\u201d The same principle is laid down in Beardsley v. Hotchkiss, 96 N. Y. 201, 218, 219, and Lawrence\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 354, 20 Atl. 521, 11 L. R. A. 85, 20 Am. St. Rep. 925.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-12\">The arguments of the learned counsel for the plaintiff are applicable to limited or special powers. It follows that the powers of appointment were validly exercised by the creation of the trusts under the will of John D. Oheever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Coming now to the consideration of the trust provisions of the will, it is evident that they must be held valid if two distinct trusts were created thereunder, one during the life of the plaintiff and the other during the life of Mrs. Porter, and if no portion of the property appointed bj' the decedent\u2019s will under <em>the deed of </em>trust created <em>by </em>decedent\u2019s father is necessarily embraced within the trust measured by the life of Mrs. Porter. The will in effect provides that the trust property be kept in solido for convenience of investment, the income being given in two equal shares, one to plaintiff and the other to defendant Mrs. Porter, and each half of the principal being liberated upon the death of the life beneficiaries and disposed of in the manner provided in the paragraphs of the will above set forth. The conclusion is therefore irresistible that the intention of the testator was to create separate trusts. Moreover, this case cannot well be distinguished in principle from Leach v. Godwin, 198 N. Y. 35, 91 N. E. 288; Sehermerhom v. Getting, 131 N. Y. 48, 29 N. E. 980.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">1.4] Wo may now inquire whether these separate trusts violate section 11 of the Personal Property Law, in that they suspend the absolute ownership of personal property beyond two lives in being at the date when the power was created under the deed of trust of John D. Cheever in 1884. There can be no doubt that, if a portion of the fund to be held in trust for the life of Mrs. Porter under the will consists of property appointed from the trust created by the decedent\u2019s father in 1884, the trust must be declared void, since she was not in being at that date. Fargo v. Squiers, 354 N. Y. 250, 259, 48 N. E. 509. The will, however, does not specifically provide to which beneficiary the property appointed under each power shall go, nor does it apportion the property appointed under each power between the two beneficiaries. It provides that each beneficiary shall receive the income of one-half the entire fund, and that each half of the principal thereof shall be disposed of in the manner heretofore stated. It is not to be assumed that the testator intended to defeat his obvious purpose of establishing two separate trusts by a division which would invalidate them. The shares of stock held in trust under each trust deed can conveniently and readily be apportioned, so that the 71 shares of the John D. Cheever trust will be embraced in the trust created under the will for the benefit of the plaintiff, who was in esse in 1884. This would leave the trust fund for the benefit of Mrs. Porter wholly made up of the shares of stock derived from Anna D. Oheevcr\u2019s trust, which was created in 1004, when Mrs. Porter was in being. Such an apportionment would fall within the spirit of the rule adopted in Fargo v. Squiers, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> With respect to the contention that an unlawful suspension may result under the power to appoint to further uses, given under the will to Mrs. Porter, Hie testator\u2019s daughter, it is sufficient to refer to Hillen v. Isclin, 144 N. Y. 365, 39 N. E. 368, which is direct authority for the proposition that such a power does not offend the statute against perpetuities. The power conferred under the will upon Mirs. Porter to appoint to further uses was clearly valid. Frear v. Pugsley, 9 Misc. Rep. 316, 30 N. Y. Supp. 149; Thayer v. Rivers, 179 Mass. 280, 289, 60 N.
