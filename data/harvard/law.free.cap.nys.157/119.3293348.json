Laws of 1909, c. 13), did not apply, and the bulk of his estate could go to a religious corporation. Under the will made in New York August 1, 1904, the Rector, Churchwardens and Vestrymen of St. George\u2019s Church in the City of New York could validly receive the fund given them by the testator for the maintenance of the seaside work of St. George\u2019.s Church by the Sea at Rockaway Beach, Long Island. Appellant, however, relies on the effect of a later testament made in Copenhagen in May, 1907, followed by its formal revocation in 1908, both papers being in Danish, and executed before a notary according to Danish custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">By the 1907 testament, first paragraph, provision was made for testator\u2019s burial in Staten Island; the second paragraph bequeathed his furniture, plate, china, linens, clothing, and 200 kroner in money (about $54) to his housekeeper. The third paragraph, as .translated in the petition, ran:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">\u201cWith the alterations consequent in the stipulations in paragraph 1 and 2, I confirm otherwise in every respect the will erected by me in 1904 in New York in which I have decided that the Episcopal Church St. George, Stuyvesant Square, in the City of New York, shall inherit my belongings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">After naming an executor, he subscribed this testament before a notary and two witnesses, and, according to Continental usages, directed its entry in the notary register, so' that a notarial copy could have the effect of an original. In 1908 he revoked this will by an entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">\u201cThe foregoing testament is hereby recalled in all its words and points\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">\u2014which deceased signed in presence of two witnesses. This was accompanied by a notarial certificate attesting this annulment as having been signed in the notary\u2019s presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">\u201cThe contents of which he, who was in full possession of his mental faculties, confirmed, after having declared that he knew the same, and he further demanded that it be entered in the notary register with the legal effect that a copy thereof shall have the same validity as the original.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The will of 1904, having been expressly ratified and confirmed in all respects by the later will (except as to the small bequests), remained the testator\u2019s final disposition. Both wills could stand to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>gather; indeed, in legal effect the Danish will of 1907 was but a codicil to the will of 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Obviously he revoked only this codicil, and not the will of 1904. Its original probate in Richmond county remained valid, notwithstanding such revocation. The surrogate, therefore, rightly denied the application to revoke the probate of the New York will and testament of August 1, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> A point, thought perhaps too insignificant in amount, was not raised before the surrogate. This is the continuing effect of the legacy in the will of 1907. To that extent, namely, the 200 kroner, and the furniture and clothing bequeathed, the residuary estate was reduced, which reduction was consummated at the moment of executing tills second testament. Although this disposition was revoked in the following year, this reduction continued, and to that extent the original will was annulled, and deceased died intestate as to this legacy, unless the New York will was thereafter republished. Osburn v. Rochester Trust &amp; S. D. Co., 209 N. Y. 54, 56, 102 N. E. 571, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 983, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 101, following Robson, J., in 152 App. Div. 235, 242, 136 N. Y. Supp. 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The surrogate\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s petition is therefore modified, so as to be without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to offer proof of the notarial record of such foreign will and revocation under Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 956, or otherwise to establish the existence of such later testamentary documents; and, as so modified, the order of the Surrogate's Court of Richmond County is affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
