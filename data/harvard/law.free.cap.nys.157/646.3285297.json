The contestant laid a foundation for impeachment by asking him if at a given time and place, and in the presence of a specified person, he did not express a contrary opinion, to which inquiry he replied in the negative. The contestant then called the specified person to prove that at the time and place named, and in his presence, the subscribing witness said that the testatrix was of unsound mind. The learned trial court excluded this evidence. In doing so', it committed reversible error. Patchin v. Astor Mutual Insurance Co., 13 N. Y. 268; Larkin v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., 205 N.
