The lease is not before us, but it is conceded by both parties that the only provision or covenant in the lease pertaining to the repair of the demised building by the tenant is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-22\">\u201cSecond. That the tenants shall take good care of the premises and do all of the inside repairs at their own cost and expense, and at the end or other expiration of the term shall deliver up the demised premises in good order or condition, damages by the elements excepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-23\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In the absence of an express covenant to that effect, the landlord is under no obligation to repair the demised premises. Witty v. Matthews, 52 N. Y. 512; Suydam v. Jackson, 54 N. Y. 450; Franklin v. Brown, 118 N. Y. 110, 23 <em>N. </em>E. 126, 6 L. R. A. 770, 16 Am. St. Rep. 744. In Castagnette v. Nicchia, 76 App. Div. 371, 78 N. Y. Supp. 498, the lease was drawn so as to provide that the tenant should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>make any and all repairs, internal and external, to the demised premises; but before execution \u201cand external\u201d was stricken out, and the court held that this did not create an implied covenant on the landlord\u2019s part to make all external repairs, where no claim was made that there was any express understanding or covenant between the parties on that subject. And in Schiavone v. Callahan, 52 Misc. Rep. 654, 102 N. Y. Supp. 538, this court held that an express covenant for the making of inside repairs by the tenant does not bind the landlord to make outside repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respondent does not claim that any express agreement was ever made to charge the landlords with the obligation of making outside repairs, but contends that because they had made repairs to the roof, and were apparently willing to make them, when the tenant himself had them done at the landlord\u2019s expense, they thus recognized their duty under the lease to malee outside repairs. Where there is an uncertainty as to the meaning of an instrument when applied to the situation and circumstances of the parties, the construction put upon the contract by the parties themselves, as shown by their conduct, may be considered as evidence (1 McAdam, Landlord &amp; Tenant [4th Ed.] p. 392); but here there is no uncertainty in the covenant requiring the tenant to \u201ctake good care of the premises,\u201d which include the roof, and do all the inside repairs, and deliver up the demised premises in good order at the end of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It follows that the apparent recognition by the landlords of an obligation to do outside repairs, in the absence of an agreement under the lease or otherwise imposing that obligation upon them, was not sufficient to charge them with the legal duty of making the repairs in question, and the judgment must be reversed, with $30 costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
