Y. Supp. 936. The case was then placed upon the trial calendar for February 27, 1914, at which time plaintiff demanded a jury trial. Numerous adjournments were taken, and the trial was finally set down for April 7, 1915. On that day, on the call of the calendar, a clerk of associate counsel for plaintiff respondent, stating that he had been informed by the clerk of plaintiff\u2019s attorney that plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Mr. Nicchia, <em>would be </em>engaged in the Supreme Court on that day and could not he present to assist in the trial of the action. The court then asked for the production of an affidavit setting forth the facts stated, but the affidavit was not produced; and on the second call of the calendar, no one answered for the plaintiff, whereupon J usticc Spiegelberg directed the complaint to be dismissed, and judgment was entered accordingly in favor of the defendant for $104.76 accrued costs and disbursements. Ten weeks later plaintiff moved to open the default, which motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The first point to be considered on this appeal is whether sufficient facts were presented by plaintiff in the moving papers to warrant the granting of said motion. The affidavit of'Mr. Nicchia, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, made in support of the motion, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">That after long delay and being twice marked \u201cReserved generally\u201d the case was, by stipulation, set for trial February 17, 1915, and on that day was, by further stipulation, adjourned to April 7, 1915, on which day \u201cdeponent was not able to be present at the trial of this action, as lie was engaged in the Supreme Oourt, New York County, Trial Term, Part XVII, in the action of Munroe v. Sacca et al., as well as in Part II for trial in the action of D\u2019Anei v. Saitta\u201d; that on the day previous he endeavored to connect with defendant\u2019s attorneys by telephone, but failed to do so, and requested his clerk to notify \u201cMr. Aaron Morris, deponent\u2019s associate, who is the counsel in the case herein, to get an adjournment\u201d; also \u201cthat on the 7th day of April, 1915, deponent was actually engaged in the cases aforesaid, and also in the bankruptcy court in the Matter of Caleca, which hearing was set for 11 o\u2019clock\u201d; and further \u201cthat deponent has had interviews with the plaintiff herein, and from the facts stated to him the plaintiff has a good cause of action against the defendant herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The affidavit does not state that plaintiff has fully and fairly stated the facts in the case to the deponent. Defendant presented affidavits, in one of which extracts were set forth from the Taw Journal of April 8th whereby it conclusively appeared that plaintiff\u2019s attorney was not and could not have been actually engaged in either Part 17 or Part 2 of the Supreme Court, as averred, for the reason that neither of said cases was tried on April 7, 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In the absence of an affidavit setting forth actual engagement of counsel, and in the absence of any other valid ground for an adjournment, the cas.e having been set down for trial by stipulation, the trial justice properly granted the default and directed judgment for costs in favor of the defendant; and unless we are to adopt the rule that any litigant may submit to a default, and, without' presenting any ground whatever, except a belief of counsel, on such facts as his client may see fit to acquaint him with, that there is a good cause of action, tire litigant shall be entitled to open the default, the motion should have been denied. To adopt such a rule would be, in effect, to nullify the effect of the provisions of the Code providing for the taking of judgment by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Judgment in favor of plaintiff reversed, with $30 costs to the defendant appellant; order opening plaintiff\u2019s default reversed, and judgment of April 7, 1915, in favor of defendant reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
