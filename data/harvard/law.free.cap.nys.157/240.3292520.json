The record discloses that, while the plaintiff was being cross-examined upon his rebuttal testimony, the court said, \u201cThat is all.\u201d The witness left the stand, and a colloquy ensued, during which the stenographer noted, \u201cBoth sides rest.\u201d Subsequently, and during a further conversation between the court and the respective attorneys, the plaintiff asked leave to discontinue, which was refused, and judgment rendered for him for less than half of his claim. Erom this record it is evident that the case had not been submitted by the parties to the trial court for decision so completely as to preclude the plaintiff\u2019s right to discontinue. The action was brought after the Municipal Court Code went into effect, and the rules governing the rights of plaintiff to discontinue are therefore those in force in the Supreme Court. In the Matter of Butler, 101 N. Y. 307, 4 N. E. 518, it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">Except where substantial rights o\u00ed other parties have accrued, and injustice will be done by permitting it, a party has a right to discontinue an action or proceeding, and his reasons for so doing are no concern to the court. A refusal o\u00ed leave to discontinue, therefore, when nothing appears to show that it will injuriously affect the rights or interests of the adverse party is not within the discretion of the court and is error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">In Winans v. Winans, 124 N. Y. 140, 26 N. E. 293, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">\u201cAn application for leave to discontinue an action is addressed to the legal, not the arbitrary, discretion of the court, and it may not be denied capriciously, but may be refused whenever circumstances exist which afford a basis for the exercise of legal discretion; in such a case the court has but to consider whether anything has occurred since the commencement of the action which would so far prejudice defendant\u2019s interest, in the event of a discontinuance,, as to require a denial of the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Nothing was shown in this case calling for a denial of plaintiff\u2019s request, and he should have been allowed to discontinue. Judgment for costs would, of course, go against him in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Judgment reversed, with $30 costs to appellant, and complaint dismissed without prejudice to a new action, with costs in the lower court; costs of one party to be set off against those of the other. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
