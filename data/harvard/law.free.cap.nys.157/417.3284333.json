Bowne from so much of a judgment of partition and sale as excludes her from any interest in the real property, the subject of the action. The issue determined by that portion of the judgment from which this appeal was taken is the allegation of the complaint that \u201cthe defendant Jessie D. Bowne is seised of an estate for life in an equal undivided third part of said premises,\u201d which is denied in the answers of the respondents Colt and Jacobson. The facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Walter Bowne died on October 13, 1877, leaving an estate consisting of personalty and several parcels of real estate. He was survived by several children (among them Robert S. Bowne, the appellant\u2019s husband), and left a last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate, and by which he provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201cFourth. All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, I direct my said executors and trustees, and the survivors and survivor of them and his successors to divide into as many parts as shall be the number of my children, who shall survive me, and who shall die before my death, leaving issue me surviving, adding as one my said wife if she shall survive me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">After providing as to the share of tire wife and of the issue of each child who shall die before his death, the will continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">\u201cThird. Each of such remaining equal parts I give, devise and bequeath to my said executors and trustees, the survivors, and survivor of them, and his successors in trust as to each one of such equal parts for one of my surviving children, to enter into and upon the same and take possession thereof, and collect and receive the income, issues and profits thereof, and to pay over the same to my child, in trust for whom such equal part shall be so held, during the period of the natural life of such child, and, upon the death of such child, to divide the same to and among the persons who would be entitled to the same, and in the shares in which they would be so entitled had such child died possessed thereof after my death, intestate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">Some time after the death of Walter Bowne, the trustees under his will brought an action for the partition of his real property, and the allotment of the real and personal property to the several trusts created under the foregoing provisions. The premises which are the subject of this- action, were set off and vested in trustees\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-15\">\u201cin trust to collect and receive the income, issues and profits thereof and to pay over the same to the said Robert S. Bowne during the period of his natural life, and upon his death to divide the same to and among the persons who would be entitled to the same and in the shares in which they would be entitled had said Robert S. Bowne died possessed thereof after the death of said Walter Bowne, intestate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Robert S. Bowne died September 20, 1896, and was survived by the appellant and four children, the plaintiff, the respondent Elizabeth B. Colt, Marion S. B. Crosby, and Walter. Bowne, 2d. The latter two \u2022conveyed their interest in the premises to the plaintiff and the respondent Elizabeth B. Colt. The conveyance made by Walter Bowne, 2d, was expressly \u201csubject to the estate therein of Jessie D. Bowne,\u201d and that made by Marion S. B. Crosby, after the covenant against incumbrances, contained the words: \u201cExcept the dower right of Jessie D. Bowne.\u201d Erom the death of Robert S. Bowne until the commencement of this action, one-third of the rent of the premises was paid to Jessie D. Bowne. The learned justice at Special Term has construed the word \u201cintestate,\u201d at the end of the third subdivision of the residuary clause of the will, as meaning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cTBe guide or test for determining those among whom the shares to be divided is the law of intestacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">As the widow takes no interest in the real estate under the statute of descent, but by virtue of the law relating to dower, he drew the conclusion that Jessie D. Bowne had no interest in the real property of her husband, Robert S. Bowne. We do not think that the language used by tire testator will bear this construction. \u201cThe word \u2018intestate\u2019 signifies a person who died without leaving a valid will.\u201d Matter of Cameron, 47 App.. Div. 120, 123, 62 N. Y. Supp. 187; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2768, subd. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In sustaining a will, effect must be given to' each word used, if possible. The learned justice at Special Term and the counsel in the case have ignored the word \u201cpossessed\u201d in their consideration of the case. In the connection in which the word is here used it is equivalent to seised. While it may not be strictly accurate to- say \u201caccording to the modern authorities, there seems to be no legal difference between the word seisin and possession\u201d (Slater v. Rawson, 47 Mass. [6 Mete.] 437, 444), yet, when the estate possessed is inheritable, then \u201cpossessed\u201d is equivalent to \u201cseised.\u201d In the present case the testator in providing for the disposition of the property at the expiration of the life estate instructed his trustees to apply the provisions of law that would have obtained if such child (Robert S. Bowne), instead of having a mere life estate, had \u201cdied possessed thereof after my death\u201d\u2014in other words, had an estate of inheritance, which is equivalent to saying \u201cwas seised in fee.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that the testator\u2019s intention was that the property should be divided into such shares and transferred to the same persons as it would have vested by operation of law, had Robert S. Bowne died seised in fee of the premises without having-made a will. Piad he so died, Jessie D. Bowne would have been entitled to her right of dower in the property. Real Property Law (Consol. Laws, c. 50) \u00a7 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The respondent contends that the widow could not have any right of dower, because Robert S. Bowne was never seised of the property during coverture. Of course she could not. Durando v. Durando, 23 N. Y. 331, 332. It is entirely competent, however, for the testator to provide that she shall receive an interest in the property equivalent to that which she would have received by law had her husband been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>so seised, and that is what he clearly did. Had it been the testator\u2019s intention that the property should only\" have been divided among the issue of the child on the termination of the life estate, he would undoubtedly have used the words he did in the second subdivision of the residuary clause, \u201cto the issue of each such child.\u201d In view of the language of the second subdivision, the use of the word \u201cpersons\u201d in the provision under consideration is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">It is suggested by the respondent\u2019s counsel that the use of the word \u201cdivide\u201d shows that Walter Bowne could not have contemplated a further life interest in the real estate. In my opinion this conclusion does not follow. In so far as the trust estate consisted of various parcels of real estate, actual division by the trustees could not be made, even among the children. Had it been the testator\u2019s intention that a physical division of the property should have been made, in my opinion, he would have given the instructions necessary to effectuate that design, by designating some particular mode of dividing the property. As this real estate was incapable of actual division, even as between the children, power to divide could only be exercised by additional power of sale. In my opinion the entire clause shows that the division related to the estate that is to be taken, and not to tire mode of division. See Miller v. Miller, 62 Ky. (1 Dur.) 8. It has been necessary to bring this action to make the division. Actual partition cannot be made; hence the property must be sold and the proceeds divided. It is perfectly competent to admeasure the appellant\u2019s interest and pay it out of the fund, in the same manner as would have been done, had Robert S. Bowne died intestate, seised of the property, leaving a widow and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The first, second, third, and fourth conclusions of law are reversed. The judgment will be modified, by striking therefrom the findings of fact improperly included therein and making the same to conform to this opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to the appellant. Findings and decree to be settled upon notice. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
