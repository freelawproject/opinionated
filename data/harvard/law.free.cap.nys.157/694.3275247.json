The learned trial court in its charge first instructed the jury as to the several allegations of negligence contained in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and then charged the jury, generally, if they should find that the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate was due to- negligence on the part of the defendants in any of the respects claimed by plaintiff, that then plaintiff was entitled to recover. Among other things, the court specifically charged the jury that it was for them to determine whether defendants furnished plaintiff\u2019s intestate with a reasonably safe place to work, and also that it was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether or not the accident was due to the acts of a person intrusted with authority to direct, control, or command plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We are able to find no evidence justifying the submission of the case to the jury, either upon the allegation of a safe place or upon the claim that the accident was caused by the carelessness of a superintendent. Indeed, as to the latter counsel during the progress of the trial expressly disclaimed that plaintiff charged that the accident was due to an act of superintendence. The law is well settled that, where one of several charges of negligence is improperly submitted to the jury, there being no sufficient evidence to justify a verdict that a defendant was negligent in that respect, the judgment should be reversed, as it cannot be determined that the verdict was not based upon such erroneous theory of negligence alone. Jennings v. Degnon Contracting Co., 165 App. Div. 248, 251, 150 N. Y. Supp. 820, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We think the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b725-7\">KRUSE, P. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Amty\">1. I think the evidence supports a finding that the working place of plaintiff\u2019s intestate was unsafe. He was required to work under a swinging boom, which fell upon and killed him because the crane to which it was attached and of which it was a part was defective. This defective condition had existed so long that the defendants knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that it would endanger and make unsafe his working place. It is said that the defect was in the derrick and not in the working place; but it was this defect which made the working place unsafe. It is clear that is what the learned trial judge had in mind in his charge and that the jury so understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">2. As to negligent superintendence, I am of the opinion that if the deceased was put at work in this dangerous place without warning him of the danger by any one in defendants\u2019 employ haying authority from the defendants to direct and control him in his work, as the evidence tends to show, the defendants are liable for such negligence; and this is so, I think, whether the negligence was an affirmative act, or a mere omission to properly safeguard the workman against harm. I do not understand that plaintiff\u2019s counsel disclaimed any liability upon that ground. He specifically stated that there was a lack of proper superintendence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">I think the case was properly submitted to the jury, and that there are no errors to warrant a reversal. I therefore vote for affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
