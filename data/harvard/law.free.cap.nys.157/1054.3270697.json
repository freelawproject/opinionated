Having paid in the sums bid, relator received five tax deeds, dated January 31, 1911, which were recorded October 18, 1911. It does not appear that relator paid any further taxes on such lands. On a petition by the owner of the lands, and on an agreed statement of facts, the county treasurer, on January 13, 1915, ordered relator\u2019s tax deeds canceled because the warrant issued to the receiver of taxes for said town was not under the seal of the county as required by law. This proceeding was taken to review such order.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1085-10\">Argued before JENKS, P.

While certain irregularities may be thereby cured, the Legislature has extended to five years the period within which tax deeds may be canceled for jurisdictional defects. Adirondack League Club v.

The absence of the seal of the county from the warrant created a fatal defect. Erase v. Miller, 195 N. Y. 204, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>88 N. E. 369. But this defect did not enter into the assessment itself, and I think it was not \u201cjurisdictional\u201d on constitutional grounds. See Hagner v. Hall, 10 App. Div. 581, 42 N. Y. Supp. 63; Ensign v. Barse, 107 N. Y. 329, 14 N. E. 400, 15 N. E. 401. That part of section 132 of the Tax Law which provides a five-year limitation applies to cases where the defects arise from constitutional grounds; that is, where they permeate the assessment itself and do not arise from mere irregularities as to details which the Legislature might have dispensed with in the beginning, as might have been done in this case without infringing any constitutional right of the landowner. I think the limitation of two years, provided by section 132 of the Tax Law, applies here. As the curative act of 1911 (chapter 470) was enacted <em>after </em>the sale, I do not consider it.
