Gracy, wile of a wealthy Manhattan business man who has a beautiful home at 53 Brookfield road, Montclair. Last Friday Mrs. Gracy missed a diamond ring valued at $1,000. On Tuesday, following her confession that she had stolen the ring, the girl was arrested and brought before Becorder Yost, who sent her to the Newark jail. The next day Mrs. Gracy found the ring in a place where she had put it and had forgotten about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">\u201cWhen first accused of the theft the young girl denied any knowledge of it. Later she said she had taken it and given it ta a little Italian girl. She changed this story afterward, saying that she had given it to her mother, and when this was disproved said that she had lost it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">\u201cSeveral of the most prominent society women of Montclair were wrought up by stories of the manner in which the girl is alleged to have been intimidated into the confession that brought about her arrest. A delegation headed by Mrs. Hettie H. Patterson, president of the Altruist Society, went to Newark to engage the services of Attorney Frank M. McDermott, who was instructed to bring about the nurse girl\u2019s release and to institute such other proceedings as might seem advisable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">\u201cThe police say they have not received official notification that the property has been recovered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">The complaint then alleges that the statements in the article that \u201cthe next day Mrs. Gracy (meaning plaintiff) found the ring in a place where she had put it and had forgotten about it,\u201d and \u201cthe charge on which she (meaning Rachel Anderson) was arrested had been disproved,\u201d are wholly false, and plaintiff has been thereby injured in her reputation, and persons have declined to associate or deal with her, and have sent her scurrilous communications, all to her damage in $10,000. The defendant has demurred to the complaint, on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, which demurrer was overruled at Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> It is well settled that any matter published concerning a person, which holds him up to reproach, scorn, or ridicule, or imputes to him bad actions or viciou-s principles, diminishes his respectability, and hence his comfort and enjoyment in the community, and is actionable per se. Morrison v. Smith, 177 N. Y. 366, 69 N. E. 725; Snyder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>v. N. Y. Press Co., 137 App. Div. 291, 121 N. Y. Supp. 944; Triggs v. Sun, 179 N. Y. 144, 71 N. E. 739, 66 L. R. A. 612, 103 Am. St. Rep. 841, 1 Ann. Cas. 326. Had this \u00e1rticle stated that the plaintiff forced a confession from the nurse girl and made the charge on which she was arrested and confined, then the false statement would be libelous per se that the plaintiff had the next day found the ring where she had put it and forgotten about it, and that the charge had been disproved, but nevertheless the girl was still held in jail. The article does not state who made the charge, nor who obtained the confession; unless this is shown by innuendo to have been written of tire plaintiff, she has no right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The interlocutory judgment is reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave, however, to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 10 days from service of a copy of the order to be entered hereon together with notice of entry. In default of the service of an amended complaint, defendant may enter final judgment dismissing the complaint, with costs. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
