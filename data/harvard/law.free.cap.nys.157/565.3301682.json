The elevator was put in on March 18, 1913. On June 5th following, the Monok Company sold the premises to defendant Anna C. Farrell, by conveyance duly executed and delivered, followed by the grantee\u2019s talcing possession, but without recording her deed. Meanwhile, on June 12, 1913, plaintiff filed its notice of lien in due form, in which it specified the Monok Company as owner, and as the one by whom plaintiff had been employed. Though defendant Farrell was a bona fide owner in possession, she failed to record her conveyance until July 16, 1913, over a month after plaintiff\u2019s notice of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> Although the remedy by early mechanics\u2019 lien acts was so defective that the lienor took the risk of being defeated by an unrecorded conveyance (Quimby v. Sloan, 2 Abb. Prac. 93 [1855]), bej cause the title reached was only the interest of the contracting owner as it existed when the notice of lien was filed (Cox v. Broderick, 4 E. D. Smith, 721), later statutes have enabled the lienor to rely on the title as it stands on record when the lienor files his notice (Laws 1863, c. 500, \u00a7 1; Laws 1875, c. 379, \u00a7 4; Laws 1885, c. 342, \u00a7 5; Laws 1897, c. 418, \u00a7 13 [now Laws of 1909, c. 38; Consol. Laws, c. 33]). Even the validity of a conveyance on record is conditioned upon a proper acknowledgment, so as to warrant recording the instrument. Lemmer v. Morison, 89 Hun, 277, 35 N. Y. Supp. 623. Such lien now has priority \u201cover a conveyance, judgment or other claim against such property not recorded, docketed or filed at the time of filing the notice of such lien.\u201d Laws 1909, c. 38, \u00a7 13. Hence, for the purpose of plaintiff\u2019s lien, the apparent ownership of the Monok Company continued, and was a valid subject of lien on June 12th, when its notice of lien was filed, notwithstanding the unrecorded conveyance to defendant Farrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The judgment of dismissal should therefore be reversed, with costs of this appeal. As other liens may be involved, the cause is remitted to the Special Term to adjust the equities under section 45 of the Lien Law, and to render judgment of foreclosure and sale. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
