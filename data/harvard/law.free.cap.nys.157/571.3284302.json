The facts show damage from the carrier\u2019s negligence, which it does not attempt to excuse. Whether the barrel contained flour, potatoes, or other usual barrel commodities, and whatever was its declared value, it was not to be left out unpro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tected. The contents were soaked and discolored. A common carrier in this state by general exception may relieve itself even from its own negligence. Boyle v. Bush Terminal R. R. Co., 210 N. Y. 389, 104 N. E. 933. Where, however, the carrier\u2019s receipt in the course of its excepting clauses reserved therefrom instances of its negligence, it cannot say that the $50 limitation measures its liability, whether from negligence or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In this receipt the carrier is not to be\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cliable in any event for more than fifty dollars ($50) on any shipment of 100 pounds or less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">But it does not stop there. It goes on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">(4) <em>\u201cUnless caused) by its own negligence,\" </em>it is not to be liable for difference in weight, or for death, injury, or escape of live freight. (6) \u201cPackages containing fragile articles, or articles consisting wholly or in part of glass, must be packed so as to insure safe transportation by express <em>with, ordinary </em>care. If not so packed, and plainly marked so as to indicate the nature of the contents, the company shall not be liable for damage to such shipment' <em>unless proved to be negligent.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The carrier\u2019s duty to take ordinary care is so fundamental that defendant would not venture to leave it wholly out in drawing up these protective exemptions. The clauses would naturally lead a shipper to think, and, in my 'view, a court to hold, that the qualifications \u201cunless proved to be negligent,\u201d \u201cunless caused by its own negligence,\u201d apply elsewhere in the contract. Can the express company say: I am <em>in no event </em>to pay more than $50, but in case of certain articles, or liabilities, I shall not be liable at all, unless I am shown to be negligent ? Perhaps that might be contended before Public Service Commissions Law (Laws of 1907, chapter 429) \u00a7 38. But if these clauses as to certain kinds of merchandise purport to exempt from all liability, then in this state they are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">I think, therefore, the exemption to $50 in this receipt did not cover damage caused by defendant\u2019s proven negligence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
