In order, therefore, to set up a defense, the answer should have alleged that the goods were sold in this state, as well as a want of license. A denial that the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>were sold in Ohio is not equivalent to an allegation that they were sold in the state of New York, and consequently there was no sufficient defense pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Judgment affirmed, with $25 costs, with leave to defendant to amend the answer, upon payment of the costs in this court and in the court below.
