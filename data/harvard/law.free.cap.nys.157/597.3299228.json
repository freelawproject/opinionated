Notwithstanding the pending appeal to the Court of Appeals, we have this power. Birnbaum v. May, 170 N. Y. 314, 63 N. E. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">After the original issues had been refereed, and an appeal taken from the order of reference, it was mutually stipulated that our decision should be final, if the appeal should be dismissed or the order should be affirmed. Upon argument of defendant\u2019s appeal from the order of reference, the learned counsel for the plaintiff took the position that his action was to recover compensation upon the contract only, and thereby influenced the court to decide that the issues were referable. Having on that ground affirmed the order (153 App. Div. 906, 137 N. Y. Supp. 1116), this court thereafter regarded that as the law of the case, both for the purposes of the reference and the trial. In the course of the proceedings before the referee, he subsequently allowed an amendment, so that the complaint was no longer for a year\u2019s net profits of the business, but for damages for a breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the order of reference having been denied, and then appealed here, this court, having been committed to the initial decision by the plaintiff\u2019s primary insistence that the complaint was for compensation, and not for breach of contract, abided by it, and considered that the referee could not eliminate that refera-, ble cause of action and substitute another. Accordingly we affirmed the order, which refused to vacate the reference, stating that the complaint had not been changed, as such attempted amendment was not within the referee\u2019s powers. 157 App. Div. 481, 142 N. Y. Supp. 572. Nevertheless, the learned referee thought fit to ignore this opinion, and, in disregard thereof, proceeded to report upon the issues introduced by such amendment. Naturally the defendant excepted thereto, on the ground that the referee was without power or jurisdiction to make such findings, as not within the scope of said order of reference, and not within the pleadings, and not provable under the cause of action alleged or referred. This court reversed the judgment on such report (154 N. Y. Supp. 875), without passing on any of the matters of fact in findings made in opposition to our determination, which determination, until reversed, was binding upon the parties and upon the learned referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The order of reversal, dated July 30, 1915, is therefore resettled, so as to show why the findings of fact were not passed upon.or reviewed on the appeal, which resettled order is now signed and entered; otherwise, the defendant\u2019s motion is denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
