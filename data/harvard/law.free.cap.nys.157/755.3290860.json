The defendant is not a resident of the state. He appeared specially for the sole purpose of making the motion. No attachment has been issued against the property of the defendant. The demand for judgment is reproduced from the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-15\">\u201cWherefore plaintiffs demand judgment as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-16\">\u201cFirst. That an accounting bo had between the parties hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-17\">\u201cSecond. That the defendant be compelled to discover and disclose to plaintiffs any and all facts in any way relating to or affecting the manufacture and sale of said Blexican Mustang liniment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-18\">\u201cThird. That the said clause of said contract, Schedule A, mentioned and set forth in paragraph fifteenth of this complaint, be judicially interpreted and construed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-19\">\u201cFourth. That the interest of the plaintiffs under the terms of the contracts set forth herein be defined and enforced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-20\">\u201cFifth. That it be adjudged that defendant shall specifically perform said contracts, Schedules A and B, and in default thereof that damages for said default be awarded to plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-21\">\u201cSixth. That plaintiffs have judgment for any sum or sums of money which <em>may be </em>found <em>due them </em>on an accounting between the parties, or which may be found due them by reason of any neglect or omission on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>part of the defendant in the management of the manufacture and sale of said Mexican Mustang liniment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u201cSeventh. That plaintiffs have such other and further and general relief in the premises as to the court may seem just.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The subject-matter is a claim for royalty upon the sales of a proprietary medicine, payments to be made annually. The plaintiffs claim they should have had more money than was remitted to them for the fiscal year ending July, 1914, although they allege in their complaint no tortious wrong or breach of contract. The complaint does not state facts upon which the court could render judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cThat the defendant be excluded from a vested or contingent interest in or lien upon specific real or personal property within the state, or that such an interest or lien in favor of either party be enforced, regulated, defined, or limited, or otherwise affecting the title to such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The complaint states no cause of action against a nonresident of which the courts of this state could take cognizance without acquiring jurisdiction of his person by his voluntary appearance or by personal service of the summons upon him within the state.

Boyce, 152 N. Y. 191, 196, 46 N. E. 180, 36 L. R. A. 549; Von Hesse v. Mackaye, 55 Hun, 365, 8 N. Y. Supp. 894, affirmed 121 N. Y. 694, 24 N. E. 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">The part of the order denying defendant\u2019s motion should be reversed, with $10 <em>costs </em>and disbursements, and the defendant\u2019s motion granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
