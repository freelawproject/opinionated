Defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s moving affidavit, made after the service of the summons, alleges that this action is for the same cause, viz., to recover for -the identical broker\u2019s commissions. Plaintiff\u2019s answering affidavit does not deny this. A summons without a complaint is required to be indorsed with \u201ca statement of the nature and substance of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d Municipal Court Code, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and <em>78. </em>We must assume that the moving affidavit is based upon the required indorsement upon the summons. Plaintiff has neglected to include the summons in the return. He who asserts that his own pleading is defective must prove it, as error is no longer presumed, but must be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In the former District Courts trials were stayed for the nonpayment of costs of prior actions, just as they would have been in the Supreme, Court. Flewelling v. Brandon, 4 Daly, 333, 334; Lewis v. Davis, 8 Daly, 185, 187, 188. The right and duty to stay a trial until the costs of a prior action for the same cause are paid does not depend upon those costs being awarded by the same court in which the later action is brought. Singer v. Garlick, 123 App. Div. 282, 283, 107 N. Y. Supp. 972; Weil v. Manheim, 66 Misc. Rep. 566, 568, 121 N. Y. Supp. 1114. Stays for nonpayment of costs of prior actions are salutary, because it is for the public interest to diminish interminable, groundless litigation. Conlon v. Nat. Fireproofing Co., 128 App.. Div. 271, 112 N. Y. Supp. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There is nothing in the present Municipal Court Code which changes this salutary rule of the Supreme Court and District Court practice. One of the defects, of the Municipal Court Act, which the present Code replaced, was that subdivision 15 of section 1 thereof excluded power to stay for nonpayment of costs of a prior action. McKown v. Oppenheimer, 60 Misc. Rep. 99, 100, 111 N. Y. Supp. 609; Goldman v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 129 App. Div. 657, 658, 114 N. Y. Supp. 182.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
