Plaintiff further alleges that, as defendant refused to pay the aforesaid $400 or the said sum of $141.65, an action was brought in the Supreme Court to recover both of said sums, which action came on for trial on March 22, 1915, and that upon said trial and in open court the first cause of action hereinbefore set .forth for the recovery of the sum of $400 was withdrawn, and plaintiff tried the issue as to the balance of the sum due. The plaintiff annexes to his complaint a copy of the answer in such former suit showing the issues raised therein. It is further averred that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201cSaid action was tried, and the jury found in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for his wrongful discharge, and rendered a verdict in favor of the' plaintiff and against the defendant for his wrongful discharge, and rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the full amount claimed for the unexpired salary as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Plaintiff then sets forth the entry of judgment for the balance of the salary due in the sum of $150.14, as appears by the judgment roll, \u201cand plaintiff pleads said judgment as res adjudicata on the question of the wrongful discharge of tire plaintiff by the defendant before the expiration of the year aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The demurrer is based upon the ground that the complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We believe that the order appealed from was erroneous, and that the defendant was entitled to judgment upon the pleadings. There was but one wrongful discharge of the plaintiff by the defendant, and that was on March 12, 1914. The damages which flowed from that discharge were not only the wages for the balance of tire term of the contract, but as well the additional compensation for his services which was to have been paid hr plaintiff by tire defendant on April 1, 1914, if plaintiff was then still in defendant\u2019s employ. Plaintiff avers that the hiring for the additional year ending on that date was \u201cso that the defendant could protect himself in knowing that the plaintiff would be in his employ on said date.\u201d By reason of the wrongful discharge plaintiff was not so- in defendant\u2019s employ and could not be, and therefore, would not become entitled to the payment of the said sum on that date. On the contrary, by reason of the defendant\u2019s wrongful discharge of him, he became entitled to recover that sum upon the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of the discharge, for by that act, and as a necessary consequence thereof, and as part of the damage flowing therefrom, defendant prevented plaintiff from enjoying the right which he would otherwise have possessed of receiving said sum of $400 on April 1, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The action heretofore brought was not for plaintiff\u2019s services, but for the damage caused by the discharge in the loss of his earnings for the balance of the term of the contract. The plaintiff could have recovered therein as part of his damage the sum of $400 in question. As was said in McCargo v. Jergens, 206 N. Y. 363, at page 372, 99 N. E. 838, at page 841, by Judge Chase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cIf a servant be wrongfully discharged, he has no action for wages, except for past services rendered and for sums of money that have become due. As far as any other claim on the contract is concerned, he must sue for the injury he lias sustained by his discharge in not being allowed to serve and earn the wages agreed upon. Howard v. Daly, 61 N. Y. 362, 369 [19 Am. Rep. 283]. The plaintiff cannot recover as compensation for services the amounts payable by the agreement in any case unless the services therein provided are performed. An action for wrongful discharge may include every element of damage arising from the discharge. It is an indivisible action, and one recovery is a bar to any further action for damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment for the damages recovered in the prior action, based upon the same wrongful discharge, is a bar to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The order appealed from will be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
