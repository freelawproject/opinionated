Letters of administration had not at that time been issued to the plaintiffs. The letters of administration bear date June 13, 1914. At the conclusion of the case defendant\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that the action was prematurely brought. This motion was denied, tire case, submitted to the jury, and a verdict rendered for $3,000. From the judgment entered upon the verdict this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It is well settled that the action to recover for the negligent causing of death of a person is a statutory action, which had no counterpart at common law. The damages awarded for the negligent act are such as result to the property rights of the person or persons for whose benefit the cause of. action was created. The statute is not simply remedial, but creates a new cause of action in favor of the personal representatives of the deceased, which is wholly distinct from, and not a revivor of, the cause of action which, if he had survived, he would have had for his bodily injury. Matter of Meekin v. B. H. R. R. Co., 164 N. Y. 145, 153, 58 N. E. 50, 51 L. R. A. 235, 79 Am. St. Rep. 635, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The cause of action did not arise until some one was in position to bring and maintain the action, or, in other words, until the \u2022 personal representatives of the deceased had been duly appointed and qualified. Crapo v. City of Syracuse, 183 N. Y. 395, 397, 400, 76 N. E. 465; Conway v. City of N. Y., 139 App. Div. 446, 448, 124 N. Y. Supp. 660. \u201cIt cannot be said that a cause of action exists, unless there be also a person in existence capable of suing.\u201d Murray v. East India Co., 5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 204, cited in Barnes v. City of Brooklyn, 22 App. Div. 520, 522, 48 N. Y. Supp. 36, 38. It is clear, therefore, that the nonappointment of the administrators before bringing the action is not merely a lack of capacity to sue, for that presupposes an existing cause of action, which the plaintiff is incapacitated to maintain. But tire due appointment and qualification of the administrators is a necessary element to the existence of tire cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\"><bracketnum>'[3, 4]</bracketnum> The objection of lack of capacity to sue must be raised by demurrer, if the defect appears on tire face of the complaint, otherwise by a defense set forth in the answer, or it will be waived. But where the fact of their appointment is a necessary element of the cause of action itself, a denial of the fact alleged in the complaint properly presents the issue. Therefore, when plaintiffs proved their appointment some months after the commencement of the action, they established the fact that no cause of action existed at the time the action was brought, and defendant\u2019s motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\"><bracketnum>[5, 6]</bracketnum> It is suggested that as the administrators had been appointed prior to the trial, and there existed a cause of action at that time, tire plaintiffs should not be deprived of their rights, and under our liberal statute of jeofail (chapter 8, tit. 1, Code of Civil Procedure) we should disregard the error. The answer to this is twofold: First, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>such an error as is covered by the statute, as it goes to the substance of the action; and, second, as the dismissal is not on the merits, another action may be brought within one year from the termination of this one by a reversal of the judgment and a dismissal of the complaint (Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7 405), as the general provisions of the Code dealing with the limitation of actions apply to actions brought under section 1902 of the Code. Sharrow, Adm\u2019r, v. Inland Lines, Ltd., 214 N. Y. 101, 105, 111, 108 N. E. 217, L. R. A. 1915E, 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">The judgment and order should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. Order filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">CLARKE, P. J., and SCOTT and DOWLING, JJ., concur. SMITH, J\u201e dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
