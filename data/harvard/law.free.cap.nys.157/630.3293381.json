Coughlin for the probate of the will of Patrick Daly, deceased, with petition by Annie Farrell for construction thereof. From a decree (154 N. Y. Supp. 895, 90 Mise. Rep. 545), of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, construing the will, Anne McGrath appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-21\">Appeal from a decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings County, entered in the office of the clerk of said court on the 20th day of May, 1915, admitting decedent\u2019s will to probate and construing a paragraph thereof. Patrick Daly, who died January 24, 1915, left a will in which there was this residuary clause: \u201cFourth.\u2014All the rest residue and remainder of my estate of every name and kind so ever I give devise and bequeath to my son-in-law JamesCoughlin and Annie McGrath of 519 Greene Ave. in equal shares.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-22\">Upon instituting probate proceedings, a petition asking for the construction of this clause was presented by Annie Farrell, who alleged that the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cAnnie McGrath\u201d in this fourth clause of the will was intended for her, Annie Farrell, as the name Annie McGrath had been wricten into the will by mistake. In the third paragraph of the will were the following bequests: \u201cAnne McGrath of Vanderbilt avenue near Atlantic Ave. Brooklyn one hundred dollars, to Annie Farrell all my family pictures.\u201d It appears, therefore, that Anne McGrath and Annie Farrell were both persons in being when the will was made, and had been elsewhere mentioned by the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-5\">The lawyer who drew the will had known decedent over 25 years. On his being called to decedent\u2019s home the night of December 11, 1914, decedent stated that ho wished to make a change in his will. Decedent said: \u201cYou know the other will left everything to Annie Farrell, and I am going to give half of it now to Mr. Coughlin, .my son-in-law. Since making the last will my daughter died, and he has been very good to me.\u201d Decedent also said: \u201cI have a relative, I think the only relative I have in the world, named Mc-Grath, living on Vanderbilt avenue near Atlantic; I don\u2019t know what the number is, but it is the brownstone row where Judge Courtney lived. * * * I think I onght to leave her something; I will give her $100.\u201d The lawyer then made a memorandum of these directions to help prepare the will. This original memorandum was received in evidence. It indicates that the residuary estate was to go to James Coughlin and Annie Farrell of 519 Greene avenue. Annie Farrell had resided at 519 Greene avenue, in the same house with testator, at the time of the execution of the will, and for one year and three months prior thereto. Anne McGrath never lived at 519 Greene avenue; she had lived at 494 Vanderbilt avenue for ten years. It is to be noticed that in the third clause the testator had bequeathed $100 to <em>Anne </em>McGrath, of Vanderbilt avenue, near Atlantic avenue, and <em>Annie </em>Farrell was given the family pictures. The fourth clause reads \u201cAnnie [not Anne] McGrath.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-6\">The surrogate accordingly concluded that by this clause the testator intended Annie Farrell, and decreed accordingly. From this decree Anne McGrath appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b661-7\">Argued before JENKS, P.

A name fits one claimant, but it is coupled with a residence which fits only the other claimant. This lets in parol evidence to show the circumstances surrounding the testator and his expressed views, in order to aid in determining his intention, and to identify the person he attempted to describe. Declarations of the testator, even to his attorney at the time of preparing the will, were admissible, as such testimony was not privileged, since it was given by a subscribing witness. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Here the residence was important, and in the situation decisive. In such questions of construction the liability to\u2019 a mistake in the name and not the place has been judicially remarked upon. Thus in 1860, Metcalf, J., quoted Ford Abinger that generally, where mistakes have been assumed to have been made by testators, \u201ceither in the name or description of the devisee, or the property devised,\u201d it has been found \u201cthat the mistake has been made in the name and not in the description.\u201d Thayer v. City of Boston, 15 Gray (Mass.) 349. The situation here is like the two competing beneficiaries, Magdalena Baumann Fuhge and Lena Baumann, in Baumann v. Steingester, 213 N. Y. 328, 107 N. E. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>By such identification, the will is construed according to the plain intent of the testator. This principle has been often applied where religious and, charitable institutions, having similar corporate names, have been identified and ascertained by parol, and then by construction the right one has been declared to be the intended beneficiary. Many such decisions in this country are in 1 Jarman on Wills, 760, note (Am. Ed., Randolph &amp; Talcott). And a recent instance is German Pioneer Verein v. Meyer, 70 N. J. Eq. 192, 63 Atl. 835, by Pitney, V. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention against the surrogate\u2019s power thus to construe this will, and still less as to her insistence upon a jury trial for such a question of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">I advise that the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court be affirmed, with costs to the three parties to this appeal, payable out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">THOMAS, STAPLETON, and MILLS, JJ., concur. JENKS, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
