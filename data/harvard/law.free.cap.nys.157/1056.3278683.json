He testified that he noticed a carriage standing in the block between Twenty-Third and Twenty-Fourth streets with a crowd around it, and went there to investigate, and plaintiff pointed out the place where the accident occurred, about 60 feet south of Twenty-Fourth street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">The story told by the plaintiff, that before he stepped off the sidewalk to cross the street he \u201clooked around to see if anything was coming up,\u201d and saw nothing on the street coming up or down, and that after he was about 4 feet from the sidewalk he looked' again up and down, and saw nothing coming up or down the avenue, and then started to walk, and was immediately struck by defendant\u2019s horse and knocked down, is incredible. He was struck so soon after leaving the sidewalk that defendant\u2019s carriage must have been within easy sight before he started to cross, if he had looked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">There was an arc light on the southwest corner of Twenty-Third street, and there was no evidence of any unusual atmospheric conditions, or that the avenue was not lighted in the usual manner, or that there was anything to obstruct his view, or as to the speed at which the horse was going, except that it was trotting; but one of the witnesses for plaintiff testified that when the horse was stopped plain-. tiff\u2019s \u201cfeet were under the carriage, by the carriage where the wheels went over him,\u201d and as said by Mr. Justice Herrick in Fuller v. Dederick, 35 App. Div. 93, 94, 54 N. Y. Supp. 593, 595:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-7\">\u201cIt seems almost incredible that, if the plaintiff was exercising her faculties, she should not have seen the horse and carriage until it struck her. * * * It seems to me impossible that, if she had been using her eyes and ears as a person should do in crossing a city street, she should not have seen this horse and wagon approaching, and that, if she. had been so using her senses, she would have known of its approach before it struck her, as she insists, or before she ran into it, as the evidence seems to indicate. * * * So far from showing the absence of contributory negligence, the evidence shows its presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">As stated by Fauglilin, J., in McKinley v. Metropolitan Street R. Co., 91 App. Div. 153, 156, 86 N. Y. Supp. 461, 463:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-11\">\u201cThe accident could not have happened in the manner described by him. The inference is irresistible that he did not look at all, or did not look with care. * * * This is not a case where the credibility of a witness is involved, which takes the case to the jury. His testimony is impeached by physical facts, about which there is and can be no controversy. The car was <em>there </em>and almost upon him as he stepped upon the track, or he would not have been struck while stepping over the first rail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>As stated by Chief Justice Cullen, in Dolfini v. Erie R. R. Co., 178 N. Y. 1, 4, 70 N. E. 68, 69:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-5\">\u201cIt is not sufficient that the plaintiff testifies that he looked, but did not see. Such a statement is incredible as matter of law. Matter of Harriot, 145 N. Y. 540 [40 N. E. 246].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Nor does the story of this plaintiff become any more persuasive because, in addition to a compliance with the care demanded by the law of looking before crossing a street, he testified that he also stopped and listened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">No negligence was shown on the part of the defendant, and the evidence fails to establish plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence. The motion of defendant to dismiss the complaint, made at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, and renewed at the close of the case, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and judgment entered dismissing the complaint, with $30 costs to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
