Adams for making the premature sketch of the entries. It is incredible that the acting commissioner, who, in the awkward situation of determining a question of veracity or recollection between his highest superior and the relator, conducted the proceeding fairly, could have dismissed the relator from the force on account of the first two charges. Indeed, he referred to the third charge as the serious one. While the relator may have been negligent in failing to discover the subsequent entries, even in the probable mental disturbance caused by the sudden appearance of, and abrupt rebuke by, the commissioner, and while the acting commissioner was authorized to find that the relator did use the words, <em>\u201cI </em>don\u2019t remember,\u201d the evidence does not sufficiently show that the defendant was guilty of conscious false statement to the inspector. He should be convicted only by clear proof of the offense. The words, <em>\u201cI </em>don\u2019t remember,\u201d if given their usual meaning, would have indicated mere flippancy, which is not ascribed to him. The evidence fairly shows that he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was there or not.\u201d That is an understandable statement. What the relator said as the commissioner, declining to hear explanation, was about to depart, should be considered in connection with the information that Lieut. Adams had given the relator regarding the entries. Viewed in such light, it has not the significance that must have been given it by the trial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">Relator\u2019s statement, \u201cI am positive there was,\u201d meaning a blotter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>over the lower part of the page, is entirely consistent with his earlier statement: \u201cI saw nothing there at all at the time. It seems impossible for me to do it, but I did it.\u201d Evidently, upon reflection, especially after the suggestion made by his lieutenant, he had, when he testified later, come to the certain conclusion that the blotter must have been there, and so then said, \u201cI am positive there was.\u201d It was his reasonable inference, not an assertion that he remembered actually seeing the blotter upon the page. The interrogation does not seem to have pinned the relator down to such exact inquiry as this, \u201cDo you remember that you actually saw the blotter on the page?\u201d We consider that the relator came in the end to- the belief that there was an interposed piece of blotting paper, as a rational inference from the fact that he did sign his name without noticing the entries below, and the later advice by the lieutenant as to the blotter, and, further, that such inference was, under the circumstances, not unreasonable for him to draw, and should have been accepted by the commissioner as representing the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">It is concluded that the writ should be sustained, the determination of the acting commissioner annulled, and the relator restored to his position, with $50 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">THOMAS, STAPLETON, and MILLS, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-7\">PUTNAM, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Au9\">I cannot excuse or palliate false testimony found under the third specification. Relator was called before Inspector Sclimittberger for investigation on October 14th. He then said that, when he came in, <em>\u201cI </em>saw nothing in the blotter except the line, and I filled it in 3 :55 p. m.\u201d He repeated that he did not see the commissioner\u2019s entry at the foot, nor the ro-ll-call entry. He could not explain this oversight. On examination of Lieut. Adams, the inspector started to suggest that something covered these entries, and Adams responded that a blotter <em>may be </em>on top of it, when the relator (interrupting) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">\u201cThe lieutenant handed me a pen, and I put myself in. I saw nothing there at all at the time. It seems impossible for me to do it, but I did it.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Yet at the adjourned hearing on November 6th relator had brought himself to testify that he was \u201cunder the opinion\u201d that a blotter covered the entry. From being under such an \u201copinion,\u201d his certitude rose to answering:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">\u201cQ. Was there a blotter on this book? A. I am positive there was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Here was an entry improper as to time. Police rule 486. It is like a false entry in a ship\u2019s log, to which a penalty attaches (R. S. U. S. \u00a7 4292 (U. S. Comp. St. 1913, \u00a7 8038). That loose blotting paper covered the lower page came as a later and dubious excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">The head of the police force has to raise the standard of scrupulous exactness in the entries officially made in station house blotters. Such entries often become the basis of officers\u2019 testimony in civil and criminal causes. But he has a still higher duty. This is to raise and enforce a standard of strict truth. Formerly it was not infrequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>that a patrolman\u2019s word carried small weight with juries. When, after trial, the commissioner finds testimony consciously false, I am unwilling to hold he erred, or that he could not impose the extreme penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">JENICS, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
