Considering the gravity of a bankrupt\u2019s concealment of assets (Bankr. Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, \u00a7 29b [1], 30 Stat. 554 [U. S. Comp. St. \u00a7 9613] ; U. S. v. Rhodes [D. C.] 212 Fed. 513), the state court should not aid a former bankrupt in suing upon a cause of action which of right belonged to the trustee for the benefit of creditors. The fact that in 1901 this bankruptcy was a matter of public news, and was the subject of journalistic comment in defendant\u2019s issues, did not charge defendant\u2019s motion with laches. When the plaintiff\u2019s testimony brought out that, at the time of his bankruptcy, plaintiff owned these certificates, defendant promptly moved to set this up.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The orders appealed from, therefore, are affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
