Penal Law, \u00a7 2124, subd. 3. There was no testimony tending to warrant any finding of the offense of robbery of a lesser grade, and therefore the court was not required to instruct the jury that they could find appellant guilty of any lesser degree of crime, especially as no such instruction was asked, or exception taken to the instructions which the court gave. In view of the testimony, such a request to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that the jury could convict of a lesser grade of the offenses charged would not have been appropriate. The other points raised are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
