This prior action was \u201csettled and discontinued,\u201d on a stipulation signed by the parties; the defendant paying the plaintiff for such settlement the sum of $50. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The alleged contract for the doing of the work was an oral one,' and plaintiff\u2019s president on cross-examination admitted that the lien was filed to protect all work that had been done or was to be done for the defendant including the water main.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">It thus appears that after the performance of the work, to recover for which this suit is brought, plaintiff had sued defendant for damages for breach of contract, \"which contract included the services and materials for which recovery is sought in this action, and it is clear that, in the absence of fraud or mistake, the acceptance of $50 in settlement of its unliquidated claim concluded the plaintiff and required a direction of a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Judgment reversed, with $30 costs, and complaint dismissed on the merits, with appropriate costs in the court below.
