Penal Law, \u00a7 486, subd. 2. In such case the Legislature, subordinating a parent\u2019s custody to' the infant\u2019s welfare, considers the \u201cchild in need of the care and protection of the state.\u201d Laws 1910, c. 659, \u00a7 39. The Children\u2019s Court in Kings County had jurisdiction of such a proceeding. Penal Law, \u00a7 486; Laws of 1910, c. 659, \u00a7 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">In February, 1915, an agent of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children filed in this Children's Court an information, alleging that these three children above named (two aged 5, and one of 3) were found without proper guardianship', neglected by parents and guardians, in violation of section 486 of the Penal Law; that the father was dead; charging dissolute conduct on the mother (this appellant), even that her intercourse with dissolute men had occurred in the children\u2019s presence; also that she had then left the children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>and had gone to Buffalo with a male person with whom she had a meretricious relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">After full hearings, in which appellant was represented by counsel, the charges were amply proven, whereupon, with testimony as to the children\u2019s religion, the learned justice on March 10, 1915, committed these children to the Greek American Institute of New York. _ Appellant attempted to test this disposition by a writ of habeas corpus, which, on March 26, 1915, Justice Clark, of the Supreme Court, at Special Term, dismissed, upon the return showing such commitment. From this determination appellant did not appeal. The uncle then took proceedings to adopt these children, but not on notice to appellant, who was referred to in his petition as having been deprived of custody of the children. It set forth the action by the Children\u2019s Court, annexing copy of Justice Wilkin\u2019s opinion, showing that the mother had been judicially deprived of their custody and they had been committed to the Greek American Institute of New York. The consents of others interested were attached. The order of adoption by the Surrogate was made on April 10, 1915. Appellant thereafter took the proceeding, which her appeal brings here, to set aside this order. After hearing, and upon filing an opinion, this was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Her appeal raises the single point that, because of omission of notice to her, the Surrogate\u2019s Court was without jurisdiction. Our statute makes it unnecessary to give notice to a parent who is \u201cjudicially deprived of the custody of the child on account of cruelty or neglect.\u201d Domestic Relations Law (Consol. Laws, c. 14) \u00a7 111, subd. 3, formerly Laws of 1873, c. 830, \u00a7 6. Here the grounds were more than mere neglect. When the dissolute mother was arrested in the Buffalo hotel, these children had been left in the hands,of a rheumatic old woman too infirm to undress them, so that, when taken, they were found asleep in their clothes at 10 o\u2019clock at night. Other conditions were shown calling for interference. A full investigation resulted in a commitment actually depriving appellant of her custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel urges that \u201cjudicially deprived\u201d requires that appellant should have been convicted of the offense mentioned. But this is to lose sight of the purpose of the Children\u2019s Court, which is not to convict, or punish, but to protect. Starting with the innovation of hearings of juvenile cases in a separate room, a new court followed, wherein it was often found that the first step was to take the child from the corrupting influence of bad surroundings. Justification for such a power to take the child away from depraved parents was taken from the old chancery jurisdiction, exercised as parens patriae\u2014in former times invoked chiefly for children with property, or in connection with matrimonial decrees. On behalf of infancy, suffering from poverty, vice, and neglect, this ancient chancery doctrine was now laid hold of and turned to wider service. The interests of the child, not the punishment of crimes, are the subjects of the jurisdiction of Children\u2019s Courts. Commonwealth v. Fisher, 213 Pa. 48, 62 Atl. 198, 5 Ann. Cas. 92. When such investigation, conducted with care, as the present record shows, results in taking away the children from the control and influence of the delinquent parent and committing them to an institution, she has been \u201cjudicially deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>of custody\u201d within our adoption statute. Otherwise, the permanent effect of Children\u2019s Courts, now carrying on beneficent work in cities of over 30 American states, would be lost or imperiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Furthermore, the dismissal of the writ of habeas corpus, sued out by appellant, was res judicata. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 64, 35 Am. Dec. 653. Hence, on this appeal, minute criticisms of abbreviations in the information and in the form of the commitment are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Richmond County should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
