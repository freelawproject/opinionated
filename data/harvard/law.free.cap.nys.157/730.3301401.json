Pinckney, brought this action in ejectment to recover possession of premises in the city of New York included between 150th street on the north, Seventh avenue on the west, and the bulkhead line on the Harlem River on the east. Mary G. Pinckney died December 8, 1908, seised in fee of the premises in question, and leaving a will which was admitted to probate December 31, 1908. The testatrix appointed Thomas L. Watt, Archibald Watt, and Curtis B. Pierce to be executors and trustees under her will. Thomas L. Watt and Curtis B. Pierce qualified as executors; Archibald Watt having died before the testatrix. Thomas L. Watt died October 10, 1910, and from that time on Curtis B. Pierce continued to act as sole surviving executor until his death, October 21, 1912. After Pierce\u2019s death, Grace Watt -Thomas and Charles E. Littlefield were appointed administrators with the will annexed. Grace Watt Thomas resigned and was discharged March 3, 1913. Littlefield began this action, but died May 12, 1915. Clarence H. Kelsey was then appointed administrator with the will annexed, and the action was continued in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The premises in question were disposed of by the testatrix, under the eighth and ninth clauses of her will, as a part of the residue of her estate. In the first part of paragraph 8 of the will tire testatrix leaves a quarter of the- residue of her estate both real and personal to Thomas L. Watt absolutely, and in like manner a quarter to-Archibald Watt. The remaining one-half of the residufe, except one-eighth given absolutely to Grace Watt, is left to the executors upon trust to invest and reinvest and pay the income during a life, with remainders over. The testatrix gave her executors a full power of sale, and in an action to construe this will the Supreme Court held that there had been an equitable conversion of all the real estate of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The plaintiff claims to recover on an alleged equitable title as a basis for his action. - He alleges \u201cthat the said Curtis B. Pierce as executor was vested with the title to all of the said property as <em>personal property \u201d </em>because of its equitable conversion, and that the plaintiff, as administrator with the will annexed and as successor to-tire executor, Pierce, has been and is vested with the title to tire property above described and is entitled to the immediate possession thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"Afb\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> An equitable title will not support an action of ejectment. \u201e There must be a legal title. Cagger v. Lansing, 64 N. Y. 417, 428; Bennett v. Gray, 92 Hun, 86, 36 N. Y. Supp. 372, and cases cited; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1519. This section of tire Code of Civil Procedure evidently was taken from the Revised Statutes, which declare the-essentials of a complaint and verdict in ejectment. 3 R. S. (5th Ed.) c. 5, tit. l, \u00a7 10, and section 23, subd. 7. The Code has not changed the provisions of tire Revised Statutes, except so far as to omit stating expressly the form of the complaint; but the Code, in prescribing-the form of the verdict, indicates what allegations and proofs are essential to maintain the action. It is clear that under the Code of Civil Procedure the plaintiff in ejectment must allege and prove that he has an estate in fee, or for life, or for a term of years. In the case under consideration the plaintiff neither alleged nor proved these facts, and naturally the verdict did not specify any one of these estates. Therefore the verdict was wrong and insufficient for the judgment entered upon it. For this reason the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In the case at bar the administrator with the will annexed did not take the title of the executor, Pierce. Of course, he took the power of sale conferred upon the executor (Mott v. Ackerman, 92 N. Y. 539, 553, 554), and was under an imperative obligation to exercise that power of sale, but under the circumstances of this case he did not take legal title to the premises. This will appear from an inspection of the terms of the eighth clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\"><bracketnum>[4-6]</bracketnum> Under the devises to Thomas L. Watt and Archibald Watt, the fee of their respective shares- of the estate vested in them as devisees, subject to the power of sale in the executors; while as to those shares out of which the test\u00e1trix created life estates with remainders over, the executors were trustees of an express trust, and therefore the fee of those shares vested in them as trustees. Morse v. Morse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>85 N. Y. 53, 58; Salisbury v. Slade, 160 N. Y. 278, 54 N. E. 741; Real Property Law, \u00a7 100. The mere fact that the devise was to executors, without designating them as trustees, makes them none the less trustees when, from the terms of the will, it appears that they were to act as trustees. Mee v. Gordon, 187 N. Y. 400, 407, 80 N. E. 353, 116 Am. St. Rep. 613, 10 Ann. Cas. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">The case of Salisbury v. Slade, supra, was quite like the case under consideration. There the testator gave, devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate, real and personal, to his sons and daughters\u2014 to his sons absolutely, but to his daughters for life, with remainders over; the executors to hold the daughters\u2019 shares and pay them the income. The court held that there was an equitable conversion of the land into personalty at the moment of testator\u2019s death and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201cThe naked fee of the land, as it could not remain in suspension, was vested in the trustee and testator\u2019s three sons for the purpose of carrying out in fact that conversion which the law already regarded as equitably accomplished. The real estate, as such, could not be dealt with as such for any other purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> Upon the appointment and qualification of the administrator with the will annexed, the fee did not pass to him, but vested in the Supreme Court, which would then have power to appoint some person to execute the trust. Horsfield v. Black, 40 App. Div. 265, 57 N. Y. Supp. 1006; Dunning, Trustee, etc., v. Ocean Nat. Bank, 61 N. Y. 497, 501, 502, 19 Am. Rep. 293; Real Property Law, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
