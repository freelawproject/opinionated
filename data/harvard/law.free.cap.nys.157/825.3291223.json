The separate defense alleges that between. October 3, 1915, and October 18, 1915, plaintiff performed certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>services amounting to the value of $21, and that the defendants have tendered that sum to the plaintiff, less the amount of $14.07, which is due to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is to be noted that under the so-called separate defense the defendants admit liability for wages for two weeks and two days from October 3d at the rate of $9 per week. At the opening of the case the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">\u201cI have a check that was given plaintiff for his wages for the week immediately before October 3d, which check came back from the bank. Not having been: paid, the entire amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand is admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">This statement was not objected to. The check was offered in evidence and admitted without objection. The plaintiff then rested. The defendant thereupon moved to dismiss on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff cannot maintain an action for wages. An infant is not entitled to maintain an action unless he has been emancipated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The trial justice denied this motion, and the parties then litigated the issues raised by the defendant under their counterclaim. At the close of the case the defendant again moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiff has not alleged or proven emancipation. The court reserved decision on the entire case, and then rendered judgment \u201cafter a trial of the issues\u201d for the defendant. That judgment is clearly incorrect. The material allegations of the complaint stand admitted, and even if we assume that upon the evidence presented the trial justice decided in favor of the defendant on the counterclaim, the plaintiff would still he entitled to- judgment for the sum of $15.93, since the counterclaim is only for $14.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The defendant however, claims that the trial justice dismissed the complaint on the ground that there is no allegation or proof that the infant was emancipated. If the trial justice decided the case on this ground, he should have dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d; but certainly he could not give judgment on the merits after a trial of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Moreover, even a dismissal of the complaint on this ground would be erroneous. The defendants rely for authority on the case of Shute v. Dorr, 5 Wend. 204. That case represents the common-law rule that a parent is always entitled to a minor son\u2019s earnings unless he has emancipated the son. The rule, however, was to some extent modified by chapter 266 of the Laws of 1850, now section 72 of the Domestic Relations Law. That statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-12\">\u201cWhere a minor is in the employment of a person other than his parent or guardian, payment to such minor of his wages is valid, <em>unless such pa/renl or guardian notify the employer </em>in writing, within thirty days after the commencement of such service, that such wages are claimed by such parent or guardian, but whenever such notice is given at any time payments to the minor shall not be valid for services <em>rendered, thereafter.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">It seems to me quite clear that under the terms of this statute title to wages earned by a minor under a contract of service, unless notice is given within 30 days by the parent, vests <em>as between the employer and the employe </em>in the employe, and the parent or guardian can thereafter by notice obtain title only to those wages earned thereafter. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the present case the plaintiff entered into service of the defendant 6 months before the action was brought. He signed the contract and he received the wages. Whether he has been emancipated or not is immaterial in this action, for payment to him by the defendant would be binding under the statute as against the father, even if the father still has a right to claim from the son moneys paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Judgment should therefore be reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
