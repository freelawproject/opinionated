The facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Defendants were plaintiff\u2019s tenants under a long lease. May 26, 1914, the landlord brought summary proceedings for nonpayment of the May rent, due May 1st. The learned trial judge has found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cBut before a warrant therein was issued out of said Municipal Court, the defendants vacated said premises and the plaintiff took possession thereof under the terms of said indenture of lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As P shall point out, the crucial question in this case is whether the lease was terminated by the dispossess proceedings. There is no conclusion of law to that effect, and from this finding of fact it would appear that the lease had not been terminated. We have, however, in the record before us, an admission by defendants\u2019 counsel that defendants by this summary proceeding \u201chad been duly dispossessed from the premises in question,\u201d and that is repeated, expressly or impliedly, a number of times. It is therefore not even necessary to determine whether, by defendants\u2019 vacating the premises after the institution of the summary proceedings but before the warrant issued, the relation of landlord and tenant had not been terminated. I think it had been. Hoffert v. Dutton, 74 Misc. Rep. 433, 132 N. Y. Supp. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Under the circumstances, therefore, and upon the authority of section 1317 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see Bonnette v. Molloy, 209 N. Y. 167, 172, 102 N. E. 559), we must amend the third finding of fact to read that \u201cby virtue of said proceedings the defendants were duly dispossessed from the premises in question,\u201d and we must make a conclusion of law to accord with the tenth allegation of defendants\u2019 answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cThat by reason of the said proceedings the plaintiff terminated the relation of landlord and tenant theretofore existing between plaintiff and the defendants, and thereby canceled and annulled the lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">To resume now the statement of facts. Erom May 26th on plaintiff endeavored to let the store to other tenants, but without avail. September 5, 1914, he brought an action against tire defendants in the Municipal Court for rent for the months of May, June, July, and August, but at the trial amended the summons and complaint to ask only for the rent for the month of May, for which judgment was thereupon rendered in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Defendants on the trial in the instant case amended their answer to plead substantially as their only defense the above recovery as res judicata as to the installments of rent due on the 1st days of June, July, August, and September, 1914, which, under the terms of the lease would have been $75 a month, a total of $300, by which amount appellant insists the present judgment should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Respondent frankly concedes the correctness of defendants\u2019 contentions to the effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">(a) \u201cThat several claims payable at different times, arising out of the same contract or transaction, must be included in one action\u201d\u2014on the authority of Kennedy v. City of N. Y., 196 N. Y. 19, 89 N. E. 360, 25 L). R. A. (N. S.) 847, and Loriilard v. Clyde, 122 N. Y. 41, 25 N. E. 292, 19 Am. St. Rep. 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">Also1 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">(b) \u201cThe test of the identity of actions is not the theory upon which the pleader adduces his evidence, nor the forum to which he presents it, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>whether the same evidence will support the two suits\u2019\u2019\u2014on the authority of Steinbach v. insurance Co., 77 N. Y. 498, 33 Am. Rep. 655, and Stowell v. Chamberlain, 60 N. Y. 272.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Respondent urges, however, and I agree in the correctness of his position, that these rules have no application to the case at bar. The dispossess proceedings of May, 1914, having terminated the lease, the landlord\u2019s action, brought in September, 1914, was correctly modified to be one for <em>rent </em>solely for the month of May.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> His present suit, although the recovery may be measured by the amount of the rent for each succeeding month, is not an action for rent, nor an action under or upon the lease as a whole, but one strictly for damages for defendants\u2019 breach of their separate covenant to pay rent, which, by the terms thereof, expressly survived the termination of the lease. Pannuto v. Foglia, 55 Misc. Rep. 244, 247,105 N. Y. Supp. 495; Michaels v. Fishel, 169 N. Y. 381, 62 N. E. 425. See, also, Walsh v. N. Y. &amp; Kentucky Co., 88 App. Div. 477, 85 N. Y. Supp. 83, and McCargo v. Jergens, 206 N. Y. 363, 99 N. E. 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The previous recovery for rent, therefore, was not res judicata upon the present suit for damages for breach of covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
