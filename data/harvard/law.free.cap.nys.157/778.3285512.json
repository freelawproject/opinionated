The only question, therefore, that the trial justice could have left to the jury, is whether it is negligent for the owner of a tenement house to wash slate steps at 6 o\u2019clock each Sunday morning. I do not think that, under any view of what constitutes \u2022reasonable care, such an act could be considered as negligent, and the trial justice properly refused to leave the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-18\">Judgment affirmed, with $25 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
