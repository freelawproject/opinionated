The answer sets out the making of a written contract between the Empire Gas Fixture Company (hereinafter referred to as the contracting company) and the defendant for the doing of the work in question, that subsequently the contract was assigned to the plaintiff, the Empire Lighting Fixture Company, and the failure of the plaintiff to perform the contract, to the defendant\u2019s damage in the sum of $446.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> In the written contract pleaded by defendant there was no provision for payment as the work progressed, so that payment could not be demanded as of right until the completion of the contract. Rosen v. Bonagur, 143 N. Y. Supp. 1059. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s president, Ansorge, if believed, would have obviated any such difficulty as far as the plaintiff was concerned, for he swore that there was no assignment, that he had at no time been connected with the contracting company, that that company went out of business and he received the contract from one of its former employes and on or about April 1, 1915, brought it to the defendant, told him the plaintiff company (whose name was almost the same as the contracting company, the only difference being that the word \u201clighting\u201d was substituted for \u201cgas fixture\u201d) had taken over the plant of the contracting company, and that, if defendant wanted the plaintiff to deliver under the contract, plaintiff was willing to do so, but that the contract did not say anything about payments, and on the promise of the defendant to make payments as the work progressed plaintiff agreed to perform the written con- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>, tract. The same witness stated, however, that the plaintiff was organized to and did take over the business of the contracting company, and that the contract was in plaintiff\u2019s office when defendant in April, 1915, telephoned that he was ready for the work to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Defendant testified that one Clark was the person with whom he had dealt as tire representative of tire contracting company; that when Ansorge saw the defendant, the former said he was taking Clark\u2019s place\u2014came instead of Clark; that nothing was said about tire contract, or of altering it in regard to payment, and no mention made of the plaintiff; that because of threats made by Ansorge to stop the work payments were made from time to time, but that defendant gave as little as he could, so as to get Ansorge to- go ahead; Ansorge on May 1, 1915, when he received $200 from defendant, receipted for that amount \u201con account of this contract,\u201d signing on the contract, \u201cEmpire Gas Fixture Company, P. J. Ansorgeon June 3d he gave a similar receipt, and subsequently he signed receipts in the names of both the contracting company and the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">It is apparent, therefore, from the preponderance of credible testimony, that plaintiff is the assignee of the contract made by defendant with the Empire Gas Fixture Company, and as such bound by the provisions of that contract, and that there was no consideration for the payments on account actually made by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Under the contract plaintiff was required to \u201cfurnish and install material specified above complete in the buildings located as above, and furnish certificates from the New York Board of Fire Underwriters for each and all fixtures furnished and installed.\u201d Although plaintiff showed that an inspector of that board had inspected the two Seventy-Second street houses for which fixtures were furnished, and given an order for the issuance of a certificate, it does not appear that a certificate was ever issued for these two houses, or that an inspection was made of the Seventy-Third street house. This was not merely a technical omission, because lack of such a certificate may seriously affect fire insurance, and the department of water supply, gas, and electricity may cause the electric current to be shut off. See Meyers v. Shapiro, 127 App. Div. 186, 111 N. Y. Supp. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> It further appears that, because defendant refused to malee payments, the plaintiff did not supply fixtures called for by the contract of the value of $55.10, according to the plaintiff\u2019s estimate, and which defendant testified it cost him $77.40 to furnish. This default was without excuse, as defendant was under no obligation to make the payment demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Judgment must be reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
