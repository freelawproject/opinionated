J. H. Semel <em>&amp; </em>Co., of 514 and 516 Broadway, New York, the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars for all goods that have been sold prior to the date of this guaranty and all goods sold and delivered on running account to Samuel Braun, of 704 Columbus avenue, New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-19\">At the trial the defendant claimed that, since the words in this guaranty were in the past tense, the guaranty should be confined to those goods which had been \u201csold,\u201d but not delivered, and to goods which had been \u201csold and delivered,\u201d prior to the date of the guaranty. The trial justice overruled this contention, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for the value of goods sold and delivered to Samuel Braun after the signing of the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>It seems to me that the decision of the trial justice is correct, and should be affirmed. There are two elements in this guaranty which show an intention on the part of the defendant that it should apply to \u201cgoods sold and delivered\u201d after the date of the guaranty. In the first place, the guaranty provides that it shall cover \u201call goods that have been sold prior to the date of this guaranty,\u201d and then proceeds with the words, \u201cand all goods sold and delivered on running account.\u201d If the parties had intended that these words should also be limited to a time \u201cprior to the date of this guaranty,\u201d it is difficult to understand why the parties should have specifically placed this limitation only on the first clause of the guaranty. In the second place, while the word \u201caccount\u201d has no definite technical meaning and is capable of a flexible use (see Goldstein v. Leibowitz, 157 N. Y. Supp. 905, decided herewith), yet when that word is coupled with the word \u201crunning\u201d I think it connotes an account which is not closed, but is a continuing account. Certainly it is quite open to this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">It follows that the judgment should be affirmed, with $25 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
