Stafford, 162 N. Y. 558, 57 N. E. 92), or, as seemingly conceded by both sides, if he was liable for such proportion of the November rent as was covered by his occupancy, then for about $95. On no possible theory can the judgment for $62.50 and $12 costs be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event.
