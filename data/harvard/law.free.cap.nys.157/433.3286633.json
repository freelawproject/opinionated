It was the duty of the International Railway Company to fence its tracks, and it was not relieved from that obligation as to the plaintiff by any arrangement it may have had with the Erie Company respecting tire maintenance of the fences; and the cow having been killed upon the tracks, and by the car, of the International Rail- ' way Company, it is liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs as to the defendant International Railway Company.
