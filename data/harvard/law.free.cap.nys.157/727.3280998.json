The judgment runs against Hirschman, appellant, for any de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ficiency not exceeding $16,210.04, although contractually he is not liable therefor, albeit he purchased the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Such result is based upon a finding that Hirschman by fraudulent representations obtained a release of an award against the city of New York for land covered by the mortgages. It was decided that as between Hirschman and the plaintiff and Ijams, mortgagees, the release is void, and that the mortgages are liens on the net amount ($16,210.04) which Hirschman received from the award, and the judgment makes him a debtor therefor, so far as necessary to pay any deficiency. The facts ar.e that the award was $32,000 and the first assessment $16,672. The court affirmed the award, but not the assessment. In that way, in May, 1911, the matter stood, except that the award, with interest, had become something over $40,000. The new assessment of $30,899.70 was finally reported on November 26, 1913, . and confirmed March 4, 1914. So at the time in question, May to August 3, 1911, the award stood and the assessment was still sub j udice. The finding is that in 1911 Hirschman represented fraudulently that there had been made an award of $30,000 and an assessment of $20,000; that he had arranged with the city to pay the assessment out of the award, and would pay the remaining $10,000 to plaintiff and Ijams\u2014$5,000 on account of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage for $16,000, and $5,000 to discharge Ijams\u2019 $5,000 mortgage. On August 3, 1911, Hirschman did make such payments, and receive the release from plaintiff and Ijams and an extension of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage and another mortgage held by Ijams, whereupon he drew the award subject to oilier assessments of $10,136.58 and to an attorney\u2019s lien for $4,038.57, which he paid, leaving him $16,210.04, the sum which, as decided, limits his personal liability for deficiency. The situation of affairs before the release on August 3, 1911, was as follows, disregarding accrued interest on mortgages and taxes on the premises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">First mortgage held by Williamsburgh Bank.....................$10,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s mortgage............................................. 16,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">Ijams\u2019 mortgage under foreclosure............................... 5,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">Ijams\u2019 mortgage................................................ 4,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">Total mortgage liens......................................$35,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">Award and interest.-................................$40,385 13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-11\">Attorney\u2019s lien...........................$ 4,038 51</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-12\">Other assessments....................... 10,136 58 14,175 09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-13\">Balance of award over assessments 26,210 04</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-15\">Excess of mortgage liens over award...................... 8,789 96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-16\">Present assessment not then made...............9......... 30,899 70</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-17\">Total liens on land $39,689 66</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">In other words, if the owners of the four mortgages, including the bank, could have settled with the city as Hirschman did, there would remain $8,789.96 due on all four mortgages, which would be subject to the assessment of $30,899.70. So, by applying on August 3, 1911, the net awards, the bank\u2019s mortgage would have been paid, and of the three inferior mortgages, aggregating $25,000, but $8,789.96 would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>have remained. By reason of the agreement made by Hirschman as above found, as well as through the release procured from the bank, the following resulted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">The hank\u2019s mortgage remained...................................$10,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">Plaintiffs mortgages of $16,000, by reason of $5,000 paid by appellant, were reduced to........................................13,000- 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">ljams\u2019 $5,000 was paid and her other mortgage remained at....... 4,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">Total mortgages..........................................$25,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">Assessments ............................................. 30,809 70</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-11\">Total liens...............................................$55,899 70</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">In other words, the mortgages are now $25,000, instead of $8,789.96, and the underlying assessment is the same, and all the mortgagees are the worse for the releases by the difference between such sums, or $16,210.04,\" but that difference relates to- all mortgage liens, including that of the bank. But $10,000 of that sum: would accrue to the bank $10,000 mortgage, which deducted leaves $6,210.04, and if Hirschman is liable for any deficiency that sum is the limit of it, rather than the sum of $16,210.84, as found by the court. The error in the finding is that it gives plaintiff and ljams the benefit of the whole net balance received by Hirschman\u2014that is $16,210.04\u2014whereas the amount of the bank mortgage should be deducted, whereupon there would remain $6,210.04, which is the sum 1 have found by a different method. Of course, the plaintiff could not reach a conclusion even as favorable as that, unless it can be inferred that all the mortgagees, having established their liens on the award, could have persuaded the city to pay it over to them in entire disregard of the new assessment to come, and which proved to be $30,899.70. But it is not to be assumed that the city would have favored Hirschman and not the mortgagees.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">The next question is whether, in this action, Hirschman can be made liable even to the extent of $6,210.04. The court has decided that the release was void as to Hirschman and plaintiff and ljams and valid as to the city. That is the practical result, but it may be added that the agreement between Hirschman and plaintiff and ljams is void. But that involves rescission, and requires the parties to be placed where they were. If that be done, the situation would be this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-14\">Plaintiffs and ljams\u2019 three mortgages, amount due...............$25,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-15\">Award .............................................$40,385 13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-16\">Attorney\u2019s lien..........................$ 4,038 51</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-17\">Other assessments....................... 10,136 58 14,175 09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-18\">$26,210' 04</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-19\">Bank\u2019s prior lien.............................. 10,000' 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-20\">Balance award................................$16,210 04</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-21\">\u2014which the plaintiff and ljams could use to pay on the assessment, or, if permitted,, draw and apply on the mortgage. But the mortgagees have $10,000 that Hirschman paid them by virtue of the contract, and that must be returned or allowed him out of the award collected by him. So the same result, $6,210.04, is reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The mortgages were extended. That cannot be undone. But it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>was to Hirschman\u2019s benefit. Hirschman cannot receive again the $750 paid to Mr. Henshaw, but that sum was to cover foreclosure costs and the attorney\u2019s labor in arranging the contract into which Hirschman led him. Hirschman cannot complain because he does not recover the legal expenses incurred in leading the opposite party into a fraudulent contract. The evidence sustains the finding of fraudulent representations. It comes near to inconceivable credulity on one hand and equal folly of statement on the other concerning an award in which the parties had interest, made in a legal proceeding affecting them all, and relative to an assessment therein in the course of adjudication\u2014 all matters of a public record, which, dutifully sought, would in a moment have dissipated confidence and revealed the truth. One may wonder at the faith of the attorneys without rejecting it, and credit the representation alleged to have been made by the appellant in view of his testimony and manner of giving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The judgment should be modified, so as to reduce the limit of appellant\u2019s liability to $6,210.04, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
