No incident or interruption is referred to or claimed to have occurred during the summation, and no appeal or intent to appeal to the judgment or authority of the court is even suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Under these special circumstances, the absence of the judge has happened to become merely casual, and does not, in our opinion, warrant reversal of a judgment which is otherwise entirely justified by the law and the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
