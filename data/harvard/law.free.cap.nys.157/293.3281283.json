The respondents, against whom he seeks a writ, are a committee of the board of education known as the committee on the care of buildings, and an employ\u00e9 o\u00ed the board known as the supervisor of janitors. Relator\u2019s complaint is that the respondents undertook to' transfer him from one school to another without possessing legal authority to make such a transfer. Hence he asks that they be compelled to reinstate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">It may be, as relator claims, that 'the committee on the care of buildings had no specific authority under the by-laws of the board of education to make the transfer; but it is not necessary to pass upon that question, because it appears that the action or attempted action on the part of that committee has been formerly ratified and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>firmed by the board of education itself, so that the validity of relator\u2019s transfer now rests not upon any action by the committee, but upon the action of the board. If, as relator insists, the committee had no power to transfer him in the first instance, it certainly has no power to retransfer him in the face of the action taken by the board, and he cannot have a mandamus to compel the committee to do what it has no power to do. If the committee has power, despite the action of the board of education to retransfer relator, it had power to transfer him in the first instance. So, in any event, he may not have a mandamus against the present respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">CLARKE, P. J., and SMITH and PAGE, JJ-, concur. DOWLING, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
