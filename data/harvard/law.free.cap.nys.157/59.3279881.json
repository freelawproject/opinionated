I think defendant\u2019s agents supposed, and had the right to suppose, that Purdy was the owner of the car. He did not disclose the fact that he was the agent or chauffeur for the owner. I think there is no sufficient evidence to support the verdict to the effect that Purdy, in moving the car onto the boat, acted as agent of defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
