On October 25, 1910, a notice of claim was served by plaintiff upon the defendant under the Employers\u2019 Liability Act (Consol. Laws, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204). On November 1, 1910, the action was commenced. The original complaint stated facts to bring the action under the Compulsory Compensation Law (Laws 1910, c. 674). On December 23, 1910, the defendant answered. On March 24, 1911, the Compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Compensation Law was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals. Ives v. South Buffalo Ry. Co., 201 N. Y. 271, 94 N. E. 431, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 162, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 156. On January 12, 1912, motion papers were served by the plaintiff to amend her complaint by setting up additional facts to make the Employers\u2019 Liability Act applicable. January 27, 1912, permission to so amend the complaint was granted. The defendant appealed from that order, contending that, if such amendment was allowed, it would permit the plaintiff to set up a new cause of action, which was barred under the Employers\u2019 Liability Act, requiring the action to be commenced within one year from tire death. But the order was affirmed by this court on October 2, 1912. 152 App. Div. 950, 137 N. Y. Supp. 1140. A year later, October, 1913, the action was brought to trial, and the jury disagreed. In April, 1915, the case came on for trial a second time. In the meantime the question had been settled that the federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act was paramount and exclusive. 35 Stat. 65, c. 149, as amended by 36 Stat. 291, c. 143 (U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 1322, 1324); Mondou v. N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 223 U. S. 1, 32 Sup, Ct. 169, 56 L. Ed. 327, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Taylor v. Taylor, 232 U. S. 363, 34 Sup. Ct. 350, 58 L. Ed. 638, reversing sub nom. Matter of Taylor, 204 N. Y. 135, 97 N. E. 502, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">At the opening of this trial plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked to amend the complaint by setting forth the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was injured while engaged in interstate commerce. The defendant objected, and the application was denied; the trial judge saying that he did not see how it makes any difference whether it is amended or not. The defendant later conceded that the trades at the crossing and place where the .intestate met his death were regularly used daily for the hauling of freight and express and passengers from a point without the state to points east and west of the state, and that freight, passengers, and express were hauled from one state to another over these tracks. However, that concession was made with the distinct statement that it was not to be regarded as in any way waiving the defendant\u2019s objection to the evidence as incompetent and inadmissible under the pleadings and immaterial in the case; counsel for the defendant explicitly stating that the concession was only to be regarded the same as though the plaintiff had called a witness and asked these questions, and tire defendant had taken objections and exceptions, to which statement the trial judge assented.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> If the facts are as stated, the action cannot be maintained under tire state law, because they show that tire deceased workman at the time of his injuries and death was engaged in interstate commerce and was so employed by- the defendant. In such a case the federal act is paramount and exclusive, and tire question of the defendant\u2019s liability must be determined by that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> It often happens that it is to the advantage of the defendant to have its liability determined under the state law rather than the federal act, or that the question is not raised by the pleadings or otherwise on the trial. In such a case it may well be that a defendant will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>not be heard to raise the question for the first time in the appellate court. Tyndall v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 162 App. Div. 920, 146 N. Y. Supp. 1115; Id., 213 N. Y. 691, 107 N. E. 577. A witness may incidentally testify to\u00a1 something which is not material to the issue and the testimony left undisputed, when if the testimony had been pertinent to the issue being tried it would have been disputed. Under such circumstances it would manifestly be unjust to give full effect to the testimony, regardless of the issues made by the pleadings and the theory upon which the case was tried; but where, as here, the plaintiff relies upon the federal statute, but fails to allege facts to bring herself within its provisions, and objection is made and the question properly raised, I think she is not entitled to give proof of such unpleaded facts. The employment of the workman by the defendant in interstate commerce, and the fact of his being so engaged under such employment at the time of his injuries, are material to a cause of action under the federal act, and may be put in issue by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I am not aware that the precise question has been decided in this state by the appellate courts. There are expressions in some of the opinions in other jurisdictions which perhaps tend to support the contrary conclusion. I shall not collate the cases or analyze the decisions. I think the rule laid down in Thornton\u2019s Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (3d Ed.) \u00a7 201, is supported by reason and authority. It is there said:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cTo recover under <em>the </em>statute it <em>must be </em>shown by the pleading <em>that the </em>employs plaintiff was at tlie time of his injury engaged in interstate commerce, and also that the defendant was a common carrier by railroad at the same time, in the transaction wherein the omploy\u00f3 was injured, likewise engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
