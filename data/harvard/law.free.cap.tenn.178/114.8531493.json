Justice Chambliss</author>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The company appeals from a judgment awarding\u2019 compensation for an injury to the thumb. The employment of petitioner was conceded, also that he received the injury in the course of his employment. It is also conceded that he was entitled to compensation for several weeks of time lost as the result of this injury. It is further agreed that this amounted to the sum of $50.70, being 501 per cent of his wages for this period, and the company tendered this sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">However, the company complains of the finding by the trial court that petitioner had suffered a 15 per cent permanent disability on account of this thumb injury and was entitled to recover on this basis for the remainder of the period of sixty weeks fixed by Section 6878, paragraph (c) of the Code for the loss of a thumb; the judgment thus arrived at, including the $50.70 tendered for the weeks of total disability, being $147.84. The insistence is that there is no material evidence to support this additional allowance, that neither the thumb, nor any substantial portion of it was severed, that the injury was to the flesh tip only and does not affect at all the wage-earning capacity of petitioner, who resumed, after his lay off, 'and continues to discharge his former duties at the same wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We find no dispute on the record as to the material and controlling facts. Petitioner stated that the flesh end of his thumb was split open and a portion of the flesh cut off, that since it had healed \u201calmost a quarter of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>inch\u201d was gone. He stated that his work was running a motor, that he was performing the same work as before and had been receiving the same wages. On original examination he had said he conld not pick up anything as well as before with that hand. However, on cross-examination he is asked more specifically about this. We quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cQ. Mr. Apperson, since you have returned to work your wages are exactly the same as they were before you were off? A. Yes sir-.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cQ. You are performing the same service, on the same job, and drawing the same pay as you did before the injury? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cQ. You state in the operation of the motor that there is a coupling* pin? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201cQ. Did you pick that up before your injury? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201cQ\u00a1. Since you have returned to work on July 24th, 1940, you have performed the same service? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">\u201cQ. You still pick up the pin? A. Not with that hand for two months after I returned, used this one (Indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">\u201cQ. At the present time you use either hand? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>At the time of the injury, and when you went to the doctor \u2014 you said the nail was all off? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">\u201cQ. I believe there is a nail on the left thumb at the present time? A. Hardly as large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">\u201cQ. Hardly, but almost as large as this finger ?' (Indicating) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-15\">\u201cQ. So far as you know, you have no injury to the joint? A. Not as I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-16\">\u201c Q. You are now working your joint? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u00a3\u00a3Q'. That is as good as it was before? A. Can\u2019t tell any difference in the working of the joint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">\u00a3\u00a3Q. Ton were examined by the doctor, and there was no injury to the bone? A. He said he didn\u2019t think there was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">It seems that when he spoke of inability to \u201cpick up\u201d things, the witness was referring to the condition before the wound healed and not to a permanent or even present disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A doctor, the only other witness, also described the injury as to the fleshy portion of the thumb tip, a small portion severed, leaving a scar. He said there was no injury to the bone. We quote the concluding portion of this doctor\u2019s examination, in the course of which he was questioned by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u00a3\u00a3Q. Would you say he had a good recovery? A. Yes, very good recovery, some loss here in front, where its cut off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">\u201cQ. Of the flesh of the thumb ? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">\u00a3\u00a3Court: Has he got any disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">\u201cWitness: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">\u201cCourt: What per cent of disability would you say he has to this thumb ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">\u201cWitness: Don\u2019t know, but where you have this cut off you have some disability. (Indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">\u201cCourt: You would not be able to specify the per cent of disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-14\">\u201cWitness: No sir, I would not know how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">\u201cBy Mr. Ladd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-16\">\u00a3\u00a3Q. Assuming the man now does the same work and draws the same wages, would you say he has any disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-17\">\u201cMr. Brown: Object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-18\">\u201cCourt: Sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cMr. Ladd: We want that in the record if yon please. We except to the ruling of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201cBy Mr. Ladd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cQ. Assuming the man now has the same job, and draws the same wages, would you say he has any disability?' A. Grot this disability- \u2014 this part of the finger is cut off. (Indicating) This part of the finger right through here, this fleshy part of the finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201cBy Judge Cassell: Of the thumb?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201cWitness: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Counsel for petitioner comment and quote from the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">\u201cThe Court compensated the petitioner according to the schedule and limitations prescribed in Section 6878 of the Code, subsection (c). This section of the code specifically fixes compensation for the loss of a thumb at 60 weeks, and for permanent partial disability the statute provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\u201c \u2018In cases of permanent partial disability due to injury to a member resulting in less than total loss of use of such member not otherwise compensated in this schedule, compensation shall be paid at the prescribed rate during that part of the time specified in the schedule for the total loss or total loss of use of the respective member, which the extent of injury to the member bears to its total loss.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">By analogy to the rule applicable where there has been the loss of a thumb, or other member, or of limbs or eyes, counsel say, and the- trial court held, that the question of whether, or to what extent there has been a loss in fact of earning capacity is foreclosed by the terms of the statute, which fixes definitely the compensation in any one of such cases; that when, as here, there has been a loss of any portion of a member, here the thumb, compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>sation is to be allowed in proportion to the dismemberment or loss, without regard to resultant impairment of use, or earning value; that the rule applicable to the whole, applies proportionately to any part.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">This argument seems to us to fail on principle. The Legislature saw fit to fix definitely and remove from the realm of debate this issue of the measure of resultant loss of earning capacity in the specific cases enumerated, in all of which cases it is certain that some degree of permanent impairment of usefulness will ensue. But the paragraph of the statute above quoted and relied on by counsel is dealing with \u201cdisability due to injury to a member resulting in less than total loss of use of such member\u201d and in fixing compensation for such loss on the facts of each arising case while the prescribed rate during the time specified in the schedule is to be followed, the extent of the injury must be looked to in determining what loss of use has resulted. And, in fixing compensation for this loss of use, there comes into play a principle which underlies the Compensation Law. Code, section 6851 et seq. In the early days of this legislation this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cThe principle underlying this legislation is substitution of compensatory income for loss of earning capacity, proportioned to the loss of the contributory income earning power of the particular member or faculty injured. If the hand is so injured that it can no longer contribute to the employee\u2019s income earning capacity, then, whether servered or not, however injured there is total disability as to the hand. And so of other members and faculties.\u201d <em>Hartford Hosiery Mills </em>v. <em>Jenigan, </em>149 Tenn., 241, 243, 259 S. W., 546, 547, 32 A. L. R., 563.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">And see the recent case of <em>Key </em>v. <em>Briar Hill Collieries, </em>167 Tenn., 229, 68 S. W. (2d), 115, to the same effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Indeed, in the next sentence following the language quoted as above by counsel from the act it is provided that, \u201cIf an injured employee refuses employment suitable to his capacity, ... he shall not be entitled to any compensation,\u201d etc., thus plainly implying application of the principle that it is loss of use resulting in loss of earning capacity that the statute is intended to provide compensation for.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Now there is a loss here of some part of this member, although small, and a loss of the use of this small part has resulted from the injury, but we think it clear that this loss of use involves no \u201closs of the contributory income earning power of the particular member or faculty injured\u201d and for such a loss of use no compensation is provided by the act. At most we find here only a minor mutilation and such an injury the law does not cover. <em>Hartford Accident </em>&amp; <em>Idemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>159 Tenn., 202, 17 S. <em>W. </em>(2d), 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The judgment will be modified so as to limit the recovery to the amount of the tender. The costs will be adjudged against petitioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
