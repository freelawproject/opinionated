In construing the statute this court, speaking, through Chief Justice G-bee\u00ae-, in <em>Trotter and Arnold </em>v. <em>State, </em>158 Tenn., 264, 268, 269, 12 S. W. (2d), 951, 952, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u2018 \u2018 It seems to us from the terms employed that section 1 was a prohibition against organizing, joining, or remaining a member of any association or society, bearing any name, or formed upon any pretext whatsoever, which contemplated taking human life, inflicting corporal punishment, or doing the other things enumerated. By \u2018 conspiracy or combination . . . under any name,\u2019 the statute indicated an organization with a special designation, such as the White Caps or Night Riders, although membership in an organization formed \u2018upon any pretext whatsoever \u2019 and having in view any of the unlawful purposes set out was equally denounced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cThe Legislature had in mind a conspiracy, combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tion, or organization with an existence more or less protracted. This is made plain by section 2, in which it is declared a felony for any person \u2018to procure or encourage anyone to become or remain a member of such unlawful conspiracy or combination. \u2019 Continuous existence of the conspiracy or combination, before and after the connection of any one conspirator, was thus recognized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cA separate provision was furthermore made in section 2 for the punishment of any person who aided or abetted in the accomplishment of any purpose or end of such conspiracies or combinations; that is, membership in such a conspiracy or combination was one crime, and aiding or abetting the combination or conspiracy in accomplishing any of its illegal purposes another distinct crime. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The statute is aimed at organization created for the purpose of taking human life, or engaging in acts reasonably calculated to cause the loss of life, or to burn or otherwise destroy property or to feloniously take the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">There is no testimony that the organization to which defendants belong was created for the purpose of doing the specific things denounced by the statute. In the brief filed on behalf of the State it is said: \u201cThe State does not for an instant say that the United Mine Workers of America had anything whatsoever to do with this crime. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">There was a second count in the indictment which charged the defendants with making an assault upon the body of Archie Sharp with force and arms and with intent to commit murder in the first degree. This is the count upon which the iS'tate should have relied for a conviction. The jury, however, convicted the defendants upon the first count, their verdict being that the defendants \u201care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>guilty as charged in the indictment for conspiracy,\u201d the effect of this verdict being\u2019 to acquit the defendants of the crime set forth in the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">From what we have said, it follows that the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the defendants discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
