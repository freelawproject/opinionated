We have examined the questions, raised by the appellant in the light of the authorities cited in his brief, but we are unable to discover that the statute is in violation of any provision of the constitution of this state or of the United States. The act commands the payment of the sum named at a given time, without any other conditions than may be implied from, the fact that the Richmond Hook &amp; Ladder Company is authorized by law to continue to discharge the duties for which it was organized until a paid department shall be provided; and the refusal of the comptroller to pay the sum, unless upon an accounting for the like sum paid in the year 1901 under the same statute, was not justified by anything contained in the law. Volunteer fire companies are recognized as discharging a municipal function, and it is a legitimate use of municipal funds to pay such organizations, the same as\" it is to pay for a fire protection afforded b)r a paid department. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-18\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1059-19\">\"WILLARD BARTLETT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AxJj\">concurs in result, being of opinion that the right to payment may be deemed conditional upon the continued rendition of services by the volunteer companies respectively.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
