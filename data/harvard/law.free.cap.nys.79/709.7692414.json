His counsel was absent from the county on his wedding trip when the original motion was returnable, and the brief time (two days) allowed by the learned special term in the appellant\u2019s absence proved entirely unavailing for a proper exhibition of his side of the controversy on the merits. We think he should be allowed his day in court, and that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $io costs and disbursements, and the motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
