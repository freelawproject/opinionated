Orders duly made by the railroad commissioners within their statutory authority to regulate the maintenance and operation of railroads as common carriers, may be enforced in appropriate proceedings, when they are not shown to be illegal or unreasonable. Such orders when duly made under authority conferred are by statute made <em>prima facie </em>reasonable and just; and the burden is upon the respondent to clearly show that they are unreasonable in their terms or in their practical operation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-11\">2. In mandamus proceedings to enforce an order of the railroad commissioners duly made within the authority conferred requiring a railroad company to furnish designated facilities for the accommodation of passengers and shippers at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>station on its line of railroad, the main question to be determined is not whether the relators erred in their finding on the facts upon which they acted in making the order involved here, but whether the relators as railroad commissioners in making the order exceeded their authority or abused their official discretion to the substantial injury of the respondents\u2019 constitutional property rights.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-5\">3. When acting within the authority conferred upon them, a wide discretion is accorded to the railroad commissioners, and their valid orders, rules and regulations should be made effective as contemplated by the constitution and statutes. The statutes expressly provides that the authorized rules and regulations of the railroad commissioners \u201cshall be deemed and held <em>prima facie </em>reasonable and justand when action is taken by the commissioners in the exercise of their undoubted authority, their administrative discretion will not be controlled by the courts and their regulations will be made effective in appropriate proceedings where an abuse of discretion is not clearly shown in unreasonable and arbitrary action taken.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>4. </em>In determining whether a rate, rule, regulation or order of the Railroad Commission upon a subject within its authority is so unreasonable and arbitrary as to be illegal and unenforceable, the court, in deference to the governmental functions conferred by law upon the commissioners, will not only require the <em>prima facies </em>of reasonableness impressed by the statute upon the rate, rule, regulation or order to be overcome by admission or proofs, but will require the admissions or proofs of facts tending to show unreasonableness to be clear and convincing, every reasonable doubt being yielded in favor of the rate, rule, regulation or order.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-7\">5. To afford reasonably adequate facilities at its own stations is an absolute duty of the carrier; and the burden of furnishing such facilities does not invade the respondent\u2019s property rights, when the requirements are not in fact unreasonable and arbitrary.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Original proceedings in Mandamus by the State.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b99-5\">Peremptory writ will issue.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-6\"><em>F.

That thereafter, on to-wit, the 23rd day of January, 1913, at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, pursuant to said notice, the Railroad Commissioners being then and there duly in session at Peters aforesaid, the said Florida East Coast Railway Company then and there appearing by its attorney, and the petitioners in the said matter appearing in their own behalf.

But the cir-circumstances of this case develop the fact that Peters, as a station was established about the sanie time as the one' at Perrine, and having veen voluntarily established by the said company ought to be provided with proper and adequate facilities for the accommodation of patrons of the said station;</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The said Railroad Commissioners do further find that the facilities now maintained and heretofore maintained at Peters as aforesaid are inadequate and insufficient for the proper accommodations of patrons of the said railway company desiring to use the said station;</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">It is therefore considered, ordered and adjudged that the Florida East Coast Railway Company be and it is hereby required to provide at Peters, Florida, aforesaid additional side track facilities by providing a side track or side tracks of at least double the capacity of the side track now and heretofore maintained;</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">And that said railroad company be required to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>vide at said point an adequate and suitable depot building to contain two waiting rooms, one for each color, each of which shall have at least eighty (80) square feet of floor space, and a wareroom for freight to have at least four hundred (400) square feet of floor space;</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">And it is recommended by the said Commissioners, not required, that the said depot building should be so constructed that it may be utilized in the future for the purposes of an agency station;</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">And it is further ordered that the work on the said sidetrack shall be completed on or before the 15th day of March, 1913, and that the work on the said depot building shall be begun on or before the 15th day of March, 1913, and shall be prosecuted with all reasonable speed and completed on or before the 15th day of April, 1913;</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">It is further ordered that the application of petitioners for an order requiring the installation of an agent at Peters- be and the same is hereby deferred to such time as the Commissioners may deem it proper to reopen this said question upon notice to the parties at interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">Done and ordered by the Railroad Commissioners of the State of Florida in open session at their office in the City of Tallahassee, this 15th day of February, 1913.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-9\">R.'HUDSON BURR,</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-10\">Chairman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-11\">6.

That the said Florida East' Coast Railway Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>pany has disregarded and failed and refused to obey the said Order No. 389, as above set forth, in that the said railway company has not provided at Peters aforesaid additional sidetrack facilities by providing a. sidetrack or sidetracks of at least double the capacity of the sidetrack now and heretofore maintained at said station, as required in and by said Order No. 389, and did not complete the work on the said sidetrack on or before the 15th day of March, 1913, as required in and by said Order No, 389, and has not yet begun the same; and in that the said company did not begin and has not yet begun the construction at said point of an adequate and suitable depot building to contain two waiting-rooms, one for each color, each having at least eighty (80) square feet of floor space, and a ware-room for freight having at least four hundred (400) square feet of floor space; but on the contrary the said company has failed and refused and still continues to refuse so to do, in disregard of the orders of the Railroad Commissioners aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">8.

I. Peters, and his successor in interest of the packing house located at said point, viz: T. J. Peters, who is now the lessee and occupant of the packing house at said siding, and who has exclusive right to the use of the siding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-12\">Respondent further shows that on February 15, 1914, W. I. Peters entered into a contract with the respondent for the building of a sidetrack sufficient to accommodate eleven cars, and also for the right to use certain land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>adjacent thereto, upon which to build a packing house, and it was provided in and by said lease, among other things, that said siding should be for the exclusive use of the said W. I. Peters, and that it might, at any time, be discontinued by the lessor, and that tlie lessor should not be obliged to stop any of its trains at sad siding and that the lessee should not permit others to use the premises or any structure thereon; the original of said lease being attached hereto and made a part hereof and marked Exhibit \u201cA.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">Respondent further represents that subsequent to the date of the execution of said lease the said T. J. Peters succeeded by purchase or otherwise to the inter est of the said W. I. Peters, and took the same subject to the contractual relation existing between this respondent and said W. I. Peters, and that since the acquisition of the rights of W. I. Peters by T. J. Peters the aunual rental of one dollar per annum was paid by said T. J. Peters down to and inclusive of February, 1912, and that since said date the said T. J. Peters has failed and refused to pay said rent and has been occupying the premises of respondent as a tenant at sufferance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">Respondent further answering says that it has offered on various occasions to increase the sidetrack facilties at Peter\u2019s Siding for the benefit of said T. J. Peters, and has only imposed the responsible condition that said T. J. Peters should pay for the cost of installing such additional facilities and that this is a reasonable and just custom of respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">Respondent further Answering the alternative writ, and particularly that portion of the order of the Railroad Commission, which finds that a non-agency station has been established for eight years last past, denies that a non-agency station has been maintained at Peter\u2019s Siding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>for eight years last past, or any portion thereof, or that it has received, or offered to receive, freight in carload and less than carload quantities, except for the lessee under its contract, or delivered or offered to deliver freight in carload or less than carload lots, except for lessee, or for persons using the private siding with the permission of the lessee. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">Respondent further avers that for the year ending December 31st, 1912, the following freight shipments left Peter\u2019s Siding, shipped by the following named consignees, viz: T. J. Peters, 673 tons; O. R. Graham, wood 73 .tons; Parrish &amp; Gauthier, wood 564 tons; Charles Penny, miscellaneous 2 tons; and that the total shipments from said station, other than those of T. J. Peters, who is the lessee, and for whose benefit the siding is maintained, was 637 tons of wood, of a total revenue value to respondent of $490.40 ,and a miscellaneous tonnage of two tons of the revenue value of $5.95; that that portion of the finding of the Railroad Commission, in which it is stated that a station has been voluntarily established and maintained, denies that the same is true, and, on the contrary, it alleges, as hereinbefore alleged, that Peter\u2019s Siding is not a station and never has been, and is only a private siding with the right reserved to respondent to, at any time, discontinue the same and remove its rails and facilities; that said Peter\u2019s Siding is located nine-tenths of a mile from Perrine, an agency station, at which there is maintained sidings more than sufficient to accommodate all the traffic offered or received within a territory of many miles surrounding it, and that it maintains also at said Perrine a depot with ample freight and passenger accommodatons, and that it also maintains at said station a station agent, who is on duty twelve months in each year; that south of Peter\u2019s Siding, about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>two and one-half to three miles distant, there is maintained the regular agency station of Goulds, at which there are ample siding facilities and freight and passenger accommodations, and a regularly maintained agent, more than sufficient to accommodate all freight received or offered from the territory for many miles contiguous thereto; that it denies that there is any public necessity for the increase of its private siding, or for the building of a freight and passenger depot, and it respectfully represents unto the court in explanation of the reason why no increased sidetrack facilities are necessary, or the building of any freight and passenger depot, that within a territory beginning immediately north of Perrine and extending to within one-half mile north of Goulds, the station south of Peter\u2019s Siding, which territory is approximately three miles north to south and nine and one-half miles east to west, there is under cultivation on this date approximately the following acreage, to-wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">Citrus Fruit ..........................................................................................257 acres;</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">Tomatoes, which acreage may vary from year to year ...............................................................................................751 acres;</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-8\">Peppers ......................................................................................................... 4 acres;</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-9\">Beans .............................................................................................................05 acres;</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-10\">Potatoes ...................................................................................................... 5 acres;</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-11\">and that out of the acreage of Citrus and tropical fruit, not all of which is bearing, more than fifty per cent, is as close to Perine or to Gould\u2019s as to Peter\u2019s Siding; that of the tomatoes, approximately 450 acres of the total is owned by T. J. Peters, and that of the total acreage, approximately seventy-five per cent is as close to Perrine as to Goulds, except that of T. J. Peters, as to Peter\u2019s Siding; that the seasons are so uncertain that the acreage herein given is, by no means permanent, and that for the present season T. J. Peters and other shippers in the neigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>borhood will have no crops whatever to ship, by reason of floods, and this condition is liable to occur, judging from the past experiences, one season out of each three years. That within the territory mentioned there are approximately eighty-two dwelling houses, two school houses, no churches, no stores, and five packing houses; that of the total number of dwellings that only seven are as close to Peter\u2019s Siding as to- Goulds or Perrine. That there are no school, houses, no churches, and ho stores at Peter\u2019s Siding ,and that out of the total number of packing houses of five, only those as close to Peter\u2019s Siding as to Perrine or Goulds are owned by T. J. Peters, the lessee of the respondent; that at the time the said private siding was established the country contiguous to Peter\u2019s Siding was wild, uncultivated and had no hard road facilities, over which said W. I. Peters and T. J. Peters coukl transport their freight, but that since said private siding was established there have been opened to*the public 23.2 miles of public roads, all of which lead from Perrine, Goulds and from the adjacent territory into the main road, and of this total mileage 12.5 are rocked or hard-surfaced, and that all of the shippers in the above described territory can, with equal facility and at the loss of only a few minutes, reach Goulds or Perrine as well as Peter\u2019s Siding. A map of said territory is referred to and prayed to be made a part hereof if necessary; that the building of additional sidetrack facilities and a station building for the accommodation of the few inhabitants contiguous to Peter\u2019s Siding and for the freight received or transported would work a great hardship upon respondent, for the reason that the revenue derived from the business of the general public would not, by any means, justify the large expenditures necessary to build said siding and said station building, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>that it would result in an annual loss to respondent to maintain such station so close to other stations already equipped ' and maintained; that there are now several hundred regular stops for trains between Key West and Jacksonville, and that to equip and maintain a station at Peter\u2019s Siding so near to other stations would be discrimination against the general shipping public contrary to the laws of the Unted States, and would greatly interfere with the schedules of respondent\u2019s trains, particularly of freight trains carrying perishable products and engaging in carrying interstate commerce; that each and every allegation in the alternative writ not admitted is hereby expressly denied.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">Issue was joined on this answer, and the cause was-submitted to the court at the January Term, 1914, on the testimony taken and briefs filed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-6\">Whitfield, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASS\">\n<em>(After stating the facts.)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">This proceeding in mandamus is to enforce an order of the Railroad Commissioners requiring the respondent railroad company to provide specified depot buildings for freight and passenger accommodation and also additional sidetracks at a place called \u201cPeters\u201d on respondent\u2019s line of railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Orders duly made by the Railroad Commissioners within their statutory authority to regulate the maintenance and operation of railroads as common carriers, may be enforced in appropriate proceedings, when they are not shown to be illegal or unreasonable. Such orders when duly made under authority conferred are by statute made <em>prima facie </em>reasonable and just; and the burden is upon the respondent to clearly show that they are unreasonable in their terms or in their practical operation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>See State <em>ex rel. </em>Railroad Comm\u2019rs v.

Rep. 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The relators contend in effect that the place called \u201cPeters\u201d has been for a number of years a non-agency station on the respondent\u2019s railroad, at which local passenger trains have been accustomed to stop on flag, and at which freight has been received and delivered in carload and less than carload quantities; that the station having been voluntarily established by the respondent, such station should be provided with proper and adequate facilities for the accommodation of 'the patrons of the station; and that the facilities now afforded at the station are inadequate and those demanded by the order here sought to be enforced are reasonably required for the convenience of the patrons of the station. For the respondent it is insisted that * * * the siding at Peters was put in under special contract for the use of one shipper there, who now \u201cdesires more sidetrack facilities for his personal use,\u201d and that apart from this shipper \u201cthere would be no necessity even for the stopping of trains at Peters Siding for freight or passengers, and that there is no necessity for station facilities at this point,\u201d and further that an observance of the order would entail an annual expense upon the respondent not justified by the business done at the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The main question to be determined in this mandamus proceeding is not whether the relators erred in their finding on the facts upon which they acted in making the order involved here; but whether the relators as railroad commissioners in making the order exceeded their authority or abused their official discretion ro the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>stantial injury of the respondent\u2019s constitutional property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">By statute the Railroad Commissioners are authorized \u201cto require the establishment of such freight and passenger depots as the condition of the road, safety and convenience of passengers and prompt delivery of freight and the most convenient transfer of passengers and freight may justify,\u201d \u201cto require any * common carrier to properly operate its railroad or transportation line and to furnish all the necessary facilities for the convenient and prompt handling, transportation and delivery of all freights offered along its line for transportation, and shall provide and prescribe all such rules and regulations as may be necessary to secure such operation and the furnishing of such facilities and the prompt handling, transportation and delivery of all freights offered.\u201d Paragraphs 2893, 2896, Gen. Stats. of 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">When acting within the authority conferred upon them, a wide discretion is accorded to the Railroad Commissioners, and their valid orders, rules and regulations should be made effective as contemplated by the constitution and the statutes. The statute expressly provides that the authorized rules and regulations of the Railroad Commissioners \u201cshall be deemed and held <em>prima facie </em>reasonable and just;\u201d and when action is taken by the commissioners in the exercise of their undoubted authority, their administrative discretion will not be controlled by the courts and their regulations will be made effective in appropriate proceedings where an abuse of discretion is not clearly shown in unreasonable and arbitrary action taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">A railroad common carrier may, in addition to the facilities and accommodations already furnished, be required to render a particular service that it is essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tially the duty of the carrier to do for the reasonable convenience of its patrons among the public, and to meet the reasonable requirements of the public service undertaken. Even though such a particular duty if enforced Avould be in itself unremunerative and burdensome, such a result would be an incident to the service voluntarily undertaken, in consideration of the franchises permitted to be used for the public good, and the property rights of the carrier would not thereby be unlaAA\u2019fully invaded, if the particular service Is reasonably necessary for the public convenience, and the burden to the carrier has some fair relation to the benefits accruing to the public, and the burden of the particular service, considered with reference to the entire business of the carrier, does not in reality amount to a denial to the carrier of a reasonable compensation for the service rendered by it as an entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">If the performance of a particular useful, but nonessential duly will as- a part of a general public- service contribute to the public convenience, the fact that the particular service must be rendered at a loss, does not, in view of the nature of the duty reuqirea, excuse nonperformance, but the loss occasioned by the performance of the particular duty may be considered in determining the reasonableness of the order requiring the particular service to be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In determining Avhether a rate, rule, regulation or order of the Railroad Commission upon a subject within its authority is so unreasonable and arbitrary as to be illegal and unenforceable, the court, in deference to the governmental functions conferred by laAV upon the Commissioners, will not only require the <em>prima facies, </em>of reasonableness impressed by the statute upon the rate, rule, regulation or order to be overcome by admission or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>proofs, but will require the admissions or proofs of facts tending to show unreasonableness to be clear and convincing, every reasonable doubt being yielded in favor of the rate, rule, regulation or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The reasonableness of a rate, rule, regulation or order of the Railroad Commissioners is to be determined by a consideration of the rights of ail parties directly and materially affected by the rate, rule, regulation or order. This involves\u2019 a consideration of all the facts and circumstances \u2019by\u2019 such appropriate processes and standards of reasoning and computation as are afforded by law or by common experience and the dictates of right and justice. State <em>ex rel., </em>Railroad Comm\u2019rs v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 62 Fla. 315, 57 South. Rep. 175; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. N. C. Corporation Commission, 206 U. S. 1, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">To afford reasonabty adequate facilities at its own stations is an absolute duty of the carrier, and the burden of furnishing such facilities does not invade the respondent\u2019s property rights, when the requirements are not in fact unreasonable and arbitrary. See Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Railroad Comm\u2019rs, 63 Fla. 491, 58 South. Rep. 543. Where the requirement is not. among the carrier\u2019s absolute duties, the expense to be incurred may be one of the controlling considerations. See Oregon R. &amp; Nav. Co. State of Washington <em>ex rel. </em>v. Fairchild, 224 U. S. 510, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">A proper test is not whether the facilities required by the order ai\u2019e in fact <em>necessary, </em>but whether they are reasonable for the convenience and safety of the public to be served, and the expense to the carrier is not so unreasonably out of proportion to the convenience afforded to the public as to impose an unlawful burden upon the carrier. Ro question of confiscation is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Tbe testimony shows that only a few persons are to be served at present as shippers or as passengers at Peters, which is less than a mile from another station, and that the expense of observing the order would exceed the receipts at the station from all others except the principal patron for whom the siding was put in under special contract. The carrier now uses Peters as a non-agency station. It is within the authority and lawful discretion of the Railroad Commission to require appropriate and adequate depot and sidetrack facilities at such point, and while the order is perhaps an extreme one, it does not clearly appear from the evidence that, the requirements: sought to be enforced in this proceeding are in cost and extent so out of proportion to the public benefit and so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to an abuse of official authority or discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The future may justify the requirement; and it is within the province and duty of the Railroad Commissioners and the carrier to anticipate the reasonable requirements of prospective growth of the business done by the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">A peremptory writ will issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-7\">Shackleford, C.
