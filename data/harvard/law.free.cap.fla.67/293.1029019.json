D. Beekman, of Washington, in the District of Columbia, brings this, his bill, against the Sonntag Investment Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of some one of the United States other than the State of Florida, and having an office and doing business in'Evansville, Indiana, and at Seabreeze, in the County of Volusia and State of Florida. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">And thereupon your orator complains and says, that said Sonntag Investment Company on the 11th day of June, 1908, being, or pretending to be, seized and possessed in fee simple of the following described real property, .situate, lying and being in the County of Volusia and State of Florida, to-wit: Lots Two (2) and Three (3), Block Forty-five (45), and Lots Two (2), Four (4) and Six (6), Block Forty-two (42), according to the map of East Daytona of record in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Volusia County, Florida, in Map Book Two, page one hundred and six (106), entered in a written agreement with your orator by which it sold your orator said lots and your orator paid therefor the sum of One Dollar, the receipt whereof was acknowledged by said Sonntag Investment Company, and agreed to give said Company a bill of sale for the auxiliary yacht \u2018Crystal Wave.\u2019 Said written agreement was signed \u2018Sonntag Investment Co., A. I. Miller, Resident Agent,\u2019 and \u2018D. 1). Beekman;\u2019 was witnessed by H. G. Wilson and John W. Williams, who signed their names as subscribing witnesses thereto, and was acknowledged by the said A. I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Miller as resident agent, and by your orator on said 11th clay of June, 1908, and was filed for record and recorded according to law on the 20th day of August, 1908, in Book 45 of Deeds at page 486 of the records of Yolusia County, Florida, as by the original of said instrument in possession of your orator, with its certificates of acknowledgment and record will more fully appear, and which your orator is ready to produce in court when required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">(2) Your orator further shows unto your Honor that within a few days after the execution of said written agreement he delivered said yacht \u2018Crystal Wave\u2019 to said Sonntag Investment Company (who have used the same as their own property and had said yacht altered from an auxiliary yacht to a launch), and would have given said company a bill of sale of said yacht had they required it, but your orator was informed by the Customs authorities that said yacht being under twenty tons measurement had been dropped from registry and that no bill of sale was necessary but that title to her would pass by delivery of possession as in case of other personal property, and your orator communicated such information to the agents and officers of said company and they did not require a bill of sale. Your orator however, to comply literally with said contract on his part has executed a bill of sale of said yacht which is filed in the court with this bill of complaint and tendered to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">(3) Your orator further shows unto your Honor that in October, 1908, one W. L. Sonntag, the treasurer, and at that time the local manager of said company at Sea-breeze, Florida, explained to your orator that a mistake had been made in the description of one of the lots sold and wrote on the top of said contract \u2014 \u2018Lot No. 3B No. 42 to be substituted for lot No. 2B. No. 42\u2019 and your orator accepted such amendment of said contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>(4) And your orator shows unto your Honor that he has fully complied with his part of said contract by delivering to defendant said yacht 'Crystal Wave/ but the defendant refused to make him a conveyance by deed of said lots Two (2) and Three (3) of Block Forty-five (4o) and Lots Three1 (3), Four (4) and Six (6) of Block Forty-two (42) of East Daytona upon his request and claim that said A. I. Miller, who signed said contract, had no authority and never was an agent of said company further than that he received commission for selling various lots, but your orator says that said Miller had a sign on the office of the Sonntag Investment Company at Sea-breeze, stating that he1 was its resident agent; that on the 15th day of June, 1908, said company contracted to deed him lot 3 of Block 18 of East Daytona for $500 and took his note due in one year for $450.00 of said price and demanded payment of said note on its maturity through the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Daytona, thus recognizing the validity of said contract although it is signed 'Sonntag Investment Company by A. I. Miller, resident agent/ and by your orator precisely as in the contract which said company now seek to repudiate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-5\">(5) Your orator further shows unto your Honor that at the time said agreement was under consideration Mr. Miller, Mr. W. L. Sonntag, Mr. M. L. Waggoner and your orator were together at the office of the Sonntag Investment Company at Seabreeze; that both Mr. Sonntag and Mr. Waggoner were directors of said company and Mr. Sonntag was manager at Seabreeze, although he has recently been succeeded in that position by Mr. Wag-goner; that it was decided to take the Crystal Wave in trade for said lots and Mr. Sonntag told Mr. Miller to make out the contract, in your orator\u2019s presence, and Mr. Miller drew a contract, which on reading, your orator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>rejected, as it was in the form of an option; thereupon Mr. Sonntag said to Mr. Miller, \u2018You have power of attorney and can fix this up with the Doctor tomorrow,\u2019 and thereupon your orator was led to believe that said Miller had full authority in the premises and accepted the contract set up in this bill and delivered said yacht to said Miller as the resident agent of said defendant. Your orator further shows that within a few days thereafter the said Sonntag, Waggoner, Miller and others took a trip on said yacht to St Augustine, and used said boat as the property of said company until the fall of 1908, when they took her to Root\u2019s boatyard at Daytona, and had her materially altered and changed in many respects, and afterwards said Sonntag listed her for sale with one E. T. Conrad and also asked your orator to try to find a purchaser for said boat, and the said Sonntdag amended said contract by the substitution of Lot 3 for Lot 2 of Block 42, writing said amendment himself upon the top of said contract, and your orator says that said pretended defense that said contract is not the contract of the Sonntag Investment Company is false and fraudulent and ought not to be entertained by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">(6) Your orator further shows unto your Honor that said yacht has never been in his possession since he delivered it to Mr. Miller upon receiving said contract; that it was used constantly by said Sonntag Investment Company until they broke the engine, broke the rudder and finally broke the clutch. It was then taken to Mr. Root\u2019s boatyard in Daytona by Mr Sonntag\u2019s order and the rigging taken off, the mast taken out, the bowsprit cut off and the carved woodwork in the cabin painted over, and these alterations were made after defendant company had had possession of said boat for six months. Since that time the machinery in said boat has been taken to pieces and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>dispersed, said boat has been left unpainted and neglected and charges of some $100.00 or more are against her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">(7) Your orator further shows unto your Honor that at the time said contract was made Mr. Sonntag explained to him that it would not be convenient to give a deed at that time because his company had to pay the Post Estate $500 before it could make a clear deed to said lots and that they desired six months before giving him a deed, but your orator has exercised possession of said lots ever since the sale of them to him by said contract and has paid the taxes thereon and your orator has since ascertained that said Sonntag Investment Company has a contract made with Helen W. Post, the owner in fee of said lots, on June 22nd, 1907, and in which Charles C. Post, the husband of said Helen, joins, by which the said Sonntag Investment Company can demand a deed to said lots to be made to the purchaser thereof upon payment to said Helen W. Post by said company of the sum of $100.00 per lot and'interest of said $100 at 6% per annum from the date of said contract; and said contract is recognized as valid and is carried out by the legal representatives of the estate of said Helen W. Post and Chas. C. Post, both of whom are dead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">(8) But now so it is may it please your Honor, that the said M. L. Waggoner combining and confederating with said W. L. Sonntag and other members of said Sonntag Investment Company, and contriving how to wrong and injure your orator in the premises, absolutely refuse to recognize said contract and to make a conveyance of said lots by deed to your orator to carry the same into effect and pretend that said Sonntag Investment Company did not purchase and use said yacht \u2018Crystal Wave\u2019, and did not make said contract or authorize or ratify the same, whereas your orator charges the contrary thereof to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>true. All of which actings, doings and pretences of the defendant\u2019s officers and agents are contrary to equity and good conscience, and tend to the manifest wrong, injury and oppression of your orator in the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">For as much therefore as your orator is without remedy in the premises except in a court of equity, your orator, prays: that the Sonntag Investment Company be required to make full and direct answer to this bill, but not under-oath, an answer under oath being expressly waived; that the said defendant be required to specifically perform the said agreement entered into with your orator as aforesaid and to procure and deliver to your orator a good and sufficient deed of said described premises; and that your orator may have such other and further relief as equity may require and to this court shall seem meet.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">To this bill the defendant filed a demurrer that was overruled by the court, whereupon the defendant answered as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201cThe defendant the Sonntag Investment Company, a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana by Stewart &amp; Bly its solicitors, not waiving the many imperfections and defects of said bill, for answer thereto denies the allegation in the bill that on the 11th day of June, 1908, that they were seized or pretended to be seized in fee simple of Lots Two and Three, Block Forty-five, and Lots Two, Four and Six of Block Forty-two, according to the map of East Daytona, as alleged and set forth in said bill, and say that they are not no w, nor never have been seized or possessed of the title to said property, and have been and were only agents of the Post Estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">This defendant further denies that it or anyone authorized or with power to act ever entered into a written agreement with D.

I. Miller to sign any contracts of the said company, and that the execution of any contract of the Sonntag Investment Company by him, was Avithout authority and null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">This defendant further answering says that the acknoAAdedgment by the said A. I. Miller as resident agent of this defendant was Avithout authority and null and void, and that the recording of said agreement of the 20th day of August, 1908, in Book 45 of Deeds at page 486, of the records of Volusia County, Florida, was absolutely null and void and without force or effect, and without authority from this defendant or any of its legally authorized \u25a0 agents, president or board of directors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">For further answer defendant denies that within a few days after execution of said agreement, the said D. D. Beekman delivered said yacht \u2018Crystal Wave,\u2019 to the Sonntag Investment,Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Tlie defendant further denies that it has used the same as its own property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">This defendant denies that it has had said yacht altered from an auxiliary yacht to a launch.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">This defendant further answering as to whether or not the complainant would have given this defendant a hill of sale of said yacht had they required it as set forth in said bill has no knowledge as to what the complainant would have done as they did not buy or purchase said \u2018Crystal Wave\u2019 and had no use or desire for said yacht or a bill of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">As to whether or not the complainant was informed by the custom authorities that said yacht being under twenty tons measurement had been dropped from registry and no bill of sale was necessary, but that the title to her would pass by possession and delivery as in case of other personal property, this defendant has no knowledge or information save and-except that set forth in the bill, and therefore denies the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">This defendant denies that such information as therein set forth was communicated to the agents and officers of this defendant, and denies that it had anything to do with said bill of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">This defendant for further answer denies that in October, 1908, one W.

This decree the complainant brings here for review by appeal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-7\">Taylor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX6\"><em>(after stating the facts.) </em>\u2014 The court below erred in the rendition of the decree appealed from. The complainant by his proofs, practically without contradiction on all essential questions, has fdlly sustained all of the material averments of his bill. The defense urged by the defendant is: (1) That, it does not own the lots of land in question, the title thereto being in the estate of Helen W. Post, deceased, and that it cannot, therefore convey the same as it is sought to be coerced by the bill to do. (2) That it never contracted, either itself or by any authorized agent, with the complainant for the sale and conveyance of said lots as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">As to the first of these defenses the proofs without contradiction show that while the legal title to the lots in question is in the estate of Helen W. Post, deceased, the defendant has a centra ct with her whereby the lots in question will be conveyed either to the defendant or to anyone to whom it might direct the title to be made upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>payment to the said Helen W. Post or to her executor of the sum of $100.00 per lot. Helen W. Post left a will in which she made express provision for the carrying out by her executor of the terms of this contract with the defendant \u2014 so that all that the defendant has to do in order to procure a title to the complainant for said lots is to pay to the executor of the last will of Helen W. Post the total sum of $500.00, or the sum of $100.00 for each of said five lots contracted' to be conveyed to the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">As to ''he second of the defences urged, the proofs show that the contract sought to be .enforced for the sale and conveyance of the five lots made by the defendant, a corporation, with the complainant, was executed for the corporation at Seabreeze, in Volusia County, Florida, by one A. I. Miller, as resident agent. The defendant urges that A. I. Miller had no authority to bind the corporation by executing for it any such contract. That no one had any such authority except the president of the corporation. The proofs show without contradiction that the defendant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of another State, and that its home office is in a distant city of such other State, where its president resides. That it has also an office in the locality of the lots in question in Volusia County, Florida, over the entrance to which, at the time the contract in question was made, it kept the following sign: \u201cSonntag Investment Company, A. I. Miller, Resident Agent.\u201d That at the time the contract was made W. L. Sonntag, who was a director of the company, was its Secretary and Treasurer and General Manager, and that M. L. Waggoner was another director. That these two were personally present and bought from the complainant his yacht agreeing to take her in full payment for the said five lots of land; that he delivered said yacht to Sonntag, who took possession of her and used her as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>company\u2019-s own in making various excursions in and about tbe business of said company in selling land lying on or near navigable waters, for several, months, and in the meantime had various alterations made in her. That on the day said trade was made the said Sonntag in the presence of said Waggoner told the complainant that A. I. Miller had a power of attorney to act for the company and that said Miller would the next day embody the terms of their trade for said yacht and lots in a written contract, and that the contract in question was so signed by Miller as resident agent for said company. Besides this the proofs further show without contradiction that this complainant bought other lots from the defendant company for cash partly and partly on short time, lots that also belonged to the Post Estate, and that he bought them through this same A. I. Miller as Resident Agent for the defendant company who gave him a contract for title to same, executed by him as resident agent, exactly like the contract in question, and that upon the payment by him of the purchase price in money he received title to the lots so purchased from the defendant without any question or demur as to Miller\u2019s authority either to sell the lots or to bind the company by contract for title thereto. The proofs also showed that other parties dealt with this company through Miller as resident agent for the purchase of lots of the Post Estate in the same localit.y, receiving from him contracts for title executed by him as resident agent for the company, and that titles were made pursuant to said contracts without question or objection as to Miller\u2019s authority so to act for and bind the company. But besides all this the proofs show that after the contract in question was executed and delivered to the complainant, W. L. Sonntag, Secretary and Treasurer and General Manager of the defendant company in the presence of M. L. Wag-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>goner, another director of the company, upon being shown the said, contract discovered that a mistake had been made therein in giving the number of one of the lots therein, and that he with the consent of the complainant wrote a memorandum on the margin of said contract, designed to correct said error therein, by giving in said memorandum the correct number of said lot to be substituted for the lot incorrectly described. &gt; This amounted to a ratification of said contract by the defendant company through its Secretary and Treasurer and General Manager, and made it his contract as such Secretaray, &amp;c., as though he had himself as such executed it in the first instance. We find in the record a resolution adopted by the defendant compny\u2019s board of directors on June 22nd, 1907, to the effect that in case of the absence or disability of the president of said company it shall be the duty of the Secretary and Treasurer to sign and execute all papers in his stead. The proofs show that the president was absent from Florida when this contract was made, and that Sonntag, its Secretary and Treasurer, was present on the ground and that he as such virtually and in fact made the contract for the company. The defendant company was here doing-business as a real estate dealer on the Atlantic coast in Volusia County, and along the adjacent river Halifax. Its agents in charge of its business there desired a yacht as a suitable and convenient vehicle in carrying forward its business and bought the complainant\u2019s yacht agreeing to convey to him therefor the five lots in question. He has fully performed his part of said contract by delivering-possession of said yacht, and is now entitled to a good title to said five lots of land in exchange therefor; and the defendant company is now estopped from repudiating said contract made for it by A. I. Miller as its resident agent, after holding him out as being authorized to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>such contracts by recognizing and carrying out without objection similar contracts made by him for the company in the same capacity with the complainant and with others besides. We think the defendant company is fully bound by the contract in question. If the vendor is in a situation to obtain title, is in such situation that it is only necessary, for instance, to demand a deed after having paid the purchase money at an administrator's sale of the subject of the contract of sale between him and the purchaser, or to do like acts clearly within his power and thus acquire a title, a court of equity will retain the bill, will require him to perform such acts, and will thereupon decree performance of the contract. Knox v. Spratt, 19 Fla. 817. The acts of an agent, performed within the scope of his real or apparent authority, are binding upon his principal. The public have a right to rely' upon an agent\u2019s apparent authority, and are not bound to enquire as to his special powers unless the circumstances are such as to put them upon inquiry.
