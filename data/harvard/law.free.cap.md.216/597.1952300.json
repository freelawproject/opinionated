He escaped therefrom on November 15, 1954, and was returned from said escape on April 25, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The bases for his petition to Judge Gray were that the clerk of the court failed to fully comply with Article 27, section 786 of the Code (1951), and that the third sentence was intended to run concurrently. The provisions of section 786 of Article 27 have nothing to do with the legality of the petitioner\u2019s detention. Their purpose is to furnish certain information to the Department of Correction. The docket entries disclose there is no foundation for petitioner\u2019s contention that one of the sentences _ was to run concurrently. Inasmuch as he had not served the three years, exclusive of the time he was at liberty after escape, it is obvious Judge Gray was correct in denying his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
