We have repeatedly held that neither ground can be raised on <em>habeas corpus. </em>Applicant further contends that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>four-year sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by law (as to which we express no opinion), but until he serves so much of the sentence as he concedes was within the power of the court to impose (eighteen months), which the record shows he is far from having done, his application is premature and will not be entertained. <em>Ramberg v.
