Whether a person returned to custody for violation of parole is to receive such credit is a matter resting in the discretion of the Board of Parole and Probation. Article 41, section 115, Code (1957). A failure of the Board to exercise its discretion so as to grant credit does not deprive the petitioner of any constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>right, even if we assume, without deciding, that such a question could be raised on <em>habeas corpus.
