The only points raised by the appellant are: the</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">failure of the court to instruct as to the statutory duty to reduce speed under such conditions, the refusal to instruct as to last clear chance, and the admission into evidence of a plat of the road. No novel question of law is presented. Without reciting the evidence in detail, we deem it sufficient to say that we think the court\u2019s charge as to due care under the circumstances was adequate, and that there was no factual basis for the application of the doctrine of last clear chance. Cf. <em>Henderson v. Brown, </em>214 Md. 463, <em>Domeski v. Atlantic Refining Co., </em>202 Md. 562, and cases cited. We think the admission of the plat was well within the discretion of the trial court, and not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
