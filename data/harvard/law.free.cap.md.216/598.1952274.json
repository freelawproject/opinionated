The docket entries also show that he was represented by counsel and, when arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and that he was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">He also complains that his counsel refused to summon a witness. However, he fails to state that he complained of this fact to-the trial judge. <em>Smith v. Warden, </em>213 Md. 643, 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Of course, the bald allegation that one has been denied constitutional guarantees, without setting forth facts substantiating the same, cannot constitute the basis for issuing a writ of <em>habeas corpus. Lucas v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 645, 647. Likewise, his attack on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction is not available in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings. <em>Hicks v. Warden, </em>213 Md. 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
