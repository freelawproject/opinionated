With respect to the allegation of prejudice there is nothing in the record to support the charge. Moreover, alleged prejudicial remarks made by a trial judge should be tested by an appeal and not by <em>habeas corpus. Ford v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 649, 135 A. 2d 894 (1957). The petitioner was sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Code (1951), Art. 27, sec. 573, which provides for a sentence of three to ten years. The sentence imposed did not exceed the maximum provided by law. <em>Jones v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 656, 136 A. 2d 377 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
