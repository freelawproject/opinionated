A \u201cfamily\u201d is defined in the zoning regulations (Montgomery County Code (1955), Sec. 107-2(56)) as: \u201cAn individual, or two or more persons related by blood or marriage, or a group of not more than five persons, excluding servants, not related by blood or marriage, living together as a single housekeeping .group in a dwelling unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Appellant' employs a number of lumberjacks and regularly has boarded from five to eighteen of them in his home. He contends that the word \u201cservant\u201d in the regulations is to be \u25a0construed as including employees, while Montgomery County says that the word means only domestic servants. The lower court agreed with the County and issued an injunction accordingly. Considering the setting and the purposes of the regulation, and the consequences that the broader meaning would permit, we agree with the County and the court that the word \u201cservant\u201d was used in its original and primary meaning. <em>Tyrie v. Baltimore County, </em>215 Md. 135. \u201cThe first sort of servants, therefore, acknowledged by the laws of England, are <em>menial servants; </em>so called from being <em>intra \u25a0moenia, </em>or domestics * * <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, </em>Lewis\u2019s Ed., Book I, Chap. 14, p. 425; <em>Lewis v. Fisher, </em>80 Md. 139, 142. \u201cAlthough the word 'servant\u2019 may be used in .a statute without any qualifying phraseology, it will be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>strued in a restricted sense if the subject-matter and purpose of the enactment indicate that only one particular class of servants is within the contemplation of the legislature.\u201d <em>Labatt\u2019s Master &amp; Servant, </em>Second Ed., Chap. 1, Sec. <em>7. </em>The sense was restricted to domestic servants in <em>Yewens v. Noakes, </em>L. R. 6 Q. B. Div. (C. A.) 530, 538; and <em>Park Ave. Methodist Episcopal Church v. Barrett, </em>30 N. Y. S. 2d 667 (motions for reargument and for leave to appeal denied, 37 N. Y. S. 2d 443).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
