The defendant Wilson denied having diverted the water from the creek, and alleged that he was in possession as a pre-emptor of one hundred and sixty acres of land adjoining the creek, occupying the tract for agricultural purposes; that upon his premises water naturally rises by percolation through the soil, forming springs and rivulets. He claimed the right to use this water only. The Court rendered a decree which contained the clause quoted in the opinion. The defendant Wilson appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-7\"><em>H. C.
