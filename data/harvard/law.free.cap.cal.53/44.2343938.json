(Stats. 1873-4, p. 588.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">Judgment was rendered for plaintiff, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-14\"><em>D.

Heydenfeldt, 46 Cal. 68; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>47 Ibid. 456; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>Ibid. 603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The Act of March 25th, 1874, \u201c To ratify and confirm certain ordinances,\u201d etc., (Stats. 1873-4, p. 588) is in violation of the Constitution of the State, and therefore void. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>51 Cal. 15; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goldtree, </em>44 Ibid. 323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">As the attempted assessment was absolutely void, the act of the Legislature was an attempt to levy a contribution within a certain district, and to declare that each lot named in the original roll should pay a sum arbitrarily fixed. This would be to create a lien on defendants\u2019 real estate, which, if the law were valid, the Courts would be compelled to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">If this can be done, the Legislature may take the property of the citizen without any legal process, for there can be no difference between taking the property directly and imposing a lien upon it. But no person \u201c can be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d (Constitution, art. 1, sec. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The act of the Legislature is an attempt, at best, to levy an \u201c assessment \u201d within a city. The Legislature has no power to levy such assessment. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>31 Cal. 240; <em>People </em>v. Lynch, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">Wallace, C.
