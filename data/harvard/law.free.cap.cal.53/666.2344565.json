B. Matlock and all owners and claimants known or unknown,\u201d was void. This view is upheld by <em>Kelsey </em>v. Abbott, 18 Cal. 609 ; <em>Smith </em>v. Davis, 30 Cal. 537; <em>Blatner </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>32 Cal. 328, and by other decisions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.
