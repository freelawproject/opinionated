Tilomas A. Scott, agreeing that in consideration of the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railway within the time fixed by its charter the City of San Diogo should procure the right of way through the county for the road, depot, grants for the same, together with the franchise and property interests of the San Diego and Southern Pacific and Atlantic Railroad Company. This contract was subsequently ratified by a vote of the citizens. To enable the city to carry out the agreement, Charter Ordinances No. 7 and 8 were passed, as stated in the opinion. The Legislature subsequently passed an act, (approved February 24th, 1874\u2014see Statutes 1873-4, p. 156) \u201cTo legalize certain bonds of the City of San Diego, and to provide for the payment of the interest thereon and for the redemption thereof,\u201d limiting <em>the </em>sum to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. In October, 1875, a petition signed by A. E. Horton and other citizens was filed with the Board of Trustees, representing that certain unfriendly legislation was contemplated by Congress, and recommending that, in order to defeat such adverse legislation and to protect the interests of the city, the defendant, Ealsenheld, be sent as an agent to Washington, \u201cto represent the interests of the city in this railroad matter; and for his services and expenses that you appropriate and deliver to him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sum of four thousand dollars in City Railroad Bonds.\u201d The bonds in controversy were issued in compliance with this petition, and without passing any resolution for the purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-7\"><em>H.

The authority to issue the bonds is derived exclusively from ordinances numbered seven and twenty-two of the trustees of the city, which were subsequently ratified and validated by the Act of the Legislature of February 24th, 1874. (Statutes 1873-4, p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Ordinance No. 7 provides that the bonds are \u201cto be issued at such times and in such manner as said Board of Trustees may direct \u201d; and Ordinance No. 22 in the fourth section provides that the bonds are to be issued \u201c to such person or persons, and at such time or times, as said Board of Trustees may, <em>by resolution, </em>direct \u201d; and the fifth section, after providing for the signing of the bonds, etc., then provides that the \u201c Clerk shall then deliver said bonds, thus signed and sealed, to such person or persons, and at such time or times, as said Board may, <em>by resolution, </em>direct.\u201d The bonds in controversy were issued and delivered to Bowers, and were payable to him, \u201c or the lawful holder thereof \u201d ; and the Court finds \u201c that no resolution of said Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of Trustees was ever passed authorizing said bonds to be issued to said Bowers, or designating the denomination of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u201c It is a general and fundamental principle of law that <em>all </em>persons contracting with a municipal corporation must, <em>at their peril, inquire into the power </em>of the corporation or its officers to make the contract; and a contract beyond the scope of the corporate power is void, although it be under the seal of the corporation.\u201d (Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sec. 372.) And where the <em>mode </em>of contracting \u201cis specially and plainly prescribed and limited, that mode is exclusive, and must be pursued, or the contract will not bind the corporation.\u201d (Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sec. 373.) In <em>Argenti </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>16 Cal. 283, Mr. Justice Field says : \u201c A municipal corporation can only act in the cases and in the <em>mode </em>prescribed by its charter.\u201d In <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>16 Cal. 620, the same learned Judge, in delivering the opinion of the Court, says the Common Council \u201c were the mere agents of the corporation, and possessed only such powers as were specially delegated to them by the charter; and when that instrument granted a power with a specific designation as to the <em>mode </em>in which it should be used, the mode was restrictive\u2014no other mode could be followed.\u201d In <em>Zottman </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>20 Cal. 102, the Court says: \u201c The rule is general, and applies to the corporate authorities of all municipal bodies\u2014when the <em>mode </em>in which their power on any given subject can be exercised is prescribed by their charter, the mode must be followed. The mode in such cases constitutes the measure of the power.\u201d The same proposition was affirmed in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Napa County, </em>20 Cal. 503; <em>French </em>v. <em>Teschemacher, </em>24 Cal. 550; <em>Herzo </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>33 Cal. 145; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>35 Cal. 507, and in later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In this case, the ordinances, as ratified by the act of the Legislature, prescribed definitely and precisely the mode and the only mode in which the bonds could be issued and delivered, to wit, by a resolution of the Board of Trustees, directing when and to whom the bonds were to be issued and delivered. Nor can this requirement be regarded as merely directory, a violation of which would not impair the validity of the bonds. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the contrary, it was intended as a precaution against an abuse of its power by the Board of Trustees, and to prevent a fraudulent or unauthorized delivery by the Clerk to a person not entitled to receive the bonds. Under the terms of the ordinance, no bond could be issued or delivered, except upon a resolution of the Board appearing upon its minutes or the record of its proceedings, thus furnishing a most important safeguard against fraud and an abuse of power. Every person dealing in the bonds is bound, at his peril, to inquire whether they were issued in the mode prescribed; and as the mode is the measure of the power, the bonds would be void in the hands of a holder for value without actual notice, if issued in any other mode. We are therefore of opinion that the bonds in controversy would be void in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder, and would not be a valid charge against the city. It results that the plaintiff as a tax payer can suffer no damage if the bonds are put-in circulation, and has no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Mr. Justice McKinstry and Mr. Chief Justice Wallace expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
