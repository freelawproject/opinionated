At the trial it appeared that the plaintiff had contracted with one McCormick to thresh wheat on the ranch of the defendant, near Bio Yista, at forty dollars per day. After he had worked several days, he went to San Francisco to see about his pay, and when he called upon the defendant was referred by him to his brother, John Zeile, who acted as agent for the defendant. The plaintiff informed John Zeile that he had not been paid by McCormick, and he would not do any more work unless he knew when he was going to be paid for it. John Zeile told him to go on with the work, get an order from McCormick for the amount due, and he (John Zeile) would pay him. The plaintiff thereupon returned and finished the work. He obtained an order from McCormick for the whole amount of his bill, and, McCormick having failed, demanded payment, upon refusal of which he brought this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-12\">Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, a new trial was denied, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>J.
