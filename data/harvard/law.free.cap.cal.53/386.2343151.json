After due proceedings had, a decree was entered by the Court below for the sale of the property, to satisfy said sum of five and seventy-five one-hundredths dollars, with twenty-five per cent, added thereto, and interest and costs of suit. Copy of the decree, as an order of sale, was issued to the Sheriff, and was by him returned wholly unsatisfied. On the 7th of February, 1876, the Court caused a judgment to be docketed against defendant for the amounts due under said decree, and ordered execution to satisfy the same out of the general property of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The defendant, on the 14th day of May, 1878, paid the tax, percentage, and interest due on the judgment, but did not pay the costs of the action. This appeal is from the order of the District Court denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for an execution against the property of the defendant for the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">If the provisions of the Act .of March 28th, 1874, were applicable, there can be no doubt the plaintiffs were entitled to recover costs. We are to inquire, therefore, whether, under the Act of March 15th, 1876, <em>\u201c </em>to regulate proceedings for the collection of taxes, and to prevent oppressive costs,\u201d the defendant was entitled to have the action \u201c dismissed \u201d on payment of the amount sued for without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The final judgment in the Court below was entered and docketed before the passage of the last-named act.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">It may be assumed that the Legislature, for the State, had power to remit the costs, leaving the attorneys for the People to appeal to the State for their compensation for services performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The question here relates to the construction of the language employed in the Statute of March 15th, 1876. The full text of that statute is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">\u201c Section 1. In all cases when actions have been brought in the name of the State to recover taxes, under the provisions of an Act entitled \u2018 An Act levying State taxes for the twenty-fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and twenty-fifth fiscal years, and to provide for the enforcement thereof,\u2019 approved March 28th, 1874, and the amount of tax-<em>sued for is </em>ten dollars or less, the defendant or defendants in each of said actions respectively shall be permitted to settle the same on the payment of the amount\u2019sued for, without costs; and upon the payment into Court of the said amounts, the defendant or defendants shall be entitled to have the action dismissed. l\u00edo charge or cost of any kind shall be required of such defendant or defendants, by the Clerk or any other person, either before or after such payment into Court, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201c Sec. 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">In looking at this statute, we consider: 1. The class of cases to which it applies. 2. The privilege conferred on defendants. 3. The act to be performed by defendants. 4. The right acquired by defendants on performance of such act. And, first, the statute applies to \u201c all cases where actions <em>have been brought </em>\u201d under the former statute, and \u201c the amount sued for is ten dollars or less \u201d; second, the privilege is to \u201c settle,\u201d etc.; third, the act to be done is the payment of the amount sued for, without costs; fourth, the right is to have the action <em>dismissed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The words \u201c when actions <em>have been </em>brought \u201d and \u201c the amount sued for <em>is </em>\u201d indicate a reference to actions <em>pending. </em>The \"word \u201c settle \u201d naturally refers to cases in which the asserted claim has not yet been definitely and finally determined by judgment ; and the word \u201c dismissed \u201d is made applicable by the Coie of Civil Procedure to dismissals on motion of defendant only where the plaintiff fails to appear at the trial, or abandons the action, or fails to prove a sufficient' case to go to the jury. (Sec. 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Suits were disposed of by dismissal originally in chancery, and the term has been used in Courts of Law only at a comparatively late period. (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict.) As used in <em>Courts of </em>Law, it seems always to have been applied to a removal out of Court prior to a judgment on the merits. After the final adjudication by the Court having jurisdiction, the judgment, (except when appealed from) can only be <em>satisfied </em>by the defendant. Certainly, no case can be found .in law or equity, in</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>which an action has been <em>dismissed </em>on motion of <em>defendant </em>after judgment or decree, in favor of the <em>plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">It is undoubtedly true that the Legislature might have given a broader meaning to the word \u201c dismissed \u201d than that which it had previously received as part of the legal phraseology. But, as we have seen, the context here not only does not require that we shall confer a new meaning upon the word \u201c dismiss,\u201d but very strongly tends to strengthen the presumption arising from the use of the word itself, that it was not intended to be applied to a case in which judgment had already been entered. If, however, there still remains doubt as to whether it was intended that a defendant who had contested an action throughout could, after judgment and by virtue of a statute subsequently passed, have the action \u201c dismissed \u201d on payment of a portion of the judgment, a reference to the <em>title </em>of the Act of March 15th, 1876, will remove such doubt. The title is: \u201cAn Act to regulate proceedings for the collection of taxes, and to prevent oppressive costs.\u201d The title surely indicates that the act was to be applicable only to proceedings pending when the act was passed,, or such as should he commenced subsequent to the passage of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
