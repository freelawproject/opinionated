The deceased claimed the title to a large tract of land upon which the defendants were living under a claim of title adverse to him. There was evidence showing a bitter state of feeling on the part of the defendants towards the deceased, growing out of long and vexatious litigation, together with efforts on his part to eject the defendants. About one o\u2019clock a. m., March 24th, 1877, More\u2019s barn was set on fire; he went out of his dwelling to investigate the matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and while out was set upon by several armed men in disguise, and was killed. The defendant was indicted June 7th, 1878, and was put upon his trial July 10th, 1878. He moved for a continuance upon three grounds, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">1. That certain material witnesses, particularly one Frank Davis, were absent, and he had not been able to procure their attendance; that the said Davis, who was in defendant\u2019s employ, was at the house of defendant on the night of the murder, and would, testify that defendant was at home all that night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">2. That the defendant had been so closely confined to the jail, and watched by the officials, since his arrest, that he had not been allowed to consult his counsel sufficiently, and prepare for his trial\u2014the time being insufficient even with full opportunities for preparation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">3. That an excited and highly prejudiced state of feeling was prevalent at the time in the community generally against the defendant, in consequence of which he was apprehensive that any jury by whom he might be tried at that time would be so biased as to prevent his receiving a fair and impartial trial, which excitement and prejudice, he believed, would so far subside by the next term of Court that he could then submit to a trial with a reasonable expectation of meeting with full and impartial justice, and \u201c although this might properly be ground on which to move for a change of venue, yet the number and poverty of the witnesses, as well as his own poverty, effectually preclude a change of the place of trial from this to any other county without imposing expenses upon his witnesses which neither they nor affiant are able to bear.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">Affidavits were filed on behalf of the prosecution, showing that the defendant had been allowed the fullest opportunity to consult his counsel and prepare for <em>trial; </em>that when called as a witness before the grand jury the defendant had testified that there was no one at his house on the night of the murder except the members of his own family. The motion was denied. The Court, at the trial, made an order excluding from the Courtroom such of the jurors summoned for the term as were not empanneled, and also an order excluding from the Court-room all the witnesses (including the wife and daughter of defendant) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>except the one under examination. The defendant objected to these orders, upon the ground that they had the effect to deprive him of a public trial. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. Subsequently the defendant moved to set it aside, in order that he might show that the trial had not been conducted according to the forms of law, in that the Deputy Sheriff had made improper communications to the jury. In support of the motion he offered the affidavit of a juror, which was excluded. The defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied, whereupon he appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-6\"><em>Creed Haymond, James D. Fay, Hines &amp; Brooks, N. C. </em>Bledsoe, and <em>W. W.

The rule is that the jury <em>may </em>reject the whole of the testimony of a witness who has willfully sworn falsely as to a material point; that is to say, the jury, being convinced that a witness has stated what was untrue, not as the result of mistake or inadvertence, but willfully and with the design to deceive, must treat all his testimonj\u2019' with distrust and suspicion, and reject all unless they shall be convinced, notwithstanding the base character of the witness, that he has in other particulars sworn to the truth. The third subdivision of sec. 2061 of the Code of Civil Procedure is but declaratory of the rule above considered, and by requiring a jury to distrust, necessarily authorizes them to reject all the testimony of such a witness, in a proper case. The word \u201c false \u201d is not the equivalent of \u201c mistake,\u201d as contended for by defendant\u2019s counsel; the word \u201c willfully \u201d did not change the effect of the instruction as offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">After the jury was empanneled and sworn, the Clerk did not (as directed by sec. 1093 of the Penal Code) read the indictment and state defendant\u2019s plea. It appears from the bill of exceptions, however, that during the empanneling of the jury the substance of the indictment. and plea were many times repeated ; that in opening the case to the jury the District Attorney stated the substance of the indictment and also defendant\u2019s plea thereto; that in the charge of the Court the substance of the indictment and plea were again mentioned; and that the defendant made no objection to proceeding with the trial by reason of the failure of the Clerk to read the indictment or to state the plea, nor in any way referred to the omission until after the verdict had been received and entered on the minutes, and the jury polled at defendant\u2019s request. Sec. 1404 of the Penal Code provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201c Heither a departure from the form or mode prescribed by this Code in respect to any pleading or proceeding, nor an error or mistake therein, renders it invalid, unless it has actually prejudiced the defendant, or tended to his prejudice, in respect to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>substantial right\u201d; and sec. 1258 of the same Code is as follows: \u201cAfter hearing the appeal, the Court must give judgment, without regard to technical errors or defects, or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">There can be no doubt that the jury were fully informed from the commencement of the trial of the precise charges against the defendant, and of the issue raised by his plea of \u201c not guilty.\u201d The departure from the form or mode of presenting the issue prescribed by the statute did not prejudice or tend to prejudice the defendant in respect to a substantial right, and it is therefore the duty of this Court to give judgment without reference to an irregularity\u2014the result of such departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
