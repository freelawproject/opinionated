That after the passage of said Act of the Legislature, entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for th\u00e9 disposition of certain property of the State of California,\u201d passed March 26th, 1851, to wit, on the 27th day of June, 1856, the Board of Aldermen and the Board of Assistant Aldermen of the City of San Francisco passed a certain ordinance, which was that day approved by the Mayor of said city, entitled \u2018 Ordinance H o. 982,\u2019 declaring East Street open from Folsom Street to Clay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Street, wherein it was provided that East Street from Folsom Street to Clay Street, as laid down on the Official Map,street.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">\u201c VIII.

Humphreys, City and County Surveyor, 1870, as per Order 966 of the Board of Supervisors, approved October 25th, 1870,\u2019 is deposited in the office of the City and' County Surveyor of San Francisco, and is one of the maps of said City and County, and one of the maps constituting the records of said office. That upon this map, among other streets, a street is exhibited marked East Street, on the cast water front of said city, and extends from. Market Street to Folsom Street, in width one hundred and fifty (150) feet. Its location on this map is the same in all respects (except as to width) as upon the other maps in this stipulation mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">The Court overruled the objection to each of the said instruments, <em>to </em>which defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">Andrew J. Pope testified for defendants: \u201c I am one of the defendants, and know the premises since within the year 1850. The defendants own the water lots west of and abutting on the premises in controversy, to wit; lots six hundred and fifty-three and six hundred and fifty-four. We piled and capped and planked the premises in controversy in 1854, and since then used the same continuously as a lumber yard, exclusively claiming the same in our right as against all the world. What is claimed as the west half of East Street was never opened for use by the public. Defendant\u2019s possession was never interrupted. The bulkhead is built in front of the lots owned by defendants, except the last lot, which it does not quite cover. Defendants have lumber piled all along and around there. It is all covered, and said lumber is piled to a height above the level of the bulkhead, as it is constructed, ten or fifteen feet high. Do n\u2019t know that we actually took possession by piling of the premises described in the complaint before 1864. Think that the piling was confined to the water lots up to 1864. In 1864, at the time the lease from the State Harbor Commissioners was signed, we occupied East Street with a wharf, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>was built at different times, from 1854 to 1864, and is on a level with the grade of the bulkhead. The defendants did not occupy the whole space until 1864. There was a slip left open where East Street is\u2014where they hauled the vessels in. There \u25a0has been considerable piling done since 1864, in repairing the wharf.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">It was admitted by the defendants that there was such a place as East Street, between Market and Folsom Streets, and that the premises described in the complaint are within the limits of such street. \u2018 It was admitted by the parties that the defendants were, at the time of the commencement of said cause, and still are, in possession of the premises described in the complaint, and using the same as a lumber yard, with piles of lumber thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">The foregoing was all the evidence given upon the trial of <em>the </em>action, and thereupon the defendants asked the Court to hold and decide that they had shown a title to the premises which in the complaint were averred to be the property of the plaintiffs by virtue of an adverse, continuous, and exclusive possession as against the State of California, as against the City and County of San Francisco, and against all the world, and had also shown a right to the relief prayed for in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">The Court refused so to hold and decide, to which ruling and decision defendants duly excepted. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-9\"><em>Wm. H. </em>Patterson, Newhall, <em>Carson &amp; </em>Phelan, and <em>E. B. &amp; J. W. Mastick, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-10\">The defendants own, by title acquired fi\u2019om the State, water lots six hundred and fifty-three and six hundred and fifty-four-, abutting on the west line of the so-called East Street, which line was the easterly boundary of said water lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-11\">East Street, or rather the western half thereof, was never opened by any public authority, and was never used by the public; but fi'om 1854 down to the filing of the complaint herein, January 23rd, 1872, was'exclusively and adversely used by the defendants, continuously during said period, as a lumber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>yard, on which they piled lumber unladen from sea-going vessels which brought the same thereto from Oregon, Humboldt, and other places by water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-6\">Such user, coupled with the act granting the water lots described in the Acts of 1851, p. 307, chap. 40, vested in defendants the right to continue to use East Street, as aforesaid, until A. d. 1950. , Said water lots were granted for commercial purposes and for private use, and until the expiration of ninety-nine years from March 26th, 1851, the State has no interest in the use of said water lots, and consequently, by for\u00f3e of the Statute of Limitations, has no use nor right to the use or control of so-called East Street, it having dedicated East Street to the use of the City of San Francisco, and the defendants having acquired title thereto as against said city and county, by ten years adverse possession. The adverse possession by defendants gave them title. <em>(Bird </em>v. <em>Lisbros, </em>9 Cal. 1; <em>Coryell </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>16 Cal. 572; <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Liscom, </em>34 Cal. 365 ; <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>48 Cal. 7; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Heaton, </em>22 Vt. 7.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-7\">\u201cIf land within the surveyed limits of a public highway be inclosed by an individual and occupied by him constantly for more than twenty years, under a claim of right, he will acquire a prescriptive right to the land so occupied as against the public, and can maintain trespass against the selectmen of the town who remove his fence to the original line of the highway.\u201d (Washburn\u2019s Digest, 480.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-8\">In the case last above, counsel for the defendant seems to have anticipated this Court in <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>The City, </em>by arguing \u2014page 482\u2014that the Statute of Limitations would not run because the premises in question had been dedicated to public use, but Judge Eedfield held that non-user by the public and the constant use by the plaintiff, under a claim of right, is sufficient to establish a prescriptive right, citing <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>3 Barn. &amp; C. 332; Dowling <em>&amp; </em>R. 234; Gale &amp; Whateley on Easements, 256. And in concluding the opinion, he said: \u201c The Statute of Limitations now in express terms providing that the State shall not be exempt from its operation, we see no good reason why one may not set up prescriptive and presumptive rights against the public, the same as against individuals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>And there is perhaps no good reason why such prescriptions should not apply as well against the public as in their favor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\">The same doctrine is maintained in all States that have Statutes of Limitation running against, the public. <em>(Beardsley </em>v. <em>French, </em>7 Conn. 125 ; <em>Commissioners etc. </em>v. <em>Laylor, </em>2 Bay, S. C. 282; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>11 Ohio, 444; 8 B. Mon. 232, 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-7\">In the latter case the Court says: \u201c The right of the public in property dedicated to public uses may be lost by an adverse possession for twenty years.\u201d (Angell on Highways, sec. 323.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-8\"><em>Attorney-General Hamilton </em>and <em>W. C. Burnett, </em>City and County Attorney, for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-9\">1. The Statute of Limitations will not avail the appellants. <em>(San Francisco </em>v. <em>Sullivan et al. </em>50 Cal. 603; <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>50 Cal. 265; <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>50 Cal. 370; <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>N. P. Transportation Co. </em>50 Cal. 592; <em>Weber </em>v. <em>The Board of State Harbor Commissioners, </em>18 Wall. 57.) Unless the public may take possession, no public improvement-of a street can be made; and possession in a private person would be a perpetual injunction against such improvements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-10\">The lease mentioned in the case of <em>Pope &amp; Talbot </em>v. <em>San Francisco et al., </em>on argument with this case, and submitted on the same trial and evidence with this, is a lease from the Board of State Harbor Commissioners to the appellants of the easterly half of East Street, directly adjoining upon the east the premises mentioned in the complaint; whereby they admitted the existence of East Street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-11\">2. The premises designated as East Street have been dedicated to public use. In \u201c An Act to provide for the disposition of certain property of the State of California,\u201d passed March 26th, 1851, (Statutes 1851, p. 307) see mention made of East Street, in sec. 1 thereof, in giving boundaries or lines of the San Francisco beach or water lot property. By that act the beach and water lot property was granted to the city for ninety-nine years. It is a familiar principle that where the sovereign, by deed or grant, bounds the property conveyed on a street as such, that act is a dedication of that street on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>of the grantor. (Angell on Highways, sec. 149; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lambier, </em>Denio, 9, 19; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>11 Wend. 486 ; <em>Matter of Seventeenth Street, </em>1 Wend. 262; <em>Matter of Lewis Street, </em>2 Wend. 472, 474-5; <em>Matter of Thirty-second Street, </em>19 Wend. 128; <em>Matter of Twenty-ninth Street, </em>1 Hill, 189; <em>Hannibal </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>15 Mo. 639; <em>Vick </em>v. <em>Vicksburg, </em>1 How. Miss. 379; <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Morris Canal Co. </em>1 Beasl. 547.) That act of dedication by the State was adopted in all its parts, without any reservation whatever, and thereby a dedication made by and on the part of the city itself, by virtue of an Ordinance, numbered 326, approved- April 5th, 1853. (See volume of \u201c Ordinances and Resolutions,\u201d published 1853-4, p. 50.) And \u201c An Act to provide for the sale of the interest of the State of California in the property within the water-line front of the City of San Francisco, as defined in and by the Act entitled <em>\u2018 </em>An Act to provide for the disposition of certain property of the State of California,\u2019 \u201d passed March 26th, 1851, approved May 18th, 1853, whereby the official map of the city was recognized and approved with reference to the water-lot property. (Statutes of 1853, sec. 7, p. 221.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-6\">3. Again, by \u201c an act to provide for the sale of certain property of the State of California, within the water-line front of the City and County of San Francisco,\u201d approved April 26th, 1858, all of the streets mentioned and referred to in the said Act of March 26th, 1851, to the full extent of said streets, and the streets as laid down on the map or plat made by J. J. Gardiner, mentioned in sec. 2 of the Act of 1858, are confirmed, established, and dedicated to. public use as streets. All acts conflicting therewith are repealed. (Stats. of 1858, pp. 323, 324, 325, secs. 7 and 8.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-7\">On the Gardiner Map the width of East Street is one hundred and thirty-seven and one-half feet. By virtue of sec. 8 of an Act of 1864, amendatory, etc., of an Act of 1863, providing for the improvement, etc., of the \u25a0 whaiwes, etc., approved March 5th, 1864, the width of East Street was made to be one hundred and fifty feet, by widening the same to the' easterly twelve and a half feet. (Stats, of 1863-4, p. 143, sec. 8.) East Street is declared an open street and thoroughfare by Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the Legislature approved March 27th, 1868, entitled \u201c An Act to authorize the Board of State Harbor Commissioners to lease a portion of the water front of the City and County of San Francisco.\u201d (Stats. 1867-8, p. 408, sec. 1.) All the original streets as laid down upon the map now in the office of the City and County Surveyor of the City and County of San Francisco, signed by C. H. Gough, Michael Hayes, and Horace Hawes, Commissioners, and by John J. HofE, Surveyor, and generally known as the\" \u201cVan Ness Map,\u201d and all other streets, lanes, alleys, places, or courts then dedicated to public use, or which should thereafter be dedicated to public use, lying between the Bay of San Francisco and Johnston and Larkin Streets, etc., were, on the 25th day of April, 1862, declared by the Legislature to be open public streets, etc. (See Stats. of 1862, p. 391, amendment to sec. 36 of the Consolidation Act.) When the Bay of San Francisco is mentioned in that section, in bounding the District upon one side, with Johnston and Larkin Streets as the other boundary, the \u201c water front,\u201d as established by the Act of March 26th, 1851, is intended. (Stats. 1851, p. 307, etc. See <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Jackson Street Wharf </em>Company, 31 Cal. 121, where said act is referred to by a wrong date.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-6\">By an amendment to that section, made April 4th, 1870, all the streets as laid down upon the map signed by George C. Potter and Thaddeus B. Brooks, and now in the office of the City and County Surveyor, and made official by the Board of Supervisors, as per Order No. 684, January 30th, 1866, and all other streets, etc., now dedicated to public use, are declared to be open public streets. (Statutes of 1869-70, p. 890; see amendment to that section, stats. 1871-2, p. 804.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-7\">That section, as it has stood ever since the 25th day of April, 1852, has furnished ample authority to the Board of Supervisors to establish and ascertain the width and dimensions of all the streets, etc., therein referred to (including East Street). The city and county whs authorized to establish the lines and grades of streets, etc., through a Board of Civil Engineers, but according to the original lines, etc. (Stat. 1862, p. 407, etc.) Order No. 684, above referred to, was adopted pursuant to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>statute. The map therein referred to is in the office of the City and County Surveyor. (See Order 684 in Municipal Reports of 1866, p. 384, etc.) East Street is laid down on all the city maps.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">Dedication, by user or otherwise, is as easily proven against the Government as against an individual. <em>(Regina </em>v. <em>East </em>Mark, 11 Ad. <em>&amp; </em>E. 876; <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 7 Blackford, 512.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\">If a street be dedicated by Act of Parliament, it is not necessary that it be adopted by the city; and even if dedicated by user, at common law, the city must keep it in repair. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of </em>Leake, 5 Barn. &amp; Ad. 496, etc.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-8\">4. Encroachments on public streets are public nuisances. <em>(El Dorado Co. </em>v. <em>Thos. Davidson, </em>30 Cal. 520; <em>Wetmore </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>14 Wend. 250; <em>Hart et al. </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc. of Albany et al. </em>9 Wend. 571; <em>Denning </em>v. <em>Roome, </em>6 Wend. 651; <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Geary et al. </em>1 Cal. 467; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Chicago City, </em>4 Wall. U. S. 657; <em>Vale </em>v. <em>Bliss &amp; Davis, </em>50 Barbour, 358; <em>Nevens </em>v. <em>City of Peoria, </em>41 Ill. 503; <em>Attorney- General </em>v. <em>Cambridge C. Gas Co. </em>Law Rep. 6 Eq. 282; <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>2 Mass. 143.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-9\">5. No length of time will legalize a public nuisance. <em>(Folkes </em>v. <em>Chads et al. </em>3 Doug. 340-3; <em>Voght </em>v. <em>Winch, 2 </em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 662, 671.) And that it is only by Act of Parliament that a public right in a navigable river can be determined. <em>(The King </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>(6 Geo. IV) 4 Barn. &amp; C. 598, 602, 605.) And also that a public right in a navigable stream can only bo determined: 1st. By Act of Parliament. 2nd. By writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>and an inquisition found thereon by a jury. Or, 3rd. By natural causes, as by the receding of the sea, etc. <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Hall &amp; Richards, </em>9 Wend. 315 ; <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hornby, Clerk, </em>7 East, 199, 200, and new edition, vol. 4, p. 95; <em>Dygert </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>23 Wend. 445, 447; <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Chaloner, </em>42 Maine, 150.) And that the remedy against a public nuisance by abatement is in all respects concurrent with that by indictment. <em>(Penwick </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>3 Hill, 621.) And that the nuisance may be abated at common law, or may be indicted. (Russell on Crimes, vol. 1, page 330; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cunningham et al. </em>1 Denio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>524, 536; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Upton, 6 Gray, 473; <em>City of Philadelphia </em>v. <em>The Phila. &amp; R. R. R. Co. </em>58 Penn. 253.) The Board of Supervisors of the city and county are authorized to direct, etc., the summary removal of nuisances and obstructions in the streets, alleys, highways, and public grounds of said city and county, and to make regulations therefor. (Stats. 1863, p. 540, sec. 1, par. 2. And the same statute, in Municipal Reports of 1869\u201470, p. 500.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-6\">6. At common law a common nuisance may be abated by any of the King\u2019s subjects. (Blackst. Com. book 3, p. 5.) And they may cut down a gate erected across the public highway. (Cro. Car. 184.) So of a house built across a highway, etc. (Blackst. Com. book 3, p. 5, note 6; 2 Salk. 458; <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Geary et al. </em>1 Cal. 462.) The Court held that if the erection of Gunter was a nuisance, the defendants were justified in removing it, and yet the power to remove a nuisance summarily was not expressly given by statute in the charter of the city at that time, either in 1850 (p. 223) or in 1851 (p. 357). The statute of this State defining what are nuisances and prescribing a remedy by action does not take away any common-law remedy in the abatement of nuisances which the statute does not embrace. <em>(Stiles et al. </em>v. Laird, 5 Cal. 120.) Any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance, may bring an action, and by the judgment the nuisance may be enjoined or abated, as well as damages recovered. (Sec. 249 Practice Act.) And the obstruction upon a street may be removed, and the nuisance thereby created abated, by action in the name of the People of the State, by the Attorney-General on the relation of any. citizen of the State. See <em>McCauley </em>v. Weller, 12 Cal. 500, etc.; Crittenden\u2019s brief, where the subject is ably discussed; 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 180 <em>et seq. </em>title \u201c Easement,\u201d where it is clearly shown that a highway is for the free use of all the Bang\u2019s subjects, and that the remedy is by proceedings in the name of the King. (Practice Act, sec. 310; Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 803. Sec, also, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Saybrook, </em>21 Conn. 326-7, opinion of Storrs, J.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-7\">In cases of public nuisances upon streets, as by placing ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>structions thereon, the remedy for the Crown is either by information of intrusion at common law, or by an information at the-suit of the Attorney-General in equity. (Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. secs. 921, 922.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">A dedication by act of the Legislature, or of a Common Council, is an exercise of governmental powers, and not those of a mere property holder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-7\">It was by legislation, in the strict sense of the term, that the dedication was made, and only by legislation could the public franchise be destroyed. <em>(McCracken </em>v. <em>The City of San </em>Francisco, 16 Cal. 620, 621.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-9\">7. As to East Street, north of Market: <em>People ex rel. Jacobs </em>v. Kruger, 19 Cal. 411; <em>People ex rel. Burr </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>22 Cal. 11. This last case is a good authority to show that East Street, from Market to Folsom, existed in 1851. (Stats. 1851, p. 313, chap. 49; Stats. 1858, p. 323, chap. 337.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-10\">As to the law of streets, etc., as to the right to close the same, see <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay and Mississippi Canal Co.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-11\">It is now settled that a Court of Equity may take jurisdiction, in cases of public nuisance, by an information filed by the Attorney-General; the jurisdiction seems to have been acted on with great hesitancy and caution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>30 Cal. 379, 387; <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Cleaver, </em>18 Ves. 216; <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Utica Ins.

See, also, the opinions in the cases of <em>Weber </em>v. <em>The Board of State Harbor Commissioners, </em>18 Wall. 57; and <em>Henshaw et al. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>18 Wall. 225.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b472-12\">By the Court, Crockett, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">That East Street was duly dedicated as a public street can admit of no serious doubt, on the facts established at the trial, and it is not denied that at the time of the commencement of the action the defendants were, and for a long time prior thereto had been, using a portion of the street as a lumber yard, obstructing the same with piles of lumber, and preventing the use of it by the public as a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Apparently, the only defense seriously relied upon was the Statute of Limitations, the defendants claiming that they had been in the actual adverse occupation of the premises for more than ten years next before the commencement of the action. Assuming that the evidence proved such actual adverse occupation for ten years \u00f3r more, it must be considered as the settled doctrine of this Court, since, the decision in <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>San </em>Francisco, 50 Cal. 265, that no one can acquire by adverse occupation, as against the public, the right to obstruct a street dedicated to public use, and thus prevent the use of it as a public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Judgment and order affirmed, and it is further ordered that the judgment herein be entered as of the day on which the cause was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Mr. Justice McKinstry did not express any opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
