But the circumstance that the owner shall have decided to remove his stock subsequent to the assessment does not relieve the Assessor of the duty of demanding of the owner the statement set forth in the section. Whether the owner has already determined to remove his live-stock when he gives in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>list of it to the Assessor, or shall subsequently determine to remove it, the duty of making the statement is not imposed on him, unless the Assessor demanded the statement when the list was given or assessment made. The Court below found that no demand for the statement was made by the Assessor. Judgment should, therefore, have gone for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to the Court below to enter judgment for defendants.
