The contract specifies the machinery, and as a part of it a scow of certain proportions; and the complaint avers that at the time of the execution of the agreement and soon thereafter the plaintiff paid to the defendant in advance, as a part of the contract price, several sums of money, amounting in the aggregate to four hundred and thirty-three dollars and fifty cents, and that though the time for performing the contract by the defendant had elapsed, he had never \u201c built, furnished, or put in running order, any peat or other machinery, * * * * and refused so to do; and said plaintiff has never accepted any machinery from said defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We think this is substantially an averment that the defendant had failed and refused to perform any part of the contract; and the action is to recover the money advanced, on the ground that the consideration upon which it was paid had wholly failed. The authorities appear to be uniform to the effect that where a sum of money has been paid upon a consideration which has entirely failed, the law implies a promise to refund it. On the facts stated in the complaint there was, therefore, an implied contract for the direct payment of money, which brings the case within the very terms of the statute defining the cases in which an attachment may issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Order reversed and cause remanded. Remittitur forthwith,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
