The defendant answered, setting up title to the land, and under sec. 838 Code of Civil Procedure the action was transferred to the District Court, where it was tried without a jury, and the plaintiff had judgment in the sum of one hundred and seventeen dollars \u201c in gold coin.\u201d The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-12\"><em>Eli R. </em>Chase, for Appellant, cited <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>38 Cal. 684.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-13\"><em>H.

Cummings, 38 Cal. 683, is in the fact that the complaint here alleges that the plaintiff was the <em>owner </em>of the fences standing upon the land mentioned therein. But this averment added nothing to the complaint or to the cause of action therein set forth, and the gravamen of which was the fact of possession of the land by the plaintiff when- the alleged trespasses were committed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The averment as to ownership of fences might be stricken out, and the cause of action and proof which might have been adduced in its support would be precisely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We think, therefore, upon the views stated in the case referred to, the Justice must be held to have had jurisdiction of the action before its transfer to the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">II. But the judgment for <em>gold coin </em>cannot be supported, and it must be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The judgment of the Court below is therefore modified by striking therefrom the words \u201c <em>in gold coin of the United States </em>\u201d and the cause remanded with directions to make such modification ; the appellant not to recover any costs occasioned by this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
