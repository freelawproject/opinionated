Upon a showing by L the injunction was dissolved, and thereafter L sued B for damages caused by the injunction. At the trial the Court instructed the jury that the mere issuance and service of the injunction was a conversion of the fixtures by B: <em>held, </em>that the instruction was erroneous.\u2014[Beporter.]</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b715-12\">Appeal from the District Court of the Seventeenth Judicial District, Los Angeles County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-13\">Trover for the conversion of certain fixtures and improvements placed upon a lot in Los Angeles. The plaintiff entered into possession of the lot under a conditional agreement to purchase the same from the defendant, as he alleges; that he should make certain improvements, which, in case the sale should not be made, he should have the right to remove. Subsequently, the defendant sued out an injunction against the plaintiff, alleging in his complaint that Lacey, the plaintiff herein, was about to remove the fixtures, and praying that he be enjoined from so doing. The preliminary injunction was granted, but upon the showing made by Lacey the injunction was dissolved. Thereupon this action was commenced for damages alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>been sustained in the conversion by Beaudry of the fixtures. At the trial the Court instructed the jury as follows: \u201c That the said Beaudry, by the issuance and service of said injunction, converted to his own use the fixtures and improvements in plaintiff\u2019s answer in said injunction suit mentioned and described.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-5\">The verdict and judgment were in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b716-6\"><em>Howard, Bronson &amp; Howard, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b716-7\"><em>F.
