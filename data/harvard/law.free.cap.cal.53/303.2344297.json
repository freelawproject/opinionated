At the trial, the plaintiff, on his cross-examination, admitted that he had not worked the claim for several years, but had during the time followed mining in Mexico, the machinery having been removed from the claim. It appeared, also, that he was aware the defendants had applied for a patent, and made no opposition thereto. The defendants were in possession under a patent. The question of abandonment was submitted to the jury, and they returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Judgment was rendered accordingly. Defendants moved for a new trial, which was denied, and they appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>J.
