He testifies that a very short time prior to the murder of More he had a conversation with Sprague, in which the latter said : \u201c \u2018 What are we going to do with More ? He has threatened to take the water away and turn his sheep loose on us, to eat us up.\u2019 I told him I didn\u2019t know; I had nothing'to do with Tom More anyway. I said: \u2018 Some time ago you made the remark, \u201c He ought to be killed, and would have been long ago if anybody had been detailed to kill him,\u201d and perhaps some of these squatters may detail you to kill him.\u2019 He says, \u2018 That is what I want to see you about. There is a party organized to kill More, and I have come to see if you will go with us.\u2019 I asked who the party was. He says, John Curlee, Jesse Jones, Pete Ewanson, Henry Cook, Mr. Churchill, and himself. I told him I didn\u2019t care about being mixed up in the killing of a man. \u2018 Oh,\u2019 he says, \u2018 I will do the killing myself. All I want of you is to stand guard.\u2019 I asked him where he wanted a guard, and he said, ' We want a guard at the shop, at the granary, and at the house, to keep all at bay, should there be any there from the sheep camp.\u2019 I said, \u2018 They will see you. and know you.\u2019 \u2018 Oh, no,\u2019 he says, \u2018 we have a disguise fixed. Take a gunny-sack, and cut some holes in it for your head and arms, and throw a cloth over your \"head, and they won\u2019t know you.\u2019 Says I, \u2018 How is this thing to be done?\u2019 \u2018We have it all planned and fixed,\u2019 he says. ' We have a ball saturated with turpentine, and when it is set on fire we throw it into the barn, and when the barn is on fire that will draw him out, and I will shoot him.\u2019 I says: \u2018 They will see you and know you.\u2019 \u2018 Ho,\u2019 be says, \u2018 we have a disguise fixed.\u2019 Then I says: \u2018 Where do you meet ? at More\u2019s house?\u2019 \u2018Ho,\u2019he says,\u2018we have a place of meeting near a little slough, between Lawton\u2019s house and mine, and the time of meeting is about ten o\u2019clock, and as you approach the slough you give a low whistle, and it will be answered, and some one will come out and show you where we are.\u2019 I told him I could not promise to be there. My wife did not like to stay alone nights, and if I was away she wanted to know where I was and what I was doing. He says: \u2018If it is possible for you to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>there, we want you there.\u2019 I told him I could-not promise, and he went away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">He then testified to a conversation he had with Churchill, another of the alleged conspirators, on the Thursday preceding the. murder, in which Churchill said: \u201c \u2018 To-morrow night is the night fixed to kill Tom More, and we want you to be there. The hour is ten o\u2019clock. The place of meeting is the same as Sprague told you, near a little slough, and the signal is the same\u2014a low whistle, and you give a low whistle, and it will be answered, and some one will come out and conduct you in to where we are. There are parties in it now there is no back-out to. This road is being watched, and the road above, near Law-ton\u2019s.\u2019 He then asked me if I had a shotgun. I told him I had. \u2018 Have you any ammunition ? \u2019 I told him I had not: and he then handed me five buckshot. He said that would be enough, ' and the powder and caps will be furnished you at the rendezvous.\u2019 I told him I could not promise to be there ; that my wife did n\u2019t want to be alone nights, and I could not leave her; something to that effect; if I was away she wanted to know where I was and all about it.\u201d On cross-examination he testified: \u201cI never promised Sprague nor Churchill to help them in that conspiracy.\u201d He also testified that he had never had any previous conversation with Churchill \u201c about, anything of importance, and on that day had called on him to deliver a message to him from Thompkins about some hogs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">It will be observed the witness testified that he had a previous conversation with Sprague ; and in the last conversation he reminded him that in the prior conversation he [Sprague] had remarked: \u201c He [More] ought to be killed, and would have been long ago if anybody had been detailed to kill him,\u201d and thereupon the witness suggested, \u201c Perhaps some of these squatters may detail you to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">There is nothing in his evidence tending to show that in the conversations with Sprague and Churchill he made any effort, either by word or deed, to discourage the conspiracy or to prevent its accomplishment. It does not appear that he gave any warning to More to awaken his suspicions as to the danger impending over him, nor does he assign any reason for having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>omitted to do so, The principal reason assigned to Sprague and Churchill for refusing to promise his aid in the conspiracy was, that his wife did not like to be left alone at night, and when he was away she always wanted to know where he was and what he was doing. Nor did he positively refuse to be present at the rendezvous. The strongest expression he used was, that he \u201c did n\u2019t care about being mixed up in the killing of a man,\u201d and that he would not <em>promise </em>to be there. Nevertheless he accepted from Churchill, without remonstrance, the buckshot with which to load his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">It is not necessary for us to decide whether these circumstances were sufficient to charge him as an accomplice; but if they <em>tended </em>to prove his complicity in the crime, it then became a question for the jury whether the proof was sufficient to establish that fact. The jury was to judge of his credibility, considering the circumstances under which he was testifying, and would have been justified in rejecting his statement that he did not promise to be present, if, on the whole evidence, they did not believe it to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We are of the opinion that the evidence, as detailed above, did tend in <em>some </em>degree to prove that he was an accomplice, and it was for the jury to determine what weight should be given to it. If the witness had been on trial for the murder, and had testified precisely as he did in this case, it would scarcely have been claimed that there was no evidence whatever tending in any degree to establish his complicity in the crime. It may have been slight and insufficient of itself to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; but that would have been a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">At the trial the Court, of its own motion, charged the jury that \u201c there is no evidence in this case tending to show that the witness Brown was an accomplice in the commission of the offense with which the defendant is charged.\u201d This took wholly from the jury the question whether or not lie was an accomplice, and the instruction was erroneous, if there was any evidence, however slight, tending to prove his complicity; and, as we have seen, there was evidence tending, in <em>some </em>degree at least, to establish that fact. Under sec. 1111 of the Penal Code, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>defendant could not have been convicted on the testimony of an accomplice, unless he was corroborated by other evidence, as therein provided; and the Court should have submitted to the' jury, under proper instructions, the question whether or not he was an accomplice. It may have been a question of vital consequence to the defendant, and we cannot say that he was not prejudiced by the ruling of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Wallace, C. J., did not express an opinion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
