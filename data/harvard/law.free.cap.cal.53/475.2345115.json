The right is neither greater nor less than that a natural person possesses. <em>(The Frankford &amp;c. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>The City of Philadelphia, </em>58 Penn. St. 119; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>60 Penn. St. 445.) Where the charter of a corporation is silent on the subject of taxation, the company is liable to pay a specific tax imposed by a subsequent act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Detroit &amp;c. </em>1 Mich. 458.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-17\">And a corporation is not exempted from paying an <em>admlorem </em>\u201e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tax, because it is required by the terms of its charter to pay a specific license tax. <em>(Louisville City Railway Co. </em>v. <em>City of Louisville, </em>4 Bush, 479.) Where there is no exemption in the charter of a bank, it may be required to pay taxes by a subsequent act of the Legislature. <em>(Providence Bank </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>4 Peters, 561; 22 Wall. 375; <em>State </em>v. <em>Herod, </em>29 Iowa, 123; Dillon Municipal Corp. secs. 571-628; <em>Appeal of N. B. &amp; M. R. R. Co. </em>32 Cal. 504 ; <em>City of New Haven </em>v. <em>Fairhaven &amp;c R. R. Co. </em>38 Conn. 430.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-4\">The intention to exempt from taxation or other burdens borne by the citizens generally must clearly appear, and will not be inferred. <em>(Second Municipality of N. O. </em>v. <em>N. O. &amp;c. R. R. Co. </em>10 Robinson; <em>Pacific R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Cass Co. </em>53 Mo. 27; <em>Orange &amp; Alexandria R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Alexandria, </em>17 Gratt. 182; <em>Erie Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>66 Penn. St. 86 ; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>3 W. Va. 331.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-5\">Under the Constitution of this State taxation must be equal, <em>i. e., </em>imposed equally upon all persons or property of a given class within a particular governmental department. Therefore an exemption by the Legislature of a particular individual from any kind of burden lawfully imposed upon other persons or property of the same class, in the same district, is unconstitutional. It is, in fact, an attempt to alienate a right of sovereignty. <em>(Mott </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co. </em>30 Penn. St. 27; <em>Iowa Homestead Co. </em>v. <em>Webster Co. </em>21 Iowa, 227.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-6\"><em>Moore, Laine &amp; Leib, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-7\">The Legislature of California, on March 24th, 1868, (Statutes of 1867-8, p. 259) contracted with S. A. Bishop and others, the grantors of defendants, that he and his co-grantees and their assigns should have the right to lay down, maintain, and operate a railroad over a certain designated route for twenty years, <em>provided </em>they should comply with their part of said contract, viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-8\">1. That the rails should be of iron, and of good and substantial make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-9\">2. That they should run cars thereon every day at convenient hours for the transportation of passengers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>3. That the track-should be laid flush with the streets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">4. That the cars should be of a substantial nature, and so constructed as to insure comfort and convenience to passengers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">5. That the same should be run at a moderate speed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">6. That the railroad should be paved or macadamized, as the city authorities should direct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-8\">7. That the railroad should be built in a certain time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">All these things and others the grantees were to do, or their contract was ended under the express provisions of sec. 7. All this they have done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\">On October 4th, 1875, the City of San Jos\u00e9, through which a portion of said railroad runs, passed an ordinance requiring the defendant to pay a license fax for the privilege of complying with its own contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-11\">It would appear that the bare statement of the action would be its own answer. The city\u2014or stating most favorably for plaintiff, the Legislature, through the city\u2014-after having deliberately made a contract, onerous and stringent upon us, but with which we have strictly complied\u2014a contract upon the strength of which we have invested our money\u2014now seeks to violate it. We submit that good morals, the law, and the two Constitutions themselves, both State and Federal, protect us from this injustice. (Const. of Cal. art. 1, sec. 16; Const. of United States, art. 1, sec. 10, subd. 1; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Second Av. R. R. </em>32 N. Y. 261; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Third Av. R. R. </em>33 N. Y. 42; <em>Stein </em>v. Mayor, 20 Am. 283.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-12\">But the Legislature never attempted to give the city such power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-13\">The power it has is found in Stats. 1875-6, p. 628, where it says: \u201c To license and regulate all and every kind of business authorized by law and transacted and carried on in said city; to fix the rates of license tax upon such business.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-14\">A railroad is not a business within the meaning of these clauses. If it were, still it is not a business transacted or carried on in the city within the meaning of the law. As- well might we say that the Southern Pacific or Central Pacific Eailroads were liable to this tax because part of their roads were within the city. Or, carrying it one step further, everv mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>chant or business man in the State would be liable to this tax, the ramifications of whose business might happen to extend to San Jos\u00e9. Assuming, however, this is the kind of business referred to, still the city has a right to do what ? To regulate and to license it. We need no license permitting us to operate the railroad, for we already have the permission\u2014in fact, it is a part of our duty under the contract with the sovereign. Nor do wc think the city could regulate the railroad, for all the necessary regulations are fully and minutely prescribed by the sovereign and made a part of the contract. Were it otherwise, however, the city could only put on a license tax sufficient to cover the expense of enforcing its regulations of the railroads. This is the true construction of their power. (Cooley Const. Lim. 201.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">The city never attempted to regulate the railroad, and it is apparent that the only object of this ordinance was revenue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">We claim that each of these grounds is an answer to plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-7\">By the Court, Crockett, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The franchise granted by the Act of March 24th, 1868, to Bishop and his associates, to construct a railroad track along and through certain streets of the City of San Jos\u00e9, and to run cars thereon, is not a contract in such sense as to exempt the business or occupation of operating the road from all proper police regulations, or from taxation in the same manner as other occupations may'be taxed, under legislative authority. ( <em>Cooley on </em>Taxation, 385-86; <em>Frankford etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Phila</em>delphia, 58 Pa. St. 119; <em>Johnson </em>v. Philadelphia, 60 Pa. St. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The charter of the City of San Jos\u00e9, in defining the powers of the Common Council, authorizes it, amongst other things, \u201c to license and regulate all and every kind of business authorized by law, and transacted and carried on in said city, and to fix the rates of license <em>tax </em>upon said business.\u201d In construing a similar power conferred upon the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, we said in <em>Ex parte Frank, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>52 Cal. 606, \u201c when the power conferred upon the corporation, as in this case, is to ' license and regulate? callings and occupations, a question has sometimes arisen in the Courts, whether, under such a grant of power, the corporation could exact license fees for purposes of revenue, or should be limited to a sum reasonably sufficient to defray the expense of granting the license. (Dillon on Mun. Corp. 291.) But the rule as stated by Judge Dillon is, that in construing the words of the grant the whole charter and general legislation of the State respecting the subject-matter must be consulted in order to determine whether by the terms \u201c license and regulate \u201d it was intended to authorize licenses for purposes of revenue. Tested by this rule, we held that the power to \u201c license and regulate \u201d occupations in San Francisco included the power to raise revenue for municipal purposes by means of license fees; and the same rule of construction is applicable to the power conferred on the Common Council of San Jos\u00e9. Indeed, the charter itself designates it as a \u201clicense <em>tax </em>upon such business,\u201d indicating clearly that it is a tax on the occupation, and not merely a license to carry on the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">That the Legislature of this State has the power under the Constitution to tax occupations and to authorize municipal corporations to tax them, was settled as early as the case of <em>People </em>v. Coleman, 4 Cal. 46, and we are not aware that the proposition has ever been denied or questioned in any subsequent case. On the contrary, it has been recognized and reaffirmed in <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>California Stage </em>Company, 12 Cal. 134; <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>16 Cal. 120; <em>Ex parte Hurl, </em>49 Cal. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The point made by counsel, that the defendant is not subject to the tax because its cars are not employed wholly within the corporate limits of San Jos\u00e9, is not tenable. The complaint avers and the answer does not deny that the defendant has its principal place of business in San Jos\u00e9, and that it has run its cars through the City of San Jos\u00e9 to the adjoining Town of Santa Clara. In <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>California Stage </em>Company, <em>supra, </em>the point was made that the defendant was not subject to the tax, because its business of conveying passengers in stage coaches was conducted chiefly outside the corporate limits. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the Court held the point to be untenable, and we think correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">At the argument, counsel expressly waived any question as to the right of defendant to employ powers by it employed, or to enjoy the franchises granted to its assignors.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Mr. Justice Rhodes did not express any opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
