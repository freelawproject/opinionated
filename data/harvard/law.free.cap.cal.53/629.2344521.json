But the offense is not particularly described.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">It has repeatedly been held that an indictment is sufficient if it describe the offense charged in the language of the statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaber, </em>32 Cal. 36; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>34 Cal. 183; <em>People </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>34 Cal. 114.) It would have been sufficient, according to the authority of those cases, to have described the intent in the language of the statute\u2014that is to say, to have alleged the.felonious assault, \u201cwith the intent then and there upon the person of the said Caroline Waldfogal to commit a rape.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Potter, supra, </em>it is said that it is not necessary to follow strictly the language of the statute by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the' offense is described, but that words conveying the same meaning may be used. The words employed in the indictment convey the same meaning as the words of the statute, and therefore the indictment is, in that respect, sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">J udgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
