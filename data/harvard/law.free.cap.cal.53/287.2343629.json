The motion was denied, and Adams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Waiving the question whether the judgment would be void if the relief granted exceeded that prayed for, we proceed to inquire whether the relief granted was in fact in excess of the prayer of the complaint. The proposition of the appellant is that the relief granted was excessive, because <em>all </em>the defendants, except Frisbie and De Zaldo, were alleged to have acquired interests in the land which were subject to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the prayer was that the \u201c defendants \u201d be required to convey to the plaintiff the interest which he claimed. As the appellant construes it, this was, in legal effect, a prayer that each defendant convey his proportionate share of the whole amount required to be conveyed. But in the judgment it was adjudicated that the action be dismissed as to the two Carpentiers, who were defendants, and that the other defendants convey to the plaintiff the whole amount claimed. It is argued that because the prayer was that <em>all </em>the defendants convey a quantity sufficient in the aggregate to make up the total amount claimed, and because the decree dismissed the action as to the two Carpentiers, and required the other defendants to convey the whole amount claimed, the relief granted was in excess of that prayed for. But the appellant\u2019s construction of the prayer of the complaint is too narrow. The prayer must receive a reasonable interpretation, and is to be construed in reference to the purposes and nature of the action; and in legal effect, it was a prayer that such of the defendants as should be adjudged to have an interest in the land which was subject to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, be decreed to convey. On the appellant\u2019s theory, if the plaintiff had discovered immediately after the commencement of the action that the Carpentiers had not, and never claimed to have, any interest in the land, and had dismissed the action as to them, after which he had taken a judgment by default against the other defendants, requiring them to convey the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>whole amount claimed, the relief granted would have been in excess of that prayed for. But we do not understand this to have been the scope and intent or legal effect of the prayer. On the contrary, as before stated, its obvious meaning was that the defendants, or such of them as should be adjudged to have an interest in the land which was subject to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, should be required to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Order affirmed. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
