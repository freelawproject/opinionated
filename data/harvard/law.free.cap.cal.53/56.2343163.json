The complaint alleged that the overflow was the consequence of negligence on the part of the defendant, in not'keeping the ditch in repair. The first instruction which is referred to in the opinion was as follows: \u201c If the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">defendant has been guilty of -negligence, such negligence will not entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, unless the evidence shows that the plaintiff has suffered damages from such negligence as the approximate and direct result of such negligence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff upon a verdict of the jury, and the defendant appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">The other facts are stated by the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-10\"><em>Brown &amp; Daggett, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-11\"><em>W.

The law is well settled that in actions for negligence the damages to be recovered are only those of which the negligent act is the <em>proximate </em>cause. The maxim applicable to such actions is \u201c <em>causa pr\u00f3xima non remota </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>spectatur.\u201d (Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, secs. 93-95, and cases there cited. /See also Civil Code, sec. 3333.) If it be claimed that the error in this instruction was cured by the first instruction given at the request of the defendant, the answer is that the two instructions are in this particular contradictory, and it is impossible to determine on which of them the jury acted. <em>(People </em>v. Campbell, 30 Cal. 312 ; <em>Brown </em>v. McAllister, 38 Cal. 573 ; <em>People </em>v. Anderson, 44 Cal. 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.
