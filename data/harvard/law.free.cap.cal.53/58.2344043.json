At the trial, Kimble testified that while he was carrying a washboard in his hands through a street in Stockton, he was knocked down by one Meehan. Kimble immediately shouted \u201cPolice,\u201d when a person standing near whom he recognized as the defendant said, \u201c Hit him again.\u201d Kimble became insensible; and when he recovered, his purse, containing one hundred and thirty-five dollars, was gone. There was evidence that Kimble was intoxicated ; that he was not struck; that Meehan seized the washboard and snatched the purse from Kimble\u2019s pocket at the same instant, and that it was some time afterwards that he discovered his loss and was accosted by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-13\">The defendant asked the Court to instruct the jury as stated in the opinion, but the instruction was refused. He was convicted of robbery, moved for a new trial, which was denied, and appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>L.

Cr. L. 1158.) In the Penal Code,, sec. 484, larceny is defined: \u201c The * * felonious * * taking * * the property of another.\u201d And sec. 211 of the same Code declares: \u201c Robbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, <em>from his person or immediate </em>presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">It is obvious from the foregoing definitions that an indictment for robbery must aver every fact necessary to constitute larceny, and more.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The jury may find a defendant guilty of any offense, the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged in the indictment. (Penal Code, 1159.) And as there was some evidence tending to show that the crime was merely larceny, the defendant had the right to insist on the instruction he requested the Court to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Judgment and order denying new trial reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
