The, Commissioners having examined waters and water rights <em>not </em>upon the peninsula, refused to consider the propriety of purchasing such water or water rights, and made no effort, to purchase water or water rights, except <em>on </em>the peninsula: <em>held, </em>that the event had not occurred which authorized the Commissioners to appoint persons to constir tute a portion of a Board with power to condemn.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">- Original application for mandamus directing the defendants to proceed to act upon appointments made by the Mayor, Auditor, and District Attorney respectively, of Commissioners, in supposed condemnation proceedings under the Act of March 27 th, 1876, \u201cto authorize the City and County of San Francisco to provide and maintain public water works for said City and County, and <em>to </em>condemn and purchase private property for that purpose.\u201d The Feather River Water Company, by its President, John Mullan, filed a petition of intervention, asking that the Board of Water Commissioners be required to consider the advisability of purchasing the water rights of the intervener on Putah Creek, Lake County. The defendants answered, excusing their refusal to act upon the ground that the act was unconstitutional. They moved to dismiss the petition.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-7\"><em>William </em>Irvine, for Petitioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-8\"><em>John </em>Mullan, for Intervener.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-9\"><em>W.

The petition does not show that petitioners ever offered to sell at any price, or that they refused to name a price, and shows affirmatively that the Commissioners never determined on a price to offer for the lands and waters of petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>There was, therefore, no such <em>negotiation </em>as is required by the second section of the Act of March 27th, 1876. Such negotiation is made a necessary preliminary to the appointment of a Board to' condemn.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">2. The act distinctly required that the Commissioners should make careful examination of all water rights, etc., on the peninsula of San Francisco, and \u201c wherever convenient to supply San Francisco with water,\u201d and authorized them to purchase any such rights and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">While it may be that the Court could not be called on to review the judgment of the Commissioners, or to hold that they should purchase one property instead of another, yet it is manifest that they were not empowered arbitrarily to refuse to consider the propriety of purchasing any one of the properties which they had examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">It affirmativ.ely appears from the petition that the Commissioners <em>made no effort </em>to agree as to price with the owners and claimants of any of the properties which they had examined <em>not upon the peninsula ; </em>but that upon receiving the opinion of the City and County Attorney that they had no power to obtain a supply of water from those owning water rights <em>off </em>the peninsula, they confined their efforts to agree on a price, (whatever such efforts may have been) to those owning and claiming such rights <em>on </em>the peninsula.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">As the Commissioners refused to consider the propriety of purchasing any water rights off the peninsula, and made no effort to purchase any such, it follows that they were not au- / thorized to make appointments, or to take any step toward the condemnation of any particular land or water, and no duty was cast upon the Board of Supervisors to take action with reference to the appointments made by the Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u25a0Petition and intervention dismissed, and writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
