In July, 1877, the Court, upon motion of parties interested in the estate, made another order setting aside the former order, and from the last order the executors appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-15\"><em>Geo. F.

In <em>Riddle </em>v. Baker, 13 Cal. 295, it was held that an order vacating a judgment was equivalent to an order granting a new trial, and was appealable. Such an order is also a special order made after judgment. <em>(Bond </em>v. Pacheco, 30 Cal. 530.) An order granting a new trial and \u201c a special order made after judgment,\u201d are appealable under clause 3 of sec. 939, Code of Civil Procedure. This section is applicable to Probate Courts, as to all the Courts of the State. Each proceeding commenced in a Probate Court pending administration must, in the nature of things, be considered a separate suit, or in the nature of a distinct action.
