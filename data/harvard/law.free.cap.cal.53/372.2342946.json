This interest in the rancho was then mortgaged by Eulogio to one Gibbs, whose executor, Patterson, brought suit to foreclose. The defendant appeared in that suit, and filed an answer as attorney for Eulogio. A decree of foreclosure having been rendered, the land was sold to Patterson for the amount of the mortgage and costs\u2014about forty thousand dollars. Eulogio then went to San Francisco for the purpose of selling the interest of the estate in the San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Fernando Rancho, in order to raise money to redeem from the mortgage sale, and at the time the transactions occurred upon which this suit is based, was engaged in negotiating a sale, and the defendant was assisting him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">As to the transactions immediately involved in this suit, plaintiff read in evidence the deposition of defendant given' in an action brought by one Alvarado against Eulogio, for commissions claimed for selling the interest of the estate in the Rancho San Fernando.

I told him I was. Next he stated that he was acting for himself and others, and desired to purchase the ranch, and they would make it an object to me to effect a sale. He said that he was authorized to pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for the ranch, or the interest of the estate of De Celis, and that he would pay me one-half of all that I could get the ranch less than that sum. I immediately went to the office and met Mr. de Celis. I then told Mr. de Celis that I could get one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars for their interest in the rancho\u2014that is, the interest of the estate in the ranch. He replied that he had made up his mind to sell for one hundred and twenty thousand dollars. We talked the matter over for a short time, as to what would be for the best interests of the estate, and he then concluded, and so informed me, that he would sell the interest of the estate for one hundred and seventeen thousand five hundred dollars.\u201d Then, having stated that the trade was consummated, witness continues: \u201c I received from Maclay thirty-seven hundred and fifty dollars for my services in the matter. The defendant also agreed to pay me two thousand five hundred dollars, of which sum I have already received seventeen hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">The Court found that there was no fraud on the part of the defendant, and that the estate had not been injured.
