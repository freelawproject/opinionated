J. Palmer with intent to defraud said corporation. This is the only description of the offense contained in the indictment. The particular entry complained of is not set out in words, nor is it stated according to its legal effect. The averment is, in substance, that on a specified day the defendant made some entry in the books, from which it \u201c appears \u201d that at the commencement of business on that day the cash on hand amounted to a specified sum. But he may have made a hundred entries on that day, and he is not informed by the indictment what particular entry is relied upon as false and fraudulent. Under such an indictment the prosecution would be at liberty to produce any entry made by the defendant which tended to show the amount of money'on hand at the commencement of business on that day; and until the proof was offered the defendant would be ignorant of the particular entry relied upon. An indictment so general in its averments is not in compliance with sec. 950 of the Penal Code, which requires the indictment <em>to </em>contain \u201c a statement of the acts constituting the offense \u201d; nor with sec. 952, which requires it to be direct and certain as to \u201c the particular circumstances of the offense charged, when they are necessary to constitute a complete offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Judgment affirmed?</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
