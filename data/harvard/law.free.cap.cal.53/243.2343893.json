Croly, was intimately acquainted with the deceased, having occupied a room in her house for about ^even years previous to her death, and she always advised with him in her business' transactions. She told him before her death that she wished him to settle up her affairs in case of her death. Immediately before her death she attempted to dictate a will, and at that time requested Croly to act as her executor, but she died without completing the will. Croly filed a petition May 27th, 1878, praying for letters of administration upon the estate. The petition was accompanied by the written request of the three heirs that he be appointed administrator. On May 30th, 1878, Troy Dye, the Public Administrator, filed his petition praying that letters of administration be issued to him, and objecting to the appointment of Croly.

The distributees and next of kin in this case are <em>married </em>women, and incapable, therefore, themselves of administering upon the estate, and their expressed preferences for the appointment of Croly, as set forth in their petition filed in the Probate Court, were of no legal consequence whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">2. But had it been otherwise in this respect, and had the next of kin been laboring under no such disability, their petition requesting the appointment of Croly was addressed to the <em>mere discretion </em>of the Probate Judge; it did not operate to supersede the claim of the Public Administrator, otherwise established under the statute, to receive letters of administration, and it not appearing that the Probate Court in refusing to appoint Croly has abused the discretion confided to it in terms by the statute, the order will not be disturbed, but must be affirmed here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Order affirmed.
