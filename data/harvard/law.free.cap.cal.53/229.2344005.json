The trustees, Samuel Poorman and H. G. Smith, were appointed commissioners, and were ordered to sell the land, upon due notice of time and terms of sale; to execute a deed to the purchaser, vesting him with the title in fee, and giving him the right to the immediate possession and to a writ of assistance. The commissioners subsequently reported having complied with the decree, having sold the land November 8th, 1877; and thereupon the Court made an order approving and confirming their proceedings. The purchaser, McKee, demanded possession of the land from the defendant, and being refused, he applied for a writ of assistance, which was granted November 24th, 1877. The defendant appealed from the order granting the writ.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\"><em>R. P. &amp; H. N. Clement, </em>for Appellant, argued that the defendant had a right to redeem from the sale within six months, as in case of an ordinary mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-10\"><em>D.

From this order no appeal appears to have been taken, and we think that the effect of the order of confirmation, irrespective of the language of the .decree, was to deny the right of the appellant to redeem from the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Order affirmed. Bemittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
