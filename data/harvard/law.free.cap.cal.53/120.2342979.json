(2 Parsons on Notes and Bills, 534, 536, and 537; <em>Darlin </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>11 Maine, 434; <em>Stocking </em>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>5 Pick. 181; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>3 Scam. 71; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>11 N. H. 375; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>51 Cal. 166.) The answer sets out the contract for the purchase of the stock of goods by defendants from plaintiff, and alleges that the note was given for the sole purpose of showing the amount due after the payment of the first installment under said contract. Taking the allegations of the answer to be true, the promise to pay in six months was without consideration to support it. There was neither gain or benefit to the makers, nor loss or injury suffered by the payee. This want of consideration could be established by parol evidence. (1 Parsons on Bills and Notes, 194.) The agreement set out in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>answer was a part of the note. (2 Parsons on Notes and Bills, 539-553; <em>Brannan </em>v. <em>Mesick, </em>10 Cal. 106.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-6\"><em>Geo. W. Schell, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">The rule of law is well established, that parol evidence cannot be admitted to alter, vary, or control a written contract; nor to annex thereto a condition or defeasance not appearing in the contract itself; nor to show that the parties intended a different contract from that expressed in the writing signed by them. ( <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Simonds, </em>12 Met. 277; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>48 Barb. 283; 2 Wharton\u2019s Evidence, sec. 1058; <em>Forsythe </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>91 U.
