Assuming this <em>to </em>be the correct construction, the effect of this provision is that if a witness is willfully false in one portion of his testimony he \u201c is to be distrusted in others \u201d; and not that his whole testimony is to be absolutely rejected. If the rule was otherwise at common law, the Code has changed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The instruction asked was correctly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Mr. Justice Rhodes did not express any opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
