This action was commenced May 2nd, 1878, the plaintiff claiming that by the terms of the mortgage the debt secured thereby was due, by reason of a default in the payment of the interest for more than sixty days\u2014the total amount of interest paid being two thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and eighty-two cents.

McDonald might pay out of the rents received such sums as by the contracts between the mortgagor and the tenants in possession were to be paid by the former, but he was not authorized to pay taxes or make other expenditures <em>merely </em>because the mortgagee, by the terms of the mortgage, had the right to make them (and to have his lien therefor) in case they were not paid by the mortgagor. To construe the stipulation as authorizing the agent, McDonald, to make such expenditures, would be to construe it as authorizing him to pay such sums as would, perhaps, reduce the rents received, so that they would be insufficient to meet the interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and thus set the sixty days running contrary to the meaning and intent of the covenants of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
