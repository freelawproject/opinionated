Barney &amp; Co., and endorsed by the payee to the plaintiff. Two of the witnesses testified that the note was endorsed July 2nd, 1874, and another that it was not endorsed until September 20th, 1875. The defense was that the amount due on the. note had been paid by the defendants to Barney &amp; Co. between the 13th and the 20th of August, 1874. There was evidence that Barney <em>&amp; </em>Co., who were dealers in grain, kept a banking account with the plaintiff, that his account was overdrawn, that the note was deposited as collateral security, and that they were continuously thereafter indebted to the plaintiff in a sum equal to the amount due upon the note. The case was tried by the Court with a jury, and the following was the first instruction given, at the request of the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-13\">\u201c If the jury believe from the evidence that the note sued on in this action remained the property of J. H. Barney &amp; Co. until it was overdue, and was paid by the maker to J. IT. Barney &amp; Co., without notice that it had been assigned to any other party, the jury must find for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-14\">At the request of the plaintiff, the following instructions were given:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-15\">1. \u201cIf the jury find from the evidence that the note in controversy was endorsed and delivered to the Bank by J.
