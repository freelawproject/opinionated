Judgment by default was entered by the Clerk. The summons notified the defendant that if he failed to appear and answer the complaint, the plaintiff \u201c will take judgment against you by default for the above named sum and accruing costs.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">It is provided by sec. 1852 of the Political Code that \u201c the law regulating proceedings in civil cases in the Courts of justice in this State, so far as the same are not inconsistent with the provisions of this article, is. hereby made applicable to proceedings under this article.\u201d That article does not contain any provisions prescribing the form of the summons where the suit is against the person indebted for the tax; and therefore it must conform to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Sec. 407 of that Code provides that in an action other than an action arising on contract for the recovery of money or damages only, the summons must contain a \u201c notice that unless the defendant appears and answers, the plaintiff will apply to the Court for the relief demanded in the complaint.\u201d The publication of the summons which omitted the above notice did not authorize the Clerk to enter the default of the defendant. The Clerk is authorized by sec. 585 Code of Civil Procedure to enter judgment by default only in \u201c an action upon contract for the recovery of money or damages only.\u201d In other cases, application for judgment must be made to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
