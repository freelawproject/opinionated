Every other crime is a misdemeanor; or, when a crime punishable by imprisonment in the State Prison is also punishable by fine or imprisonment in a county jail, in the discretion of the Court, it shall be deemed a misdemeanor for all purposes after a judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment in the State Prison.\u201d (Amendment of 1874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The offense of which the defendant was convicted was, therefore, only a misdemeanor, and no appeal lies from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Mr. Justice McKinstry expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
