This finding is as follows : \u201c That all the issues of fact raised by the pleadings in this case arc hereby found and decided in favor of the plaintiffs, and against said defendant.\u201d We do not think this finding sufficient. To say that all the issues of fact raised by the pleadings are found and decided in favor of either party, suggests an inquiry as to what issues are raised by the pleadings\u2014a question often found to be one of no little difficulty to determine, and concerning which, in this case, the views of the Court below may be widely different from our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>We think the finding under consideration as indefinite in its character as the finding that \u201c all the material allegations of the complaint \u201d are resolved in favor of a named one or other of the parties, and which we have held insufficient as a finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Judgment and order denying new trial reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.
