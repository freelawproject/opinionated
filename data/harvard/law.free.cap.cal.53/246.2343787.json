The person who <em>bets at </em>a banking game cannot be said to <em>play </em>the game, within the meaning of that section of the Code. There is no other section of the Code applicable to the alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Nor, in our opinion, can the person who bets at the game\u2014\u25a0 who wagers a sum of money \u201c against the bank kept at the game \u201d\u2014be held to be an accessory to the crime of gaming, as .defined in that section. The intent in the case of betting at the game is quite different from that in the case of gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Ordered that the defendant be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
