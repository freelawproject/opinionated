F. Somers to purchase said land is so void and insufficient, inasmuch as it does not conform to the requirements of the Act of April 27th, 1863, under which it was made, and is not accompanied by the affidavit of three disinterested persons, stating, among other things, that the applicant, W. F. Somers, is a resident of this State, and that the lands were unoccupied by any person except said applicant, W. F. Somers. That said application of W. F. Somers, not being accompanied by such affidavit of three disinterested persons, is insufficient under a decree of the Supreme Court of this State, in the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of <em>Jas. F. Cunningham </em>v. <em>John Crowley, </em>rendered at its October Term, 1875, and to which decree reference is hereby made. And I also protest against the issuance of patent for said lands to said Somers for other reasons not necessary to be stated in this protest. I also hereby claim that location number one thousand one hundred and ninety-five of Los Angeles Land District, in my own name, and embracing the land herein described, is a good and valid application for said land, and is on file in the office of the Surveyor General of this State, and that under said application I have the right, as against any other person or persons, to become the purchaser of said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Wherefore, I demand that the contest so arising as to who has the better right to become the purchaser of said land fA&gt;m the State of California be referred by you to the proper Court for judicial determination.
