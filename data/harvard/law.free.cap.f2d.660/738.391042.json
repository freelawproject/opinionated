He alleges denial of due process and effective assistance of counsel because his attorney waived his state right to a 12-person jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-22\">Cooks was present when his counsel requested a 6-person jury and voiced no objection until after trial, a guilty verdict by the jury, and his incarceration. The state courts rejected his claim that the waiver was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-23\">He claims the trial court denied him due process when it deprived him of his state-created right to a knowing and voluntary election of a jury of less than 12 persons. <em>See generally State v. Allman, </em>19 Wash. App. 169, 173, 573 P.2d 1329, 1332 (1977); Wash.Crim.R. 6.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-24\">Violations of state law, without more, do not deprive a defendant of due process. <em>La Brasca v. Misterly, </em>423 F.2d 708, 709 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 838, 91 S.Ct. 77, 27 L.Ed.2d 72 (1970); <em>Quigg </em>v. <em>Crist, </em>466 F.Supp. 544, 549 (D.Mont.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>616 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 922, 101 S.Ct. 323, 66 L.Ed.2d 150 (1980). <em>See generally Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970) (federal constitution does not guarantee 12-person juries in state criminal trials). Habeas corpus relief for an asserted violation of due process is available only when the state court\u2019s action is arbitrary or fundamentally unfair. <em>United States ex rel. Burnett v. Illinois, </em>619 F.2d 668, 670 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 880, 101 S.Ct. 229, 66 L.Ed.2d 104 (1980); <em>see Debra P. v. Turlington, </em>644 F.2d 397, 404 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-25\">Cooks\u2019 claim is indistinguishable from that rejected by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Burnett. </em>We agree with the Seventh Circuit that an attorney\u2019s waiver of a 12-per-son jury, with the defendant\u2019s silent presence, does not constitute an arbitrary or fundamentally unfair trial. The procedure followed by the state court did not deprive Cooks of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>To show he was denied effective assistance of counsel, Cooks must establish that he failed to receive \u201creasonably effective and competent defense representation,\u201d <em>Cooper v. Fitzharris, </em>586 F.2d 1325, 1329 (9th Cir. 1978) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1542, 59 L.Ed.2d 793 (1979), and that he suffered resulting prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Since a smaller jury presents both potential advantages and disadvantages for a defendant, <em>see Bailew </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 229-39, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 1033-38, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978), the jury-size decision by Cooks\u2019 attorney was tactical. As such, it fails to support a charge of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Gustave v. United States, </em>627 F.2d 901, 904 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">His claim of prejudice amounts to mere speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
