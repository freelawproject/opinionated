HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">This appeal involves the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus made by a Georgia state inmate under sentence of death. Petitioner John Eldon Smith, a/k/a Anthony Isalldo Machetti, was convicted on two counts of murder in the Superior Court of Bibb County, Georgia and on January 30, 1975 was sentenced to die.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed both his conviction and sentence, <em>Smith v. State, </em>236 Ga. 12, 222 S.E.2d 308, <em>cert. denied, </em>428 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 3224, 49 L.Ed.2d 1219 (1976), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Smith v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 3224, 49 L.Ed.2d 1219 (1976). Smith then unsuccessfully petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the denial of relief, <em>Smith v. Hopper, </em>240 Ga. 93, 239 S.E.2d 510 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 950, 98 S.Ct. 2859, 56 L.Ed.2d 793 (1978), and again the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Smith v. Hopper, </em>436 U.S. 950, 98 S.Ct. 2859, 56 L.Ed.2d 793 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">Having exhausted his state court remedies, Smith sought a writ of habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district judge referred Smith\u2019s case to a magistrate, whose proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were adopted as the opinion of the court. Accordingly, on November 26, 1980, the district court denied the request for a writ. Smith now appeals from that denial. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the dismissal of Smith\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On appeal Smith raises three main issues. First, he contends that the exclusion from the jury, for cause, of two veniremen who were unequivocally opposed to the death penalty violated his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments in three distinct respects: (1) exclusion of these veniremen resulted in a jury that was conviction prone and thus less than neutral on the issue of guilt, in violation of his right to trial by an impartial jury; (2) their exclusion violated his right to trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross-section of the community; and (3) the cumulative effect of such death qualification of jurors infringed his sixth amendment interest in a properly functioning jury. Second, Smith urges that his death sentence was imposed pursuant to an arbitrary and racially discriminatory pattern of capital sentencing in Georgia. Finally, he challenges the constitutional adequacy of Georgia\u2019s capital sentencing\u2019 review procedures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">I. THE COMPOSITION OF SMITH\u2019S JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">A. Right to Trial by an Impartial Jury During voir dire examination of the jury venire from which the jury that convicted Smith was selected, two persons unambiguously expressed their opposition to the death penalty, indicating that they would automatically vote against imposition of that penalty without regard to evidence presented in the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These veniremen were excused for cause in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the practice approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Smith contends that the exclusion for cause of these veniremen violated his right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to an impartial jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He asserts an argument considered but rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>\u2014 namely that those veniremen who remain on the jury after the exclusion of those unalterably opposed to the death penalty are more conviction prone than the ones excluded under the \u201cdeath qualifying\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> procedure. While Smith does not challenge the exclusion of these unalterably death-opposed veniremen from the panel that determines the penalty to be imposed, he asserts that their being excluded from the guilt determination stage<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> results in the creation of an unconstitutionally conviction-biased jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In support of his contention, Smith offers a plethora of studies, some of which were before the Court in Witherspoon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In rejecting this constitutional objection in Witherspoon,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"AOG\">The data adduced by the petitioner . . . are too tentative and fragmentary to establish that jurors not opposed to the death penalty tend to favor the prosecution in the determination of guilt. We simply cannot conclude, either on the basis of the record now before us or as a matter of judicial notice, that the exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment results in an unrepresentative jury on the issue of guilt or substantially increases the risk of conviction. In light of the presently available information, we are not prepared to announce a per se constitutional rule requiring the reversal of every conviction returned by a jury selected as this one was.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">391 U.S. at 517-18, 88 S.Ct. at 1774-75 (footnote omitted). However, the Court did not foreclose a defendant, having more persuasive evidence of juror tendencies, from asserting the guilt proneness of death-qualified jurors in a subsequent case. Some of the issues that would then arise were suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Even so, a defendant convicted by such a jury in some future case might still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>attempt to establish that the jury was less than neutral with respect to guilt. If he were to succeed in that effort, the question would then arise whether the State\u2019s interest in submitting the penalty issue to a jury capable of imposing capital punishment may be vindicated at the expense of the defendant\u2019s interest in a completely fair determination of guilt or innocence \u2014 given the possibility of accommodating both interests by means of a bifurcated trial, using one jury to decide guilt and another to fix punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"AyE\"><em>Id. </em>at 520 n.18, 88 S.Ct. at 1776. Seizing this invitation, Smith argues that the studies he has offered provide the requisite degree of proof.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">We assume without deciding that Smith\u2019s evidence does indeed supply the persuasiveness found lacking by the Supreme Court and by many other courts, both federal and state, since <em>Witherspoon.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nevertheless, for reasons to be discussed, we hold that the exclusion for cause from Smith\u2019s jury of veniremen so unequivocally opposed to the death penalty that they would not follow the law on the subject did not deny his constitutional right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">In <em>Spinkellink </em>v. <em>Wainwright, 578 </em>F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1978), this court rejected the precise contention now urged by Smith.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Today we reaffirm the rationale set forth in <em>Spinkellink.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">That a death-qualified jury is more likely to convict than a nondeath-qualified jury does not demonstrate which jury is impartial. It indicates only that a death-qualified jury might favor the prosecution and that a nondeath-qualified jury might favor the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 594.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">All veniremen are ' potentially biased. The process of voir dire is designed to cull from the venire persons who demonstrate that they cannot be fair to <em>either </em>side of the case. Clearly, the extremes must be eliminated \u2014 i. e., those who, in spite of the evidence, would automatically vote to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>or impose the death penalty or automatically vote to acquit or impose a life sentence. The guarantee of impartiality cannot mean that the state has a right to present its case to the jury <em>most </em>likely to return a verdict of guilt, nor can it mean that the accused has a right to present his case to the jury <em>most </em>likely to acquit. But the converse is also true. The guarantee cannot mean that the state must present its case to the jury <em>least </em>likely to convict or impose the death penalty, nor that the defense must present its ease to the jury <em>least </em>likely to find him innocent or vote for life imprisonment. Yet Smith here urges that he has a constitutional right to a jury <em>more </em>likely than a death-qualified jury to find him innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In essence, Smith urges us to define \u201cimpartial\u201d as a middle ground that involves a jury with persons who are in effect defendant prone.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The logical converse of the proposition that death-qualified jurors are conviction prone is that nondeath-qualified jurors are acquittal prone, not that they are neutral. Smith offers no proof that inclusion of veniremen currently excludable under <em>Witherspoon </em>will not tip the balance in the guilt/innocence determination in favor of the accused.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The state as well as the accused enjoys a right to an impartial jury. <em>See Hayes v. Missouri, </em>120 U.S. 68, 70-71, 7 S.Ct. 350, 351, 30 L.Ed. 578 (1887); <em>Williams v. Wainwright, </em>427 F.2d 921, 923 (5th Cir. 1970), <em>modified, </em>408 U.S. 941, 92 S.Ct. 2864, 33 L.Ed.2d 765 (1972). Such a tilt of the scales of justice would violate that right. As recognized in <em>Spinkellink, </em>the danger of a defendant prone jury is too great to accede to Smith\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The state has decided that the parties\u2019 right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to an impartial jury and the state\u2019s interest in the just and even-handed application of its laws, including [the state\u2019s] death penalty, are too fundamental to risk a defendant-prone jury from the inclusion of such veniremen. The Constitution does not prohibit this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">578 F.2d at 596.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">B. Destruction of the Whimsical Doubt While we reject Smith\u2019s argument that conviction by a death-qualified jury violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>his right to an impartial jury, we are fully cognizant that, with regard to the guarantee of impartiality, there are strong competing interests on both sides. As the Supreme Court indicated in dicta in <em>Wither-spoon, </em>the question is one of accommodation. The Court stated that, even if a defendant proved that the jury which convicted him was less than neutral,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the issue would then become \u201cwhether the State\u2019s interest in submitting the penalty issue to a jury capable of imposing capital punishment may be vindicated at the expense of the defendant\u2019s interest in a completely fair determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. at 520 n.18, 88 S.Ct. at 1776. Thus the Court characterizes the dilemma as a problem of remedy and invites consideration of a remedy which, while accommodating the state\u2019s interest in submitting the penalty issue to a jury capable of voting for death may be less restrictive of the defendant\u2019s interests than is the current scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">With this \u201cless restrictive alternative\u201d approach in mind, the Supreme Court suggested,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and petitioner Smith urged at oral argument, the use of a bifurcated trial, with one jury to determine guilt and another to fix punishment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This court is not persuaded, however, that this procedure would in fact be less restrictive of the capital defendant\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed our fear is that, were we to sanction such a remedy as an appropriate balance of constitutional rights, we would deprive the capital defendant of important benefits which the current system affords him.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">As capital trials are currently conducted in Georgia, the same jury sits at both the guilt and penalty phase.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is a potential benefit to a defendant inherent in such a procedure which would be lost were the jury which found guilt discharged and a new jury empanelled to decide punishment. We cannot point to any empirical data in this record demonstrating such a benefit, but we ought not ignore reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">The fact that jurors have determined guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not necessarily mean that no juror entertained <em>any </em>doubt whatsoever. There may be no <em>reasonable </em>doubt \u2014 doubt based upon reason \u2014 and yet some <em>genuine </em>doubt exists. It may reflect a mere possibility; it may be but the whimsy of one juror or several. Yet this whimsical doubt \u2014 this absence of absolute certainty \u2014 can be real.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The capital defendant whose guilt seems abundantly demonstrated may be neither obstructing justice nor engaged in an exercise in futility when his counsel mounts a vigorous defense on the merits. It may be proffered in the slight hope of unanticipated success; it might seek to persuade one or more to prevent unanimity for conviction; it is more likely to produce only whimsical doubt. Even the latter serves the defendant, for the juror entertaining doubt which does not rise to reasonable doubt can be expected to resist those who would impose the irremedial penalty of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Under Georgia\u2019s present procedure, such a juror would sit to decide punishment. The right to have that juror \u2014 or those jurors \u2014 , entertaining whimsical doubt, on the penalty jury is of undoubted value to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The scheme appellant here urges upon us would effectively destroy the whimsical doubt. The guilt-determining jurors \u2014 including those not absolutely certain \u2014 would be thanked for their service and discharged. A new jury, including only those willing to impose the death penalty, would be selected. They would entertain no doubt that the defendant before them was, indeed, the guilty party. Presumably they would be instructed that the defendant was the guilty party. They would hear only evidence of aggravating circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime \u2014 and mitigation if there be evidence of such. Not even a flimsy alibi would disturb their deliberations; no suggestion of misidentification would be material. Certainty of guilt would replace any whimsical doubt entertained by the discharged jurors. Some may conclude that the destruction of the whimsical doubt, sought here by appellant, would involve a more serious deprivation of the benefits of the constitutionally guaranteed jury trial than envisioned by Smith\u2019s advocates in this appeal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In short, Smith has not persuaded us that the remedy he has suggested is a better accommodation of the state\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s interests than is the present system.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">That there is no record in this case evaluating the impact of the two-jury system upon important interests of the defendant further illustrates the shortcomings of appellant\u2019s case. A compilation of data from experience or experiment might show the relative likelihood of the imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>death penalty by jurors directed to accept the guilt of defendant and by jurors who have heard and considered defendants\u2019 attacks upon prosecutors\u2019 fact cases. Absent such data, mere proof of the coincidence of exclusions for cause and elimination of tendencies of excused veniremen is but a fragment of the whole picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">What we have written here is not based upon a review of the record in this case. We merely presume to some understanding of the place of a jury in our system for the administration of justice. That role is, in the end, \u201cthe interposition between the accused and his accuser of the eommonsense judgment of a group of laymen\u201d spoken of in <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1905, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">C. Right to a Jury Chosen from a Fair Cross-Section of the Community</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> Smith also argues that the exclusion for cause of veniremen opposed to the death penalty infringed his right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to a jury which is representative of the community. <em>Taylor v. Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 538, 95 S.Ct. 692, 701, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975), clearly establishes that the \u201cvenires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in the community and thereby fail to be reasonably representative thereof.\u201d In reliance on <em>Taylor, </em>Smith urges that death-opposed jurors comprise a distinctive group whose systematic exclusion violates the sixth amendment. Although the fair cross-section requirement does not mean that the jury actually chosen must mirror the community and reflect the various distinctive groups in the population, <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions concerning the jury trial guarantee do intimate that this sixth amendment right comprehends a <em>fair possibility </em>for obtaining a jury which is representative of the community. <em>See Peters v. Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 500, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 2167, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972); <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1905, 26 L.Ed.2d 466 (1970). The exclusion of veniremen unalterably opposed to the death penalty undoubtedly reduces the possibility of obtaining a jury which represents a true cross-section of the community. Any elimination of prospective jurors who are disqualified potentially impairs the achievement of a true cross-section on the particular jury. Nevertheless it must be remembered that a jury which reflects a fair cross-section of the community is a goal that is never to be achieved at the cost of leaving on the jury those veniremen who are legitimately disqualified. As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201cThe fair cross section principle must have much leeway in application. The States remain free to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions so long as it may be fairly said that the jury list or panels are representative of the community.\u201d 419 U.S. at 537-38, 95 S.Ct. at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">One would not suppose, for example, that defendant Jones who. was on trial for murder in Jones County, 85% of which is populated by members of the Jones family, is entitled to a jury on which members of the Jones family serve, even though a jury from which Jones family members are excluded would not reflect a fair cross-section of the community. Thus, relationship to the defendant is a legitimate disqualification even though, in our hypothetical, such exclusion negates <em>any </em>possibility of obtaining a jury which is representative of the particular community. Likewise, unalterable opposition to capital punishment is a legitimate disqualification even though it reduces the possibility of achieving a true cross-section on the particular jury. As stated by the Supreme Court, even if the defendant establishes a prima facie viol\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tion of the fair cross-section requirement,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the state may justify the infringement by proof of \u201ca significant State interest [which is] manifestly and primarily advanced by those aspects of the jury-selection process, such as exemption criteria, that result in the disproportionate exclusion of the distinctive group.\u201d <em>Duren v. Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357,- 367-68, 99 S.Ct. 664, 670, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979) (footnote omitted). \u201c[T]he parties\u2019 right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to an impartial jury and the state\u2019s interest in the just and evenhanded application of its laws\u201d supply the necessary justification. <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 597 (5th Cir. 1978). For these reasons, we hold that unalterable opposition to the death penalty is a legitimate disqualification and that the exclusion of such disqualified jurors does not violate the fair cross-section principle of the sixth amendment. The fair cross-section must, in the end, be fair. Neither the state nor the defendant is entitled to an unfair juror whose interests, biases or prejudices will determine his or her resolution of the issues regardless of the law and regardless of the facts. A cross-section of the fair and impartial is more desirable than a fair cross-section of the prejudiced and biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">D. Right to a Properly Functioning Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Relying on <em>Ballew v. Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978), Smith argues that the process of death qualification has the same damaging effects condemned as a violation of sixth and fourteenth amendment interests in <em>Ballew. </em>In that case the Supreme Court concluded that a state criminal trial to a jury of only five persons deprived the accused of the jury trial right guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments. The Court\u2019s conclusion rested on empirical evidence suggesting that the smaller size of the jury had detrimental effects on group deliberation, on the accuracy and consistency of results, and on the representation of minority viewpoints in jury decisionmaking. <em>Id. </em>at 232-38, 98 S.Ct. at 1035-38. By analogy Smith contends that death qualification is unconstitutional because it limits the attitudinal perspectives represented on the jury, thereby inhibiting the counterbalancing of biases during the deliberative process,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and excludes a significant minority viewpoint.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Smith\u2019s analogy to <em>Ballew </em>is inappropriate. The Supreme Court\u2019s concern in <em>Ballew </em>focused on the effect of <em>size </em>on the proper functioning of the jury. The Court\u2019s task was that of simply drawing a line, of setting a constitutional minimum for the size of juries in nonpetty criminal cases. <em>See Ballew v. Georgia, </em>435 U.S. at 245 \u2014 46, 98 S.Ct. at 1041-42. (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he line between five- and six-member juries is difficult to justify, but a line has to be drawn somewhere if the substance of jury trial is to be preserved.\u201d). Thus the Court limited its focus to this question. It did not purport to establish, as Smith would have us accept, a sweeping constitutional rule stating that factors which, considered individually, do not infringe an accused\u2019s sixth and fourteenth amendment rights may effect, when viewed in the aggregate, a violation of those rights. The Court in <em>Ballew </em>was not inviting defendants to allege as many \u201cnegative\u201d factors as possible with the hope of reaching the threshold level for a sixth amendment violation. Moreover, the analogy to <em>Ballew </em>is faulty because Smith is concerned with the particular attitudinal composition of the jury and seeks to require the inclusion of a particular viewpoint \u2014 i.e., the view of those irrevocably opposed to the death penalty\u2014 on any jury that determines his guilt or innocence. So phrased, Smith\u2019s argument manifests itself as simply another way of claiming that the jury which convicted him was not fairly representative of the community. We have considered and rejected this claim above.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Having examined each aspect of Smith\u2019s constitutional attack on the exclusion of veniremen irrevocably opposed to the death penalty, we conclude that Smith\u2019s jury was constitutionally composed. We are not prepared to nullify <em>Witherspoon </em>by holding that the death qualification process approved therein violates the defendant\u2019s rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">II. ARBITRARY &amp; CAPRICIOUS IMPOSITION OF DEATH PENALTY</p>\n<p id=\"A9m\">Smith next contends that his sentence was imposed pursuant to a pattern and practice of wholly arbitrary and capricious infliction of the Georgia death penalty in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments. The district court properly found <em>Spinkellink </em>controlling on this issue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">In <em>Spinkellink </em>this court observed \u201cthat if a state follows a properly drawn statute in imposing the death penalty, then the arbitrariness and capriciousness \u2014 and therefore the racial discrimination \u2014 condemned in <em>Furman [Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] have been conclusively removed.\u201d <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 613-14 (5th Cir. 1978) (footnotes omitted). Smith construes <em>Spinkellink </em>as precluding constitutional challenges to the <em>application </em>of a death penalty statute and argues that <em>Godfrey v.

It merely established that in the absence of proof of \u201csome specific act or acts evidencing intentional or purposeful . . . discrimination <em>against [the petitioner]\u201d </em>on the basis of race, sex, or wealth, a petitioner is not entitled to relief on habeas corpus. 578 F.2d at 614 n.40 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As in <em>Spinkellink, </em>we find Smith\u2019s claim brimming with \u201c[m]ere conclusory allegations\u201d of discrimination, <em>id., </em>and wanting in proof of intentional discrimination against him in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The equal protection aspect of Smith\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of the application of Georgia\u2019s death penalty suffers from a similar deficiency. Smith has adduced evidence that \u201cracial factors [are] evident in Georgia capital sentencing patterns.\u201d Brief for Petitioner-Appellant at 40. Even if this evidence were sufficient to prove a racially disproportionate impact \u2014 and we do not decide that it is \u2014 such evidence alone cannot establish an equal protection violation. To trigger strict scrutiny of a statute, proof of intentional or purposeful discrimination is necessary. <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 265, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2059, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976); <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 615 (5th Cir. 1978). Without such proof,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> any discriminatory impact may be explained on nonracial grounds. <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d at 615. As we have already observed, the state has a legitimate interest in prescribing relevant qualifications for jurors to protect against jurors with pro-defendant biases. Having failed to prove a racially discriminatory intent or purpose in the application of Georgia\u2019s death penalty, Smith has not established a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">III. GEORGIA\u2019S CAPITAL SENTENCING REVIEW PROCEDURES</p>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">Smith\u2019s final complaint centers on the constitutional adequacy of Georgia\u2019s capital sentencing review procedures. On review of a case in which the death penalty is imposed, the Georgia Supreme Court is charged with determining:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">(1) Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">(2) Whether . . . the evidence supports the jury\u2019s . . . finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance :. ., and</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">(3) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2537(c) (1978). Georgia\u2019s statutory scheme for the imposition of the death penalty, including this provision for expedited appellate review by the Georgia Supreme Court, was held to be constitutional on its face by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell &amp; Stevens, JJ.). Smith contends that the approval in <em>Gregg </em>was conditioned on the Court\u2019s assumption about the procedural protections afforded by appellate review and that this assumption has proven to be unfounded. In support of this claim, he relies on a study purporting to show that the methods used by the Georgia Supreme Court to evaluate excessiveness and disproportionality are scientifically unsound and have exaggerated, not reduced, the racial and geographic disparities present in capital sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>fencing. We cannot conclude, as the district court apparently could not,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> on the basis of this evidence that the Georgia Supreme Court is \u201cincapable of performing its task adequately in all cases.\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 224, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2949, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (White, J., concurring). Nor has Smith \u201ceven attempted to establish that the Georgia Supreme Court failed properly to perform its task <em>in this case.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">To the contrary, the Georgia Supreme Court followed the statutory mandate imposed by \u00a7 27-2537(c). It determined that the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors and, after carefully reviewing the evidence, concluded that the evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that Smith committed the murders for the purpose of receiving money or other things of monetary value, the statutory aggravating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 27-2534.1(b)(4). <em>Smith v. State, </em>236 Ga. 12, 24, 222 S.E.2d 308, 317-18, <em>cert. denied, </em>428 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 3224, 49 L.Ed.2d 1219 (1976). As part of its comparative sentence review, the court also found that the sentence of death in this case was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalties in similar cases, expressly noting the pattern it discerned in the imposition of the death penalty in multiple murder cases. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 222 S.E,2d at 318. We therefore reject Smith\u2019s contention that Georgia\u2019s appellate review procedure in capital cases is constitutionally defective and that it operated ineffectively in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-14\">. The victims of Smith\u2019s crimes were Joseph Ronald Akins and his wife of twenty days, Juanita Knight Akins. Mr. Akins was the ex-husband of Smith\u2019s wife, Rebecca Akins Smith Machetti. The murder of Mr. and Mrs. Akins was part of a scheme to secure the proceeds of a life insurance policy on Mr. Akins, and other benefits, the beneficiaries of which were Mrs. Machetti and her three daughters by her marriage to Akins. Smith enlisted the aid of John Maree, who for his participation in the murder scheme was to receive $1,000. Maree and Smith contacted Akins and lured him to the scene of the crime, ostensibly for the purpose of having Akins install a television antenna. On the arrival of Akins and his wife, Smith shot both of them with a shotgun at close range. For additional facts concerning Smith\u2019s crime, trial, and conviction, see <em>Smith v. State, </em>236 Ga. 12, 222 S.E.2d 308, <em>cert. denied, </em>428 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 3224, 49 L.Ed.2d 1219 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\">. Before examining the merits of each of the issues raised by petitioner, we must address one contention argued throughout his brief. Smith asserts that the district court erroneously denied him a plenary hearing on the constitutional claims presented in his application for a writ of habeas corpus. First, we note that the district judge expressly stated that he would consider all evidence and authorities offered in support of petitioner\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing in deciding the merits of the habeas corpus petition. The district judge also allowed the parties thirty days for filing any additional evidence or briefs. Record at 209. Although petitioner contends that at an oral hearing he would have presented new studies never considered by any court with respect to his claims, he does not explain why he was unable to submit these in documentary form to the magistrate during the thirty-day period granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Furthermore, although Smith has not relied on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), we note that the district court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing did not violate that section, which sets forth the circumstances under which a federal district court must hold a hearing on allegations in a habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">When ... it affirmatively appears from the petition that a petitioner is not entitled to the writ, an evidentiary hearing is unnecessary ....

By death qualification we simply mean the process of determining during voir dire whether a particular venireman is unalterably opposed to capital punishment and would never vote to impose it regardless of the evidence presented or whether he is generally opposed to capital punishment but could subordinate his personal views and apply the law of the jurisdiction in light of the facts of the particular case. The former are excused for cause, while the latter are qualified (as are those not opposed to the death penalty).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b632-14\">. Georgia follows a bifurcated procedure in capital cases tried before a jury. If the jury returns a verdict of guilty, the court then conducts a presentence hearing before the jury during which any evidence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, any prior record of the defendant, and arguments of counsel are presented. Upon conclusion of the evidence and arguments, and following the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, the jury retires to determine the penalty to be imposed. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 27 2503(b) (1978). In the case of murder the death penalty may not be imposed unless at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances is found. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 27 2534.1(c).

Smith attempts to persuade us that <em>Spinkellink </em>is not controlling in light of new studies that were not available to this court at the time <em>Spinkellink </em>was decided. Any significant improvement in the scientific exactitude or conclusiveness of the proof of guilt proneness, however, is irrelevant with respect to the precedential value of <em>Spinkellink </em>because, as, in this opinion, the court assumed that Spinkellink\u2019s contention regarding guilt proneness was factually true. 578 F.2d at 590.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b634-13\">. Smith argues that this passage reveals the assumption which is central to Spinkellinks rejection of the conviction proneness claim-vtz., that there is no ascertainable standard for determining jury impartiality. Brief for Petitioner-Appellant at 33. He further asserts that this assumption is clearly erroneous in light of new studies that correlate juror attitudes toward the death penalty with tendency to favor the prosecution. We remain unpersuaded. Although the new studies may give us an external, ascertainable standard for determining death-qualified jurors\u2019 tendency to convict, they do not give us a standard for measuring impartiality <em>per se. </em>Moreover, we cannot expect to achieve the abstract concept of impartiality if it be equated with absence of tendency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">. An impartial jury, he contends, is one composed of persons who can fairly and impartially determine the defendant\u2019s guilt <em>without reference to their opinions on the death penalty. </em>Brief for Petitioner-Appellant at 34. Thus he proposes that there should be no death qualification of veniremen prior to the guilt determination stage. This proposal reveals a paradox, however; for the very premise of Smith\u2019s contention that death-qualified jurors are conviction prone, maintains that attitudes toward the death penalty influence the guilt/innocence determination. Therefore, there exists the risk that a jury that has not been death-qualified contains many persons who are acquittal or defendant prone because of their opposition to the death penalty. Abstaining from inquiries as to the opinions of veniremen does not insure that the jury will be composed of persons having no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">While propounding the evils of the process of death qualification, Smith .also concedes that those veniremen who would automatically recommend the death penalty are properly excludable. Thus, Smith seeks the best of both worlds: he urges that persons unalterably opposed to capital punishment be included on juries at the guilt determination stage and that persons unequivocally committed to imposing the death penalty be excluded. The resulting jury is composed of persons who are neutral with respect to the death penalty, those who theoretically favor or oppose the death penalty but would subordinate these views in applying the law to the evidence, and those who are unalterably opposed to the death penalty. Clearly, the balance of opinion on a jury so composed is in the accused\u2019s favor. We refuse to accept Smith\u2019s notion of \u201cimpartiality.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b635-13\">. It will readily be seen that this \u201cbalanced\u201d jury, which the defendant envisages, is in reality a \u201cpartisan jury\u201d: if, as he urges, it may include jurors with bias or scruples against capital punishment it must \u2014 if it is to have \u201cbalance\u201d \u2014 include also those with bias in favor of the death penalty as the punishment for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\"><em>United States v.

We feel compelled to add that a challenge to the exclusion of death-opposed jurors is a challenge to the state\u2019s right to have jurors capable of obeying the court\u2019s instructions and of applying the law to all of the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">It is highly probable that a survey would disclose that there is a statistically significant number of potential jurors who disagree with the rule that the state must prove guilt beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>a reasonable doubt and that such people are more readily persuaded by the prosecutor than are others. Nevertheless it does not follow that the state would be entitled to have on the panel any such potential jurors even though they confess that they would be unwilling to accept and apply this important rule. All parties are entitled to the exclusion of those whose feelings are so intense that they would be unwilling to obey the law if it be perceived as contrary to their tendencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">. A serious defect in petitioner Smith\u2019s argument that his conviction must be reversed is his failure to bridge the gap of proof between the abstract proposition that death-qualified jurors are conviction prone and the contention that the jury which.convicted him was in fact less than neutral with respect to guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">. The Court emphasized that this alternative was <em>only </em>a suggestion, stating it intimated no view regarding the proper resolution of this problem. 391 U.S. at 520 n.18, 88 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b636-12\">. Our reservations on this point are in addition to our refusal, as discussed above, to consider a jury which includes persons with unalterable opposition to the death penalty an \u201cimpartial\u201d jury. Thus the bifurcated procedure cannot overcome the risk of violating the state\u2019s right to an impartial jury inherent in a nondeath-qualified jury which may be defendant prone, since a bifurcated procedure envisions a jury at the guilt determination stage which is composed as Smith urges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b636-13\">. More specifically, we fear that in his zeal to correct what he perceives to be a constitutional deficiency in the guilt phase, the defendant has viewed the problem with tunnel vision, ignoring the detriment which the proposed remedy entails. Although petitioner objects only to the exclusion at the guilt phase of veniremen opposed to the death penalty and not to their exclusion at the penalty phase, we must examine, having due regard for the protection of the defendant\u2019s rights, the consequences of any remedy which he asks this court to sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b636-14\">.

We have not overlooked the argument that the influence of such whimsical doubt at the penalty phase is likely to be minimal in light of the highly structured procedure for penalty determination in a capital case. See note 7, <em>supra, </em>discussing the Georgia statutory scheme. Although the jury is instructed to find on the basis of the evidence the presence or absence of mitigating circumstances or statutory aggravating circumstances, we cannot conclude that compromise does not play a role in the jury\u2019s deliberations. See <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 393, 52 S.Ct. 189, 190, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932). The statutory scheme for capital sentencing is designed to channel the jury\u2019s discretion, not to eliminate all interaction among the jurors in which one juror attempts to convince others, based perhaps only upon the presence of whimsical doubt, to vote against the death penalty. Moreover, Georgia\u2019s statute expressly permits the jury to recommend mercy. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 27 2503(b) (1978). Whimsical doubt, therefore, may play an important role.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. Of course, other possibilities remain. One alternative might involve death qualification of <em>all </em>potential jurors for an entire term of court on the first day of the term. The responses of all potential jurors to questions concerning their ability to fairly decide guilt or innocence and to apply the death penalty would be recorded and filed. When a capital case arose on the calendar and a venire was selected, attorneys for both prosecution and defense could exercise their challenges for cause by reference to the juror\u2019s prior responses. This procedure would eliminate the necessity of death qualification during voir dire and thereby avoid the guilt proneness taint which, according to the data presented by Smith, results from the very process of such questioning just prior to actual trial. See C. Haney, The Biasing Effects of the Death Qualification Process (1979) (unpublished manuscript).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">We do not suggest that this alternative is any more satisfactory than those offered by Smith. Any opinion regarding its constitutional acceptability must await proper presentation and argument before this or another court. We simply offer it by way of illustration that the problem of remedy (and we reiterate the view expressed in note 20 and in text, supra, that we do not concede that there is a constitutional problem in the present system) is a difficult one that has yet to be thoroughly explored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">. In <em>Taylor </em>the Supreme Court carefully noted the limits of its holding: \u201cDefendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition.\u201d 419 U.S. 522, 538, 95 S.Ct. 692, 701, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975) (citations omitted). Accordingly, to the extent that Smith\u2019s argument is based on the misconception that the sixth amendment guarantees that his particular jury must have a number of death-opposed jurors which is reasonably reflective of the number of such persons in the community, we reject his argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\">. We do not mean to imply that the evidence presented by Smith sets forth a prima facie violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\"><em>Duren v. Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 668, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979). According to Smith, the complete exclusion from the jury of veniremen opposed to capital punishment, as <em>Witherspoon </em>permits, conclusively establishes elements (2) and (3). These two elements, however, deal with the representation of a particular group in <em>venires, </em>not in actual juries. Smith has not alleged or offered to prove that the venire from which his jury was selected did not contain a number of death-opposed veniremen which was fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Furthermore, we do not decide that veniremen excludable under <em>Witherspoon </em>comprise a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group. Compare <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 597 (5th Cir. 1978) (wherein court assumed arguendo the \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d of this group).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\">. Incidentally, we observe that the Court\u2019s concern in <em>Ballew </em>with the less frequent occurrence of hung juries as jury size diminishes, 435 U.S. at 236, 98 S.Ct. at 1037, is parallel to the concern expressed above with the bifurcated trial procedure suggested by Smith. The detriment in both instances is to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\">. Studies presented by petitioner Smith suggest that blacks and women are disproportionately excluded through death qualification. <em>See </em>Goldberg, <em>Toward Expansion of Wither-spoon: Capital Scruples, Jury Bias, and the Use of Psychological Data to Raise Presumptions in the Law, </em>5 Harv.C.R.-C.L.Rev. 53 (1970); P.

To the extent <em>Ballew </em>exhibits some concern with the presence of minority viewpoint, we observe, as did the Supreme Court, that this point overlaps the question of jury representativeness. 435 U.S. at 236 37, 98 S.Ct. at 1037. As we discussed above, we are aware of no precedent that grants the accused a constitutional entitlement to the representation of specific viewpoints on his particular jury as long as the accused has a fair chance of obtaining a jury that reasonably reflects a cross-section of the community.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">. The allegation in Smith\u2019s brief tracks the language used by the petitioner in <em>Spinkellink \u2014viz., </em>that the death penalty is \u201cbeing exacted pursuant to a pattern and practice of Georgia prosecuting authorities, courts, juries and Governors to discriminate on grounds of race, sex and poverty in the administration of capital punishment.\u201d Brief for Petitioner-Appellant at 39. Compare <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 616 n.42 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\">. In <em>Godfrey </em>the Supreme Court held that the Georgia Supreme Court, in exercising its statutory duty to review capital cases in which the death penalty was imposed, adopted such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>broad and vague construction of the aggravating circumstance set forth in Georgia Code Annotated \u00a7 27 2534.1(b)(7) (1978) as to violate the eighth and fourteenth amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">. Indeed, three times the court took great , pains to point out that its rejection of Spenkelink\u2019s claim that his death sentence was arbitrarily and capriciously imposed did not preclude as applied attacks on the death penalty statute. 578 F.2d at 606 n.28, 614 n.40, 616 n.42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b641-14\">. Smith argues that he was prepared to present this proof at a full evidentiary hearing and should have been given the opportunity to do so. Again, he does not explain why this evidence was not submitted in documentary form during the thirty-day extension. See note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. Smith objects that the district court failed to address this issue separately and summarily dismissed it. Although we do not commend a district court\u2019s failure expressly to confront substantial issues raised in a habeas petition, it is clear that the trial court found Smith\u2019s evidence uncompelling. In any event, Smith\u2019s claim is for related reasons without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
