The mark, in relation to the services, may or may not be immoral or scandalous.\u201d After considering the additional submissions, the examiner finally refused registration on the basis that appellant\u2019s services involve \u201cvarious \u2018mini-affairs\u2019 between two ' unmarried people; sometimes two or more unmarried people.\u201d He declared: \u201cSuch <em>activities </em>are con-</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">sidered deviations from the sexual norm of husband and wife relations. Such <em>activities </em>are immoral or scandalous. . . . Th\u00e9 mark graphically indicates the activity carried on in applicant\u2019s Club; sex not normally sanctioned by (even today\u2019s permissive) social standards.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision, but \u25a0 took two different approaches. First, it considered that the newsletter and services (as broadly described in the applications) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">could appeal to, be offered to, and be read or used by every person in the United States from the age of about six years up----</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">. . . could be sent to youngsters just learning to read, to teenagers, to senior citizens, to persons of strong moral and religious convictions, to members of the clergy, and to an uncountable number of other persons in the large and varied population of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">. . . could be intended for those who are interested in improving themselves or society in a variety of ways and to those who seek the company of others simply for the comfort of companionship, or to pursue hobbies, or to provide philanthropic or social services to their communities, or to educate and train others (including young people), or for a myriad other purposes, all remote from the erotic activities which are apparently applicant\u2019s principal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">As to these people, the board said:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">We have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the people who are potential readers of applicant\u2019s newsletter as described in the application (not as actually published by applicant) or potential users of social club services within the broad context of that description (not as actually conducted by applicant) would be affronted by the use as a mark of a photograph of a nude couple embracing, whether or not the models who posed for the photograph happened to be married to each other. This mark would- be particularly offensive to those, among many others, who are parents of children of suggestible ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Secondly, the board indicated that, upon consideration of the photograph <em>per se, </em>when used as a mark, it would not be registrable. It said: Indeed, it is our opinion that by any standard, including the most contemporary mores of what has been repeatedly described as a permissive, but not licentious, society, applicant\u2019s photograph, <em>when used as a mark for any goods or services, </em>is offensive to propriety and morality, outrages a sense of decency, and is shocking to the moral sense of members of the community, whose sensibilities are protected by the statute. Applicant\u2019s mark is immoral and scandalous, as those standards have been repeatedly interpreted and applied. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">Concluding its opinion, the board remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"AGB\">We recognize that denial of registration will not affect applicant\u2019s continued use of his mark, but such use, both for the newsletter and the social club services, will be visible only to those who share applicant\u2019s interest and will be without the implied approval and the statutory benefits that would result from Federal registrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Appellant argues that section 2(a) is constitutionally \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d because there is no satisfactory definition for the words immoral or scandalous, there have been no guidelines or standards established, and, as in obscenity cases, it is not possible to formulate a national standard. Appellant also argues that the mark in question is not, under any analysis, immoral or scandalous, comparing it to works of art such as Rodin\u2019s \u201cThe Kiss\u201d and Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid.\u201d Appellant further argues that registration was improperly refused by the board due to its consideration of the specific information published and precise type of services rendered, and that the mark <em>per se </em>must be considered without regard to either the general or specific goods or services as a matter of law due to the failure of section 2(a) to include a reference to the goods and services. According to appellant, the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that sections 2(d) and 2(e)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> include a reference to goods or services, but section 2(a) does not, evinces the intent of Congress that, under section 2(a), marks be considered <em>per se </em>without regard to the underlying goods or services. Finally, appellant maintains that refusing registration will not limit the visibility of the mark and that granting registration does not imply approval by the United States Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The Solicitor argues that the mark may be refused registration under section 2(a) by considering the goods and services recited in the applications, or by considering \u201cthe goods and services with which it is actually used,\u201d or by analyzing the mark <em>per se </em>without regard to the goods or services in question. The Solicitor asserts that, under any analysis, the mark is immoral, <em>i. </em>e., \u201cpatently offensive,\u201d and scandalous, /. e., \u201cshocking to the sense of propriety of the average person applying contemporary standards.\u201d The Solicitor suggests that an analogy be drawn to obscenity cases with the exception that a national standard be applied because \u201c[i]t would be impractical to require the examining corps to be familiar with the community standards in each state or federal district.\u201d Finally, the Solicitor argues that the principal register \u201cis not an art gallery\u201d and that placing the mark on the register would be stamping the government\u2019s imprimatur on the picture which would be shocking to the average person.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">With respect to appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights, it is clear that the PTO\u2019s refusal to register appellant\u2019s mark does not affect his right to use it. <em>Holiday Inn v. Holiday Inn, Inc., </em>534 F.2d 312, 319 n.6, 189 USPQ 630, 635 n.6 (Oust. &amp; Pat. App.1976). No conduct is proscribed, and no tangible form of expression is suppressed. Consequently, appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights would not be abridged by the refusal to register his mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">There is, of course, a limited statutory right to registration, which carries certain benefits. Although, as appellant notes, these are more procedural than substantive, that right cannot be denied without compliance with Fifth Amendment due process requirements. This entails a determination of whether the term \u201cscandalous\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is sufficiently precise to enable the PTO and the courts to apply the law fairly and to notify a would-be registrant that the mark he adopts will not be granted a federal registration. The Supreme Court \u201chas consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. \u2018. . . [T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards\u2019; all that is required is that the language \u2018conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and. practices ....\u2019\u201d <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 491, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1312, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). We note the similarity of the issue in this ease to such issues as likelihood of confusion and descriptiveness for purposes of sections 2(d) and (e) of the Lanham Act, and that, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>though \u201ceach case involving a trademark (or servicemark) stands on its own facts,\u201d <em>In re Quik-Print Copy Shops, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 523, 526 n.8, 205 USPQ 505, 507 n.8 (CCPA 1980), such terms are not considered \u201cvoid for vagueness.\u201d Nor does the fact that decisions of the board and the courts on the issue of likelihood of confusion are often subjective detract from their validity. <em>See Warner-Hudnut, Inc. v. Wander Co., </em>280 F.2d 435, 47 CCPA 1172, 126 USPQ 411 (1960); Vandenburgh, <em>Trademark Law and Procedure </em>141 (2d ed. 1968) and cases cited. Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u201cscandalous\u201d is sufficiently precise to satisfy due process requirements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In determining whether appellant\u2019s mark may be refused registration as scandalous, the mark must be considered in the context of the marketplace as applied to only the goods or services described in the application for registration. Whether or not the mark, including innuendo, is scandalous is to be ascertained from the standpoint of not necessarily a majority, but a substantial composite of the general public. <em>In re Riverbank Canning Co., supra, </em>95 F.2d at 329, note 7, 25 CCPA at 1031, 37 USPQ at 270. If it is determined to be scandalous, registration must be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Contrary to the Solicitor\u2019s argument, the Lanham Act does not require, under the rubric of \u201cscandalous,\u201d any inquiry into the specific goods or services not shown in the application itself. Thus, the PTO\u2019s views with respect to the specific information disseminated by appellant in his newsletter and the specific services provided by appellant are not relevant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The Solicitor suggests an analogy to obscenity cases. We disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 2(a) does hot use the term \u201cobscene,\u201d but uses the term \u201cscandalous.\u201d Because there is a paucity of legislative history of this provision, we must look to the \u201cordinary and common meaning\u201d of that term. <em>In re Riverbank Canning Co., supra, </em>95 F.2d at 328, note 7, 25 CCPA at 1029, 37 USPQ at 269. This may be established by reference to court and board decisions and dictionary definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">In affirming the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to permit registration of \u201cMADONNA\u201d for wines, this court, by reference to dictionary definitions, defined a \u201cscandalous\u201d use of a mark as use which would be \u201c \u2018shocking to the sense of . . . propriety,\u2019 \u201d would \u201cgive \u2018offense to the conscience or moral feelings,\u2019 \u201d or would \u201ccall out condemnation.\u201d <em>In re Riverbank Canning Co., supra, </em>95 F.2d at 328, note 7, 25 .CCPA at 1029-30, 37 USPQ at 269.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Webster\u2019s New Interna</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>tional Dictionary </em>(2d ed. 1942), defines \u201cscandalous\u201d as \u201cGiving offense to the conscience or moral feelings; exciting reprobation, calling out condemnation .... Disgraceful to reputation . . . . \u201d <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary </em>(1945) defines \u201cscandalous\u201d as \u201cshocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety; disgraceful, offensive; disreputable, as <em>scandalous </em>conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The board has determined that \u201cBUBBY TRAP\u201d as applied to brassieres is vulgar, stating that it\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">would be offensive to a segment of the public sense of propriety or morality and is therefore prohibited by section 2(a) of the Act. \u2018Vulgar\u2019, as defined, means, inter alia, lacking in taste, indelicate, morally crude, and can, in our opinion, be encompassed by the term scandalous matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>In re Runsdorf, </em>171 USPQ 443, 443-44 (1971). The Assistant Commissioner refused registration of \u201cQUEEN MARY\u201d for underwear on the basis that it would be \u201c \u2018shocking to the sense of propriety\u2019.\u201d <em>In re Martha Maid Manufacturing Co., </em>37 USPQ 156 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In providing that marks comprising scandalous matter not be registered, Congress expressed its will that such marks not be afforded the statutory benefits of registration. We do not see this as an attempt to legislate morality, but, rather, a judgment by the Congress that such marks not occupy the time, services, and use of funds of the federal government.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Once a registration is granted, the responsibilities of the government with respect to a mark are not ended. The benefits of registration, in part with government assistance, include public notice of the mark in an official government publication and in official records which are distributed throughout the world, maintenance of permanent public records concerning the mark, availability of the Customs Service for blocking importation of infringing goods, access to federal courts where there is a presumption of validity of the registration (e. <em>g., </em>that the mark is <em>not </em>immoral or scandalous), notices to the registrant concerning maintenance of the registration, and, to some extent, direct government protection of the mark in that the PTO searches its records and refuses registrations to others of conflicting marks. Apart from nominal fees, these costs are underwritten by public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Unlike the situation in some obscenity cases, the graphic portrayal before us does not appear within the covers of a magazine or book to be freely examined or ignored by a person knowing the contents. Instead, as a mark, it may be used in a prominent location for public viewing by persons of all ages and convictions. As to appellant\u2019s argument that the mark is no more offensive than works of art which are publicly displayed, we agree with the board that \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>trademarks or service marks, they are not before us for adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that appellant\u2019s mark is \u201cscandalous.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the board\u2019s decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AyP\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Trademarks registrable on principal register; concurrent registration</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-14\">.

This court, in the context of section 2(a), has stated that \u201c[t]he field is almost limitless from which to select words [or pictorial displays] for use as trade-marks, and one who uses debatable marks does so at the peril that his mark may not be entitled to registration.\u201d <em>In re Riverbank Canning Co., </em>95 F.2d 327, 329, 25 CCPA 1028, 1032, 37 USPQ 268, 270 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">. We note that the board has taken the proper approach in the past. When determining that the mark \u201cWEEK-END SEX\" as applied to a magazine was not \u201cso offensive to the public sense of propriety or morality as to preclude registration thereof,\u201d it refused to consider the specific content of the articles and pictures stating: \u201cthe question of whether or not the contents of the magazine may be pornographic in nature, is not an issue to be decided by this Board. If such were the criterion, many well-known magazines with inoffensive or arbitrary titles might well have been precluded registration in the Patent Office.\u201d <em>In re Madsen, </em>180 USPQ 334, 335 (1973). <em>Cf. Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, </em>648 F.2d 1335, 1337, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (1981), and cases cited; <em>Intercontinental Mfg. Co. v.

However, the threshold for objectionable matter is lower for what can be described as \u201cscandalous\u201d than for \u201cobscene,\u201d and appellant\u2019s mark involves more than mere nudity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b541-15\">. The prohibition against registration of a mark that consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter was originally enacted as section 5(a) of the Act of February 20, 1905 (Pub.L.No.84, 33 Stat. 724). This prohibition was reenacted as section 2(a) of the Act of July 5, 1946 (Pub.L.No.489, 60 Stat. 427), over eight years after this court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Riverbank Canning Co. </em>Thus, there was ample time for the Congress to become aware of that opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ion and to modify the law if it determined that the state of the law, as interpreted by that opinion, was not in accord with its intent. That Congress has continued for over seventy-six years the prohibition against registration of a mark that consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter indicates its satisfaction with administration of the law by the PTO and review by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">.

In <em>FCC v.

This case presents none of the difficulties which were viewed by some of the justices in <em>Pacifica </em>as creating Constitutional problems in that the public was being denied access to certain material. As pointed out above, there is no prohibition against appellant\u2019s use of his mark or any limitation on enforcement of his rights under the common law or state legislation. What is denied are the benefits provided by the Lanham Act which enhance the value of a mark. For a concise history of the extension of federal registration to various types of marks see J.

The issue is not whether the act of registration would create a scandal insofar as the relationship between the PTO and the public is concerned, but whether the mark comprises scandalous matter based on the ordinary and common meaning of \u201cscandalous.\u201d Whether the PTO would be considered to have placed its imprimatur on the mark (the subject of opposing arguments) is not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b543-7\">RICH, Judge, with whom BALDWIN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeK\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">I find the majority opinion lacking in factual foundation on the main issue of whether the picture sought to be registered as a trademark is \u201cscandalous\u201d when used on the goods and services named in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">I agree that the goods and services, as recited, must be considered together with the mark, as was done in <em>In re- Riverbank Canning Co., </em>95 F.2d 327, 25 CCPA 1028, 37 USPQ 268 (1938). The majority is also correct in stating that \u201cthe Lanham Act does not require, under the rubric of \u2018scandalous,\u2019 any inquiry into the specific goods or services not shown in the application.\u201d The statement is, however, somewhat ambiguous in the words \u201cshown in the application\u201d because the application contains copies of the \u201cNewsletter\u201d as specimens. I take it that the majority is intending to say that the Lanham Act does not require us to look at the contents of the newsletter and that we should restrict ourselves to considering the picture sought to be registered and the <em>fact </em>that it is used as a trademark on <em>a newsletter, </em>not taking the contents into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Following this correct procedure, the issue is whether this picture on any \u201cNewsletter Devoted to Social and Interpersonal Relationship Topics\u201d or \u201cSocial Club Services,\u201d regardless of what those services are, is \u201cscandalous\u201d under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(a). The <em>contents </em>of the newsletter and the <em>nature </em>of the actual services rendered by appellant being left out of consideration, decision rests on the nature of the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"A4pf\">Like the majority and the members of the board, I have seen every version of the picture contained in the certified record and briefs and I do not find use of this picture on the goods or services named in the application to present a \u201cscandalous\u201d mark. I agree that the heterosexual couple are nude, that they are kissing, that they are embracing in that sense (the man has his arm around the woman\u2019s neck and the woman is holding the man\u2019s head in her hand), but, amazingly, on the crucial matter the majority equivocates in the phrase \u201cappearing to expose the male genitalia.\u201d Either it does or it doesn\u2019t- and I find it doesn\u2019t. Therefore, I find the record does not support a fact I believe the majority thinks is controlling but I speculate since I do not really know why the majority holds the mark to be scandalous.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">The majority appears to rely on the <em>Riverbank </em>(MADONNA for wine) case decided in 1938. It was a three-to-two decision and I feel the dissenters took the sounder position. I think the decision is no longer of precedential value in view of the social changes in the ensuing 43 years. The majority cites <em>Riverbank </em>in apparent support of using as a- basis for decision the imagined feelings of \u201ca substantial composite of the general public.\u201d There is no such expression in <em>Riverbank </em>and I am at a loss to know what it means or how one can have a \u201ccomposite\u201d of a class such as \u201cthe general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">I would reverse. More \u201cpublic funds\u201d are being expended in the prosecution of this appeal than would ever result from the registration of the mark.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
