Gertrude Barn-stone, a resident of Houston, a subscriber to KUHT-TV, and a regular viewer of its offerings, brought this action seeking to compel the station to air the program. On the morning of May 12, the district court entered a written \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d requiring KUHT-TV to show \u201cDeath of a Princess\u201d that evening. 487 F.Supp. 1347 (S.D.Tex.1980). That afternoon, we vacated the order on the condition that the defendants \u201ctape and preserve the program in issue.\u201d No. 80-1527 (5th Cir. May 12, 1980). That evening, the Supreme Court refused to vacate our order. 446 U.S. 1318, 100 S.Ct. 2144, 64 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (Powell, Circuit Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">After a full trial on the merits, the district court entered an order requiring the station to telecast \u201cDeath of a Princess\u201d within thirty days. 514 F.Supp. 670 (S.D. Tex.1980). We stayed that order pending this appeal. No. 81-2011 (Jan. 14, 1981). We now reverse and instruct the district court to dissolve the injunctive relief it granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The district court held that KUHT-TV is a \u201cpublic forum\u201d as that term is used in First Amendment jurisprudence, <em>see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546,555, 95 S.Ct. 1239,1245, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975), and that therefore it could not deny access to speakers \u2014 here, the producers of \u201cDeath of a Princess\u201d \u2014 who wished to be heard in the public forum, unless its reasons for doing so could withstand the rigorous scrutiny to which \u201cprior restraints\u201d are traditionally subjected. 514 F.Supp. at 689-91. Appellees defend this holding, and they also defend the district court\u2019s order on the ground that KUHT-TV\u2019s decision was based on the political content of the program. Both of these arguments were recently considered and rejected by this court in <em>Muir v. Alabama Educational Television Commission, </em>656 F.2d 1012, 1020, 1023 (5th Cir: 1981). We are bound by the decision in <em>Muir.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Thus, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED. The district court shall dissolve the injunctive relief and render judgment for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b202-11\">REAVLEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfE\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">I join in the panel\u2019s opinion because I agree that we are bound by <em>Muir v. Alabama Educational Television Commission, </em>656 F.2d 1012 (5th Cir. 1981). I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the reasoning of the <em>Muir </em>panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">The <em>Muir </em>panel has concluded that a government-owned television station is protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As far as I know, this holding has no precedent in American constitutional jurisprudence. \u201cThe First Amendment protects the press <em>from </em>governmental interference; it confers no analogous protection <em>on </em>the Government.\u201d <em>CBS, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, </em>412 U.S. 94, 139, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 2104-05, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>have no doubt that the government has the power to exercise \u201ceditorial discretion\u201d over its own speech, this power is neither conferred nor protected by the First Amendment; if the First Amendment has any relevance to this power at all, it serves only to limit the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">By holding that a government broadcaster\u2019s editorial discretion is entitled to the near-absolute constitutional protection recognized in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974) (striking down statute giving politicians \u201cright of reply\u201d access to <em>newspapers), see Muir, </em>656 F.2d at 1023, the <em>Muir </em>panel has afforded government broadcasters more protection from private citizens than private broadcasters have from the government. See <em>CBS, Inc. v. FCC, </em>101 S.Ct. 2813, 2829-30 (1981) (upholding politicians\u2019 statutory right of access to private television networks); <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 386-92, 89 5. Ct. 1794, 1804-08, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is an \u201c \u2018unusual order of First Amendment values\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">I have no quarrel with the <em>Muir </em>panel\u2019s conclusions that a government-owned television station is not a \u201cpublic forum\u201d and that the public has no \u201cright of access\u201d to such a station.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But I do not think that the primary issue in this case or in <em>Muir </em>is whether the station is a \u201cpublic forum,\u201d because I do not think\u2019the plaintiffs\u2019 primary claim is that they have a right to put anything they demand on the air.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>they are complaining that a particular program, already scheduled to be shown and already paid for with the public\u2019s money, was cancelled by state officials because they did not like its political content. <em>See Muir, </em>656 F.2d at 1014; see <em>id. </em>at 1027-29 (Clark, J., dissenting); <em>Barnstone, </em>487 F.Supp. at 1349; 514 F.Supp. at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Thus, the primary question is whether the cancellation \u201cabridg[es] the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S.Const., amend. 1. The First Amendment does not talk primarily in terms of \u201cfreedom of speakers,\u201d and Supreme Court jurisprudence over the past twenty years makes it clear that identifying the speaker should not be the primary focus of our inquiry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, we should determine whether the government\u2019s action here was an \u201cabridgment\u201d that is forbidden by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">I confess the strangeness of the idea that the government may \u201cabridge\u201d freedom of speech when it reverses its decision to send out a message that it could simply have declined to send out in the first place. The idea is, however, established by the precedents of this court. We have held in the past that once the government makes a facility available for a particular speaker, it may not deny the use of the facility to the speaker because it objects to the contents of his message. <em>See Bazaar v. Fortune, </em>476 F.2d 570, 574 (student literary magazine) (\u201conce a [state] recognizes a[n] . . . activity which has elements of free expression, it can act to censor that expression only if it acts consistent with First Amendment constitutional guarantees\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d as modified en banc, </em>489 F.2d 225 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 995, 94 S.Ct. 2409,40 L.Ed.2d 774 (1974); <em>Brooks v. Auburn University, </em>412 F.2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1969) (requiring, in a suit by disappointed listeners, a state university to pay an honorarium and travel expenses to a speaker whose invitation was withdrawn by the university president because of what the speaker might say). The <em>Muir </em>panel neither cites nor distinguishes these precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">The station and the <em>amici </em>raise the fear that the slightest judicial scrutiny will result in court supervision of their regular programming decisions. I share their concern. But this case is not a challenge to the station\u2019s general pattern of programming or its failure to select any particular program for programming: rather, plaintiffs charge that a program already selected, paid for, and scheduled to be aired by the station\u2019s professional programmer was can-celled by a state official <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because of the allegations the program made against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>government of Saudi Arabia. F.Supp. at 674. To my mind, this case is quite similar to the case in which a librarian places a book on the library shelf, only to have it removed by supervisory authorities because they object to the political views it contains. The clear majority of the courts that have considered this issue have agreed that the state may remove the book for any number of reasons, but a desire to silence its political message is not one of them. <em>See Pico v. Board of Education, </em>638 F.2d 404 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 385, 70 L.Ed.2d 205 (1981) (while removal of books from school library shelves in itself, or even removal because such books are \u201ctasteless\u201d or \u201coffensive,\u201d is not a First Amendment violation, removal because of the political ideas the books express is unconstitutional); <em>Zykan v. </em>Warsaw <em>Community School Corp., </em>631 F.2d 1300, 1308 (7th Cir. 1980) (dictum) (if complaint alleges removal of books in an effort to exclude a particular type of thought, it states a claim); <em>Minarcini v. Strongsville City School District, </em>541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Salvail v. Nashua Board of Education, </em>469 F.Supp. 1269, 1274 <em>See </em>514 (D.N.H.1979) (removal of \u201cMs.\u201d magazine because of its feminist political viewpoint); <em>Right to Read Defense Committee v. School Committee, </em>454 F.Supp. 703, 712 (D.Mass. 1978); <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>cf. Sefick v. City of Chicago, </em>485 F.Supp. 644, 651 (N.D.Ill.1979) (once city had given artist permit to exhibit his work in a public building, it could not revoke the permit on the ground that the work satirized the mayor).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Freedom of speech concerning public issues \u201cis at the heart of the First Amendment\u2019s protection.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, I believe that the primary inquiry in this case should be whether the government has attempted to silence a message because of its political content. If the plaintiffs can establish this, then the government\u2019s decision is presumptively unconstitutional. <em>See </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-2, at 581 (1978). If the government can establish that, regardless of its impermissible motive, it would have cancelled the program for legitimate reasons, then it is, in my view, entitled to judgment. <em>See Mt. Healthy City School District v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Since <em>Muir </em>forecloses this inquiry, I do not say what the result of the inquiry would be in the case before us. I recommend the inquiry because I fear that these cases involve not only the \u201cDeath of a Princess,\u201d but the wounding of a principle.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">. <em>See Muir, </em>656 F.2d at 1020 (\u201cAETC\u2019s refusal to broadcast \u2018Death of a Princess\u2019 is itself constitutionally protected\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1023 (court inquiry into whether program was cancelled on the basis of its political content \u201cis not only undesirable, it is constitutionally prohibited\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1026.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">. There is nothing to the contrary in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>CBS. </em>The question in <em>CBS </em>was whether the First Amendment confers on private citizens an affirmative right of access to the facilities of private broadcasters. <em>See </em>412 U.S. at 97-98, 93 S.Ct. at 2084. While the Court \u201cassum[ed] governmental action\u201d for purposes of its First Amendment analysis, <em>id. </em>at 121, 93 S.Ct. at 2096, its preservation of First Amendment protection for private broadcasters in performing this analysis is not precedent for conferring First Amendment protection on the government. Had the Court \u201cassumed\u201d that the private broadcasters were government for all intents and purposes, then the Court would not have asserted that it was denying the claimed First Amendment right of access because the result would be \u201can enlargement of Government control over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 93 S.Ct. at 2098. Had the government already been fully in control, then there could be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cenlargement\u201d of its control. As two of the five Justices who \u201cassumed governmental action\u201d made clear, \u201c[w]hen governmental action is alleged there must be cautious analysis of the quality and degree of Government relationship to the particular acts in question.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 115, 93 S.Ct. at 2093 (Burger, C.J., joined by Rehnquist, J.). In <em>CBS, </em>the \u201cgovernmental action\u201d was merely FCC licensure of privately-owned stations; in this case, the government owns the station and thus has the ability to completely control its programming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">. \u201c[Ajlthough the First Amendment protects <em>newspaper publishers </em>from being required to print the replies of those whom they criticize, <em>Miami Herald </em>. . ., it affords no such protection to broadcasters . . . . \u201d <em>FCC v.

I have a bit more trouble with the <em>Muir </em>panel\u2019s assertion that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence here that the government of Alabama had anything whatever to do with AETC\u2019s decision [to cancel \u2018Death of a Princess\u2019]. In sum, the present record reflects no basis for a fear that the government of Alabama is \u2018really operating the electronic press\u2019 . . . . \u201d 656 F.2d at 1018 (quoting <em>CBS, </em>412 U.S. at 143, 93 S.Ct. at 2106 (Stewart, J., concurring)) (footnote omitted). The <em>Muir </em>panel backs up this assertion by claiming that \u201c[t]he record does not establish . . . that AETC is an \u2018agency\u2019 of [the state].\u201d 656 F.2d at 1018 n.ll. Since the <em>Muir </em>panel cites an Alabama statute providing that \u201c[tjhere is hereby created an agency to be known as the Alabama educational television commission <em>...\" </em>656 F.2d at 1014 n.l, this latter claim and its relevance to the rule established in <em>Muir </em>is perplexing, to say the least.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b203-16\">. Thus, I think it may have been unnecessary to reach the \u201cpublic forum\u201d issue in these cases. Since the issue is now settled by <em>Muir, </em>however, I think it appropriate to set out what I believe is the proper basis for the Muir court\u2019s holding on the \u201cpublic forum\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">The Supreme Court has recently rejected the theory, adopted by the court below, <em>see </em>514 F.Supp. at 685, that because a government facility is \u201cspecifically used for the communication of ideas or information,\u201d it is ipso <em>facto </em>a public forum. <em>United States Postal Serv. v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Ass\u2019ns, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2685 n.6, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981) (mail boxes). The district court should have paid closer attention to the test established by this court for determining whether a public facility is a \u201cpublic forum\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">\u201cdoes the character of the place, <em>the pattern of usual activity, </em>the nature of its essential purpose and the population who take advantage of <em>the general invitation extended </em>make it an appropriate place for communication of views on issues of political and social significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-22\"><em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of West Palm Beach, </em>457 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir. 1972) (quoting <em>Wolin v. Port of New York Auth., </em>392 F.2d 83, 89 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 940, 89 S.Ct. 290, 21 L.Ed.2d 275 (1968)) (emphasis added). In the cases in which \u201cpublic forum\u201d treatment has been afforded, the speakers were attempting to use the public facility in a manner fully consistent with \u201cthe pattern of usual activity\u201d and \u201cthe general invitation extended.\u201d <em>See, e. g\u201e Hague v. CIO, </em>307 U.S. 496, 515-16, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)

The pattern of usual activity at KUHTTV, by contrast, is for professional programmers to do the programming; the general invitation extended to the public is not to schedule programs, but to watch or decline to watch what is offered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">. In <em>First Nat'I Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 98 S.ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978), the Supreme Court struck down a law restricting corporate contributions and expenditures for the purpose of advocating any political position. In so doing, the Court found it completely unnecessary to decide whether corporations are speakers who \u201chave\u201d First Amendment rights. \u201cInstead,\u201d the Court said, \u201cthe question must be whether [the state\u2019s law] abridges expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 776, 98 S.Ct. at 1415; <em>see id. </em>at 775-86, 98 S.Ct. at 1415-21; <em>Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v.

In this case, the decision to telecast \u201cDeath of a Princess\u201d had been made by KUHT-TV\u2019s full-time director of programming. The decision to cancel was made by the school\u2019s Vice President for Public Information and University Relations, who had full responsibility for the operation of the station, but who had never before, in 17 years, made a programming decision. His decision was opposed by the programming director and, eventually, by the general manager of KUHT-TV. <em>See </em>514 F.Supp. at 673-74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">. I note that the above-cited cases all involve school libraries; 1 would assume, as a general matter, that the school board has, if anything, broader discretion in determining the political content of materials selected for school children than the government broadcaster has in selecting offerings for the general public. <em>See Ambach </em>v. <em>Norwick, </em>441 U.S. 68, 76-79, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 1594-96, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">My reliance on these cases, however, implies no endorsement of the varying \u201ctests\u201d and reasoning they contain. For reasons I explain below, <em>see </em>note 11 <em>infra, </em>I would not put the initial burden on the government broadcaster to explain its every \u201cquestionable\u201d decision, as some of these cases apparently do. <em>See, e. g., Pico v. Board of Educ., </em>638 F.2d at 415 (Sifton, X); <em>Minarcini v. Strongsville City School Dist., </em>541 F.2d at 582. Moreover, the government broadcaster undoubtedly has much broader discretion to cancel \u201coffensive\u201d material than some of the cited cases concede to the school board. <em>Compare Right to . Read Defense Comm. v. School Comm., </em>454 F.Supp. at 712, <em>with FCC v.

Rather, I rely on these cases because they all expressly or implicitly support what I thought was a universally-held position: that the government cannot act against speech because of its political content.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b205-12\">. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston v.

Alabama, </em>384 U.S. 214, 218, 86 S.Ct. 1434, 1437, 16 L.Ed.2d 484 (1966) (\u201cthere is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs\u201d); <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74-75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 216, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964) (\u201cspeech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b205-13\">. 1 think that the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>test is the proper one to apply in the government broadcasting context. Just as the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>Court was attempting to strike a balance between the state\u2019s authority as employer and the employee\u2019s First Amendment rights, we must here strike a balance between the state\u2019s ability to run its public broadcasting station and the protection of \u201cthe freedom of speech.\u201d If we were to require the government broadcaster to justify its every programming decision, we would make it impossible '\u00abfor government-run PBS stations to operate. The result would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>diminution in the variety and quality of the programs offered, a result contrary to the goals of the First Amendment. <em>See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 36V, 390, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1807, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969) (\u201cIt is the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences which is crucial here.\u201d). Thus, 1 would keep on the plaintiff the heavy burden of establishing that each particular government decision he complains of was motivated by an impermissible purpose \u2014 here, the desire to silence a political message.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">For the same reasons, I would require the state to justify its decision with legitimate, not \u201ccompelling,\u201d reasons. I can think of several such reasons in the broadcasting context: because the program is offensive, <em>see </em>note 9 <em>supra, </em>because it makes allegations that are defamatory, false, or misleading, because a superior or more popular program becomes available. In this case, the district court found that the responsible university official \u201cmay have\u201d decided to cancel the program out of concern for the safety of a professor who was in Saudi Arabia working as a tutor. <em>See </em>514 F.Supp. at 675; <em>see also Muir, </em>656 F.2d at 1019 (claim of threat to well-being of Alabama citizens in the Middle East). If the state could prove that its concern had some basis and that the concern was truly a reason for its decision, then I would not require it to wait to cancel the show until a gun was put to the professor\u2019s head.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
