In addition, petitioners contend that the INS abused its discretion both in implementing that regulation and in refusing to restore them to nonimmigrant student status. Because we conclude that this Court lacks jurisdiction under section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to entertain such challenges, we are unable to address petitioners\u2019 claims and thus dismiss their petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">As one of a number of responses to the takeover by Iranian militants of the United States Embassy in Tehran, President Carter directed the Attorney General to \u201cidentify any Iranian students in the United States who are not in compliance with the terms of their entry visas, and to take the necessary steps to commence deportation proceedings against those who have violated applicable immigration laws and regulations.\u201d 15 Weekly Compilation of Pres.Doc. 2107 (Nov. 10, 1979). On November 14, 1979, the Attorney General, acting pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> promulgated Regulation 214.5, requiring all nonimmigrant alien post-secondary students from Iran to report to a local Immigration and Naturalization Service representative and to provide that representative with \u201cinformation as to residence and maintenance of nonimmigrant status.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>which became effective immediately, provided that a nonimmigrant student\u2019s failure to comply with the reporting requirement would subject him or her to deportation proceedings under section 241(a)(9) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Each of the three petitioners in this appeal reported to the Pittsburgh office of the INS and provided the information required under Regulation 214.5. With respect to each petitioner, the INS ultimately issued an order to show cause, charging that student with specified violations of the Act. Petitioner Ali Akbar Dastmalchi was alleged to have remained in the United States beyond the period authorized by his stay; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> petitioner Hossein Saliminia was charged with violating conditions of his status by transferring from one educational institution to another without receiving prior approval from the INS;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> petitioner Mohsen Tarassoly was alleged to have abridged both the stay and the transfer provisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Separate deportation hearings were conducted for each petitioner by an Immigration Judge in the Pittsburgh INS office. Dastmalchi admitted the factual allegations in the order applicable to him, but refused to concede deportability and challenged the constitutionality of the reporting regulation. The Immigration Judge found Dastmalchi deportable as charged and granted him the privilege of voluntary departure in lieu of deportation. Saliminia, too, was found at a hearing to be deportable as charged and was given the opportunity to depart voluntarily. The Immigration Judge rejected Saliminia\u2019s efforts to terminate deportation proceedings on the ground that the INS impermissibly had singled out for review only students of Iranian nationality. A similar motion was denied at Tarassoly\u2019s hearing. Tarassoly was adjudged deportable for having remained in the United States longer than permitted by his visa and was granted an opportunity for voluntary departure. In light of the determination that he was deportable because of an overstay, the Immigration Judge did not decide whether Tarassoly also had violated the school transfer restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed the appeal of each petitioner. In so doing, the Board rejected various challenges to the constitutionality of Regulation 214.5, and refused to review the discretionary refusals by the INS to reinstate petitioners to nonimmigrant student status despite their stay and transfer violations. Each petitioner subsequently filed with this Court a petition for review of his deportation order. Jurisdiction was alleged to lie under section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Petitioners advance three related challenges to the validity of their deportation orders. Even though we decline to consider the merits of these contentions, they must be set forth in some detail in order to understand why we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">First, petitioners contend that Regulation 214.5 on its face and in its implementation constitutes a denial of equal protection in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Petitioners assert that the regulation and accompanying orders draw an arbitrary and impermissible distinction between Iranian and non-Iranian nonimmigrant alien students, in that only the former were subjected to an intensive status review by the INS. Such discrimination on the basis of national origin is improper, petitioners claim, in light of the absence of a compelling connection between their own activities and the Tehran hostage incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Second; petitioners argue that Regulation 214.5 and subsequent INS implementing orders <em>in effect </em>served to deny to Iranian students discretionary relief \u201ccustomarily afforded to students who have violated a condition of admission.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The INS, petitioners charge, acting in accordance with formal or informal internal instructions, mechanically and inflexibly applied the regulation to result in a deportation order even for a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201ctechnical\u201d infraction by an Iranian student. Petitioners assert that the arbitrary and discriminatory refusal on the part of the INS to exercise discretion constituted an abuse of discretion, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. By denying all discretionary relief to Iranian nonimmigrant students, they assert, the INS prejudged deportation proceedings on the basis of nationality instead of considering the merits of each case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>base their contention in large part on the existence of an instruction issued by the INS on January 4, 1980, which reminded agency officials that Iranian students were to be treated \u201cin the same manner as students of all other nationalities.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They conclude that, had there not been previous discriminatory treatment of Iranians by the INS, such a \u201ccurative\u201d memorandum would not have been necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Third, each petitioner challenges the refusal by the INS to grant him discretionary relief and reinstate him to nonimmigrant student status. Prior to the Iranian episode, \u201cit was the common and regular practice of the Service to restore to status students who had committed technical violations of a <em>de minimus </em>nature.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, each petitioner alleges, INS actions with respect to determination of his status were both inconsistent with past agency practices and in violation of operating instructions such as that issued on January 4, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service, in its brief filed with this Court, rebutted each of petitioners\u2019 substantive attacks on Regulation 214.5 and INS actions. At the outset, however, the INS challenged the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain these petitions for review under section 106(a). It is to the jurisdictional question that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">In 1961, Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act by adding section 106(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), which vests in the courts of appeals initial and exclusive jurisdiction to review \u201call final orders of deportation\u201d entered \u201cpursuant to administrative proceedings under section [242(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1252(b).\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In enacting section 106(a), Congress sought to remedy the \u201cflagrant abuse of judicial review\u201d by \u201caliens, mostly subversives, gangsters, immoral, or narcotic peddlers,\u201d who \u201cskillfully exploit the judicial process\u201d by \u201crepetitive appeals to the busy and overworked courts with frivolous claims of impropriety in the deportation proceedings.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 22-23, <em>reprinted in </em>[1961] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2950, 2967.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Despite the seemingly straightforward language of the statute \u2014 \u201call final orders of deportation\u201d \u2014 considerable controversy developed as to the precise contours of appellate jurisdiction under section 106(a). For example, writing shortly after the provision took effect, Judge Friendly predicted that \u201cdozens of decisions will be needed before the workings of the statute become clear.\u201d Friendly, <em>The Gap in Lawmaking </em>\u2014 Judges <em>Who Can\u2019t and Legislators Who Won\u2019t, </em>63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Columbia L.Rev. 787, 796 (1963). In essence, problems arose because section 106(a) was subject to two conflicting interpretations. Some courts held that only questions involving the bare validity of a deportation order could be determined directly by a court of appeals. Other courts adopted a much broader position, concluding that the statute\u2019s ambit extended to some or all of a host of discretionary and underlying decisions which, if in error, would serve to void the deportation order regardless of the validity of the order standing alone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">To date, the Supreme Court has entered the section 106(a) controversy on three occasions. At first, it appeared that the Court might take a position in accord with those who broadly interpreted the scope of appellate jurisdiction under that statute. In <em>Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963), Chief Justice Warren, writing for the Court, concluded that section 106(a) review extended not merely to the bare finding of deportability, but also to \u201call determinations made during and incident to the administrative proceeding conducted by a special inquiry officer, and reviewable together by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 229, 84 S.Ct. at 312. Consequently, a request for a suspension of deportation made in the course of a section 242(b) deportation proceeding fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. The following Term, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the Court reversed a lower court\u2019s holding that the denial of a request before the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen section 242(b) deportation proceedings was not appealable under section 106(a). <em>Giova v. Rosenberg, </em>379 U.S. 18, 85 S.Ct. 156, 13 L.Ed.2d 90 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>392 U.S. 206, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968), however, the Supreme Court served notice that an expansive reading of section 106(a) was unacceptable. In <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>a Chinese seaman, found deportable after a section 242(b) proceeding, obtained discretionary permission to depart voluntarily and then failed to do so. In response to a subsequent order to surrender for deportation, Cheng requested a stay of deportation. When his request was rejected, Cheng petitioned this Court for review of the denial of a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">The Supreme Court affirmed our holding, 381 F.2d 542 (3d Cir. 1967), that we lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition. After reviewing the language and legislative history of the provision, the Court concluded that \u201cCongress quite deliberately restricted the application of \u00a7 106(a) to orders entered during proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b), or directly challenging deportation orders themselves.\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>at 215, 88 S.Ct. at 1975. Therefore, the Court held, \u201cthe judicial review provisions of \u00a7 106(a) embrace <em>only those determinations made during a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b), </em>including those determinations made incident to a motion to reopen such proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 88 S.Ct. at 1976 (emphasis added). Since the denial of a stay under review was neither a \u201cfinal order of deportation\u201d nor entered in the course of a section 242(b) deportation proceeding, the Court declared that section 106(a) was inapplicable. <em>Id., </em>at 212, 88 S.Ct. at 1974. The alien instead should have sought relief in an appropriate district court. <em>Id., </em>at 210, 88 S.Ct. at 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">According to the <em>Foti-Giova-Cheng Fan Kwok </em>trilogy, courts of appeals have initial jurisdiction under section 106(a) only in cases seeking judicial review of: (1) a final order of deportation entered pursuant to section 242(b) deportation proceedings; (2) an order made during a section 242(b) deportation proceeding and reviewa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ble by the Board of Immigration Appeals (Foti); or (3) a motion to reopen deportation proceedings previously conducted under section 242(b) or to reconsider a final order of deportation <em>(Giova). </em>Courts of appeals have no jurisdiction under section 106(a) to review a deportation-related issue that does not fall within one of these three categories, even though resolution of that issue in the alien\u2019s favor might \u201cdirectly affec[t] the execution of\u201d his final order of deportation. <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>at 213, 88 S.Ct. at 1974.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the claims advanced by petitioners in this appeal. Petitioners here do not challenge directly a final order of deportation, an order entered in the course of their deportation hearings, or the denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings. Rather, they attack: (1) the constitutionality of Regulation 214.5; (2) the alleged refusal by the INS to exercise discretion with respect to any of the Iranian student cases; and (3) the denial of discretionary relief to petitioners themselves. As we read <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>none of these arguments, however compelling on its face, is encompassed within the scope of section 106(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Petitioners\u2019 first contention goes to the constitutionality of the regulation underlying these deportation orders. In considering this contention, it is crucial to realize that the constitutionality of underlying statutes and regulations cannot be placed in issue at section 242(b) proceedings. 1 C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 l.lOe. Neither an Immigration Judge nor the Board of Immigration Appeals, in the course of a deportation proceeding, can enter an order voiding an alien\u2019s deportation in response to a constitutional objection.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, since under <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>the scope of section 106(a) jurisdiction mirrors that of the section 242(b) proceeding, it. seems logical to treat constitutional challenges as not immediately appealable to courts of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Despite the force of this syllogism, a number of federal courts have concluded that a court of appeals, petitioned under section 106(a), may consider \u201cconstitutional infirmities . . . which, if well taken, would void the deportation order,\u201d Riva v. <em>Attorney General of United States, </em>377 F.Supp. 1286,1288 (D.D.C.1974). In fact, two courts of appeals \u2014 the Ninth and Tenth Circuits\u2014 explicitly have endorsed this view in decisions that postdated <em>Cheng Fan Kwok.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>For example, in <em>Chadha v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>634 F.2d 408 (9th Cir. 1980),\"'the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in rejecting an argument that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain constitutional questions under section 106(a), concluded that:</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">[i]t would be anomalous . . . for Congress to provide a single form of review for deportability determinations, yet preclude from that same appeal any questions of the INA\u2019s constitutionality. We reject [such a] construction of section 106 and find that review of final deportation orders includes review of matters upon which the final order is contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 414. Were we to follow <em>Chadha </em>and its predecessors, petitioners on this appeal would be entitled to a disposition, on the merits, of their attacks on the constitutionality of Regulation 214.5 and accompanying INS implementing orders. For the reasons set forth below, however, we decline so to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">First, the decisions upholding the initial jurisdiction of a court of appeals to resolve constitutional disputes rely either upon each other or upon <em>pre-Cheng Fan Kwok </em>precedents.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With one exception, <em>Chadha, </em>they make no attempt to reconcile their basic premise \u2014 that \u201c[njothing in [section 106(a)] is explicit in directing that only issues raised at the [section 242(b)] hearing may be raised on a petition for review,\u201d <em>Pilapil, supra, </em>at 9 \u2014 with the holding of <em>Cheng Fan Kwok.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They do not explain why an alien who challenges the Act\u2019s constitutionality should be able to obtain immediate review in a court of appeals, however implausible that claim, while, under <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>an alien who contests a non-constitutional determination underlying but entered collateral to his or her deportation proceeding is relegated initially to a district court, however tenable that contention. In essence, the Ninth and Tenth Circuit opinions other than <em>Chadha </em>simply assert that section 106(a) encompasses constitutional challenges \u2014 an assertion that cannot be squared with the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that, \u201c[a]s a jurisdictional statute, [section 106(a)] must be construed both with precision and with fidelity to the terms by which Congress has expressed its wishes,\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 212, 88 S.Ct. at 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Second, a careful examination of the rea-soning offered by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Chadha, </em>the only decision from this line of cases that attempts to demonstrate its compatibility with <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>serves to reinforce our view that <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>forecloses initial review at the appellate level of the constitutionality of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In <em>Chadha, </em>an alien who conceded his deportable status at a section 242(b) hearing requested from the INS and was granted a suspension of deportation. Subsequently, however, the House of Representatives, pursuant to section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>244(c)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(c)(2), disapproved that suspension and the INS again ordered Chadha deportable. At his reconvened deportation proceedings, Chad-ha challenged the constitutionality of the congressional disapproval; the Board of Immigration Appeals, adhering to its policy of not entertaining constitutional claims, dismissed that argument as beyond its scope of review. Chadha then petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under section 106(a) and repeated his constitutional contention. The court concluded that it did have jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of a one-house \u201clegislative veto\u201d such as that employed to overrule the INS in Chadha\u2019s case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\"><em>Chadha </em>begins by rejecting the suggestion that the phrase \u201cfinal orders of deportation . . . made . . . pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 1252(b)\u201d contained in section 106(a)</p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">limit[s] appellate review to only the actual decisions and conclusions made by the special inquiry officer during a section 242(b) hearing. . .. We conclude <em>the phrase \u2018final orders\u2019 includes all matters on which the validity of the final order is contingent, rather than only those determinations actually made at the hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Apg\"><em>Id., </em>at 412 (emphasis added). We believe that the <em>Chadha </em>court\u2019s interpretation of section 106(a) is fundamentally at odds with <em>Cheng Fan Kwok. </em>In <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly refused to approve the notion that \u201c\u00a7 106(a) should be understood to embrace all determinations \u2018directly affecting the execution of the basic deportation order,\u2019 whether those determinations have been reached prior to, during, or subsequent to the deportation proceeding.\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 210, 212, 88 S.Ct. at 1973, 1974. As discussed previously, the Supreme Court, in defining the scope of section 106(a), placed exclusive emphasis on whether a determination was made in the course of a section 242(b) deportation hearing; the <em>Chadha </em>formulation, however, admittedly incorporates determinations not \u201cactually made at the hearing.\u201d A faithful application of <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>compels the conclusion that, because the constitutionality of either the one-house disapproval or the Iranian-related regulation could not have been tested during administrative deportation proceedings, neither matter should be reviewable directly by a court of appeals under section 106(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The court in <em>Chadha </em>attempts to justify its broad reading of the language of section 106(a) on four grounds. First, it relies on precedent. Specifically, the court focuses on <em>Waziri </em>v. <em>Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>392 F.2d 55 (9th Cir. 1968), which held that \u201csection 106 included the power to review \u2018logical predicates\u2019 to deportation orders that are \u2018integrally related\u2019 to and interdependent with the final order,\u201d <em>Chad-ha, supra, </em>at 412.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Waziri, </em>however, predates <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>by a number of months. More important, the <em>Waziri </em>opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ion cannot be reconciled with the later Supreme Court case, essentially for the same reason as mentioned above: <em>Waziri, </em>like <em>Chadha, </em>but unlike <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>would permit a court of appeals to void a deportation order resulting from an invalid determination made outside of the section 242(b) process.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Second, the <em>Chadha </em>court asserts that its broad reading of section 106(a) is not incompatible with <em>Cheng Fan Kwok. </em>In <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cCongress quite deliberately restricted the application of \u00a7 106(a) to orders entered during proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b), or <em>directly challenging deportation orders themselves.\u201d Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 215, 88 S.Ct. at 1975 (emphasis added). Relying on this latter clause, <em>Chadha </em>reaches a sweeping conclusion: \u201cAs the validity of the final deportation order is contingent upon the validity of the congressional action under section 244(c)(2), Chadha is very clearly \u2018directly challenging [the] deportation order [itself],\u2019 . . . and thus jurisdiction exists under section 106.\u201d <em>Chadha, supra, </em>at 413. We respectfully disagree with such an interpretation of the \u201cdirectly challenging\u201d language in <em>Cheng Fan Kwok. </em>We fail to see why, under <em>Chadha\u2019s </em>reading of that phrase, an alien in Cheng\u2019s position would not similarly be able to assert that because \u201cthe validity of [his] final deportation order is contingent upon the validity of\u201d the INS decision denying him discretionary relief, he \u201cis very clearly \u2018directly challenging [the] deportation order [itself],\u2019 . .. and thus jurisdiction exists under section 106.\u201d We decline to read the \u201cdirectly challenging\u201d language in a manner that, <em>sub silentio, </em>strikes at the heart of the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Cheng Fan Kwok. </em>Instead, we conclude that the Court, in adding the clause in question, meant only to acknowledge the longstanding notion that an alien, in a petition for review, can challenge the determination of his or her deportability <em>qua </em>deportability; that is, an alien can allege that there does not exist the requisite \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to support an administrative factfinding of deportability. Thus, review under section 106(a) extends only to agency factual determinations involving deportability and to any orders entered during the deportation proceeding itself. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Jurisdiction to Review Pri- or Orders and Underlying Statutes in Deportation Appeals, supra, </em>at 416-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Third, <em>Chadha </em>justifies its broad reading of section 106(a) as consonant with congressional intent \u201c \u2018to expedite the deportation of undesirable aliens by preventing successive dilatory appeals to various federal courts,\u2019 \u201d <em>Chadha, supra, </em>at 413-14, <em>quoting Foti, supra, </em>375 U.S. at 226, 84 S.Ct. at 312. We agree that, in enacting section 106(a), Congress was motivated primarily by a desire to eliminate repetitive and groundless federal appeals.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, we admit that, given our decision today, \u201ccases where both deportability and the IN A are challenged [may] require one hearing in the court of appeals on deportability and, if all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>appeals are taken, potentially three other hearings in the federal court system on the constitutional challenge.\u201d <em>Chadha, supra, </em>at 414. Such a result necessarily follows from a finding of no jurisdiction, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 217, 88 S.Ct. at 1976. Nonetheless, we do not believe that, for reasons of judicial economy, we should alter our interpretation either of section 106(a) or of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Cheng Fan Kwok. </em>The possibility of review of a constitutional question in both a district court and a court of appeals is not an \u201conerous burden,\u201d particularly in light of the fact that such multi-tiered constitutional review is the norm in our judicial system. More important, \u201cit is the result that we believe most consistent both with Congress\u2019 intentions and with the terms by which it has chosen to express those intentions,\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>at 217-18, 88 S.Ct. at 1976-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Finally, <em>Chadha </em>concludes that, in light of Riva\u2019s holding that a district court is precluded from considering constitutional objections to the Immigration and Nationality Act, a court of appeals is bound to entertain such objections lest aliens subject to deportation never be able to raise them. <em>Chadha, supra, </em>at 414-15. We are unable to reconcile this assertion with the <em>Chadha </em>court\u2019s earlier contention that, if courts of appeals decline to exercise jurisdiction over the constitutional claims of alien-petitioners, \u201cpotentially three other hearings in the federal court system on the constitutional challenge\u201d would result, <em>Chadha, supra, </em>at 414. In any event, we are not persuaded that, in the future, aliens in the same position as petitioners will be unable to attack the constitutionality of the Act in any other forum. On the contrary, \u201c[i]n situations to which the provisions of \u00a7 106(a) are inapplicable, the alien\u2019s remedies would, of course, ordinarily lie first in an action brought in an appropriate district court,\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 210, 88 S.Ct. at 1973. District courts remain open to individuals seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from allegedly unconstitutional statutes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">In sum, unlike the court in <em>Chadha, </em>we cannot read section 106(a) to encompass attacks on the constitutionality of a statute or a regulation underlying an alien\u2019s deportation order. Thus, we decline to consider the merits of petitioners\u2019 first contention in this appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Petitioners\u2019 second argument, that the INS abused its discretion and violated due process by \u201cmechanically\u201d denying discretionary relief to Iranian nonimmigrant students, parallels a contention rejected on jurisdictional grounds in <em>Andres v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>460 F.2d 287 (6th Cir. 1972). In <em>Andres, </em>an alien whose third preference teaching visa was not revalidated by the INS challenged that decision as a denial of due process. Additionally, the alien averred that the Secretary of Labor acted arbitrarily in promulgating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>regulation upon which the INS decision was based. The court, citing <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>dismissed the petition because \u201cthe issues raised by petitioner turn on matters collateral to the entry of the deportation order under \u00a7 1252(b),\u201d and therefore were not within the jurisdiction of a court of appeals under section 106(a). <em>Andres, supra, </em>at 288.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">The discretion argument advanced by petitioners on this appeal, as in <em>Andres, </em>is \u201ccollateral\u201d in that it amounts to neither a direct challenge to petitioners\u2019 \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d nor an attack upon an order \u201centered during proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b).\u201d To be sure, it can be argued that, had the INS exercised some sort of discretion with respect to Iranian nonimmigrant students, the deportation orders for petitioners might never have been issued. But, as we observed in disposing of the constitutional claim above, <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>does not permit appellate court jurisdiction over administrative decisions unconnected to the deportability determination. Quite simply, the INS decisions attacked here were not made in the course of a deportation proceeding and hence, according to <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, </em>may not be asserted before a court of appeals conformably with section 106(a). Moreover, it should be noted that petitioners\u2019 claim here raises complicated questions of fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of the barren record made available to us in this case.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The proper forum for compilation of such a record, as well as for initial determination of the abuse of discretion argument, lies in the appropriate district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Petitioners\u2019 final contention \u2014 that the INS violated past practices and operating instructions when it refused to overlook petitioners\u2019 visa and transfer infractions and reinstate them to nonimmigrant student status \u2014 can be disposed of quickly, in light of the above discussion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Decisions by INS district directors relating to visa extensions or to school transfers cannot be appealed to an Immigration Judge or to the Board of Immigration Appeals. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.-2(f)(7) (1981). Thus, the granting of such discretionary relief is a determination made wholly independent of and apart from any deportation proceeding involving an alien. Once again, <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>bars review by a court of appeals of petitioners\u2019 asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>tions. <em>See Butterfield v.

Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>562 F.2d 866 (2d Cir. 1977), for example, the court held that, where an alien admitted his illegal status at his deportation hearing, the illegality of the arrest that brought him before the INS was not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b947-5\">. <em>Compare Marcello v. Attorney General of United States, </em>495 F.2d 171, 173-74 (D.C.Cir. 1974), which held that a district court lacked jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to enjoin or invalidate INS administrative decisionmaking, since such judicial review is committed solely to courts of appeals pursuant to section 106(a). Significantly, in reaching this conclusion, the <em>Marcello </em>court relied upon <em>Foti </em>and <em>Giova, </em>but failed to cite or to discuss <em>Cheng Fan Kwok </em>and <em>Andres.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">. For example, even were we to reach the merits in this case, we would be unable to determine from the record whether, and if so, how the Iranian cases were handled differently from other student cases, aside from the obvious fact that the INS did not discover these infractions based on its own information but instead encountered them as a result of the implementation of Regulation 214.5. Similarly, we would be unable to assess the significance of the January 4, 1981, \u201ccurative\u201d memorandum issued by the INS. The record does not establish to whom the instruction was issued, why it should be considered \u201ccurative\u201d in nature, and in what sense it was \u201ctotally disregarded,\u201d Petitioners\u2019 Consolidated Brief, at 30, by the Pittsburgh INS office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\">. Petitioners rely primarily on <em>Mashi v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>585 F.2d 1309 (5th Cir. 1978), where the court reasoned that, in light of courts\u2019 \u201cpro-alien, anti-deportation policy of statutory interpretation responsive to Congress\u2019s intent to encourage \u2018cultural interchange,\u2019 \u201d the INS should \u201cloo[k] into each case [involving a nonimmigrant student] on its own facts, and decid[e] by striking a fair balance between the character of the act committed and the consequences which will flow from it,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1315, 1317. Consequently, the court in <em>Mashi </em>reversed a deportation order issued to a nonimmigrant student because the facts demonstrated that he was not out of compliance with the conditions of his status, and therefore was not in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(9). Here, however, petitioners do not contend that the INS incorrectly determined that they had violated their status due to overstays or unauthorized transfers; rather, they urge that, in spite of their \u201ctechnical\u201d violations, they should be restored to nonimmigrant student status. <em>Mashi </em>does not stand for such a proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
