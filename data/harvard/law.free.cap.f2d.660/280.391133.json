The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing defendants. The questions presented by this appeal are: (1) whether allegations that the defendants conspired to eliminate nude dancing in the plaintiffs\u2019 nightclubs by interfering in various municipal administrative proceedings state a cause of action when neither the plaintiffs\u2019 expressive activities nor business have been interrupted; and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>I. THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">It is well settled that for the purpose of reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint are taken as true, and the grant is appropriate only if it is beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to relief. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>Ashbrook v. Hoffman, </em>617 F.2d 474, 475 (7th Cir. 1980). In reviewing the complaint, however, it is well to keep in mind that only factual allegations will be considered, and that legal conclusions which may be alleged are not binding upon the court. <em>City of Milwaukee v. Saxbe, </em>546 F.2d 693, 704 (7th Cir. 1976). For the purposes of determining whether the plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, we accept as true the following factual allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The plaintiffs in the suit, Alfonse and Thomas Reichenberger (the Reichenbergers), own and operate two nightclubs in the City of Madison, Wisconsin. The clubs sell liquor by the drink, and present nonobscene nude dancing entertainment. The clubs\u2019 economic survival depends upon offering the combination of liquor sales and nude dancing, and the Reichenbergers derive their living from the operation of the two clubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The defendant the Reverend Richard Pritchard (Pritchard) is a Madison minister. He is also a leader of a community organization, Citizens Concerned for Our Community (CCOC), which has as one of its goals the elimination of nude dancing at the plaintiffs\u2019 nightclubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The defendant Jean Stewart (Stewart), has been a Madison alderperson and member of the Madison Common Council since before December 1977. She shares with Pritchard and CCOC the goal of elimination of the nude dancing at the plaintiffs\u2019 nightclubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Prior to November 1977 the defendants began to conspire together and with others not named in this suit for the purpose of completely suppressing the nude dancing presented at the plaintiffs\u2019 clubs by putting them out of business. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the defendants sought to participate in three separate municipal administrative proceedings relating to the plaintiffs\u2019 business, in an effort to have the plaintiffs\u2019 liquor licenses revoked, or to make the cost of renewal of the licenses prohibitively expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">A. <em>The Certificate of Nonconforming Occupancy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The first such proceeding related to the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to obtain a certificate of nonconforming occupancy for the clubs. Prior to January 1978, entertainment in all Madison businesses selling liquor was regulated by \u00a7\u00a7 9.10(10)11 and 9.11(10)(d)9, Regulations for Entertainers and Employees, Madison General Ordinances, which proscribed all nude entertainment on pain of revocation of the offender\u2019s liquor license. These ordinances were never enforced, however, and the plaintiffs\u2019 liquor licenses were renewed annually despite the clubs\u2019 violations of the regulations. In December 1977, the Common Council repealed the above regulations, and enacted a zoning-licensing regulatory scheme, which created a definition of \u201cadult entertainment tavern,\u201d based on the dress (or undress) of employees and entertainers, and established both the conditions under which such taverns could operate, and the areas of the city in which they might lawfully exist. \u00a7 9.10(17), Madison General Ordinances. It was generally agreed that existing businesses falling within the adult entertainment tavern definition but operating outside the newly designated areas, could continue to operate by obtaining certificates of nonconforming occupancy from the City Zoning Administrator pursuant to \u00a7 28.12(6)(c), Madison General Ordinances, and the plaintiffs proceeded to apply for such certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Application for a certificate of nonconforming use requires submission of documentary proof of lawful existence prior to the effective date of the zoning change, and the plaintiffs submitted such proof. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>defendants also submitted documents to the Zoning Administrator, without notice or service upon the plaintiffs. The defendants\u2019 submissions consisted of ex parte legal argument and affidavits of counsel for CCOC, and sought to influence the Zoning Administrator not to grant the certificate. The arguments were unsound, and known to be so, and the affidavits contained false and irrelevant information. There is no allegation that the allegedly false affidavits were made with knowledge of their falsity. On June 8, 1978, the Zoning Administrator, having received both the above-mentioned submissions and an opinion of the City Attorney, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application on the grounds that the nightclubs had not been lawfully existing prior to the zoning change, because they had been in violation of the Regulations for Entertainers and Employees, and because there had been no authorization in the Zoning Code for such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Proceedings were held before that body on three occasions in 1978. At the second of those proceedings, counsel for CCOC again appeared, pursuant to and in furtherance of the agreement of all the defendants, and sought to influence the Board not to grant the certificates by repeatedly speaking out of turn against the plaintiffs. In April 1979, the Board voted three to one to reverse the Zoning Administrator\u2019s decision. The Board determined, however, not to issue a certificate, in light of their governing ordinance, which they interpreted to require that the four members vote unanimously before directing any action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed the failure of the Board to issue the certificate to the Circuit Court for Dane County, pursuant to \u00a7 62.23(7)(e), Wis.Stats. That case remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">B. <em>Pritchard\u2019s Citizen\u2019s Complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The second municipal proceeding in which the plaintiffs allege the defendants conspired to do them harm was initiated on June 5, 1979, when the defendant Pritchard, again in furtherance of the conspiracy, filed a citizen\u2019s complaint against the plaintiffs\u2019 businesses, pursuant to \u00a7 176.11, Wis.Stats., and \u00a7 9.11(12), Madison General Ordinances, alleging past violations of city ordinances and current violations of the Zoning Code in an attempt to moot or otherwise interfere with the state court proceedings. That complaint was acted upon by the Alcohol License Review Committee (ALRC) of the City of Madison, an advisory body to the Common Council, on June 11, 1979. It directed the City Attorney and City Clerk to give the plaintiffs notice of a license revocation hearing before the Common Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The Common Council met the next day and amended the city ordinances to provide that hearings on citizens\u2019 complaints.such as that filed by Pritchard would no longer be heard by the entire Council, but rather would be before ALRC or a special committee of the Common Council itself. The Council then amended the resolution of the ALRC to provide that Pritchard\u2019s complaint would be heard by a special committee appointed by the Mayor. The Mayor appointed the defendant Stewart to the Special Committee. In furtherance of the goals of the conspiracy, Stewart did not decline the appointment to the Committee although she was opposed to the continuation of the plaintiffs\u2019 business. The Special Committee subsequently met, but took no action other than to stay its proceedings until after the judgment was rendered in the pending suit against the Zoning Board of Appeals in the state courts. The Committee has taken no other action since the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>C. <em>The Plaintiffs\u2019 Liquor License Renewals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">'The third municipal proceeding concerning which the plaintiffs allege the defendants conspired to do them injury, was the plaintiffs\u2019 application for renewal of the clubs\u2019 liquor licenses to the ALRC of the City of Madison. The plaintiffs allege that in furtherance of the ongoing conspiracy to suppress nude dancing at the plaintiffs\u2019 clubs, the defendant Stewart and counsel to CCOC appeared at the ALRC meeting convened to consider the annual renewal of the plaintiffs\u2019 liquor licenses, and addressed the ALRC, in violation of applicable rules of procedure, in an attempt to cause the ALRC to recommend nonrenewal of the licenses to the Common Council. The ALRC did recommend nonrenewal to the Council, and Pritchard, counsel for CCOC, and others all urged nonrenewal during the public hearing portion of the Council meeting convened to consider the ALRC recommendation. Stewart argued and voted against renewal, but the Common Council voted to renew the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses. The plaintiffs\u2019 licenses have been renewed annually since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The complaint concluded by alleging that the above activities violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(2), and 1985(3), and that as a result the plaintiffs had suffered monetary losses and mental distress. The plaintiffs sought actual damages of $100,000 and punitive damages of $150,000. They also sought injunctive relief prohibiting the defendants from further attempts to suppress the nude dancing at the plaintiffs\u2019 clubs and from further violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, which had been amended twice to conform its allegations to facts revealed in discovery, for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Stewart moved in the alternative for summary judgment. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and further found that the action was \u201cat least frivolous and unreasonable,\u201d and awarded the defendants attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment entered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u2022 II. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 \u00a7 1983 CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim, the trial court judge determined that the complaint established that neither the plaintiffs\u2019 expressive activities nor their business had been interrupted or curtailed, and further that the allegations did not establish any inference that any future loss would violate the plaintiffs\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment rights or, if such violation did occur, that it would be caused by the defendants\u2019 activities. She concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show any actual deprivation of a constitutional right by the defendants, and therefore had failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The plaintiffs contend that the court erred in so ruling, and that \u00a7 1983 does not require by its terms that a person be deprived of rights, but rather only that a person be \u201csubjected to\u201d the deprivation of rights, which includes a presently existing actual threat of deprivation. Because deprivation of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to free speech and deprivation of property without due process are among the alleged goals of the defendants\u2019 conspiracy, and because the conspiracy has succeeded in burdening the exercise of plaintiffs\u2019 rights by imposing legal fees upon the plaintiffs in the above municipal proceedings, the plaintiffs argue such a threat exists. They further contend that Stewart\u2019s presence on the Special Committee is an ongoing actual deprivation of their right to due process in connection with their liquor licenses and business.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Analysis of a \u00a7 1983 claim is two-step. First the court must discover whether the defendants\u2019 acts operated to deprive the plaintiff of any constitutional rights. Then the court must determine whether the defendants acted under color of state law. <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 140, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2692, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979); <em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1604, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Brucar v. Rubin, </em>638 F.2d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">A. <em>Deprivation of a Constitutional Right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 suit is whether the plaintiff has been deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. <em>Martinez v. California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 284, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980), <em>quoting Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 140, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2692, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). Furthermore, the complaint must allege an actual deprivation of rights resulting from the defendants\u2019 acts. <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Hanrahan, </em>600 F.2d 600, 622, 624-25 (7th Cir. 1979), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980); <em>Lesser </em>v. <em>Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>518 F.2d 538, 540 n.2 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Egan v. City of Aurora, </em>291 F.2d 706, 708 (7th Cir. 1961); <em>Jennings v. Nester, </em>217 F.2d 153 (7th Cir. 1954), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 U.S. 958, 75 S.Ct. 888, 99 L.Ed. 1281 (1955). The mere possibility of remote or speculative future injury or invasion of rights will not suffice. <em>Olitsky v. O'Malley, </em>597 F.2d 295, 298-99 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Joiner v. City of Dallas, </em>380 F.Supp. 754, 778 (N.D. Tex.1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>419 U.S. 1042, 95 S.Ct. 614, 42 L.Ed.2d 637; <em>Raitport v. Provident National Bank, </em>451 F.Supp. 522, 530 (E.D.Pa. 1978); <em>see Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 253, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1046, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978) (purpose of \u00a7 1983 is to create a species of tort liability for those injured by deprivation of a constitutional right; held, deprivation must cause actual injury to merit award of compensatory damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The complaint does not allege that the plaintiffs\u2019 expressive activity has been interrupted, and, indeed, the plaintiffs have conceded at oral argument that the nude dancing continues as ever at their two clubs. Nor have the plaintiffs been deprived of their liquor licenses. The allegations of the complaint are clear that despite the defendants\u2019 alleged interference, the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses have been renewed annually and the business of the two clubs continues. The legal fees expended by the plaintiffs in the administrative proceedings cannot qualify as a constitutional injury absent a showing of deprivation of constitutional magnitude. The terms of the complaint do not demonstrate how the plaintiffs have incurred additional legal expenses by dint of defendants\u2019 efforts, since the plaintiffs were statutorily required to appear before both the ALRC and the Madison Common Council for license renewal in any event. The plaintiffs do not have a constitutional right to be unopposed at such hearings, which are held precisely for the purpose of determining the propriety of license renewal, and are therefore designed to elicit and evaluate the reactions, comments, and complaints of Madison citizens. Furthermore, because citizen participation in such proceedings is safeguarded by the First Amendment right to petition, it is absolutely privileged from the type of attack these plaintiffs now seek to mount upon it. <em>See Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329, 1342-46 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 975, 98 S.Ct. 533, 54 L.Ed.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">To the extent Stewart, Pritchard, and other alleged coconspirators are charged to have submitted false affidavits or unsound arguments in the nonconforming occupancy or license renewal proceedings, such activity is not an injury of the requisite magnitude to support a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Sarelas v. Sheehan, </em>326 F.2d 490 (7th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 932, 84 S.Ct. 1334, 12 L.Ed.2d 296; <em>Bartlett v. Weimer, </em>268 F.2d 860, 862 (7th Cir. 1959), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 938, 80 S.Ct. 380, 4 L.Ed.2d 358 (1960); <em>Johnson v. Stone, </em>268 F.2d 803, 804 (7th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Nor can we find a constitutional depriv\u00e1tion in the plaintiffs\u2019 final contention, that Stewart\u2019s presence on the special committee to hear Pritchard\u2019s complaint constitutes an ongoing, due process deprivation. Keeping in mind that neither the plaintiffs\u2019 expressive nor business activities have been interrupted, we note that the committee\u2019s only action to date has been to defer action pending resolution of the state court proceeding on the certificate of nonconforming use, in which the same issues are apparently involved. There is thus little imminent danger of deprivation without due process. Furthermore, the allegations of the complaint establish that the committee\u2019s role is only advisory, and that any decision on Pritchard\u2019s complaint will be rendered by the Council as a whole. Because the injury complained of thus remains speculative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>tentative, and hypothetical, this ground for relief also falls short of establishing the requisite deprivation of a constitutional right to merit \u00a7 1983 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The plaintiffs contend that the threat of deprivation which the defendants\u2019 conduct generates is sufficient to give rise to a ease or controversy meriting \u00a7 1983 intervention by this court, relying on several cases in which courts have granted relief based upon defendants\u2019 activity which has threatened to deprive plaintiffs of rights but has not yet actually done so. They cite <em>Wooley v. Maynard, </em>430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977); <em>Grandco Corp. v. Rochford, </em>536 F.2d 197 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>National Association of Theatre Owners v. Motion Picture Commission, </em>328 F.Supp. 6 (E.D. Wis.1971); <em>Reichenberger </em>v. Warren, 319 F.Supp. 1237 (W.D.Wis.1970); <em>Hosey v. Club Van Cortland, </em>299 F.Supp. 501 (S.D.N. Y.1969); and <em>Jewish War Veterans v. American Nazi Party, </em>260 F.Supp. 452 (N.D. Ill.1966). None of the cited eases, however, is applicable to the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In <em>Wooley v. Maynard, </em>430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), the plaintiff was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who had been arrested and fined three times for painting over the words \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d on his New Hampshire license plates. In granting the plaintiff injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983 from further state criminal prosecution, the Court noted that to justify such relief there must be \u201cexceptional circumstances and a clear showing that an injunction is necessary in order to afford adequate protection of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 97 S.Ct. at 1434. The Court concluded that a situation in which three successive prosecutions were undertaken against the plaintiff in the space of five weeks warranted injunctive intervention, and pointed out that, \u201c[t]his is quite different from a claim for federal equitable relief when a prosecution is threatened for the first time. The threat of repeated prosecutions in the future . . . and the effect of such a continuing threat on the ability to perform the ordinary tasks of daily life which require an automobile, is sufficient to justify injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Obviously the dangers envisioned by the <em>Wooley </em>Court are not present here: there has been no interruption or state-imposed burden on the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights, nor has there been any allegation that the defendants\u2019 activities will threaten the plaintiffs\u2019 abilities to carry on the daily functions of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Grandco Corp. v. Rochford, </em>536 F.2d 197 (7th Cir. 1976), the plaintiffs were motion picture exhibitors who challenged a municipal ordinance under which they were denied licenses to operate. The plaintiffs in <em>Grandco </em>all had been subjected either to criminal prosecution (over 100 cases, had been filed against one plaintiff within the space of a year), or the denial of a license application. Here, however, the plaintiffs have riot been prosecuted, or threatened with prosecution, and their licenses have continually been renewed. In <em>National Association of Theatre Owners v. Motion Picture Commission, </em>382 F.Supp. 6 (E.D.Wis. 1971), the ordinance challenged by the plaintiffs had already become effective and operated as a scheme of prior restraint, and in <em>Reichenberger v. Warren, </em>319 F.Supp. 1237 (W.D.Wis.1970), the plaintiff had already been arrested. These cases demonstrate that a far more intrusive burden is required to have actually been thrust upon plaintiffs before \u00a7 1983 intervention is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">While language in <em>Hosey v. Club Van Cortland, </em>299 F.Supp. 501 (S.D.N.Y.1969), initially seems to offer support for the plaintiffs\u2019 position, closer examination of its facts reveals its inappropriateness. The plaintiff in <em>Hosey </em>alleged that his landlord was about to evict him in retaliation for exercise of his First Amendment rights. A state court refused to enjoin the eviction, and the plaintiff had received a seven-day notice to vacate. The federal district court preliminarily remarked that a mere threat of deprivation of a constitutional right was a sufficient basis for relief, relying upon <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). In <em>Dombrowski, </em>however, the plaintiffs had already been arrested and indicted and their property seized by the police. It does not, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>fore, support the <em>Hosey </em>dictum. Furthermore, the <em>Hosey </em>court concluded that because of the possible availability of a defense to the threatened state court action, \u201cthe threat of a constitutional violation is not sufficiently strong\u201d to warrant \u00a7 1983-based injunction. 299 F.Supp. at 507. <em>Hosey </em>is thus not only based upon inappropriate interpretation of precedent, but furthermore fails even under its own relaxed standard of injunctive availability to support the plaintiffs\u2019 position in the instant case, for the <em>Hosey </em>plaintiff faced a much more immediate and concrete threat of deprivation than the hypothetical .infringements the plaintiffs conjure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The continuing validity of <em>Jewish War Veterans v. American Nazi Party, </em>260 F.Supp. 452 (N.D.Ill.1966), in which the district court enjoined a threatened Nazi march, is called in to question by <em>Collin v. Smith, </em>578 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 291, 58 L.Ed.2d 264, which forbade interference with such a march barring imminent danger of grave substantive evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The plaintiffs have thus failed to cite any applicable precedent for granting injunctive or monetary relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the present posture of this case. Because the plaintiffs have failed to establish the presence of the threshold injury requirement, we need not reach any issue of whether the allegations provide sufficient ground upon which to base a finding of state action. Nor do we need decide to what extent the defendants\u2019 acts are protected by the doctrine of legislative and derivative immunity recently restated in <em>Gorman Towers, Inc. v. Bogoslavsky, </em>626 F.2d 607, 611-15 (8th Cir. 1980), or the precise degree to which the defendant\u2019s conduct would be privileged under the First Amendment, <em>see Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329, 1342-46 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 975, 98 S.Ct. 533, 54 L.Ed.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">III. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 \u00a7 1985 CLAIMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The complaint also charges that the defendants\u2019 activities violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2) &amp; (3), and alleges that the defendants conspired both to obstruct the due course of justice, and to deprive the plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws, by interfering in the city administrative proceedings or otherwise seeking to close the plaintiffs\u2019 clubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Although the district court disposed of these claims without reaching the issue of injury or deprivation, it is undisputed that injury to persons or property, or deprivation of a constitutional right is an indispensable element of a claim under \u00a7 1985. <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102-03, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971); <em>Bellamy </em>v. <em>Mason\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>368 F.Supp. 1025, 1028 (E.D.Va.1973), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>508 F.2d 504 (4th Cir. 1974). That portion of the statute which provides relief for the violation of any subsection of \u00a7 1985, states:</p>\n<p id=\"AXzE\">[I]n any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">In light of our holding, <em>supra, </em>that the district court properly determined that the plaintiffs have suffered no injury or deprivation of constitutional rights as long as their expressive activity continues, they retain their liquor licenses, and continue in business, we affirm the dismissal of the \u00a7 1985 claims on the ground that the plaintiffs have not alleged the requisite injury or deprivation of constitutional rights. In light of that holding, we need reach no other issues decided by the district court on the question of \u00a7 1985 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">IV. THE AWARD OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES TO THE DEFENDANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">The plaintiffs also appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>defendants, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which provides for award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in a suit brought to vindicate rights under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 &amp; 1985. In ruling that the prevailing defendants were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, the district court noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 suit attacked both the defendants\u2019 exercise of the First Amendment rights of speech and petition, and Stewart\u2019s exercise of her legislative duties. The court concluded by characterizing the suit as a joke, and as frivolous and unreasonable under the standards for award of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (Award of attorney\u2019s fees to defendant under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). The same principles apply under \u00a7 1988, <em>see, e. g., Green v. TenEyck, </em>572 F.2d 1233, 1243 n.ll (8th Cir. 1978)). The plaintiffs contend the ruling is not supported by a proper finding under the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The standard of review of a court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party under \u00a7 1988 is whether the trial court abused its discretion in making or denying the award. <em>Olitsky v. O\u2019Malley, </em>597 F.2d 303, 305 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>see Christiansburg </em>at 421, 424. The <em>Christiansburg </em>Court laid down the general standard by which such discretion is to be exercised, and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">[A] district court may in its discretion award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant . . . upon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">434 U.S. at 421, 98 S.Ct. at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In seeking to determine whether a suit is frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, courts have focused on several factors. Among those considered are whether the issue is one of first impression requiring judicial resolution, <em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 423-24, 98 S.Ct. at 701; whether the controversy is sufficiently based upon a real threat of injury to the plaintiff, <em>Olitsky, </em>597 F.2d at 305; whether the trial court has made a finding that the suit was frivolous under the <em>Christiansburg </em>guidelines, and whether the record would support such a finding, <em>see, e. g., Vorbeck v. Whaley, </em>620 F.2d 191, 193 (8th Cir. 1980). Applying these factors to the instant case reveals no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The plaintiffs contend that this case does present an issue of first impression in an unsettled area of the law, and that an award of attorney\u2019s fees will deter \u201cvigorous, innovative lawyering,\u201d in the civil rights area. That contention is based upon the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that this case presents the issue of whether a classification based upon the exercise of a fundamental right is sufficient to satisfy the class-based animus requirement for a suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), enunciated in <em>Griffin v. Breekenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). However, the case fails because of its threshold inability to allege injury or deprivation of constitutional rights, and thus the assertedly unsettled issue the plaintiffs have raised need not be addressed to dispose of this case. Furthermore, unlike <em>Olitsky </em>where the defendants, members of a liquor control commission, sought attorney\u2019s fees following dismissal of a somewhat similar claim on justiciability grounds, we find that it was obvious at the outset of this case that the plaintiffs had not suffered injury or deprivation of a constitutional magnitude. 597 F.2d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">We note additionally that although the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to state a claim made it unnecessary to reach the question of any defenses, it is quite clear in this circuit that a citizen\u2019s exercise of First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, and petitions are absolutely privileged from attack under the Civil Rights Act of 1871. <em>Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329, 1342-46 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 975, 98 S.Ct. 533, 54 L.Ed.2d 467 (taxpayer\u2019s complaint against IRS agent protected by <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine even if maliciously motivated). The plaintiffs\u2019 attack upon and attempt to chill the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the defendants\u2019 rights was thus foreordained to failure even if sufficient injury could have been established. Such a situation is precisely the type of vexatious and harassing suit the award of fees to prevailing defendants was designed to deter.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The trial court explicitly made a finding that this action satisfied the <em>Christiansburg </em>criteria. We are convinced there is adequate support for that finding in the record. In disposing of the suit the trial court twice noted the chilling effect such actions were likely to have on the exercise of defendants\u2019 (and others similarly situated) First Amendment rights. Particularly in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated indications that nude dancing in places which sell liquor is a highly appropriate subject for legislative regulation, <em>New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2599, 69 L.Ed.2d 357 (1981); <em>California v. LaRue, </em>409 U.S. 109, 93 S.Ct. 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972), the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to stifle citizens\u2019 efforts to influence or implement such regulation by threatening the exercise of such rights with burdensome litigation is particularly unreasonable and groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Furthermore, despite repeated objections by the defendants the plaintiffs engaged in extensive pretrial discovery, imposing additional burdens upon the defendants\u2019 time and finances. In <em>Olitsky </em>the First Circuit specifically tagged this type of behavior as symptomatic of harassment which the award of fees to defendants was intended to deter. 597 F.2d at 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\">.
