Long appeal from the judgment of the United States Tax. Court sustaining the Commissioner\u2019s determination of income tax deficiencies on their 1971 and 1972 joint income tax returns. Marshall Long (taxpayer), a beneficiary of the estate of his father John C. Long, claimed deductions for his share of the estate\u2019s alleged unused long-term capital losses incurred during administration of the estate and carried over to him under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7 642(h). The only issues on appeal are whether John C. Long\u2019s estate, which succeeded to the decedent\u2019s interest in the Long Construction Company partnership (Long Construction), incurred a long-term capital loss arising out of liquidation of that partnership and, if so, the amount of that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">The parties have stipulated to most of the essential facts. John C. Long (John) died testate on July 5, 1963, owning a 25% partnership interest in Long Construction; his son, taxpayer\u2019s brother, Robert W. Long (Robert) owned the remaining 75% partnership interest. John\u2019s last will and testament provided that his wife Bertha Long, Robert and taxpayer each would receive one-third of his estate. The partnership was obviously insolvent at John\u2019s death; it owed large sums to banks, and two lawsuits were pending against the estate claiming millions of dollars in damages. During the administration of the estate all claims against the partnership were settled. Since Robert apparently had no assets which could be reached to satisfy partnership debts other than his interest as beneficiary of John\u2019s estate, the estate paid all partnership debts even though the estate held a 25% interest. The estate then increased its basis in its partnership interest by the full amount of partnership obligations it paid. The partnership was ultimately liquidated, and the estate received $46,417.77 cash as the final distribution from the partnership. Since the estate\u2019s basis in the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>interest, adjusted by its payment of all partnership obligations, exceeded the amount it received upon liquidation, the estate reported a long-term capital loss. When the estate was unable to utilize all of the loss on its income tax returns, the beneficiaries claimed a right to carry the loss forward to their personal returns. <em>See </em>IRC \u00a7 642(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In its final order of distribution closing the estate, the Probate Court of Jackson County, Missouri, found that Robert owed the estate $638,213.49, which included $633,-561.62 arising out of the settlement of the partnership accounts. Applying the doctrine of equitable retention, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 473.630 (1978),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the probate court offset Robert\u2019s distributive share of the estate against his indebtedness to the estate. After the offset nothing was left for Robert; the probate court accordingly ordered the administrator to distribute the entire residue of the estate equally between taxpayer and Bertha Long, the other residuary legatees. As a 50% beneficiary of the estate, taxpayer claimed one-half of the unused long-term capital loss on his income tax returns under IRC \u00a7 642(h). The Commissioner disallowed the deduction, concluding that the estate had not incurred a long-term capital loss. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner\u2019s determination and found that although estate funds had paid 100% of the partnership liabilities, part of that payment came from Robert\u2019s distributive share. <em>Marshall Long, </em>71 T.C. 1 (1978), <em>op. on motion for reconsideration, </em>71 T.C. 724 (1979). It treated Robert as having paid his share of the partnership liabilities when the probate court ordered the offset of his distributive share against his indebtedness to the estate. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u201cAfter paying the partnership liabilities, the estate sought and obtained a determination from the probate court that Robert Long, the other general partner and a \u2018beneficiary of the estate, was responsible for his 75-percent share of those liabilities. Robert\u2019s distributive share of estate assets was then used to offset his liability for the partnership debts and other claims previously paid by the estate. Thus, although the estate advanced the cash to pay those liabilities, it did not actually carry their full burden. <em>The record is unclear on the extent to which the estate was able to obtain from Robert, through his share of the estate assets or otherwise, his contribution towards the partnership Iiabiiities. </em>In this regard, the burden of proof is on petitioner. Rule 142(a), Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure. As <em>the record now stands, we must conclude that the estate did receive Robert\u2019s full contribution. </em>There is nothing in the record indicating otherwise, and petitioner does not argue otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4b\">71 .T.C. at 10 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court ruled that the estate could increase its basis in the partnership only by its 25% share of assumed partnership liabilities; the net effect of partnership liquidation, then, was that the estate realized a capital gain rather than a long-term capital loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">We agree in all respects with the Tax Court\u2019s analysis, except for its holding that the record does not provide enough information to determine the amount Robert contributed toward payment of the partnership debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The death of John did not terminate the partnership, <em>see </em>IRC \u00a7 708(b)(1)(B); it continued with the estate as successor to John until the partnership was liquidated November 13, 1969. In calculating the estate\u2019s basis in the partnership interest, we must start by determining under IRC \u00a7 1014 the fair value of that interest, here agreed to be zero or no value. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 742. This basis is then increased by the \u201cestate\u2019s . . . share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of partnership liabilities, if any, on that date.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.742-1. The Tax Court allowed an immediate basis adjustment for the estate\u2019s 25% share of the bank loans owed at John\u2019s death. It held that because the lawsuit claims against the partnership were indefinite and contingent liabilities, they should not be recognized for basis adjustment purposes until the exact amounts of the liabilities were established. After the parties settled those suits, the Tax Court treated the settlement totals plus attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as partnership liabilities and permitted adjustment of the estate\u2019s basis in the partnership interest to the extent of its 25% interest. <em>See </em>1 W. McKee, W. Nelson &amp; R. Whitmire, Federal Taxation of Partnerships and Partners H 7.01[2] (1977). We agree with this approach and holding. The estate\u2019s basis is then further adjusted by the estate\u2019s distributive share of partnership income and losses incurred in the years the partnership operated prior to liquidation. IRC \u00a7 705(a). Further, when the estate assumed and paid Robert\u2019s 75% share of the partnership debt, the estate\u2019s basis was increased by that additional sum, to the extent the estate was unable to obtain contribution from Robert. <em>See </em>IRC \u00a7 752(a). The difference between the basis thus calculated and the cash received in the distribution at the time of final liquidation determines the recognized capital gain or loss. IRC \u00a7 731(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The record in the instant case shows that after paying the partnership liabilities, the estate sought and obtained the probate court\u2019s determination that Robert was responsible for 75% of these liabilities. Therefore, the probate court offset Robert\u2019s share of the estate assets against his 75% share of partnership liabilities and other debts he owed the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The Missouri courts have held that a distributee\u2019s debt to the estate \u201cis an asset of the estate in the hands of the administrator, who is charged with the duty of collecting it.\u201d <em>State v. Ennis, </em>222 Mo. App. 713, 716, 7 S.W.2d 737, 739 (1928). <em>See Thompson v. McCune, </em>333 Mo. 758, 63 S.W.2d 41 (1933). Furthermore, \u201c[a] distributee who is indebted to the estate is not entitled to receive his distributive share without first deducting therefrom his indebtedness to the estate.\u201d <em>Ennis, </em>222 Mo. App. at 716, 7 S.W.2d at 739. <em>Accord, Gorg </em>v. <em>Rutherford, </em>31 S.W.2d 585, 588 (Mo.App. 1930). Citing <em>Thompson v. McCune, </em>taxpayer contends the Tax Court misconstrued the Missouri doctrine of equitable retention and the effect of the offset decreed by the probate court. He argues that Robert\u2019s indebtedness to the estate was not offset against any of the \u201cgood\u201d assets; rather, it was offset only against that portion of the estate\u2019s total assets consisting of Robert\u2019s debt to the estate. Since his indebtedness to the estate was a worthless asset, Robert gave up nothing in the equitable accounting, and having given up nothing, he contributed nothing. Taxpayer argues that notwithstanding the equitable accounting, the estate neither received nor retained any additional sums that could be considered Robert\u2019s contribution; the offset could constitute a contribution by Robert only if Robert\u2019s indebtedness were less than his distributive share, in which case he would have been entitled to some of the estate\u2019s assets other than his own indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We do not think Missouri case law supports taxpayer\u2019s interpretation of the doctrine of equitable retention. <em>Thompson, </em>63 S.W.2d at 44-45, states that</p>\n<p id=\"AOci\">\u201c[i]f the legatee or distributee is insolvent or for any good reason the executor or administrator cannot or should not collect the excess, if there be any, of the amount due the estate over the legacy or distributive share of such debtor, there is no need of.such executor or administrator taking any independent action to collect, but may without more elect to pay or cancel the legacy by applying thereto the indebtedness of the legatee or distributee to the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">This equitable accounting or set-off assumes that when a beneficiary owes money to the estate and has not paid it, \u201che already has in his hands funds belonging to the estate, and such funds are considered a part of the mass of the estate, and credited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>against his distributive share.\u201d <em>Meenen v. Meenen, </em>180 Kan. 779, 783, 308 P.2d 158, 161 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The estate, having satisfied an obligation for which the estate and Robert were jointly liable, had a right to recover from Robert his share of the liabilities. <em>See Missouri Dist. Tel. Co. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>338 Mo. 692, 93 S.W.2d 19 (1935). Although Robert may have been judgment proof so far as his ability to pay anything other than his share of the estate, he was a one-third beneficiary of John\u2019s solvent estate, and his share was subject through set-off to the payment of his debts to the estate. His inability to pay the full amount of his debt does not justify holding either that his debt to the estate was valueless and therefore excludable from estate assets, or that he gave up nothing in set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">An example illustrates this proposition easily. Suppose the estate\u2019s net assets, after paying all claims and charges, consisted of $400,000 cash plus a $200,000 debt owed it by Robert. The distribution in such a case would be $200,000 to Bertha Long, $200,000 to taxpayer, and to Robert only cancellation of his debt. In <em>Mast v. Mast, </em>176 Mo.App. 1, 162 S.W. 328, 329 (1914), the court stated that a distributee\u2019s debt due the estate</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u201cis to be treated as so much of his interest in the estate already received by him, and therefore, in the distribution of the property, whether real or personal, he is entitled only to so much thereof as plus what he has already received, will make his share equal to the share of the other heirs or distributees. Otherwise the heir would receive as much more than* the other heirs received as the debt he owed the estate amounted to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The result should not differ significantly if Robert\u2019s debt in the example were $200,001 or any larger amount, and he could not contribute anything more than surrendering his one-third share of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">By applying a simple mathematical formula, we can calculate the actual value of Robert\u2019s debt to the estate. We differ here from the Tax Court because we find that the record contains enough information to determine the debt\u2019s value. Under the facts of the instant case, the value of Robert\u2019s collectable debt equals 50% of the cash and other assets available for distribution to beneficiaries. We calculate this value as follows: A (assets available for distribution to beneficiaries, other than Robert\u2019s debt) + X (collectable amount of Robert\u2019s debt) = NE (net estate). Since Robert is beneficiary of one-third of the estate, X = <em>\u2153 </em>NE. Therefore, A = \u2154 of NE, and X = <em>\u00bd </em>of A. The record shows the total assets (other than Robert\u2019s debt) available for distribution consisted of $133,699.21 in cash and other personal property valued at $351,074.42. (Exs. 32-AF, 33-AG). Thus we can compute the net value of the estate including the collectable amount of Robert\u2019s indebtedness as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">$484,773.63 Cash and personal property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">242,386.81 Collectable debt from Robert (50% of cash and personal property; \u2153 of total net estate)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">$727,160.44 Net value of estate</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">Under Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 473.630 Robert is treated as having already received $242,-386.81 in cash. Since Robert was entitled only to so much of the estate, \u201cas plus what <em>he has already received, </em>will make his share equal to the share of the other heirs,\u201d <em>Mast v. Mast, </em>162 S.W. at 329 (emphasis added), the administrator properly excluded him in the distribution of distributable estate assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">Since Robert owed other debts to the estate, we must determine what part of the $242,386.81 represents his contribution toward partnership liabilities and what part represents payment of those other debts. There is some discrepancy between the contentions of the taxpayer and the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The inventory and appraisement (Ex. 6-F) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and the federal estate tax return (Ex. 8-H) list a balance due the estate from Robert on a $115,000 promissory note secured by a second mortgage on land in Colorado and a $4500 promissory note secured by a fourth mortgage apparently on the same land. The final settlement order (Ex. 33-AG) declares Robert\u2019s total debt to the estate to be $638,213.49, of which $633,561.62 is a settlement of the partnership accounts and $4,651.87 attributable to principal and interest on the $4500 promissory note. From this we may surmise that levy on the Colorado land paid the balance on the $115,000 note but was insufficient to pay anything on the $4500 note. Since both the debt to the partnership and the $4651.87 attributable to the note appear to have the same priority status as unsecured claims, they would share proportionately in the set-off total. Thus $633,561.62/$638,213.49 X $242,386.81 = $240,620.07. That is the total of Robert\u2019s deemed contribution to the partnership debt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Taxpayer makes a final argument that even if the estate is deemed to have made a recovery against Robert, it occurred on December 18,1969, after the liquidation distribution of partnership assets on November 13, 1969, and should not require retroactive reduction in the estate\u2019s basis in the partnership interest. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s analysis in its supplemental opinion, 71 T.C. 724, 726 (1979), that the timing of the probate court order should not control. The estate had complete dominion and control at all times over both the partnership and Robert\u2019s share of the estate. It should not be able to control tax consequences by its timing of the liquidation distribution and the request for an order granting the set-off. Further, even if we were to regard the set-off as a separate transaction, since the recovery against Robert and the liquidation of the partnership both occurred in the same tax year of the estate (its tax year ended May 31), the effects of the two transactions would have to be netted and the tax result would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Therefore, we hold that subject to possible corrections for minor errors in the figures, the estate had a long-term capital loss calculated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Estate\u2019s partnership basis at date 0 of death</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">+ 25% share of $309,315.68 bank loans payable at death<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> $77,328.92</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">+ 25% share of $327,957.03 litigation settlement costs 81,989.26</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">- Net adjustment for estate\u2019s share of income and losses from partnership tax returns, 1964-1969 (Losses of $122,825.82 less gains of $7,624.73) (115,201.09)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">+ Assumption by the estate of liabilities owed by Robert (before adjustment for recovery from Robert\u2019s share of the estate) 477,954.53</p>\n<p id=\"b485-19\">= Total basis before adjustment for Robert\u2019s contribution, if any<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> $522,071.62</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>- Total sum obtainable from Robert toward payment of partnership debt 240,620.07</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">= Adjusted basis $281,451.55</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">- Less liquidating distribution 46,417.77</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">= Long term capital loss $235,033.78</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The case is remanded to the Tax Court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. Section 473.630 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u201cWhen a distributee of an estate is indebted to the estate, the amount of the indebtedness if due, or the present worth of the indebtedness, if not due, may be treated as an offset by the executor or administrator against any testate or intestate property, real or personal, of the estate to which such distributee is entitled. An offset hereunder shall be treated as if made as of the time of the death of the decedent and interest shall be adjusted accordingly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\">. We note minor discrepancies in the figures appearing in Ex. 33-AG. Nevertheless, these numbers are sufficiently accurate to illustrate the proper valuation of estate assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-16\">. <em>See </em>notes 4 and 5 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-20\">. Taxpayer\u2019s Reply Brief p.4 subtracts $479,-481.90 \u2014 the taxpayer\u2019s calculation of Robert\u2019s 75% share of the partnership liabilities \u2014 from $638,213.49 \u2014 Robert\u2019s total indebtedness to the estate \u2014 to get $158,731.59 as Robert\u2019s indebtedness to the estate unrelated to the partnership. If we accept such a calculation, it would produce a figure more favorable to the taxpayer. But the statement in the probate court\u2019s order that $633,561.62 is \u201ca result of the settlement of partnership accounts\u201d is never explained; the estate, not the government, obtained that order. The burden of proof of entitlement is upon the taxpayer. Tax Ct. R. 142(a). We hold he must abide by that figure as the partnership-related indebtedness unless on remand he can show from the existing record it is a mathematical or other obvious error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b485-21\">. For purposes of this calculation, as well as for the settlement costs and Robert\u2019s share of liabilities, we use figures from the government\u2019s computation for entry of decision at Rec. I, 117, derived from the Tax Court\u2019s opinion, 71 T.C. at 11. We note these totals add up slightly differently ($637,272.71) than the total ($639,309.21) that taxpayer claims and that apparently was agreed to by both parties in the stipulation of facts. <em>See </em>Rec. I, 42-52. This discrepancy may relate to the amount of interest due on the First National Bank loan, <em>see </em>Rec. I, 7 and 48, and should be adjusted on remand if necessary to determine any deficiency taxpayer owes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b485-22\">. Following Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.752 \u2014 1 precisely we should perhaps go through an additional two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>step process: 1) increase the estate\u2019s basis by $159,318.17 for its 25% share of the capital contribution made toward payment of the partnership debt and 2) then decrease the basis by the same amount for the reduction in the estate\u2019s share of liabilities after their payment. <em>See </em>Rec. I, 117. We would follow the same process to figure the estate\u2019s payment of Robert\u2019s share of the partnership liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-27\">The government\u2019s argument \u2014 that the increased basis resulting from the estate\u2019s assumption of Robert\u2019s liabilities is offset exactly by the reduction in partnership liabilities from the payment, <em>see </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief pp. 16-17 \u2014 is fallacious because it leaves out one step. The basis is increased by assumption of Robert\u2019s liabilities, in.creased again by the capital contribution to make the payment, and then decreased by the payment of the debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
