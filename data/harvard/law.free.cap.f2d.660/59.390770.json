F. Gilroy Daly of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-5\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Appellants were convicted after a jury trial in the Eastern District of New York (Edward R. Neaher, Judge) of possessing counterfeiting drug dies in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a)(5) (1976). Drug dies or \u201cpunches\u201d are used to engrave the top and bottom of pills. The dies appellants possessed were engraved to imprint the phrases \u201cRorer 714\u201d and \u201cLemmon 714,\u201d which are trade names of methaqualudes, a controlled substance. Appellants contend that \u00a7 843(a)(5) does not penalize mere possession of such dies, but requires, as an element of the offense, an intent to use the dies to manufacture counterfeit controlled substances. We disagree and therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Section 843(a)(5) makes it unlawful \u201cknowingly or intentionally . . . to . . . possess any punch, die, plate, stone, or other thing designed to . . . imprint . . . the . . . trade name ... of another . . . upon any drug ... so as to render such drug a counterfeit substance.\u201d \u201cCounterfeit substance\u201d is defined as \u201ca controlled substance\u201d that falsely purports to be the product of a manufacturer because it bears the trade name of someone other than the manufacturer. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(7) (1976). We agree with the District Court that \u00a7 843(a)(5) should be read literally to punish possession of a die that is capable of rendering a drug a counterfeit substance, whether or not the possessor uses or intends to use the die for that purpose. The statute\u2019s scienter requirement is satisfied if the defendant knows that what he possesses has the requisite capability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We see no reason to doubt that Congress wished to penalize not only those who intend to manufacture controlled substances bearing* false trade names, but also those who possess implements suitable for falsifying trade names on such substances. The fact that appellants may have intended to put false methaqualude trade names on ordinary pills, like the antihistamines seized at their premises with the dies, does not exclude them from the statute\u2019s coverage. Congress is entitled to penalize fraud with respect to controlled substances as well as traffic in such substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Appellants suggest that \u00a7 843(a)(5) should be construed to require intent to manufacture a controlled substance because another provision, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(i)(2) (1976), penalizes possession of devices capable of rendering a drug a counterfeit \u201cdrug,\u201d as distinguished from a counterfeit \u201ccontrolled substance.\u201d However, Congress, having prescribed penalties for possession of devices to counterfeit drugs generally, was entitled to impose higher penalties under \u00a7 843(a)(5) for possession of devices capable of making ordinary drugs appear to be controlled substances. A drug falsely labeled to appear to be a methaqualude doubtlessly commands a higher street price than an ordinary drug falsely labeled to appear to be the product of a specified manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">. Appellants make no claim that they had the authorization necessary to manufacture controlled substances lawfully, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823 (1976), which would include the authority lawfully to possess dies suitable for imprinting the trade name of a controlled substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
