Beauchamp Associates, Inc.), masonry subcontractor (Anchor Associates, Inc.), and surety (Reliance Insurance Company) involved in the construction of Harbin Hall, a dormitory on the campus of Georgetown University, which was built during the years 1963 through 1966. Georgetown filed suit on August 25, 1977, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking damages for alleged defects in the design and construction of the dormitory, the surface brick of which had undergone spalling, cracking, and bulging. Georgetown claimed that it first discovered the defective condition in the masonry work in September 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Georgetown\u2019s amended complaint contained five counts. Count one alleged that Beauchamp had breached the construction contract. Count two alleged that Beau-champ\u2019s and Anchor\u2019s work on the Hall was performed negligently. Count three alleged that Beauchamp and Reliance (the successor in interest to Standard Accident Insurance Company) had breached a performance-payment bond executed by Standard, as surety, and Beauchamp, as principal, for the benefit of Georgetown. Count four alleged negligent design and negligent supervision of construction by the architects. Count five alleged negligence by all the defendants under the theory of res ipsa loquitur. Georgetown also filed a third-party complaint alleging negligent design and supervision of construction by the structural engineers. Reliance filed a cross-claim against Beauchamp seeking indemnification and exoneration should it be held liable to Georgetown on the performance bond. Because Beauchamp\u2019s corporate charter had been forfeited in 1973, copies of Georgetown\u2019s complaint and Reliance\u2019s cross-claim against Beauchamp were served on Edward M. Crough, who was a director of Beauchamp at the time of the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Several of the district court\u2019s orders are sought to be reviewed on these appeals. On January 27, 1978, the district court denied Crough\u2019s motion to quash service of process. By a memorandum opinion dated September 24,1980, it granted the architects\u2019, engineers\u2019, and general contractor\u2019s motions for summary judgment on Georgetown\u2019s tort claims, denied Reliance\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Georgetown\u2019s claim against it under the performance bond, granted Crough\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Georgetown\u2019s breach of contract claim against Beauchamp, denied Crough\u2019s motion to dismiss Reliance\u2019s cross-claim against Beauchamp, and denied Crough\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of Georgetown\u2019s claims against him as trustee of Beauchamp\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">With two exceptions, discussed below, the district court took the appropriate steps under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) to permit immediate appeals from its various orders, and we allowed the appeals. No. 80-1798 is Georgetown\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the architects, engineers, and general contractor. No. 80-1891 is Crough\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to quash service of process and, purportedly, from its denial of his motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>judgment on Georgetown\u2019s claims against him and from its denial of his motion to dismiss Reliance\u2019s cross-claim against Beau-champ. No. 80-1892 is Reliance\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment on Georgetown\u2019s claim against it under the performance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The district court held that Georgetown\u2019s tort claims against the architects, engineers, and general contractor were barred by \u00a7 12-310 of the District of Columbia Code, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">any action ... to recover damages for . . . injury to real or personal property .. . resulting from the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property . . . shall be barred unless . . . such injury occurs within the ten-year period beginning on the date the improvement was substantially completed</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-310(a)(l)(1973). The statute does not apply to \u201cany action based on a contract, express or implied . . .. \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a712-310(b)(l). Although Georgetown filed suit in Maryland, the district court applied \u00a7 12-310 because it found that that provision was substantive rather than procedural and would, therefore, have been applied by a Maryland court as the law of the place where the injury occurred in lieu of the relevant Maryland limitations provision, Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-108 (1973) (twenty-year limitation period).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Georgetown challenges both aspects of the district court\u2019s ruling. First, it argues that \u00a7 12-310 is procedural rather than substantive and therefore Maryland\u2019s limitation period should have been applied. Second, even if \u00a7 12-310 is characterized as substantive, Georgetown contends, it should not bar Georgetown\u2019s action (a) because the action is based on a contract, (b) because it seeks damages for the design and construction deficiencies themselves rather than for injuries \u201cresulting from\u201d those deficiencies, and (c) because it suffered injury within the ten-year period, when the wall was built in 1964, even though it did not discover the defects until 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">We are unpersuaded by these arguments, and hold that the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 12-310 to bar Georgetown\u2019s tort claims. Georgetown\u2019s argument that \u00a7 12-310 should be characterized as procedural is refuted by the overwhelming weight of authority holding that statutes similar to that provision are substantive rather than procedural. <em>E. g., Rosenberg v. Town of North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 293 A.2d 662 (1972); <em>Overland Const. Co. v. Sirmons, </em>369 So.2d 572 (Fla.1979). In only one reported case has a court held otherwise, <em>Regents of the University of California v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>21 Cal .2d 624, 147 Cal.Rptr. 486, 581 P.2d 197 (1978). While there is no direct Maryland authority, c. <em>f. Allentown Plaza Associates v. Suburban Propane Gas Corp., </em>43 Md.App. 337, 338 n.2, 405 A.2d 326 (1979) (dictum), the many cases in other jurisdictions characterizing statutes similar to \u00a7 12-310 as substantive rather than procedural lead us to conclude that a Maryland court would also characterize \u00a7 12-310 as substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The premise of Georgetown\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u00a7 12-310, an interpretation under which Georgetown\u2019s claims would not be barred, is that Congress did not intend that the statute would apply to actions brought by owners of buildings against design professionals for defects in the construction of the buildings. Because we think that premise faulty, we reject Georgetown\u2019s asserted interpretation of \u00a7 12-310 and hold that that provision applies to, and bars, Georgetown\u2019s tort claims. In enacting \u00a7 12-310, Congress sought to place reasonable limitations on the tort liability of persons and firms involved in the design and construction of improvements to real property. The legislative history with regard to the consideration and passage of the bills that became \u00a7 12-310 shows that Congress was concerned with the tort liability of architects, engineers, contractors, and other members of the building industry to <em>all </em>persons, to owners as well as to third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>parties. <em>See, e. g., </em>118 Cong.Rec. 36940-41 (1972). There is nothing in the history supporting Georgetown\u2019s argument that Congress intended to exempt from \u00a7 12-310 tort actions brought by owners for defects in their buildings caused by negligent design or construction of the improvement. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Reliance moved for summary judgment on Georgetown\u2019s claim against it under the performance bond it executed as surety. Acknowledging that the twelve-year statute, of limitations for specialties applied to this claim, <em>see </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-102(a)(2) (1980), Reliance argues that Georgetown did not file its action within that period because its cause of action accrued when the allegedly defective wall at the Hall was built in 1964, and not in 1966, when the Hall was completed and final payment was made by Georgetown. Reliance also contends that Georgetown\u2019s claim was time-barred by a provision of the construction contract which, it contends, altered the twelve-year statute of limitations. That provision stated: \u201cThe Contractor shall remedy any defects in the work and pay for any damage to other work resulting therefrom, which shall appear within a period of one year from the date of final acceptance of the work . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The district court rejected both arguments and correctly denied Reliance\u2019s motion. First, the provisions of the contract between Georgetown and Beauchamp, which Reliance\u2019s bond incorporates by reference, show that that contract was indivisible, that no suit for damages could have been instituted by Georgetown until the agreed date for full performance (the delivery of a completed building), and that, therefore, Georgetown\u2019s cause of action accrued and the limitation period on it began to run only when Beauchamp delivered and Georgetown accepted the Hall as completed. Because that occurred in June 1966 and Georgetown filed suit in August 1977, Georgetown\u2019s claim against Reliance under the bond was timely under the twelve-year limitation period for specialties. Second, the statutory language quoted above did not create a one-year limitation on suit by Georgetown against Reliance. It simply gave Georgetown certain rights against Beauchamp for one year after the completion of the building; it did not affect any other remedies available to Georgetown after that time.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The district court ruled that Georgetown could sue Beauchamp under the performance bond, which was executed for the benefit of Georgetown, as obligee, by Reliance, as surety, and Beauchamp, as principal. Crough challenges this ruling, arguing that, as principal, Beauchamp cannot be held liable under the bond. This argument is meritless. The first paragraph of the bond provides that, \u201cWe [Reliance and Beauchamp] bind ourselves . . . jointly and severally . . . . \u201d This language establishes that the parties to the bond intended that Beauchamp would be liable to Georgetown under the bond and this was entirely proper under suretyship law. <em>See </em>J. Stearns, <em>The Law of Suretyship </em>\u00a7 8.26, at 294 (Elder\u2019s rev. 5th ed. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">As well as alleging that Beauchamp was liable to it under the performance bond, Georgetown claimed that Beauchamp had breached the construction contract and, because that contract was under seal, Beau-champ could be sued for that breach even though the normal three-year limitation period for such actions had passed when Georgetown filed its complaint. <em>Compare </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(1980) (three-year limitation period for breach of contract actions) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 5-102(a)(1) (twelve-year limitation period for actions on contracts under seal). The district court, granted Beauchamp\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this claim because it found that the construction contract was not under seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The signature page of the contract between Beauchamp and Georgetown contains the word \u201c(Seal)\u201d in two places and is impressed with the corporate seals of Georgetown and Beauchamp. In the absence of other evidence that the parties to the contract intended it to be under seal, we agree with the district court that the contract should not be characterized as having been executed under seal. The fact that a corporate seal appears on an instrument does not make the instrument a specialty; corporations often use the seal as authentication that officers who execute documents are acting on behalf of the corporation and have been duly authorized to do so. <em>See Gildenhorn v. Columbia Real Estate Title Insurance Co., </em>271 Md. 387, 398, 317 A.2d 836, 842 (1974). The contract at issue here did not contain the familiar phrases, \u201cwitness my hand and seal,\u201d or \u201csigned and sealed,\u201d nor did its body refer to the fact that it was under seal. Without such indications that the parties intended to make the contract a sealed instrument, the combination of the word \u201c(Seal)\u201d and the corporate impressions was insufficient to establish such an intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Beauchamp\u2019s corporate charter was repealed, annulled, and forfeited in 1973 because it had failed to file an annual report and pay its franchise taxes. At the time of the forfeiture, Crough was a director of Beauchamp. Georgetown\u2019s complaint was served on Crough and he filed a motion to quash service of process. He argued that because Beauchamp\u2019s corporate existence had come to an end, his responsibilities as a director had also ended. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that Crough, as a former director, was a trustee of Beauchamp\u2019s assets and was obligated to satisfy claims that Georgetown could prove were existing debts of Beau-champ when its charter was forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The district court was correct in denying Crough\u2019s motion. Under Md.Ann.Code art. 23, \u00a7 78 (1957) (current version at Md.Corp. &amp; Ass\u2019ns Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3-410 &amp; 3-516 (1980)), when the charter of a Maryland corporation has been forfeited, the directors of the corporation become trustees of its assets and are empowered to apply the assets \u201cto the payment, satisfaction and discharge of existing debts and obligations of the corporation . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78(b). That section also provides that the \u201cdirector-trustees\u201d may \u201cbe sued in their own names as trustees, or, notwithstanding [the dissolution of the corporation], in the name of the corporation . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute applies to forfeitures as well as voluntary dissolutions, <em>see Cloverfields Improvement Association v. Seabreeze Properties, Inc., </em>280 Md. 382, 373 A.2d 935 (1977); <em>Callahan v. Clemens, </em>184 Md. 520, 41 A.2d 473 (1945), and, therefore, it was appropriate under the statute to serve Crough with Georgetown\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Crough moved for summary judgment on Georgetown\u2019s claims against him on the grounds that Georgetown\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations, that no assets of Beauchamp remain, and that no claims by Georgetown existed when Beau-champ\u2019s charter was forfeited. He also moved to dismiss Reliance\u2019s cross-claim against Beauchamp. The district court denied these motions and Crough seeks to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">A district court\u2019s order denying a motion for summary judgment or denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory and may be appealed only (a) if the district court certifies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) that the order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>gation, and (b) if the court of appeals permits such an appeal. While the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), certified an interlocutory appeal of Crough\u2019s motion to quash service of process, it made no certification with regard to its denial of Crough\u2019s motion for summary judgment or its denial of his motion to dismiss Reliance\u2019s cross-claim against Beauchamp. <em>See The President and Directors of Georgetown College v. Dennis W. Madden, et al., </em>505 F.Supp. 557, at 600 (D.Md.1980). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s orders denying Crough\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Georgetown\u2019s claims and his motion to dismiss Reliance\u2019s cross-claim in No. 80-1891 are not appealable and we must dismiss the purported appeals therefrom as not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Nos. 80-1798 and 80-1892: AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">No. 80-1891: AFFIRMED IN PART; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> Reliance also argues that Georgetown cannot assert a claim against it under the bond because the progress payments made by Georgetown to Beauchamp during the construction of the Hall constituted an acceptance by Georgetown of the work completed at the time of each payment. Because Reliance did not advance this argument before the district court we decline to consider it. <em>See Howard v. Federal Crop Ins. Corp., </em>540 F.2d 695, 699 (4 Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
