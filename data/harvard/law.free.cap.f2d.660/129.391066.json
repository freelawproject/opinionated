The legislation requires a meaningful disclosure of credit terms, sufficient to enable the average consumer to shop comparatively for credit. Perhaps unavoidably, two provisions of the Act, sections 1640 and 1604, led to often confusing interpretations and results. Section 1640 imposes strict compliance standards on institutional creditors and small lenders alike. Section 1604 delegates to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) the authority to promulgate regulations which \u201cmay contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions ... as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes\u201d of the Act and \u201cto prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or facilitate compliance therewith.\u201d This authority to regulate has been used extensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Congress specified eight disclosures which must be made in consumer credit arrangements other than open end loans, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639; FRB Regulation Z specifies an additional seven. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b), (d). The statute requires that all disclosures be clearly worded and conspicuous to the eye, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631; Regulation Z states that disclosures must be particularly phrased and be placed in meaningful sequence. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6(a). As a consequence of the detailed specificity, TIL litigation has presented questions such as whether a disclosure, in compliance with both statutory and regulatory criteria, is on the correct sheet of paper, or properly positioned on the document, when presented to the consumer. We today confront such a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Maxine S. Lyles entered into a consumer credit transaction with Commercial Credit Plan in the amount of $2,254.01. She signed two documents, a \u201cNote and Disclosure Statement\u201d and a \u201cPersonal Insurance Authorization.\u201d The Personal Insurance Authorization lists the cost for credit life insurance. It further recites that the insurance is optional and that the loan is not contingent on the purchasing of insurance. No insurance disclosures appear on the face of the Note and Disclosure Statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lyles opted to secure the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">This suit is based on Commercial Credit\u2019s failure to disclose the credit life insurance terms on both the Personal Insurance Authorization <em>and </em>the Note and Disclosure Statement. Lyles alleges that Commercial Credit violated the TIL statutes and Regulation Z. The case was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that Lyle\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted because \u201cthe law of this circuit requires that disclosures under [12 C.F.R.] \u00a7 226.4(a)(5) must be made in compliance with the general requirements of \u00a7 226.8.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations in all material respects. Commercial Credit appeals the award of statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">\n<em>Disclosure Once or Twice?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">This case poses, for the first time in this circuit, the issue of the proper interplay between 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(a)(5) and 226.8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Section 226.4(a)(5) requires disclosure of premiums for credit life and other insurance, written as part of a credit transaction, in calculating the finance charge. Section 226.8 provides the manner in which the credit term disclosures \u201crequired by this section\u201d are to be made. Our task is to determine whether the disclosures required by section 226.4(a)(5) must be in the fashion prescribed by section 226.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">A perusal of section 226.8(a) indicates that its rules apply only to disclosures required by \u201cthis section.\u201d In a grammatical sense, the section in which the requirements for credit insurance disclosures, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(a)(5), and in which the mandates for credit disclosures, other than open end, are found, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8, is the same \u2014 section 226. However, a pragmatic reading of section 226.8(a)\u2019s reference to disclosures required by \u201cthis section\u201d compels the conclusion that what is obviously intended is \u201cthis subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Our conclusion rests on a conjoint examination of sections 226.7 and 226.8. Section 226.7 enumerates several specific disclosures that must accompany the initial transaction on open end credit accounts. Nevertheless, the rules in section 226.7 cannot reasonably be considered as incorporated in section 226.8\u2019s disclosure terms, \u201crequired by this section.\u201d Open end credit and credit other than open end demand different disclosure treatment, as recognized by the FRB. Sep\u00e1rate attention has been accorded the two credit arrangements through the promulgation of independent regulation subsections, within the same section.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">The disclosure requirement for credit life insurance is another discrete matter. As might be expected, the FRB has issued a separate regulation for its governance, section 226.4(a)(5). A close study of the regulatory phrasing reflects no reason why the credit life insurance disclosure requirements should be considered as incorporated into section 226.8(a) any more than the open end credit provisions of section 226.7. The Personal Insurance Authorization Lyles signed reflected the cost of the coverage and fairly disclosed that the insurance was optional. Thus, the dictates of section 226.4(a)(5) were satisfied. Since Commercial Credit did not include the cost of the credit life insurance in the finance charge, which was fully stated on the Note and Disclosure Statement, the congressional objective of clear and \u201cmeaningful\u201d disclosure of credit terms would not be furthered by reinscribing the insurance terms within the Note and Disclosure recital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Our opinion is bolstered by interpretations, concerning the interrelationship between sections 226.4(a)(5) and 226.8(a) emanating from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the FRB. In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 566, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>100 S.Ct. 790, 797, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980), that TIL \u201cis best construed by those who gave it substance in promulgating regulations thereunder,\u201d the agency pronouncements are entitled to significant weight. The FRB staff opinions and interpretations have been consistent: the provisions of section 226.8(a) apply only to the disclosures therein required and not to those mandated by section 228.4(a)(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, an FRB staff interpretation letter has indicated that it is permissible for the disclosures required under section 226.4(a)(5) to \u201cbe made on a statement separate from the regular Truth-in-Lending disclosure form.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A letter authored by the Assistant Director for Credit Practices of the FTC carries a similar message.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Lyles argues that the documents Commercial Credit relies on do not express the official position of the FRB; four of them are unofficial FRB staff interpretations. Lyles insists that neither the FRB papers nor the FTC letter, similar in its content, is entitled to deference under <em>MilhoIIin. </em>We cannot agree. The Supreme Court teaches: \u201cUnless demonstrably irrational Federal Reserve Board staff opinions construing the Act or Regulation should be dispositive ____\u201d 444 U.S. at 565, 100 S.Ct. at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Today we seek to enforce Congress\u2019 statutory regime and the attendant agency regulations. In this effort, administrative views, official or unofficial, offer helpful guidance. <em>See, e. g., Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. at 566 n.9, 100 S.Ct. at 797; <em>Koerner v. American Express Co., </em>615 F.2d 191 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2281, 68 L.Ed.2d 803 (1981). <em>Cf. Anderson Bros. Ford v. Valencia, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2266, 68 L.Ed.2d 783 (1981). We are mindful of our responsibility to construe the Act and regulations in a manner favoring the consumer, <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652 (1973), but \u201cwe must not blindly follow such a course if in doing so we lose sight of the purpose behind truth in lending legislation.\u201d <em>Downey v. Whaley-Lamb Ford Sales, Inc., </em>607 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1979). In this regard, we heed the statement by the Supreme Court, \u201cMeaningful disclosure does not mean <em>more </em>disclosure.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. at 568, 100 S.Ct. at 798 (emphasis in original). The circumstances presented in the instant case raise this admonition to the level of a clarion call. To repeat the disclosures required of a credit life insurance authorization on the Note and Disclosure Statement is not <em>meaningful </em>in aiding the consumer to wisely shop to fulfill credit needs. It is only <em>more </em>disclosure \u2014 a redundancy that is neither preferable nor required.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">.
