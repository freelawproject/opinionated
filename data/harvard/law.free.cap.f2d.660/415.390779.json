Because they lived in an apartment awaiting completion of a new home, Mr. Merlino did not work for at least 39 weeks in the 12-month period following their arrival. The Commissioner concluded that I.R.C. \u00a7 217(c)(2) prohibited the moving expense deduction and assessed a deficiency. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-31\">On appeal, the appellants renew their arguments to the Tax Court: (1) the 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>month, 39-week work requirement should not have begun to run until they had moved into their new residence, at which time Mr. Merlino\u2019s self-employment would have satisfied the work requirement; (2) because Mr. Merlino was a civilian employee of the military before retirement, the I.R.C. \u00a7 217(g) provision exempting members of the Armed Forces from the work requirement should apply; and, (3) section 217(i), which allows a deduction for moving expenses incurred by a retiree who worked abroad and upon retirement returns to the United States, should apply retroactively to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We do not overturn a Tax Court decision absent a clear mistake of law. <em>Cruttenden v. Commissioner, </em>644 F.2d 1368, 1374 (9th Cir. 1981). The taxpayer carries the burden of showing that he comes within the provisions of a specific deduction. <em>New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, </em>292 U.S. 435, 440, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790, 78 L.Ed. 1348 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Section 1.217-2(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations answers the first argument. It defines the date of arrival as the day the taxpayer secures even temporary lodging at the new place of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">This regulation is entitled to respect and will not be overturned unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the statute. <em>Lindemood v. Commissioner, </em>566 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Rohde v. United States, </em>415 F.2d 695, 698 (9th Cir. 1969). The regulation is reasonable and consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The military exception of I.R.C. \u00a7 217(g) applies only to military personnel on active duty and not to civilian employees. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 156, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2897, 3049.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Section 217(i) is prospective only. Equitable considerations are inapplicable. <em>See Commissioner v. Dodd, </em>410 F.2d 132, 134 (5th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The Merlinos have not shown that they meet the requirements for claiming the moving expense deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
