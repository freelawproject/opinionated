The issue on this interlocutory appeal is whether a \u201cwritten warranty\u201d actionable under \u00a7 110(d) is limited to the particular promises, undertakings or affirmations of fact expressly defined as \u201cwritten warranties\u201d by Congress in the Act. The district court held that \u00a7 110(d) provides a federal cause of action not merely for breach of a \u201cwritten warranty\u201d as defined in the Act but also for breach of \u201call written promises presented in connection with the sale of a formally warranted product.\u201d 500 F.Supp. 1181, 1190 (N.D.Ill.1980). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">Plaintiffs, purchasers of automobiles manufactured by defendant General Motors Corporation (\u201cGM\u201d), brought this action as a nationwide class action on behalf of all purchasers of GM automobiles manufactured from 1976 through 1979. In Count I of their amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that GM, through its \u201cbrochures, manuals, consumer advertising and other forms of communications to the public generally and to members of plaintiffs\u2019 class specifically,\u201d warranted and represented that 1976 through 1979 GM automobiles contained THM 350 (M38) transmissions, or \u201ctransmissions of similar quality and performance. . . . and that [such transmissions] would meet a specified level of performance.\u201d Plaintiffs charge in Count I that, contrary to these warranties and representations, GM substituted inferior THM 200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(M29) transmissions for THM 350 (M38) transmissions in GM automobiles manufactured from 1976 through 1979. This undisclosed substitution is alleged to constitute a violation of written and implied warranties under \u00a7 110(d) of Magnuson-Moss. In Count II, plaintiffs claim that the substitution is actionable as a \u201cdeceptive warranty\u201d under \u00a7 110(c)(2) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(c)(2) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">General Motors moved to dismiss both counts of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On October 1, 1980, the district court granted this motion with respect to the \u201cimplied warranty\u201d portion of Count I and the \u201cdeceptive warranty\u201d claim in Count II, but denied GM\u2019s motion to dismiss the \u201cwritten warranty\u201d claim in Count I. 500 F.Supp. 1181 (N.D.Ill.1980). GM\u2019s interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the \u201cwritten warranty\u201d claim was certified by the district court on October 31, 1980 and accepted by this court on December 4, 1980. Plaintiffs did not take timely interlocutory appeals from the district court\u2019s determinations against them with respect to the \u201cimplied warranty\u201d and \u201cdeceptive warranty\u201d claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Magnuson-Moss is, in the main, a remedial statute designed to protect consumers from deceptive warranty practices. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>draftsmen believed that consumer product warranties often were too complex to be understood, too varied to allow meaningful comparisons and too restricted to provide meaningful warranty protection. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.93-151, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 6-8 (1973); H.R.Rep.No.93-1107, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 22-29, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7702, 7705-11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act\u2019s draftsmen sought to remedy these perceived ills by imposing extensive disclosure requirements and minimum content standards on particular types of written consumer product warranties. And, to promote enforcement of these warranties, the draftsmen devised a detailed remedial apparatus, which includes optional informal dispute settlement procedures as well as private and governmental judicial actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Although Magnuson-Moss does not require any manufacturer or seller to extend a warranty with its product,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> any \u201cwritten warranty\u201d offered with a consumer product is subject to the Act\u2019s regulatory requirements. The term \u201cwritten warranty\u201d is defined \u201cfor purposes of [the Act]\u201d in \u00a7 101(6) which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">(6) The term written warranty means\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AUu\">(A) any written affirmation of fact or written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product by a supplier to a buyer which relates to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is defect free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified period of time, or</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">(B) any undertaking in writing in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product to refund, repair, replace, or take other remedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">which written affirmation, promise, or undertaking becomes part of the basis of the bargain between a supplier and a buyer for purposes other than resale of such product.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(6) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Sections 102 through 109 of the Act set forth the content and disclosure rules applicable to all \u201cwritten warranties.\u201d Section 102 provides that \u201cany warrantor warranting a consumer product to a consumer by means of a written warranty shall, to the extent required by the rules of the [Federal Trade] Commission, fully and conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understood language the terms and conditions of such warranty.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a) (1976).

Int\u2019l Typographical Union, </em>76 F.Supp. 881, 887 (S.D.Ind.1948).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, we are less than confident that it is possible to distill any unambiguous Congressional intent from the Act\u2019s legislative history. As the district court noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">[A review of the Act\u2019s legislative history] is the legal equivalent of an archaeological dig. Various consumer warranty bills were pending before the House and Senate for four years, during which each body defined, discarded, reintroduced and redefined concepts which in some fashion or another are related to the enacted legislation. Some provisions of the Act are vestigial reminders of concepts buried but not totally forgotten during the ongoing legislative process. Both proponents and opponents of an expansive interpretation have cited compelling, to them, legislative history only dimly related to the language which finally emerged as law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">500 F.Supp. at 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">In support of their argument that \u00a7 110(d) created a federal private cause of action for breach of all written express warranties, plaintiffs rely heavily on the fact that the version of \u00a7 110 passed by the Senate and submitted to Conference had both defined \u201cexpress warranty\u201d and created a cause of action for breach of any express or implied warranty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the Conference rejected the Senate approach, and the version of \u00a7 110 enacted into law was adopted substantially verbatim from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the House bill, which had neither defined \u201cexpress warranty\u201d nor provided a cause of action for its breach.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The House version of the Act created instead a cause of action for failure to comply with \u201cany obligation under [the Act], or under a warranty or service contract (as defined in section 10(10) and (11)).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Conference Committee modified this language by substituting for the word \u201cwarranty,\u201d the term \u201cwritten warranty,\u201d which the Conference Committee had newly defined in \u00a7 101(6).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">It is also significant to note that the limitations imposed on federal jurisdiction by the Senate version of \u00a7 110, which plaintiffs view as expansive, were actually stricter than those imposed by the House bill. The Senate bill did not create a cause of action cognizable in federal court for breach of express warranties; instead, it apparently operated only to provide for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees by consumers who prevailed in actions for breach of express warranties in <em>state court. </em>And, because it incorporated the $10,000 amount in controversy requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1976), few, if any, actions could have been brought in federal court under the Senate version of the Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the Report of the Senate Committee on Commerce explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">Subsection (b) authorizes any \u201cconsumer\u201d ... to sue for breach of warranty or service contract in an appropriate district court, but any such suit shall be subject to the jurisdictional requirements of section 1331 of title 28 of the United States Code. In effect, this means a person or at this time a class of persons must show individual damages of ten thousand dollars or more in order to bring suit in a Federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">But any \u2018consumer\u2019 damaged by the failure of a supplier to comply with any obligations assumed under an express or implied warranty or service contract subject to this title \u2014 i. e. a warranty in writing, a service contract in writing, an express warranty ... or implied warranties \u2014 may sue in any State or District of Columbia court of competent jurisdiction. Thus, for the most part, the Federal rights created by title I of this bill will be enforced in State rather than Federal courts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>S.Rep.No.93-151, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1973).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, although the Senate bill defined \u201cexpress warranty\u201d and in some manner created a federal claim for breach of such warranties, it limited the jurisdiction of <em>federal courts </em>to actions alleging breach of \u201cwritten warranties,\u201d as that term was defined in \u00a7 101 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Therefore, in arguing that \u00a7 110(d) provides consumers with a claim actionable in federal court for breach of any written express warranty, plaintiffs argue for a construction of \u00a7 110(d) that was not contemplated by either the House or the Senate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is inconceivable that, by deleting any reference to \u201cexpress warranty\u201d from the Act, and by providing instead a cause of action for breach of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d (which the Conference Committee had newly defined in \u00a7 101(6)), the Committee could have meant to create a private remedy actionable in federal court for breach of all written express warranties, when neither the Senate nor the House had so provided.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In sum, there is simply no substantial evidence in the legislative history that Congress intended to create a broad federal cause of action for breach of written express warranties. Rather, it appears that the draftsmen of \u00a7 110(d) intended to adopt the House approach, which was to create a federal private cause of action for consumers injured by the violation of (1) any obligation under the Act, (2) any warranty subject to the extensive regulatory requirements of the Act, or (3) any implied warranty \u2014 the deceptive and unconscionable limitation of which was a major focus of the Act\u2019s regulatory provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Although the district court properly declined to adopt plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 110(d), it also rejected GM\u2019s argument that the only written warranties actionable under \u00a7 110(d) are those promises, representations or undertakings defined as \u201cwritten warranties\u201d in \u00a7 101(6). In its view:</p>\n<p id=\"AYF\">Congress . . . indicated that although the Magnuson-Moss Act only regulates transactions involving written warranties as the term is narrowly defined in \u00a7 101(6), once a consumer is involved in such a transaction there is a policy of providing federal remedies beyond the four corners of the formal warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">500 F.Supp. at 1191. Thus, the district court concluded that, whenever a manufacturer elects to extend a \u201cwritten warranty\u201d to a consumer, \u201c[o]ther written promises presented in connection with the same transaction should also be enforceable as part of the \u2018written warranty.\u2019 \u201d 500</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">F.Supp. at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The district court\u2019s determination that \u201cwritten warranty\u201d in \u00a7 110(d) means something more than it was defined to mean in \u00a7 101(6) has two aspects. First, the court found that the \u201cAct itself suggests several different possible meanings of the phrase \u2018written warranty\u2019 \u201d and is therefore ambiguous. 500 F.Supp. at 1187. Second, because of this ambiguity, the district court looked to the purposes of the Act, as derived from its legislative history, and concluded that \u00a7 110(d) should be construed to provide \u201ca remedy for all written promises presented in connection with the sale of a formally warranted product.\u201d 500 F.Supp. at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">We believe that the three ambiguities identified by the district court, which we shall consider individually, are not sufficiently real or substantial to warrant rejection of the definition of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d provided by Congress in the Act. Moreover, as already discussed, we do not find in the Act\u2019s legislative history a clear Congressional intention that the term \u201cwritten warranty\u201d was meant to have different meanings in different sections of the Act. <em>See </em>Part III, <em>supra. </em>And, if anything is apparent' from the statutory scheme, it is the importance of providing a clear, carefully circumscribed meaning to the term \u201cwritten warranty.\u201d <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">One ambiguity in the use of the term \u201cwritten warranty\u201d which was identified by the district court appears in \u00a7 103(b). That subsection provides that the Act\u2019s content and disclosure requirements \u201cshall not apply to statements or representations which are similar to expressions of general policy concerning consumer satisfaction and which are not subject to any specific limitations.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2303(b) (1976). The district court concluded that this provision would be \u201cunnecessary\u201d if the \u00a7 101(6) definition was intended to apply throughout the Act, presumably because, in the view of the district court, the generalized representations described in \u00a7 103(b) could never fall within the \u00a7 101(6) definition and were therefore statements or representations of a sort other than those defined in \u00a7 101(6). We cannot accept this supposition, however, because it is possible to construe these generalized representations to fit within the \u00a7 101(6) definition in some cases. For ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ample, a written statement that \u201cyour money will be refunded if you are not completely satisfied\u201d might be deemed to constitute an \u201cundertaking in writing in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product to refund ... in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>complete satisfaction. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(6)(B) (1976). Section 103(b) may quite plausibly have been included in the Act precisely to foreclose such interpretations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A second ambiguity identified by the district court concerns \u00a7 110(c)(2)(B), which provides that a \u201cdeceptive warranty\u201d includes a \u201cwritten warranty created by the use of such terms as \u2018guaranty\u2019 or \u2018warranty,\u2019 if the terms and conditions of such warranty so limit its scope and application as to deceive a reasonable individual.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(c)(2)(B) (1976). The district court concluded that this \u201capparently\u201d means that \u201ca written warranty can be \u2018created\u2019 by the use or misuse of the words \u2018guaranty\u2019 or \u2018warranty,\u2019 even if the document using these terms does not include representations which constitute warranties under \u00a7 101(6).\u201d 500 F.Supp. at 1187-88. Although the district court offers a sensible reading of \u00a7 110(c)(2)(B), its interpretation is not by any means required by the language of that section, and the interpretation is without support in the legislative history. The deceptive warranty provision was taken largely verbatim from the House version of the Act, which defined \u201cdecepfive warranty\u201d to mean, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca warranty (as so defined [in section 101(10)])<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> created by the use of such terms as \u2018guaranty\u2019 or \u2018warranty\u2019 ...\u201d Thus, while the draftsmen\u2019s diction may have been suspect (insofar as they used the phrase \u201ccreated by the use of\u201d instead of \u201cincluding\u201d or \u201ccontaining\u201d), it appears most plausible that they intended for the term \u201cdeceptive warranty\u201d to mean a written warranty <em>as defined in \u00a7 101(6), </em>which contains such terms as \u201cguaranty\u201d or \u201cwarranty,\u201d if the warranty\u2019s terms and conditions \u201cso limit its scope and application as to deceive a reasonable individual.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d) (1976). <em>See also </em>C. Reitz, Consumer Protection Under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act 77 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">The district court also found an inconsistency between the \u00a7 101(6) definition of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d as a particular type of promise, affirmation or undertaking, and \u00a7 102, which \u201cauthorizes the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate rules requiring \u2018inclusion <em>in the written warranty</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of various explanations of the rights of the consumer, including such statements as a \u2018brief, general description of the legal remedies available to the consumer.\u2019 \u201d 500 F.Supp. at 1187 (emphasis in original). From this, the district court concluded that \u201cin the written warranty\u201d suggests that \u201c[a] written warranty is not just a particular type of \u2018promise\u2019 or \u2018affirmation\u2019 but a type of document or written contract as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its brief on appeal, GM simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>larly stated that a \u201c \u2018written warranty\u2019 can be both a particular type of written promise or affirmation <em>and </em>the document incorporating it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The text of a \u201cwritten warranty\u201d must, in the nature of things, be written <em>on </em>something. And, to this extent, a written warranty as defined in \u00a7 101(6) might be described as a written document. But there is nothing in the scheme of the statute to suggest that the Act was intended to apply to any promises, affirmations or undertakings other than those defined as written warranties in \u00a7 101(6). And we ought not to take a leap of faith to a documentary definition allegedly suggested by the seemingly inapt phrasing of \u00a7 102. As already noted, it is apparent from the statutory scheme that \u201cwritten warranty\u201d should be accorded a single, precise meaning. Moreover, we are constrained by sensible rules of statutory construction to interpret the phrase \u201cwritten warranty\u201d in \u00a7 102, as in the other sections of the statute, to be consistent with the clear meaning given to it by \u00a7 101(6). As stated in <em>United States v.

We therefore decline to accept the position that \u201cwritten warranty\u201d means both a particular class of representations and some undefined \u201cdocument\u201d containing those representations. It is more appropriate to read the inconsistent phrase \u201cinclusion <em>in </em>the written warranty\u201d [emphasis supplied] to mean \u201cinclusion <em>with </em>the written warranty\u201d or \u201cinclusion in <em>the document containing </em>the written warranty.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The term \u201cwritten warranty\u201d serves a central function in the Act of identifying the particular representations that are subject to the Act\u2019s disclosure and content requirements.

We cannot agree that syntactical slips such as the use of the preposition \u201cin\u201d in \u00a7 102, create ambiguities in the statutory scheme of sufficient weight to justify discarding the meticulously worded definition of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d in \u00a7 101(6) in favor of an undefined \u201cdocument,\u201d or \u201cpile of written documents,\u201d as urged by the district court. <em>See </em>500 F.Supp. at 1190.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In sum, we are constrained to interpret \u201cwritten warranty\u201d in \u00a7 110(d) in accordance with the definition of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d provided by Congress in \u00a7 101(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\">. This case is related to the much-publicized \u201cengine interchange\u201d litigation, a consolidated class action brought against GM on behalf of all purchasers of 1977 Oldsmobile automobiles equipped with engines produced by GM\u2019s Chevrolet division. That litigation has been before this court twice on questions concerning, first, the district court\u2019s approval of a subclass settlement, <em>In re General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litigation, </em>594 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 870, 100 S.Ct. 146, 62 L.Ed.2d 95 (1979) and, second, the sufficiency of a notice which detailed an offer of settlement to individual subclass members, <em>Oswald v. McGarr, </em>620 F.2d 1190 (7th Cir. 1980). Nothing in our opinions or in the district court\u2019s orders in that case, however, directly addresses the issue before us here \u2014 namely, whether a warranty of description of an automobile component is actionable as a \u201cwritten warranty\u201d under \u00a7 110(d) of Magnuson-Moss. In this regard, plaintiffs have referred us to the following paragraph from <em>In re General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litigation-.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The trial court\u2019s findings contain no express discussion of the merits of the Magnuson-Moss claim. Indeed, with respect to the alleged transmission switch in Delta 88s, the court apparently misapprehended the nature of the objectors\u2019 claims. The court noted that all Delta 88 coupes and sedans contained the THM 200 regardless of whether they had Chevrolet or Oldsmobile engines. The gist of objectors\u2019 claim, as we understand it, is that the transmissions used simply were not those warranted. Thus, the fact that all Delta 88 sedan and coupe purchasers received the smaller transmission is irrelevant. If objectors\u2019 contention is correct, GM breached its warranty to all Delta purchasers, not just those who received Chevrolet engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">594 F.2d at 1132 n.44. This statement, which does not purport to be dispositive of anything, is not part of our holding in that case. It has merely become part of the detritus of lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">We do not know why the issue before us now was not explicitly considered in the engine interchange litigation. It may be that it was not raised there (although plaintiffs suggest to the contrary). It may also be, as suggested by two commentators, that the engine switch was alleged in that case to be a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, which is defined in U.C.C. \u00a7 2-314 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">(a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">(c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and</p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">(d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and</p>\n<p id=\"b377-19\">(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require; and</p>\n<p id=\"b377-20\">(f) conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-21\"><em>See </em>Miller and Kanter, <em>Litigation Under Magnuson-Moss: New Opportunities in Private Actions, </em>13 U.C.C.

Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that GM had warranted that its automobiles contained THM 350 (M38) transmissions, or \u201ctransmissions of similar quality and performance . . . and that [such transmissions] would meet a specified level of performance.\u201d The district court concluded that such a warranty did not fall within the \u00a7 101(6) definition of \u201cwritten warranty,\u201d because it did not affirm that the transmission would \u201cmeet a specified level of performance <em>over a specified period of time.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(6) (1976) (emphasis added). <em>See </em>500 F.Supp. at 1185-86. This conclusion is consistent with the FTC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 101(6), which is set forth in its regulations at 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 700.3(a) (1980):</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The Act imposes specific duties and liabilities on suppliers who offer written warranties on consumer products. Certain representations, such as energy efficiency ratings for electrical appliances, care labeling of wearing apparel, and other product information disclosures may be express warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code. However, these disclosures alone are not written warranties under this Act. Section 101(6) provides that a written affirmation of fact or a written promise of a specified level of performance must relate to a specified period of time in order to be considered a \u201cwritten warranty.\u201d A product information disclosure without a specified time period to which the disclosure relates is therefore not a written warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The district court noted that, by this reading of \u00a7 101(6), a representation that a \u201ctransmission would perform like a THM 350 transmission for the life of the transmission\u201d would constitute a \u201cwritten warranty,\u201d while the representation that a \u201ctransmission would perform like a THM 350 transmission\u201d does not. The arbitrariness of this distinction is apparent, but a certain amount of arbitrariness is inevitable whenever a bright line must be drawn. And the need for a clearly circumscribed definition in the statutory scheme before us is apparent since, to comply with the Act\u2019s obligations, manufacturers and suppliers must know in advance exactly which representations are subject to those obligations. Moreover, it is quite plausible that the Act\u2019s draftsmen defined \u201cwritten warranty\u201d in \u00a7 101(6) so as to exclude general descriptions of consumer products or their components from the reach of the Act, since it would be excessively cumbersome to impose the Act\u2019s disclosure rules on every advertisement containing a description of a product or its components. On this appeal, plaintiffs do not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that the warranties described in their complaint are not within the \u00a7 101(6) definition. 500 F.Supp. at 1185-86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b380-14\">. The Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 2-313 defines \u201cexpress warranty\u201d to mean:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">(c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">. Of course, it is inappropriate to blindly adhere to a statutory definition if such adherence would frustrate clearly expressed legislative intent. Thus, in <em>United States v. Walton, </em>514 F.2d 201. (D.C.Cir.1975), the court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the statutory definition of marijuana should prevail in a prosecution for unlawful distribution of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.' Finding that the \u201clegislative history is absolutely clear that Congress meant to outlaw all plants popularly known as marijuana to the extent those plants possess THC.\u201d 514 F.2d at 203-04, the court held that the term \u201cmarijuana\u201d as used in the Act included all species of cannibus containing THC, even though the statute defined marijuana as cannibus sativa L\u201e which, arguably, was only one of several known species of cannibus containing THC. <em>Accord, United States v. Lupo, </em>652 F.2d 723 (7th Cir. 1981); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>527 F.2d 961 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Gavic, </em>520 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">As a rule, however, there should be a strong presumption that a statutory term means what it is defined to mean, because, by the very act of including a definition in the statute, the statute\u2019s draftsmen have made a considered determination of the appropriate meaning of that term for the purposes of the particular statutory scheme they have created. Nothing offered by the plaintiffs is sufficient to suggest that Congress did not intend for the definition it ascribed to \u201cwritten warranty\u201d for purposes of the Act in \u00a7 101(6) not to apply to the phrase \u201cwritten warranty\u201d in \u00a7 110(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">.

It appears unlikely that either this proposed class action or the engine interchange class action would have met this stringent amount in controversy requirement. We note that Congress amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1976) in 1980 to eliminate the minimum amount in controversy requirement.

In contrast to the Senate version of \u00a7 110, the federal jurisdictional provision of the House bill, which was adopted by the Conference, required only that each individual claim be greater than $25, although the amount in controversy in the aggregate must exceed $50,000. In addition, if the action is brought as a class action, at least 100 plaintiffs must be named. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(3) (1976). The House Report stated that the purpose of these jurisdictional requirements \u201cis to avoid trivial or insignificant actions being brought as class actions in the federal courts.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.93-1107, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong, and Ad.News 7724. Absent these requirements, actions could have been brought in federal court under the Act without regard to the amount in controversy. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (1976); <em>Novosel v.

The Senate bill had provided for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees by consumers who prevailed in <em>state court </em>actions for breach of any express or implied warranty. The House bill, as the Conference Report correctly stated, did not provide attorneys\u2019 fees in actions for breach of oral express warranties. <em>See </em>note 11, <em>supra. </em>It would also have been correct for the Report to note that the House bill had created a federal cause of action and provided attorneys\u2019 fees only for consumers damaged by breach of those warranties defined in \u00a7 101(10) of the bill. <em>Id. </em>But the failure of the Report to\u2019 so note does not support the conclusion that the Conference Committee, in adopting the House approach, intended to do something that neither the House nor the Senate had contemplated, i. e., create a cause of action cognizable in federal court for breach of any written express warranty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b383-15\">. Plaintiffs have referred us to portions of an <em>amicus </em>brief filed with the court in the Engine Interchange Litigation by Senator Magnuson and Representative Moss. Of course, such post-passage remarks of legislators are of negligible value in ascertaining the intent of Congress in passing the Act. <em>Blanchette v. Conn. General Ins. Corp., </em>419 U.S. 102, 132, 95 S.Ct. 335, 352, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974). It is interesting to note, however, that the Act\u2019s sponsors, in urging that GM\u2019s undisclosed substitution of Chevrolet engines in Oldsmobile automobiles constituted a breach of a written warranty under \u00a7 110(d), did not argue that \u00a7 110(d) created a federal cause of action for breach of warranties of description (or other written express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>warranties not within the \u00a7 101(6) definition). Rather, they argued that the representations made by GM constituted \u201cwritten warranties\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 101(6). The plaintiffs do not argue on appeal for such an interpretation under the similar circumstances of this case, and the district court specifically rejected such a construction. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\">. In its regulations, the FTC describes \u00a7 103(b) as creating an \u201cexemption\u201d from the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 102-104. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 700.5(b) (1980). This description strongly suggests that the FTC also perceives that at least some of the generalized statements exempted by \u00a7 102(b) might otherwise fall within the \u00a7 101(6) definition, since the same regulation unambiguously states that the duties and liabilities of the Act are imposed only on those suppliers who offer \u201cwritten warranties\u201d as defined in \u00a7 101(6). <em>See </em>16 C.F.R. \u00a7 700.3(a) (1980) (quoted in note 6, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. Section 101(10) of the House version of the Act defined \u201cwarranty\u201d to mean:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">(A)(i) any written affirmation of fact or written promise made at the time of sale by a supplier to a purchaser which relates to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is defect free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified period of time, or</p>\n<p id=\"AIK\">(ii) any undertaking in writing in connection with the sale of a consumer product to refund, repair, replace, or take other remedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking, which written affirmation, promise, or undertaking becomes part of the basis of the bargain between a supplier and the first buyer at retail of such product; or</p>\n<p id=\"AOy\">(B) an implied warranty arising under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">120 Cong.Rec. 31727 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">. The regulation adopted by the FTC pursuant to \u00a7 102 supports this construction, since it requires clear and conspicuous disclosure \u201cin a single document\u201d (in contrast to \u201cin the written warranty\u201d) of the items of information required by \u00a7 102. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra. </em>Similarly, in defining \u201con the face of the warranty,\u201d the FTC distinguished between the \u201ctext of the warranty\u201d and the document containing it. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\">. Moreover, the legislative history of the Act, which the district court describes as \u201cpuzzling,\u201d 500 F.Supp. at 1188, offers no basis for the district court\u2019s rejection of the \u00a7 101(6) definition. Most of the very general legislative statements cited by the district court were made in reference to the Senate version of \u00a7 110, which, as set forth above, provided attorneys\u2019 fees for consumers who prevailed in state court actions for breach of any express or im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>plied warranty. <em>See </em>Part III, <em>supra. </em>There is simply no clear evidence that Congress, in enacting the House version of \u00a7 110(d), intended to create a federal claim for breach of representations not within the \u00a7 101(6) definition of \u201cwritten warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The reports and proceedings of legislative bodies unquestionably lend themselves to the imagery of archaeology. But for better or worse, the papyrus scrolls or cuneiform tablets which survive such proceedings must count for more than the odd-shaped rocks, human skulls and miscellaneous artifacts scattered around the site. In its \u201carchaeological dig\u201d into legislative history, the district court tended to overlook the obvious but prosaic in favor of exotic \u201cambiguities\u201d attributable more easily to drafting fatigue than to confusion of purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-13\">.

Others before him have characterized it as serving as no exemplar of legislative clarity. I would, therefore, not begin and end by viewing the Act\u2019s definition provisions in such isolation as to conclude that the beneficial consumer protection purposes of the Act are thereby completely limited.

The written warranty would then more fully deserve its gold filigree frame.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-14\">. <em>See United States v.
