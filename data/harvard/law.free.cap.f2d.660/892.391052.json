The United States urged that the court\u2019s authority to convene the grand jury derived either from Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331(a). The district court, reasoning that it lacked the requisite authority, entered an order on December 12, 1980, denying the request. The government subsequently filed this petition for mandamus, asking that we direct the district court to summon a grand jury to investigate alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws. At the time of filing the mandamus petition, the government indicated that it intended to rely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331 as well as Rule 6(a) to support its position. <em>See </em>Petition for Writ at 2. The respondent continued to challenge 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331 as a source of authority for convening a grand jury. However, in a subsequent answering brief the United States stated that it sought review only of the refusal to summon a grand jury under Rule 6(a). <em>See </em>Answering Brief at 2 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">At the outset, we confront a potential barrier to our adjudication of this dispute. Because the government seeks a writ of mandamus, we initially must consider whether the prerequisites to entertaining the petition are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-20\">Traditionally, federal appellate courts have issued the writ of mandamus where a lower court has made an error of \u201cjurisdictional\u201d dimension. Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>Roche v. Evaporated Milk Association, </em>319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 941, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943), identified mandamus as the means \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction in this sense, however, has been read broadly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a variety of contexts, appellate courts have resorted to mandamus where the district court, in a case properly before it, took some action it was not empowered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>to take<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or declined to take some action required of it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The present controversy, on superficial consideration, appears to present the paradigmatic case for mandamus review. The government contends that the district court, in declining to convene a grand jury, has failed to exercise an authority it was obliged to consider. The writ of mandamus, it is argued, provides the appropriate vehicle by which to remedy this failure to comply with applicable law. The unusual posture of the case, however, engenders special problems respecting the availability of mandamus relief. The principle of <em>Mar-bury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) \u2014 that the Supreme Court has no <em>original </em>jurisdiction to issue the writ of mandamus \u2014 historically has applied as well to lower federal courts. Although there appears to be no constitutional impediment, the First Judiciary Act confined the lower courts to issuing writs in aid of an otherwise existing jurisdiction. <em>See McIntire v. Wood, </em>11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 504, 3 L.Ed. 420 (1813).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The current authorization for mandamus, embodied in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), preserves this restraint. It provides: \u201cThe Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate <em>in aid of their respective jurisdictions </em>and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">To satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite, it is not necessary that a case be pending in the court asked to issue the writ. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Mellon Bank, N. A., </em>545 F.2d 869, 872 (3d Cir. 1976). Rather, it suffices that the case may at some future time come within the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. As we explained in <em>United States v. RMI Co., </em>599 F.2d 1183, 1186 (3d Cir. 1979), \u201cthe action must .. . involve subject matter to which our appellate jurisdiction could in some manner, at sometime, attach.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before entertaining the application, then, we must identify a jurisdiction that the issuance of the writ might assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">Because the district court has so far declined to convene a grand jury, there is currently pending no lawsuit that might eventually come before us on appeal. Indeed, one of the government\u2019s arguments for issuance of the writ is that, absent mandamus, the district court\u2019s decision will forever be shielded from review. It is, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>course, possible that some action not yet commenced may raise the issue the government would have us consider now.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But prediction of future lawsuits is nothing more than speculation, and, in any event, the connection between such suits and the present petition is so attenuated that it cannot establish that issuance of the writ at this time wo\u00fcld be \u201cin aid of\u201d our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Although the requested writ cannot be issued pursuant to our eventual jurisdiction over any identifiable case, we are not persuaded that such jurisdiction is invariably a prerequisite to a grant of mandamus relief. This Court has previously made use of the writ of mandamus notwithstanding the lack of a specific controversy over which we might later exercise jurisdiction. In <em>United States v. Malmin, </em>272 F. 785 (3d Cir. 1921), the Governor of the Virgin Islands, without authority, had revoked the appointment of district judge Malmin and replaced him with another judge. Because questions of the validity of the judgments of the functioning judge would arise \u201cin a way which would leave this court helpless to correct the fundamental trouble\u201d and insofar as it was \u201cessential to the appellate jurisdiction of this court that orderly proceedings in the district court ... be restored,\u201d the Court issued a writ ordering Malmin to reassume his duties as judge. <em>Id. </em>at 792. Indeed, eases in which, absent resort to mandamus, we would lose our ability to review the issue at all, present a wholly consistent example of mandamus as necessary for the exercise'of our jurisdiction. As described by adherents of a carefully circumscribed mandamus power: \u201cThe focal question posed for a Court of Appeals by a petition for the issuance of a writ is whether the action of the District Court tends to frustrate or impede the ultimate exercise by the Court of Appeals of its appellate jurisdiction granted in some other provision of the law.\u201d <em>LaBuy v. Howes Leather Co., </em>352 U.S. 249, 264, 77 S.Ct. 309, 317, 1 L.Ed.2d 290 (1957) (Brennan, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the refusal of the district court to convene a grand jury to investigate antitrust violations may arguably impede the prosecution of crimes over which we would otherwise have review.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">On at least three occasions, the Supreme Court, acting pursuant to Section 1651 or its predecessors, has granted the writ even though no controversy which subsequently could have been presented to the Court for review on the merits was then pending. In <em>Ex parte Bradstreet, </em>32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 634, 8 L.Ed. 810 (1833), the district court had dismissed an action in which plaintiff had demanded the return of property, on the ground that the plaintiff had not averred the pecuniary value of the land, and therefore failed to satisfy the $2,000 amount-in-controversy requirement. Because the action had already been dismissed, and there was accordingly no pending federal action, plaintiff\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus did not fall within the tribunal\u2019s \u201cpotential\u201d jurisdiction over a specific controversy. Nonetheless the Court, in a brief opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, issued the writ, directing the district court to reinstate the case. <em>Id. </em>at 649, 8 L.Ed. 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\"><em>Ex parte United States, </em>287 U.S. 241, 53 S.Ct. 129, 77 L.Ed. 283 (1932), similarly involved a situation where, at the time the Supreme Court considered the request for mandamus, there was no pending action over which the Court\u2019s jurisdiction might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>some day attach. In that case a United States Attorney, having secured a grand jury indictment against Joseph Wingert, petitioned the district court to issue a bench warrant for Wingert\u2019s arrest. When the court refused, the government, by-passing the court of appeals, petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus directing the district judge to issue the warrant. In granting the writ, the only jurisdictional question that detained the court was whether it could issue the writ notwithstanding the fact that direct review from district court decisions is vested in the courts of appeals, rather than the Supreme Court. The Court was not troubled by the absence of a pending lawsuit; indeed, the premise of the Court\u2019s discussion was that the court of appeals had authority to issue the writ, see <em>id. </em>at 249, 53 S.Ct. at 131, even though, as the district court\u2019s opinion indicates, see 55 F.2d 960, 963 (E.D.Pa.1932), mandamus supplied the only basis for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">More recently, in <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), the Supreme Court considered the appropriateness of using mandamus to require a district court to entertain a diversity action it had improperly remanded to state court. The Court, without mention of whether the writ would aid appellate jurisdiction when there was no longer a live federal case, granted the requested relief. Mandamus, it said, would help \u201cprevent nullification of the removal statutes by remand orders resting on grounds having no warrant in the law.\" <em>Id. </em>at 353, 96 S.Ct. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\"><em>Ex parte Bradstreet, Ex parte United States, </em>and <em>Thermatron Products </em>jointly suggest that a controversy may fall within the \u201cpotential jurisdiction\u201d of an appellate tribunal for purposes of Section 1651, even absent a pending federal action that might ultimately be appealed. <em>Ex parte United States, </em>moreover, indicates that the jurisdictional prerequisite may be satisfied even though no such action was ever pending in federal court. These three cases should not be read too generously, however, and we do not interpret them to sanction a broad supervisory authority over the lower courts. Instead, we regard the precedents as establishing a principle of limited application: where a district court, by action not committed to its discretion, prevents a nascent controversy from being adjudicated and thereby defeats appellate review, the subject matter of the court\u2019s action is within the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the appellate court for purposes of the All Writs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Applied to the present case, these principles support our power to entertain the government\u2019s petition. The government alleges that the district court, in declining even to consider whether to summon a grand jury, has breached a duty that is not committed to its discretion. Further, the purported consequence of this decision is that the United States will be precluded from adequate investigation and prosecution of criminal activity, thereby barring the emergence of controversies cognizable in federal court. Although the district court\u2019s action will not interfere with our review of any case currently pending in the federal system, we believe that the present dispute, affects our \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as that term is used in Section 1651.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Various of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent illuminations of the scope and purpose of the mandamus remedy strengthen this conclusion. Tn <em>LaBuy v. Howes Leather Co., </em>352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290 (1957), the Court employed the writ to compel a district court to vacate orders referring an antitrust case for trial before a master. The Court in so doing suggested that mandamus might be used \u201cas a means of policing compliance with the procedural rules,\u201d <em>see Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 100 n.10, 88 S.Ct. 269, 276, n.10, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967), by using it to review orders that are part of a general practice adopted by the district court which is outside the scope of the rules. While review of individual discretionary decisions is improper, appellate tribunals should consider charges that a lower court\u2019s approach to a rule effectively \u201cnullifies\u201d it. <em>See </em>352 U.S. at 256-57, 77 S.Ct. at 313-14. The present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>case involves such a systemic problem. The district judge simply does not believe he possesses the power to summon a grand jury, while the government adopts a contrary construction of the rules and statutes. The issue of discretionary authority is not presented, for the parties agree that the district court\u2019s power was either granted or forbidden. The case at hand thus presents an opportunity for mandamus review to fulfill its \u201cvital corrective and didactic function.\u201d <em>Will, </em>389 U.S. at 107, 88 S.Ct. at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The Supreme Court stressed the pedagogic value of the writ in <em>Schlagenhauf v. Holder, </em>379 U.S. 104, 110, 85 S.Ct. 234, 238, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964). There it approved mandamus review to decide the \u201cbasic, undecided\u201d question whether a district court could order the mental or physical examination of a defendant pursuant to Rule 35(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Similarly, the question presented here is one of first impression, and review would comport with the instructional goals of mandamus. Consideration of the petition also serves the policy of limiting the writ to extraordinary circumstances by insisting \u201cthat the party seeking issuance of the writ have no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires.\u201d <em>Kerr v. United States District Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2124, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>First Jersey Securities, Inc. v. Bergen, </em>605 F.2d 690, 701 (3d Cir. 1979). As explained above, the district court, should it persist in its interpretation of the law, will foreclose the opportunity for testing its construction on direct appeal. Review through a petition for mandamus thus appears to be the only practical way to resolve this unsettled and important question.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We note finally that the policies that typically militate against consideration of a petition for mandamus are inapposite here. The case does not implicate the general policy against piecemeal appeals, <em>see First Jersey, </em>605 F.2d at 702, inasmuch as there is as yet no ongoing action that review would disrupt. Moreover, although the cases arise in the context of the federal criminal statutes and procedural rules, review will not endanger the right of an individual criminal defendant to a speedy trial. <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971) (Sixth Amendment\u2019s speedy trial guarantee applies to period between indictment and trial); <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. at 96, 88 S.Ct. at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">In view of such considerations, we proceed to consider the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">The grand jury as an institution was adopted from the common law and, secured in the Fifth Amendment, became a fundamental part of our country\u2019s system for the prosecution of crime. <em>See Ex parte Bain, </em>121 U.S. 1, 6, 7 S.Ct. 781, 784, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1887); <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343-44, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617-18', 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). While neither the Constitution nor statutory law originally defined the scope of grand jury functions, it was established early on by the judiciary that the authority to summon grand juries was a corollary of the criminal jurisdiction of the federal courts. As Chief Justice Marshall explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">It has been justly observed, that no act of Congress directs grand juries, or defines their powers. By what authority, then, are they summoned, and whence do they derive their powers? The answer is, that the laws of the United States have erected courts which are invested with criminal jurisdiction. This jurisdiction they are bound to exercise, and it can only be exercised through the instrumentality of grand juries. They are, therefore, given by a necessary and indispensable implication. But, how far is this implication necessary and indispensable? The answer is obvious. Its necessity is co-extensive with that jurisdiction to which it is essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\"><em>United States v. Hill, </em>1 Brock 156, 159, 26 Fed.Cas. 315, 317 (C.C.D.Va.1809). Because the Fifth Amendment guarantees that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\u201d federal courts possess inherent power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>to convene grand juries when they are necessary to satisfy the constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Absent such a necessary implication from the Constitution, however, there is some question whether courts .have inherent power to convene grand juries. In discussing the authority of a territorial court, the elder Justice Harlan remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">A grand jury, by which presentments or indictments may be made for offences against the United States, is a creature of statute. It cannot be empanelled by a court of the United States by virtue simply of its organization as a judicial tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\"><em>In Re Mills, </em>135 U.S. 263, 267, 10 S.Ct. 762, 763, 34 L.Ed. 107 (1890). And more recently, the Second Circuit, in <em>United States v. Fein, </em>504 F.2d 1170, 1172 (2d Cir. 1974), declared that grand juries are not \u201ccreatures of the court\u201d; rather, the power of courts over grand juries is guided by rules and statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <em>Fein </em>court sought to reconcile the language in <em>Hill </em>and <em>Mills </em>by noting that Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion was written in 1809, \u201clong before Congress had enacted any legislation regulating the powers or the tenure of grand juries.\u201d 504 F.2d at 1172. In <em>Mills </em>the issue was the power of an Article I territorial court, whereas in <em>Hill </em>the discussion centered on Article III courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">In canvassing the possible sources that might confer power on the District Court of the Virgin Islands to summon a grand jury, we are limited. It would appear that power cannot derive simply from the court\u2019s inherent supervisory authority over activities within its purview. Nor is it clearly implied by necessity from the Fifth Amendment\u2019s command, for it was settled at the time our nation began acquiring territories that, at least with respect to prosecutions under local law, specific protections and rights conferred by the Constitution do not apply \u201cto territory belonging to the United States which has not been incorporated into the Union.\u201d <em>Balzac v. Porto Rico, </em>258 U.S. 298, 305, 42 S.Ct. 343, 345, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922); <em>Dorr v. United States, </em>195 U.S. 138, 145, 24 S.Ct. 808, 811, 49 L.Ed. 128 (1904). Therefore, this Court, following the directions provided in <em>Balzac v. Porto Rico, </em>258 U.S. 298, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922); <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>195 U.S. 138, 24 S.Ct. 808, 49 L.Ed. 128 (1904) and <em>Hawaii v. Mankichi, </em>190 U.S. 197, 23 S.Ct. 787, 47 L.Ed. 1016 (1903), has held that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s grand jury protection does not extend to prosecutions initiated in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">In all the cases holding that constitutional projections relating to the conduct of criminal prosecutions do not apply in the absence of statute to unincorporated territories, the Supreme Court reasoned that the United States, in acquiring such possessions, did not intend to supplant indigenous procedural rules which had developed to enforce local substantive norms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It might be ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>gued that the existence of a territorial tradition unlike our own should not defeat application of constitutional guarantees when the United States, rather than the territorial government, seeks to investigate and prosecute violations of federal, rather than local, law. However, in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Dowling, </em>633 F.2d 660 (3d Cir. 1980), which held that the Fifth Amendment requirement of a grand jury does not apply in the Virgin Islands even for a prosecution under federal law, we find no constitutional basis for investigatory grand juries in the territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Even if the Constitution does not apply,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> however, the Virgin Islands, as an unincorporated territory, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1541(a), is governed by a congressionally enacted Bill of Rights. 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561. We have previously held that such Bill of Rights \u201cexpresses the congressional intention to make the federal constitution applicable to the Virgin Islands to the fullest extent possible consistent with its status as a territory.\u201d <em>In Re Brown, </em>439 F.2d 47, 51 (3d Cir. 1971) (en banc). The Virgin Islands Bill of Rights extends the Fifth Amendment to that territory, but also states \u201c[t]hat all offenses shall continue to be prosecuted in the district court by information as heretobefore, except such as may be required by local law to be prosecuted by indictment by grand jury.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1561. Therefore neither constitutional nor organic statutory provisions can readily be construed to authorize, even by implication, the Virgin Islands District Court to convene a grand jury. <em>See Government of Virgin Islands v. Rijos, </em>285 F.Supp. 126, 129 (D.V.I.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Nevertheless, since Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s time Congress has enacted several statutes explicitly providing for grand juries. In the present proceeding the government originally suggested two sources for the judicial power to summon a grand jury: Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331(a), which permits the creation of special grand juries \u201cbecause of criminal activity in the district.\u201d Judge Christian, however, expressed the concern that the Virgin Islands District Court\u2019s authority in the criminal field is not congruent with that of other federal trial courts. In his view, the Virgin Islands tribunal does not share the power to summon a grand jury for indictment or investigative purposes. The government, after certifying to the district court in accordance with Section 3331 the need for a special grand jury, has sought mandamus only with respect to the district court\u2019s refusal to convene a jury pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In view of this decision by the government, we turn to Rule 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">As authorized by Congress, the District Court of the Virgin Islands possesses a hybrid jurisdiction that combines the powers of a federal court with those ordinarily reserved for state tribunals. The court possesses both \u201cthe jurisdiction of a district court of the United States\u201d over cases arising under the federal constitution and laws, and \u201cgeneral original jurisdiction\u201d in all other causes. 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure govern in the District Court of the Virgin Islands pursuant to Rule 54(a). Those Rules have the force of statute,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and thus might, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>the government maintains, provide an appropriate source of authority for the District- Court to convene a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Rule 6(a) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Summoning Grand Juries. The court shall order one or more grand juries to be summoned at such times as the public interest requires. The grand jury shall consist of not less than 16 nor more than 23 members. The court shall direct that a sufficient number of legally qualified persons be summoned to meet this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">If this Rule applied with full force in the Virgin Islands, it arguably would confer on the district court the authority to convene a grand jury to investigate crimes and indict where it found probable cause. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Wallace &amp; Tiernan, Inc., </em>349 F.2d 222, 226 (D.C.Cir.1975). The investigatory powers of such a grand jury would be broad, since the federal system allows grand juries wide compass in their inquiries. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 .S.Ct. 613, 617, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). In the Virgin Islands, however, the authority provided by Rule 6(a) is circumscribed. Rule 54(a), which extends the application of the Rules to the Virgin Islands, carves out a significant exception: \u201call offenses shall continue to be prosecuted in ... the District Court of the Virgin Islands by information as heretofore except such as may be required by local law to be prosecuted by indictment by grand jury.\u201d This exception reflects and incorporates the substance of Section 25 of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615, which provides for prosecution by information rather than indictment unless otherwise required by local law. In light of Rule 54(a) and Section 25, Rule 6(a) cannot be read to authorize <em>indicting </em>grand juries in the Virgin Islands. The government suggests that Rule 6(a) can nevertheless provide authority for grand juries in the Virgin Islands that <em>investigate </em>but do not indict. Although 54(a) does not specifically forbid such grand juries, we find nothing in Rule 6(a) which can fairly be construed to authorize them.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Many states that prosecute by information still provide for investigatory grand juries, especially when large and intricate conspiracies or public corruption are at stake. For example, Pennsylvania, which previously authorized such juries under common law, <em>see </em>Note, <em>Discretionary Power in the Judiciary to Organize a Special Investigating Grand Jury, </em>111 U.Pa.L.Rev. 954 (1963), has recently spelled out by legislation the powers it considers appropriate for its \u201cinvestigating grand juries.\u201d 42 Pa. Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4541 \u2014 4553 (Purdon 1981). That law empowers investigatory grand juries to subpoena witnesses and inquire into criminal offenses within the Commonwealth, initiate civil and criminal contempt proceedings, and issue presentments against any person within its jurisdiction who appears to have committed an offense against the Commonwealth. 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 4548. We presume that the government in this case seeks to have the District Court of the Virgin Islands authorize a similar type of institution \u2014 in effect, a body with all the powers of a normal grand jury short of the power to indict. However, we are unable to find in the Federal Rules any language that would create such an entity in the way that Pennsylvania\u2019s common law and statutory provisions do.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">The federal courts have long recognized the vital investigatory function which grand juries perform in the federal system. <em>See, e. g., Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 701, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2666, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972); <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 282, 39 S.Ct.'468, 471, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919); <em>Hale v. Henkel, </em>201 U.S. 43, 65, 26 S.Ct. 370, 375, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906). Indeed, some commentators have suggested that the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>jury\u2019s role as investigator is at least as important a contribution to our legal system as is its role as protector of individual rights. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Investigating Grand Juries: A Comparison of Pennsylvania\u2019s Judicially and Legislatively Created Bodies, </em>18 Duq.L.Rev. 933, 933 (1980). But no authority advocates investigation for its own sake; the grand jury\u2019s inquisition must culminate in a disposition that furthers the prosecutorial process. Although it may ultimately fail to uncover any crime, a federal grand jury\u2019s investigation can still be justified by the possibility that it <em>might </em>have resulted in the issuance of criminal charges. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Blair, </em>in describing the grand jury\u2019s powers:</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">It is a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of a crime. As has been said before, the identity of the offender, and the precise nature of the offense, if there be one, normally are developed at the conclusion of the grand jury\u2019s labors, not at the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">250 U.S. at 282, 39 S.Ct. at 471; <em>accord, Branzburg, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 688, 92 S.Ct. at 2660. <em>See generally United States v. Cox, </em>342 F.2d 167, 185-96 (5th cir. 1975) (en banc) (Wisdom, J., concurring specially). By its own terms this recognition of investigatory powers cannot be read to extend to situations in which the grand jury lacks the <em>power </em>to make formal accusations. Rather, it ties the grand jury\u2019s broad investigative power to its ultimate decision whether to accuse a suspect of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">For the Virgin Islands, the Federal Rules withhold any means by which grand juries might make formal accusations. As noted above, Rule 54(a) specifically denies authorization for indictment except as required by the local legislature. Further, it appears, the Rules do not empower grand juries in the Virgin Islands or elsewhere to make \u201cpresentments\u201d \u2014 reports of the grand jury to the court asking that a \u201ccharge be drawn to cover the facts should they constitute a crime,\u201d <em>United States v. Smyth, </em>104 F.Supp. 283, 295 (N.D.Cal.1952). As the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has noted, \u201cthe practice of using presentments has disappeared in the federal system and is not provided for in F.R.Crim.P. Rules 6 and 7.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>514 F.2d 794, 803 n.14 (5th Cir. 1975). This reading of the Rules is strengthened by the Notes of the Advisory Committee to Rule 7, which provide that:</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Presentment is not included as an additional type of formal accusation, since presentments as a method of instituting prosecutions are obsolete, at least as concerns the Federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">It is conceivable, of course, that Congress would wish to preserve accusation by presentment where it is not obsolete, and the Virgin Islands might be considered such a place because indictment is not available. Though such a policy might be considered advisable, nothing in the language of Rules 6 and 7 lends any support to the proposition that any federal grand juries are authorized to make presentments.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Indeed, in light of Rule 54(a) and the parallel Section 25 of the Virgin Islands Organic Act it would be difficult to find authority for a grand jury to make presentments in the Virgin Islands even if federal grand juries elsewhere had such power. The legislative history of the 1954 amendments to Section 25 suggests two concerns: a reluctance to provide for a right to grand jury indictment \u2014 a right that might lead to a general jail delivery of the territory\u2019s prisoners \u2014 and a desire to avoid creating a prosecuting body that would conflict with the Islands\u2019 civil law heritage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>the second concern it is difficult to conceive of a rationale that would motivate Congress to permit grand jury presentment but withhold authorization for indicting grand juries. If the latter would violate local traditions and customs, the former, differing only in that the grand jury would not formally institute proceedings but would recommend to the court that proceedings be instituted, would appear equally obtrusive. Presentment is no more familiar to Virgin Islands\u2019 tradition than is indictment. In the absence of a clear expression permitting presentments in the Virgin Islands, we are unable to infer such an intent from either the Federal Rules or Section 25 of the Revised Organic Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">If the government\u2019s proposed investigatory grand jury may neither indict nor present, it can serve no effective accusatorial purpose. The only remaining possible function would be the issuance of reports of some sort. In a variety of circumstances federal grand juries have been permitted to issue reports in addition to or even in place of indictments. The only explicit statutory authority for such reports is contained in the provisions for special grand juries under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3331-3334.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although federal grand juries not convened pursuant to that statute may also have some reporting powers, <em>see In re Report and Recommendations of June 5, 1972 Grand Jury Concerning Transmission of Evidence to the House of Representatives, </em>370 F.Supp. 1219, 1223-24 (D.D.C.1974),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the government has cited no case in which a federal grand jury was convened with the <em>sole </em>power and purpose of issuing such reports.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such an institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>tion would be foreign to the federal judiciary as it now exists; even grand juries convened under Sections 3331-3334 retain the <em>power </em>to indict. <em>See United States v. Ceccerelii, </em>350 F.Supp. 475 (W.D.Pa.1972). Whatever the merits of creating a non-indicting grand jury, we do not find in- the general language of Rule 6 any expression of an intent to authorize an unprecedented institution such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We recognize that an investigatory grand jury might serve a valuable function in the prosecutorial system of the Virgin Islands. In light of the serious crime problems existing in that and other jurisdictions, we are reluctant to deny the Islands the power to invoke an investigative device that elsewhere has served the legal system as a guardian of both social needs and individual rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we are constrained by the absence of authority to institute such grand juries in the Virgin Islands. Although the creation of an investigatory grand jury, or even an indicting grand jury, might be salutary, it is not for the courts to institute such an entity without legislative direction. We must, therefore, defer to the Virgin Islands\u2019 legislature or the United States Congress to authorize for the Virgin Islands such grand juries as are deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Accordingly, the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-15\">. <em>Accord, Parr v.

Yet the lower courts are not similarly bound by this constitutional language. Although McI<em>ntire v.

In fact, the absence of constitutional grounds made possible the congressional abrogation of <em>McIntire </em>in the 1962 Mandamus &amp; Venue Act.

On these facts, we held that the petition fell without our potential jurisdiction. The corporation had effectively intervened in the criminal proceedings, and, had the district court reached the merits of its motion, would have been entitled to immediate appellate review from an adverse ruling. <em>See United States v.

Saylor). Earlier, the Ninth Circuit, observing that the Guam Organic Act made the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable in the District Court of Guam, had held that criminal defendants had a right, under Rule 7(a), to prosecution by indictment for any offense punishable by a prison term exceeding one year. See <em>Hatchett v. Government of Guam, </em>212 F.2d 767, 772 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed </em>348 U.S. 801, 75 S.Ct. 17, 99 L.Ed. 633 (1954). Inasmuch as prosecutions in Guam were initiated by information, this holding created the danger that all prisoners on Guam, none of whom had been prosecuted by indictment, might be released. Congress responded by amending the Guam Organic Act to insure against a \u201cgeneral jail delivery,\u201d <em>see </em>S.Rep.No. 2006, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1954), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 3371, and to foreclose future application of federal procedural rules <em>\u201cwhich authorize or require . . . </em>the prosecution of offenses by indictment by a grand jury instead of by information.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Like Guam, the Virgin Islands, a possession of Denmark until 1917, claim a civil law heritage that does not disclose reliance on grand juries. The proposal of Judge Maris apparently respected the local interest in retaining its traditional procedures as well as the immediate concern of preventing a general release of prisoners. Although the latter goal could have been satisfied by a rule authorizing but not requiring grand juries, Section 25 and Rule 54(a) went further and withheld future <em>authorization </em>for indictment by grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3333 provides for the issuance of reports \u201cconcerning noncriminal misconduct, malfeasance, or misfeasance in office involving organized criminal activity by an appointed public officer or employee as the basis for a recommendation of removal or disciplinary action\u201d or \u201cregarding organized crime conditions in the district.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\">.

George, </em>625 F.2d 1081, 1088-89 (3d Cir. 1980). Judge Christian then observed that Section 25 of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, <em>see </em>48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615, and Rule 54(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure both provide that all prosecutions in the District Court of the Virgin Islands (except as otherwise required by local law) shall be prosecuted by information. Finally, he observed that a grand jury never had been convened in the Virgin Islands and that the procedural machinery required to bring a grand jury into being did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">In subsequent correspondence, Judge Christian suggested that the Justice Department persuade the Virgin Islands Legislature to enact a statute authorizing an investigatory grand jury. If that effort failed, the judge suggested that the Justice Department might utilize the special subpoena powers conferred on the U.S. Attorney for the Virgin Islands by the Virgin Islands Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">It was at that point that the Justice Department abandoned all reliance on \u00a7 3331.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, the Justice Department then asked that an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury be convened pursuant to Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. When Chief Judge Christian refused to convene the grand jury sought by the Justice Department, the present petition for a writ of mandamus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">The writ sought to have this court direct the District Court of the Virgin Islands to convene a grand jury for the limited purpose of investigation pursuant to Fed.R. Crim.P. 6(a). In its petition, the United States, after maintaining that mandamus was a proper remedy for the district court\u2019s refusal to summon an investigatory grand jury, asserted that enforcement of federal laws in the Virgin Islands would be \u201ccrippled\u201d if investigatory grand juries could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>be convened there. The United States then claimed that Rule 54(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615 (1976)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Section 25 of the Virgin Islands Revised Organic Act) only preclude the initiation of <em>prosecution </em>by a grand jury. Rule 54(a) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">(a) Courts. These rules apply to all criminal proceedings in the United States District Courts; in the District Court of Guam; in the District Court of the Virgin Islands; and (except as otherwise provided in the Canal Zone Code) in the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone; in the United States Courts of Appeals\u2019 and in the Supreme Court of the United States; <em>except that all offenses shall continue to be prosecuted in the District Court of Guam and in the District Court of the Virgin Islands by information as heretofore except such as may be required by local law to be prosecuted by indictment by grand jury. </em>(emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Since the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply in the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the United States contended \u201cRule 6(a) powers\u201d extend to the Virgin Islands to the extent that these powers provide for an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury which has no power of indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">According to the petition of the United States:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">It is possible \u201cto give effect to both\u201d provisions by reading them as allowing the calling of investigative grand juries in the Virgin Islands under Rule 6(a), but requiring, pursuant to Rule 54(a) and 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615, prosecution by'information. While grand juries traditionally perform both investigative and accusatory functions, Congress on occasion contemplates that grand juries might investigate crimes without issuing indictments. See, e. g., Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3333.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Grand jury investigative authority is deeply ingrained in American jurisprudence, see <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343-44, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617-618, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 688, 92 . S.Ct. 2646, 2660, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972); <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 280, 282, 39 S.Ct. 468, 470, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919); <em>Hale v. Henkel, </em>201 U.S. 43, 64-65, 26 S.Ct. 370, 374-375, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906), and it is implausible that Congress intended indirectly to abrogate this power in the Virgin Islands by insisting on prosecution by information.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Petition for the United States at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">In its final argument, the United States relied on the legislative history of the 1954 amendment to Section 25 of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, which provides for continued prosecution by information. The main purpose of this amendment, the United States argued, was to prevent the release of prisoners who, up until that time, had not been indicted by (or waived indictment by) a grand jury. The government\u2019s version of the legislative history revealed no hostility to the grand jury as an institution, and more particularly, to an investigatory grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">The answering and supplementary briefs of the United States essentially embellished its original reasoning. The government noted that the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1861, <em>et seq. </em>(1976), which provides the methods for selecting both grand and petit juries, applies to the District Court of the Virgin Islands, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1869(f) (1976). The United States argued that these provisions contemplate the use of a grand jury in the Virgin Islands. In its supplementary brief, the government, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>plained why available, alternative means of investigation \u2014 means which the government apparently never attempted to pursue \u2014 were and are less satisfactory than a grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In essence, therefore, the government\u2019s bottom line is that Rule 6(a) and Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide the only source of authority available for the convening of an investigatory grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">\u25a0 I observe.that in defining the role of an indicting grand jury convened under Rule 6, the courts have not limited themselves to the legislative history of the Fed.R.Crim.P., but have also looked to common law powers and the fifth amendment. <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 342-44, 94 S.Ct. 613, 616-18, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). Judge Adams has explored these sources of authority in section III of the majority opinion. I make no comment with respect to that discussion because of the context in which the issue of grand jury authority has been presented to us. The government, as Judge Adams and I both note, has restricted its entire argument to Rules 6 and 7. This being so, in our disposition of the government\u2019s petition, we need go no further than an analysis limited to just those Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">As Judge Adams and I have noted, the full weight of the government\u2019s argument rests on Rules 6 and 7 as the source of authority for convening an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury in the Virgin Islands. Even were we to limit our analysis solely to the rules relied upon by the government, it follows inexorably that an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury is not authorized under Rules 6, 7. Rule 6 does not refer to an \u201cinvestigatory\u201d grand jury. It does not provide for a grand jury to write reports or for a grand jury to return presentments.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Rule 6(a) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">(a) Summoning Grand Juries. The court shall order one or more grand juries to be summoned at such times <em>as the public interest requires. </em>The grand jury shall consist of not less than 16 nor more than 23 members. The court shall direct that a sufficient number of legally qualified persons be summoned to meet this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">Certainly, the language of this rule does not recognize the existence of any sort of <em>investigatory </em>grand jury. The phrase, \u201cas the public interest requires,\u201d which I have underlined in the text above can only have reference to, and thus modify, the <em>times </em>when a grand jury may be summoned \u2014 not the <em>type </em>of grand jury that can be summoned. Notes of Advisory Committee, 18 U.S.C.A. Fed.R.Crim.P. 6 at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">The government has pointed to no legislative history or case law that indicates that an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury can be convened under Rule 6(a). None of the authorities referred to by the United States supports the proposition that Rule 6(a) authorizes an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury which has no power of indictment. None lend any basis to its theory that \u201cCongress has granted grand juries in the Virgin Islands a limited role: to investigate crimes but to leave prosecution in the hands of the prosecutors.\u201d (United States Answering Brief at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">Nor can the government place any reliance on Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which it cites in support of its theory that an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury may be convened pursuant to Rule 6. Rule 7(a) is concerned only with indictments and informations. Thus, as might be expected, the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>cases cited by the United States only make reference to an <em>indicting </em>grand jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Indeed, additional examination into Rules 6 and 7 completely refutes the government\u2019s arguments that the Rules provide any authority for convening an investigatory grand jury. Rule 6 appears under a heading which reads \u201cHI. Indictment and Information.\u201d This heading alone indicates that only a grand jury with indicting powers could be summoned under Rule 6. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7 delineates the use of an indictment for a grand jury convened under Rule 6. Rule 7 makes no provision for a grand jury that only has <em>investigatory </em>powers, nor does it provide for a grand jury to write reports or issue presentments.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The Advisory Committee Note to Fed.R. Crim.P. 7 states that this Rule gives effect to the fifth amendment grand jury clause. 18 U.S.C.A. Fed.R.Crim.P. at 388, In addition, courts have looked to the fifth amendment as well as to English common law in delimiting the role of an indicting. grand jury convened under Rule 6. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 342-43, 94 S.Ct. 613, 616-18, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1979). If, as these authorities suggest, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure implement powers of the grand jury implied from the fifth amendment, then it cannot be that these same Rules constitute the sole source of a court\u2019s authority to convene a grand jury. The Rules only provide the procedures that govern grand juries, which have been convened by virtue of a pre-existing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">It cannot be disputed that the fifth amendment does not mandate the use of a purely <em>investigatory </em>grand jury. Nor can it be said that an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury arises from a necessary implication of the fifth amendment. The <em>investigatory </em>grand jury which the government urges may be convened under Rule 6, actually appears to be at odds with the requirements of the fifth amendment and the provisions implementing it. A federal grand jury acts as both a sword and a shield. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>342 F.2d 167, 186 (5th Cir.) (en banc) (Wisdom, J., concurring specially), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 935, 85 S.Ct. 1767, 14 L.Ed.2d 700 (1965). It serves as a means to bring to trial those suspected of crimes and serves as a protection against malicious and harassing prosecution. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 618, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). This latter protective function reflects the essential purpose of the fifth amendment in safeguarding the rights of an individual. The fifth amendment was designed for the benefit of the accused: to afford a safeguard against oppressive action of a prosecutor or a court. <em>United States v. Cox, </em>342 F.2d 167, 170 (5th Cir.) (en banc) (opinion of Jones, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 935, 85 S.Ct. 1767, 14 L.Ed.2d 700 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">An <em>investigatory </em>grand jury which has no power of indictment serves little, if any, protective purpose. It cannot refuse to indict an individual. To the extent that the role of an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury is defined by the government, it apparently is designed only to ferret out crime. Thus, to authorize the summoning of an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which were designed to implement the fifth amendment, would be to ignore the essential protective function of that constitutional provision. <em>See United States v. Briggs, </em>514 F.2d 794, 803 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">Moreover, as we have observed, since these Rules implement the fifth amendment, it follows that in those instances where these fifth amendment protections are inapplicable, the federal rules providing for grand juries are also inapplicable. This Court has consistently held that the fifth amendment\u2019s grand jury protection does not extend to prosecutions initiated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Virgin Islands. <em>See, e. g., Government of Virgin Islands v. Dowling, </em>633 F.2d 660, 667 (3d Cir.) (Maris J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 960, 101 S.Ct. 374, 66 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980); <em>Rivera v. Government of the Virgin Islands, </em>375 F.2d 988 (3d Cir. 1967). It is thus not surprising that the Revision Notes to 5 V.I. \u00a7 3581 (1967) state that Rule 6 and Rule 7(a), (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not apply in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Thus, there can be no basis for asserting that Rules 6 and 7 may serve as authority for the convening of an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Indeed, I search in vain for the institution called the investigatory grand jury, an institution which the government now urges us to create out of whole cloth. Of course, grand juries have investigatory powers. These powers though are a necessary adjunct to their power to indict. The function of a grand jury is only to decide whether to indict or not to indict. 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 110 at 197 (1969). Yet, without any authority, the government would have us sever the subsidiary investigatory function of the grand jury from its other functions and create a new creature.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">I agree with the majority opinion that only the Congress or the Virgin Islands Legislature may establish an investigatory grand jury in the Virgin Islands. I emphasize that it is for the legislative, not the judicial, branch to decide whether to create such an institution. If we were to adopt the reasoning of the government we would overturn the common understanding in the Virgin Islands concerning the nature of its own criminal investigation system. No grand jury has ever been convened in the Virgin Islands. We were told at oral argument that not only is the apparatus lacking to convene a grand jury, but that inordinate practical problems would be encountered if a grand jury were to be ordered. I do not think we should ignore the Virgin Islands practice and understanding without clear authority from Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Even had this panel reached a contrary conclusion as to the scope of Rules 6 and 7, and had consequently held that these Rules did indeed constitute authority for the summoning of an investigatory grand jury in the Virgin Islands, I nevertheless would have refused to issue the writ of mandamus sought by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">It must be remembered that the writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy that will \u201cissue only in extraordinary circumstances ... \u201d, <em>Kerr v. United States District Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402-03, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2123-2124, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). The party seeking mandamus has \u201cthe burden of showing that its right to issuance of the writ is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 96, 88 S.Ct. 269, 274, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967) <em>quoting Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953). <em>See also Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980); <em>Kerr, supra, </em>426 U.S., at 403, 96 S.Ct. at 2124; <em>United States v. Duell, </em>172 U.S. 576, 582,19 S.Ct. 286, 287, 43 L.Ed. 559 (1899); <em>United States v. Cuthbertson, </em>651 F.2d 189 at 193 (3d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">The burden is on the petitioner, here the United States, to show that it has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to the writ. In addition, our issuance of the writ is largely discretionary. <em>Kerr, supra, </em>426 U.S., at 403, 96 S.Ct. at 2124. Thus, in my opinion, the party seeking a writ of mandamus must first provide an explicit and detailed explanation of the relief which it seeks. Mandamus relief should be unavailable if the party seeking it furnishes only a vague description of the duty which the district court should be compelled to exercise. Yet here the United States has not only failed to provide us with a clear explanation of the relief which it desires, but it has also failed to outline the precise powers and functions of the investigatory grand jury which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>seeks, and the necessary procedural safeguards under which it should operate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Although the United States does refer to judicial and statutory authority describing various possible functions of an investigatory grand jury, the government does not employ these authorities to delineate the functions of, or provide for, the powers of the investigatory grand jury that it has requested. Whatever the government may envisage the powers and functions of an investigatory grand jury to be, all I can gather from the government\u2019s brief and petition is that there is one function and power such a grand jury would not have\u2014 the power to indict. As a consequence, we have been provided with no description of the nature, functions or powers of the investigatory grand jury which the government desires the district court to summon.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">I do not see how we could order the district court to convene such a grand jury of such an unknown nature and such unknown powers. Of course, this court can define what <em>we </em>believe to be the appropriate powers of a federal <em>investigatory </em>grand jury, but I do not believe that to be our role. Hence, even if I were to accept the United States\u2019s assertion that an <em>investigatory </em>grand jury could be empanelled under Rule 6(a), I would still refuse to grant the government\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus because no functions, powers, or safeguards concerning such a grand jury have been identified, let alone authorized. In failing to do so, the government, in my opinion, has fallen far short of demonstrating a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331.

The grand jury shall serve for a term of eighteen months unless an order for its discharge is entered earlier by the court upon a determination of the grand jury by majority vote that its business has been completed. If, at the end of such term, or any extension thereof, the district court determines the business of the grand jury has not been completed, the court may enter an order extending such term for an additional period of six months. No special grand jury term so extended shall exceed thirty-six months, except as provided in subsection (e) of Section 3333 of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">These grand juries have the duty \u201cto inquire into offenses against the criminal laws of the United States,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3332 (1976), and are authorized to submit a report:</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">(1) concerning noncriminal misconduct, malfeasance, or misfeasance in office in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>volving organized criminal activity by an appointed public officer or employee as th\u00e9 basis for a recommendation of removal or disciplinary action; or</p>\n<p id=\"AmfS\">(2) regarding organized crime conditions in that district. &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3333(a) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Before such a report is permitted to be published, a number of procedural safeguards must be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">To the extent they are not inconsistent with \u00a7\u00a7 3331-33, the provisions of the United States Code and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to \u201cregular grand juries\u201d are also applicable to special grand juries. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3334 (1976).</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AR-t\">. <em>United States v.

It is my belief that the government abandoned its \u00a7 3331 argument not only because the \u201cdistrict court\u201d to which the statute refers necessarily excludes the District Court of the Virgin Islands, but also because an examination of \u00a7\u00a7 3331-34 reveals that the mere existence of these statutes lends support not to the government\u2019s thesis but to the respondent\u2019s. For ease in reference I attach the relevant portions of these statutes as Appendix A to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">It should be observed that the special grand juries permitted under \u00a7\u00a7 3331-34 can only be convened for the purpose of investigating criminal violations, and that such grand juries have the power to indict. The Senate report accompanying the Act states:</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Section 3332(b) defines the scope of the power of the special grand jury to investigate \u201coffenses against the criminal laws of the United States. ...\u201d It reflects present law. See <em>Hale v. Henkel, </em>201 U.S. 43, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906); <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 39 S.Ct. 468, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919). Collateral inquiry which results in a report is contemplated tinder section 3332. However, this section makes it clear that investigations are to be conducted only into criminal offenses against the United States, and not for the sole purpose of report writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Consequently, even under \u00a7\u00a7 3331-34, a grand jury cannot be convened solely for the purpose of investigating. As the Senate Report indicates, the main function of a special grand jury is the same as a Rule 6 grand jury: to investigate crime and to determine whether indictments should be returned. Its reporting power, limited to noncriminal misconduct and organized crime conditions, is \u201ccollateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">The special grand jury in the Virgin Islands sought by the government could only be authorized for \u201cthe sole purpose of report writing,\u201d since section 25 of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615, provides for prosecution by information rather than by indictment, unless otherwise required by local law. Thus, the summoning of this <em>purely </em>investigatory grand jury would clearly contravene the intent of Congress in enacting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3331-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">Therefore, I am convinced, as the government must have been, that \u00a7\u00a7 3331-34 provide no authority for summoning an investigatory grand jury in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. Section 1615 provides that in the District Court of the Virgin Islands:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">All offenses shall continue to be prosecuted in the District Court by information as heretofore except such as may be required by local law to be prosecuted by indictment by grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b961-12\"> Investigatory grand juries are also permitted in 18 states in which the prosecutor may proceed by information. See <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 688 n. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2660 n. 25, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b962-9\">. Rule 7(a) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">\u25a0(a) Use of Indictment of Information. An offense which may be punished by death shall be prosecuted by indictment. An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a- term exceeding one year or at hard labor shall be prosecuted by indictment or, if indictment is waived, it may be prosecuted by information. Any other offense may be prosecuted by indictment or by information. Any information may be filed without leave of court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. 1 observe that when Congress authorized \u201cspecial grand juries\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331, it took pains to include in the statutory scheme, the powers, and functions of such grand juries. Significantly, Congress also included a number of procedural safeguards. For example, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3333 prohibits the district court from making a report public unless the report is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, persons named in the report have been given an opportunity to testify and call witnesses, and public officials named are given an opportunity to file an answer which becomes an appendix to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Similarly, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted legislation providing for \u201cinvestigating grand juries,\u201d it set out in great detail the powers, composition, and functions of such institutions and provided as well for safeguards in connection with their operation. <em>See </em>Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4541-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">It cannot be disputed that neither Rule 6 nor Rule 7, nor for that matter any other statute or Rule, provide the federal system with the structure for an investigatory grand jury. Nor do they provide for the powers or functions that such a grand jury would possess.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
