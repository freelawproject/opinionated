He was medically retired by the Air Force on September 3, 1976, for failing to pass a \u201cfitness for duty examination.\u201d In response to Swisher\u2019s allegations that his forced medical retirement was a pretext for retaliation by the Air Force for Swisher\u2019s \u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d activities, an investigation was conducted by Col. Morris on behalf of Lt. General John Flynn, the Air Force Inspector General. Following review of the Morris report and all relevant records, Lt. General Flynn informed Swisher by letter that there was no basis for his complaints and that his complaint file would be closed and not reopened on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Swisher then requested a copy of the Morris report. Treating his request as one pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, the Air Force released that portion of the report containing factual data, but withheld the report\u2019s \u201cconclusions and recommendations\u201d as exempt from disclosure by section 552(b)(5) (\u201cExemption 5\u201d). After an unsuccessful administrative appeal to obtain the withheld portions of the report, Swisher filed suit in the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court held that the \u201cconclusions and recommendations\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were properly withheld pursuant to Exemption 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Swisher appeals asserting that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the district court erred in declining to consider his claim of retaliation as overriding the Air Force\u2019s claim of executive privilege, and (2) that the district court erred in holding that the Morris report did not lose its exempt status as it was not expressly adopted or incorporated in . Lt. General Flynn\u2019s \u201cfinal opinion.\u201d We affirm. 495 F.Supp. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In making his argument that his claim of retaliation is a showing of exceptional need which overrides the Air Force\u2019s claim of executive privilege, Swisher relies on the dictum in <em>American Mail Line, Ltd. v. Gulick, </em>411 F.2d 696, 703 (D.C.Cir.1969), that the particular needs of an individual are to be balanced against the government\u2019s privilege. Subsequently, in <em>Sterling Drug Inc. v. FTC, </em>450 F.2d 698, 704-05 (D.C.Cir. 1971), that court aligned itself with the established rule that an individual\u2019s particular exceptional need is not relevant to the application of Exemption 5, as the correct standard is whether the documents would \u201croutinely be disclosed\u201d in private litigation. <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 143 n.10, 149 n.16, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1513 n.10, 1516 n.16, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975); <em>Hoover v. United States Department of the Interior, </em>611 F.2d 1132, 1139 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Brockway v. Department of the Air Force, </em>518 F.2d 1184, 1192 n.7 (8th Cir. 1975). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Developments Under the Freedom of Information Act </em>\u2014 1979, 1980 Duke L.J. 139, 160 n.145; Note, <em>Freedom of Information Act and the Exemption for Inter-Agency Memoranda, </em>86 Harv.L.Rev. 1047, 1051 n.22 (1973). As a result, if a showing of exceptional need is necessary for disclosure in civil litigation, then it is not routinely discoverable and the material remains protected by Exemption 5. Thus, the district court was correct in refusing to balance Swisher\u2019s complaint of retaliation against the Air Force\u2019s claim of executive privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Swisher next argues that the Morris report lost its exempt status by being expressly adopted or incorporated by reference in Lt. General Flynn\u2019s letter. In <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 161, 95 S.Ct. at 1521, the Supreme Court held that this adoption or incorporation must be <em>express. </em>An examination of Lt. General Flynn\u2019s letter reveals that it does not expressly adopt or incorporate the \u201cconclusions and recommendations\u201d of the Morris report. The letter does not refer in any manner to the rationale or conclusions of the report, but relies on the factual data of the report to ensure that no new issues had been raised in addition to those already considered by the Air Force. This factual portion of the Morris report has been released to Swisher. In addition, there are no references in the letter that the \u201cconclusions and recommendations\u201d are being made available to explain the letter. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 151-53, 95 S.Ct. at 1516-17 (post-decisional explanations are not exempt). Nor does the letter invite an examination of the \u201cconclusions and recommendations\u201d in order to discover its reasoning. <em>Niemeier v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, </em>565 F.2d 967, 972-73 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">.
