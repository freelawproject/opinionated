The state trial court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>relief, and the North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Jensen v. Satran, </em>303 N.W.2d 568 (N.D.1981). Three weeks after the state supreme court decision, two other inmates of the same institution brought the instant action in federal court. They also complained of law library deficiencies and restrictive rules. They requested leave to proceed in forma pauperis. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted this request, but then dismissed the suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). The district court concluded that based upon the documents submitted and the complaint itself, the reasoning of the <em>Jensen </em>case applied, and the complaint was frivolous. The prisoners, Wattson and Trieb, bring this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the dismissal of a complaint filed in an in forma pauperis proceeding, we employ an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Van Meter v. Morgan, </em>518 F.2d 366, 368 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 896, 96 S.Ct. 198, 46 L.Ed.2d 129 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We conclude that there has been no abuse of discretion in the instant case. Most of the matters mentioned in the complaint were fully and fairly considered in the state court proceedings, and the record in the instant case shows no factual errors on the part of the state court. We agree with that court that the library meets constitutional standards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We note that some of appellants\u2019 claims were not explicitly mentioned in the state court decision. We have carefully considered these claims and find them to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-18\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">.
