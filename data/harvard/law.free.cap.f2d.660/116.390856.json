Hall appeals from the denial by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of her application for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. Hall brought this action to challenge the Secretary\u2019s determination that she was not disabled within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court affirmed the denial. We reverse the district court, vacate the decision of the Secretary and remand to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-18\">Hall is a fifty-one year old female, has a twelfth grade education and has worked as a telephone interviewer, sales clerk and receptionist. She alleges that she is unable to work due to asthma, allergies, arthritis, painful teeth and an unpredictable menstrual cycle, although she submitted no evidence of the latter. Because Hall noted on her request for a hearing that she did not wish to appear, the Secretary decided this case without a hearing, basing his decision on the paper record submitted by the parties. The relevant documents in the record include the following: the medical opinions of Hall\u2019s treating physician Dr. Lee and the Secretary\u2019s consulting physician Dr. Collyns; the clinical findings of Dr. Collyns; Hall\u2019s statements in various Social Security forms; medicine, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, doctor and hospital bills; a statement by Hall\u2019s mother. From the medical evidence the Secretary determined, pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504(b) (1980), that Hall retained the residual functional capacities to continue in her prior employment and found that, pursuant to <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1504(a), Hall\u2019s medical condition was not severe as it did not significantly limit her ability to perform work-related functions. The Secretary thus denied her application for benefits, finding her not disabled under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-19\">The review of this court is limited to whether the Secretary\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>as a whole. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Watts v. Harris, </em>614 F.2d 515 (5th Cir. 1980). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Harris, </em>602 F.2d 1233,1235 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389,401, 91 S.Ct. 1420,1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). Furthermore, the reviewing court \u201cmay not decide the facts anew or substitute its judgment as to the credibility of the evidence for that of the Secretary.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Harris, </em>602 F.2d at 1235. Moreover, the burden of establishing a disability rests with the claimant. <em>Simmons v. Harris, id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">El, 2] On appeal, Hall challenges the legal standard applied to the evidence by the Secretary and the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. A review of the record reveals, however, that the Secretary applied the proper legal standard in reaching his decision. Hall alleges that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) did not properly consider her allegations of pain. The ALJ is required to consider the subjective symptoms of the claimant, as well as other objective evidence such as medical opinions, clinical findings and the like. <em>De-Paepe v. Richardson, </em>464 F.2d 92 (5th Cir. 1972). A review of the ALJ\u2019s opinion, however, indicates that the ALJ did consider Hall\u2019s subjective symptomology. Furthermore, the medical evidence amply supports the Secretary\u2019s findings. In fact, Hall failed to submit clinical findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After viewing the evidence before the AU, we hold that a reasonable mind could conclude Hall was not disabled within contemplation of the Act. The Secretary based his decision on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Hall also challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the new evidence \u2014 Dr. Mintz\u2019 report \u2014 presented to the district court failed to provide a \u201cgood cause\u201d for remand. The Act permits a court to remand a case for additional fact finding upon the showing of \u201cgood cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Hall argues that the failure to include the report of Dr. Mintz in the administrative proceeding stems from the fact that the Secretary failed to inform her of her right to counsel and to explain the hearing procedure as required by Social Security Ruling 79-19 (C.E.1979) (\u201cRuling 79-19\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In essence, Hall argues cause for remand exists due to the Secretary\u2019s failure to meet his responsibilities set out in his own rulings. We agree. The Secretary failed to fulfill his responsibilities. We hold that such neglect requires that we vacate the judgment of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>As a general rule, where the rights of individuals are affected, an agency must follow its own procedure, even where the internal procedures are more rigorous than otherwise would be required. <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); <em>Sheehan v. Army and Air Force Exchange, </em>619 F.2d 1132 (5th Cir. 1980). The power of the governmental department or agency to promulgate the procedure flows from a grant of such power by Congress. <em>See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). Should an agency in its proceedings violate its rules and prejudice result, the proceedings are tainted and any actions resulting from the proceeding cannot stand. <em>Pacific Molasses Company v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>356 F.2d 386 (5th Cir. 1966); <em>Alamo Express, Inc. v. United States, </em>613 F.2d 96 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Clearly, the Secretary published Ruling 79-19 pursuant to a congressional grant of authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ruling 79-19 requires that a claimant be given a thorough explanation of the hearing procedure, the claimant\u2019s right to personally appear and present evidence, the claimant\u2019s right to representation, the value of a personal appearance and the fact that absent a personal appearance the claim will be decided solely on the written evidence on file. In the present case, the record does not contain the written and signed waiver required by the ruling. As we are bound by the record, we must assume the Secretary did not comply with the ruling. Thus, we inquire whether Hall was prejudiced as a result of the noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In Ruling 79-19, the Secretary explains the rationale behind the promulgation of the ruling. The Secretary recognizes the importance of the hearing appearanee rights of claimants and voices a concern that a waiver of the right to appear be voluntary, based on a full understanding of the consequences of such a decision. Social Security Ruling 79-19 (C. E. 1980 at 60). We could not state grounds for prejudice in this case more eloquently. This court fails to understand how Mrs. Hall could comprehend without an adequate explanation the effect of the waiver of her right to personally appear. Certainly the mere placing, as in this case, of an \u201cX\u201d in a box labeled \u201cI do <em>not </em>wish to appear at a hearing\u201d and \u201cI request that a decision be made on the basis of the evidence in my case\u201d does not evidence an intelligent and knowledgeable waiver. Oral testimony and the personal presence of Hall would be immensely valuable in evaluating the issues in this case. Furthermore, the late submission of Dr. Mintz\u2019 report to the district court reflects Hall\u2019s lack of understanding of her need to marshal all her supporting evidence and submit it to the Secretary. Thus, we find the Secretary\u2019s failure to comply with Ruling 79-19 prejudiced Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Accordingly, we vacate the Secretary\u2019s decision denying Hall disability benefits. Upon remand the Secretary should allow Hall a new request for a hearing and then fully comply with Ruling 79-19 should Hall decide to waive a personal appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the decision of the Secretary VACATED. We REMAND this case to the Secretary for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-14\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d), reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"ATF\">(d)(1) The term \u201cdisability\u201d means\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">(A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">. Hall attempts to sidestep this hurdle by asserting that the bills for x-rays form the basis for Dr. Lee\u2019s report that Hall suffers from degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine with disc disease; Dr. Lee\u2019s report, on the other hand, makes no such assertion. Both the bills for x-rays and Dr. Lee\u2019s report mentioned above were submitted to the Appeals Council. The Appeals' Council held that they did not provide a basis to reopen or revise the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">. Social Security Ruling 79-19 (C.
