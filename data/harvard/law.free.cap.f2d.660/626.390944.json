On a complaint to such effect by the Board\u2019s regional director, the Administrative Law Judge (the ALJ) had held, after hearing, that the discharge was based on Surley\u2019s protected concerted activities in protesting and objecting to certain employment practices by Red Ball that were unfavorable to its clerical employees. On analysis of the record evidence, the ALJ concluded that Red Ball \u201cseized upon\u201d the failure of Surley (an employee of 9\u00bd years tenure) \u201cto commence work promptly at 8 A.M. as a pretext to make its true motivation, i. e., to rid itself of an employee who had demonstrated a growing propensity to engage in protected concerted activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">The Board affirmed the rulings, findings, and conclusions of the ALJ. Red Ball Motor Freight, Inc. and Linda Surley, 253 NLRB No. Ill (1980). It agreed that the activities in which Surley had been engaged were protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, as \u201cconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection\u201d with respect to the terms and conditions of employees. It upheld the unfair labor practice under Section 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), as found by the ALJ, in that Red Ball had interfered with or coerced the employee in her exercise of her protected concerted activities conduct. In doing so, however, the Board analyzed the issue in the light of its own recent decision in <em>Wright Line, A Division of Wright Line, Inc., </em>251 NLRB No. 150 (1980). By that test, when the General Counsel had made a prima facie showing that Surley\u2019s participation in concerted activities protected under Section 7 of the Act was the motivating factor in Red Ball\u2019s decision to discharge her, the burden shifted to the company to establish that the discharge would have taken place in the absence of the protected conduct; Red Ball having failed to rebut the prima facie showing, the Board concluded that Red Ball had failed to show that, absent Surley\u2019s protected activities, her discharge would nevertheless have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">Red Ball challenges the Board\u2019s <em>Wright Line </em>shift of the burden of proof, in mixed-cause discharg\u00e9s (i. e., at least partially based on protected conduct and also allegedly based on good cause), as improperly requiring an employer to prove its innocence and as in derogation of the right of management to discharge employees for cause, see, e. g., Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act. Another panel of this court, however, recently indicated no disapproval of the Board\u2019s use of the <em>Wright Line </em>test in determining whether, after a prima facie case of discharge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>protected activities has been established, the \u201cgood\u201d cause assigned was indeed the real reason rather than pretext for the discharge. <em>N. L. R. B. v. Charles H. McCauley Associates, </em>657 F.2d 685 (5th Cir. 1981). Moreover, substantial evidence in the present record as a whole, as the Board\u2019s decision states, \u201camply supports the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings that Surley\u2019s growing propensity to engage in protected concerted activities caught the attention of Respondent\u2019s management, which was then motivated to engage in special surveillance of her work performance and to seize upon her first alleged transgression as a pretext to terminate her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review of the order of the Board will be DENIED. The Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of its order will be GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">ORDER ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
