Aby was convicted in 1978 in a Nebraska state court of first-degree sexual assault. The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. <em>State v. Aby, </em>205 Neb. 267, 287 N.W.2d 68 (1980). Thereafter, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, alleging that the testimony of the prosecuting witness was uncorroborated and that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the petitioner\u2019s conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied relief, and petitioner appealed. We affirm substantially for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s memorandum opinion. See 8th Cir. R. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">We are guided, as was the District Court, by the presumption of correctness of the factual findings made by the Nebraska state courts. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). The District Court carefully reviewed those findings, and we cannot say that that court erred in concluding that the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, would support a finding by a rational trier of fact that the petitioner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">We also hold that a rational trier of fact could find that the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony was corroborated to the extent required by Nebraska law. It is unnecessary to discuss, and we express no view on the question, whether a state-law requirement of corroboration has any due-process significance in a federal habeas proceeding applying the rule of <em>Jackson v. Virginia, supra. </em>In addition, we note that the District Court dismissed a third claim by petitioner \u2014 ineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 without prejudice, for failure to exhaust state remedies. Petitioner does not challenge this holding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-20\">. The Hon. Warren K. Urbom, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
