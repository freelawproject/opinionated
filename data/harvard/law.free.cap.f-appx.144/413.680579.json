Juarez-Campos was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 46 months to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-29\">Juarez-Campos argues for the first time on appeal that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system based upon facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury. He contends that mitigating circumstances brought to the district court\u2019s attention at sentencing would have led to a lesser sentence if the district court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sentenced him under an advisory guideline scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Juarez-Campos\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence based upon facts not determined by a jury and which he did not admit is unavailing because he failed to show that \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2014sentencing under an advisory scheme rather then a mandatory one\u2014would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-522 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>see also United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 (5th Cir.2005). His argument that the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory was error also fails because he did not show that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Juarez-Campos concedes that the issue whether his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was rendered unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court precedent is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We therefore must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
