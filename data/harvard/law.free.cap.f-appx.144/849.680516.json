Stat. \u00a7 772.11 (Count III), fraud (Count IV), money had and received (Count V), and fraudulent conveyance or transfer (Count VIII). In addition, the complaint sought a constructive trust and an accounting (Count VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In a non-jury trial, the district court found for Plaintiffs-Appellees as to Counts I through V and Count VII, entering judgment according to the parties\u2019 stipulation that Plaintiffs-Appellees\u2019 damages were $526,500.00. Furthermore, finding that Plaintiffs-Appellees were entitled to this amount of damages on any of their claims, the court awarded treble damages pursuant to Florida\u2019s civil theft remedy, bringing the total damages to $1,579,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. Miles v. Naval Aviation Museum Found., Inc., </em>289 F.3d 715, 720 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Howtzer and Cartaya contest the court\u2019s finding that the parties entered into an escrow agreement, which was the basis for the court\u2019s entry of judgment against them. After a careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we find that the district court\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final judgment accurately resolved the issues in this case. The district court did not clearly err in finding that an escrow agreement existed because ample evidence in the record supported this finding. <em>See The Florida Bar v. Joy, </em>679 So.2d 1165, 1167 (Fla.1996) (citation omitted) (\u201cIn the absence of an express agreement, written or oral, the law will imply from the circumstances of the escrow that the agent has undertaken a legal obligation....\u201d). Furthermore, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s September 17, 2004 order, and having determined that the court\u2019s finding of an escrow agreement was not clearly erroneous, we find that Plaintiffs-Appellees have established the requisite elements for the breach of contract, conversion, civil theft, fraud, and money had and received claims. As for Plaintiffs-Appellees cross-claim for attorney\u2019s fees, we hold that the district court did not err in determining that PlaintiffsAppellees did not make the required showing of clear and convincing evidence that would entitle them to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. ch. 772.104. Accordingly, the court\u2019s entry of judgment against Defendants-Appellants is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-29\">. EMB Group, Inc., is the Third-Party Defendant in this case. Claims between Defendants-Appellants, as Third-Party Plaintiffs, and EMB Group, Inc., were resolved through a settlement agreement prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
