Gonzalez-Mata, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 258 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See de la Cruz-Gonzalez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1995, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-30\">Gonzalez-Mata argues that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines prohibited by <em>Booker. </em>Gonzalez-Mata identifies no evidence in the record suggesting that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). In fact, he concedes that he cannot make the necessary showing of plain error that is required by our precedent. He also cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>rectly acknowledges that this court has rejected the argument that a <em>Booker </em>error is a structural error or that such error is presumed to be prejudicial. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22; <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate our judgment affirming Gonzalez-Mata\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
