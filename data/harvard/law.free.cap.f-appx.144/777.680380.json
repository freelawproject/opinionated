He appeals his sentences, contending that the district court acted in violation of the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because appellant raised this Sixth Amendment issue before the district court, we will set aside his sentences and remand the case for resentencing unless the error, if any, was harmless. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-21\">In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that the imposition of a sentencing enhancement under the State of Washington\u2019s mandatory sentencing guidelines system based upon facts neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury infringed the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court extended this holding to sentences imposed under the federal sentencing scheme. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 760. Under <em>Booker, </em>two errors can occur: (1) constitutional error, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>caused by the court\u2019s imposition of the sentence called for by the application of mandatory guidelines based on facts neither admitted by the defendant nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) statutory error, which is caused by the court\u2019s imposition of the sentence called for by the application of mandatory guidelines. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\u201cConstitutional errors are harmless where the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (mandate withheld). Statutory errors are subject to a less demanding harmless error standard. <em>Id. </em>A \u201cnon-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>1291 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The district court did not commit a constitutional error because appellant admitted to the probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report, and the plea hearing established, the facts the court used to enhance appellant\u2019s sentences. The court, however, as the government concedes, committed a statutory error. The question we must decide, then, is whether the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In <em>Paz, </em>we said that the harmless error analysis puts the burden on the government to show that the mandatory (as opposed to the advisory) application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. 405 F.3d at 948. We cannot tell from a reading of the record in this case what the district court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory and, moreover, had properly considered the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The Government therefore cannot show that the mandatory application of the Guidelines was harmless. We consequently vacate appellant\u2019s sentences and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\">. Appellant also challenges the district court's enhancement of his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)(2)(B). Because we vacate appellant\u2019s sentences and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing\u2014in which the court may consider evidence and arguments deemed irrelevant under the <em>pre-Booker </em>sentencing scheme\u2014we do not address this challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
