In No. 04-1543, Ndenge seeks review of an order of the Board affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order finding Ndenge removable and denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. In No. 05-2032, Ndenge petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>for review of a Board order denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Ndenge failed to raise any argument in his brief concerning the Board\u2019s order in No. 04-1543. Therefore, he has abandoned appellate review of this order. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999). In No. 05-2032, we have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Ndenge\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">We accordingly deny the petitions for review in these cases. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
