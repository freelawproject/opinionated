California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).

R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-26\">We decline to address the ineffective assistance claims raised by Prado-Martinez in this proceeding. <em>See United States v.

Our decision is without prejudice to Prado-Martinez\u2019s right to assert such claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro v.
