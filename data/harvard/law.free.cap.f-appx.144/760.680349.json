Plaintiff-Appellant, Willie Grayer, filed an action challenging Liberty\u2019s denial of his disability benefits under provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The parties agree with the district court\u2019s published findings of fact. <em>See Grayer v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>331 F.Supp.2d 1383, 1384-89 (M.D.Fla.2004). We will not, therefore, recite them here. Suffice it to say that the administrator of Grayer\u2019s insurance plan denied him benefits because Grayer could not show that he remained disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">In these types of cases, we apply the same standard of review as the district court. <em>Paramore v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1446, 1449 (11th Cir.1997). We first examine whether the claims administrator is empowered to interpret disputed terms of the insurance plan. <em>HCA Health Servs. of Ga., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 982, 993 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the parties agree that Liberty\u2019s administrator is so empowered. Accordingly, we must determine, <em>de novo, </em>whether the administrator\u2019s decision to deny benefits was \u201cwrong\u201d under the plan\u2019s terms. <em>Brown v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala., Inc., </em>898 F.2d 1556, 1567 n. 12 (11th Cir.1990). Only if we consider the administrator\u2019s decision wrong, do we examine whether the administrator is self-interested. <em>See generally HCA Health Servs. of Ga., Inc., </em>240 F.3d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">On appeal, Grayer attributes the denial of his benefits to the administrator\u2019s conclusion that Grayer was no longer disabled. He says the district court erred by deciding he was not entitled to benefits for a different reason: that Grayer failed to provide any proof of disability for about a year, as required by the plan. This argument lacks merit. The district court concluded that Grayer was no longer disabled under the terms of the plan. The lack of medical documentation is relevant to the extent that what medical documentation existed indicated that Grayer no longer had restrictions or limitations on his workload. We agree with the district court that the administrator was not wrong in deciding that Grayer\u2019s condition at the time of denial\u2014complaints of low back pain, decreased appetite for two weeks and coughing\u2014did not amount to a disability under the plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\">. Because we disagree with Grayer's characterization of the district court\u2019s opinion, we do not decide whether district courts are limited to determining whether the reasons proffered by an ERISA plan administrator are the only reasons district courts can consider on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
