He started work with Consolidation Coal in 1955 and remained employed with that company until he retired in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">In 1979, Wilburn filed a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>An ALJ determined that Wilburn was not entitled to benefits because there was insufficient evidence of total disability due to pneumoconiosis. Wilburn appealed to the BRB and the Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-18\">In August 1996, Wilburn was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. Wilburn died on October 26, 1996. Wilburn\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Darrell Saunders, certified the immediate cause of death as acute leukemia. An autopsy was performed by Drs. Sydney Goldblatt and James Pisano. The autopsy report noted the presence of \u201cMacular, Simple Coal Worker\u2019s Pneumoconiosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-19\">Daisy Wilburn, the widow of Robert Wilburn, filed a claim for disability and surviv- or\u2019s benefits with the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. A hearing was held on November 14, 2000 before an Administrative Law Judge. On April 19, 2001, the ALJ awarded benefits to Mrs. Wilburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-20\">The essence of this petition for review is Consolidation\u2019s disagreement with the ALJ\u2019s determination of the weight afforded to an autopsy, to various x-rays, and to the testimony by way of reports and depositions of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">First, the ALJ held that Wilburn\u2019s x-ray records did not themselves contain sufficient evidence of pneumoconiosis. As part of that analysis, the ALJ afforded greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>weight to x-rays taken for the purpose of diagnosing pneumoconiosis than to x-rays taken for the purpose of diagnosing Wilburn\u2019s leukemia and other related illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Second, the ALJ examined the medical history, autopsy records and reports and depositions of the expert witnesses and found sufficient evidence of pneumoconiosis to award benefits. The ALJ based his opinion largely on the weight afforded to four experts: Drs. Cyril H. Wecht, Richard L. Naeye, Stephen T. Bush and Joseph F. Tomashefski, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Dr. Wecht reviewed Wilburn\u2019s medical history and autopsy report on behalf of Mrs. Wilburn. Dr. Wecht concluded that Wilburn died of pneumonia, a terminal complication of acute leukemia. Dr. Wecht also concluded that pneumoconiosis was \u201ca substantial contributing factor in [Wilburn\u2019s] death.\u201d He also stated: \u201c[s]pecifieally, I believe that his pulmonary pathology was coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Drs. Naeye, Bush and Tomashefski reviewed Wilburn\u2019s medical history for Consolidation Coal. Dr. Naeye concluded that there was no evidence of pneumoconiosis and that Wilburn would have died \u201cat the same time and in the same way if he had never mined coal.\u201d Dr. Bush also concluded that there was no evidence of pneumoconiosis and that \u2018Wilburn would have died at the same time and in the same manner if he had never been exposed to the pulmonary hazards of coal mining employment.\u201d Dr. Tomashefski concluded that Wilburn \u201cdid not have coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis\u201d and therefore \u201cpneumoconiosis was not a contributing factor in Mr. Wilburn\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The ALJ afforded greater weight to Dr. Wecht\u2019s report because it was well reasoned, well documented, and supported by the findings in the autopsy report. In this connection, we note that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(2) provides in part that \u201cA report of autopsy shall be accepted unless there is evidence that the report is not accurate or that the claim has been fraudulently represented,\u201d conditions not present here. The ALJ found portions of the reports from Consolidation Coal\u2019s three experts to be equivocal, internally inconsistent, and lacking sufficient explanation for their reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Consolidation Coal appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Benefits Review Board. The BRB found error in the ALJ\u2019s decision to afford less weight to x-ray readings interpreted for the purpose of treating Wilburn\u2019s leukemia, but found the error harmless. The Board concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision to afford greater weight to Dr. Wecht\u2019s testimony and lesser weight to the testimony of Drs. Naeye, Bush and Tomashefski was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to award benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">We review the Board\u2019s Decision and Order to determine whether it properly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1193 (4th Cir.1995). After consideration of the briefs, record, and oral argument, we find that the Board correctly addressed the questions now raised by Consolidation Coal in its petition for review and that the Board properly found the ALJ\u2019s decision supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Accordingly, we are of opinion that there is not reversible error in this case, and we therefore deny the petition for review for the reasons expressed in the Benefit Review Board\u2019s Decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
