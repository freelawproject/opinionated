Crawford has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997). He has also filed a motion for appointment of counsel, which is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-26\">Crawford argues that the district court erred in dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Citing <em>Rocky v. Vittorie, </em>813 F.2d 734, 736-37 (5th Cir.1987), Crawford contends that he made a good faith effort to meet the exhaustion requirement, that the district court invoked the exhaustion requirement without considering the interests of justice, and that the administrative procedures must be certified to be in compliance with statutorily defined minimum standards. He contends that the district court should have given consideration to his good faith attempt to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) exhaustion requirement is \u201cmandatory, \u2018irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 739, 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001)). This court reviews a dismissal under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) de novo. <em>Days, </em>322 F.3d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Crawford\u2019s arguments and citation to <em>Rocky v. Vittorie </em>are based on the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). Under the post-PLRA version of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e, the district court is no longer required to determine whether a prisoner has pursued his administrative remedies in good faith. <em>Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 294 (5th Cir.1998). Crawford\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to make such a determination lacks an arguable basis in law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The district court\u2019s certification that Crawford\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Crawford\u2019s motion for IFP is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Crawford is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201c[D]is-missals as frivolous in the district courts or the court of appeals count [as strikes] for the purposes of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) ].\u201d). We caution Crawford that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">IFP AND APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
