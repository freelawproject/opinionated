Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Arnold v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2527, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). We previously affirmed Arnold\u2019s conviction and twelve-month sentence for conspiring to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 269 (11th Cir.2004). After review, we conclude that because Arnold raised a Booker-type claim in his initial brief on appeal, but raised no such claim before the district court, we can review his sentence only for plain error. However, because Arnold has not demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different result under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guidelines system, we again affirm Arnold\u2019s sentence and reinstate in part our prior opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-21\">After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated $217, 586.00 as the total tax loss attributable to Arnold\u2019s role in the conspiracy. Using this loss amount, the PSI recommended a base offense level of sixteen, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(a)(l). The PSI also recommended a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, due to Arnold\u2019s continued refusal to comply with grand jury proceedings\u2014conduct that ultimately resulted in a criminal contempt conviction. With an adjusted offense level of 18 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI calculated his guidelines\u2019 imprisonment range at 27 to 33 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-22\">Arnold filed a <em>pro se </em>affidavit stating his objections to the PSI. His extensive objections largely concerned allegations that the district court lacked jurisdiction, as well as his related quasi-constitutional claims regarding the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. While Arnold did repeatedly object to the tax loss amounts calculated, he did not do so based on the judge\u2019s determination of the tax loss or jury\u2019s failure to find the tax amount. Arnold\u2019s affidavit also failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>reference the Sixth Amendment or any cases in the line of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">At the sentencing hearing, Arnold refused to address the district court regarding his objections, repeatedly stating that he would remain silent and stand on the objections contained in his previously-submitted affidavit. He explicitly declined to be heard on the issue of tax loss calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The district court ultimately overruled any objections and adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and guideline calculations. However, the district court then departed downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, because Arnold had already served 18 months for criminal contempt based on his failure to cooperate with the grand jury proceedings. The district court ultimately sentenced Arnold to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On appeal, Arnold, again proceeding <em>pro se, </em>raised a variety of claims concerning his conviction and sentence. In relevant part, Arnold again objected to the district court\u2019s tax loss calculation on several grounds, including a claim that his \u201csentence is not lawful\u201d because it was \u201cbased upon [tax loss] \u2018numerics\u2019 ... conjured <em>after </em>trial, for a charge never even alleged, much less tried.\u201d Appellant Br. at 50 (emphasis in original). Arnold argued that imposing such a sentence where the tax loss amount was neither charged nor tried, would \u201crocket-sled through the due process barrier at light speed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We affirmed Arnold\u2019s conviction and sentence, finding the tax loss amount used by the district court in sentencing was a reasonable estimate of the tax loss during the time of Arnold\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. <em>Arnold, </em>125 FedAppx. 269. Arnold then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted that petition, vacating our opinion and remanding the case for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>Arnold,-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2527, 161 L.Ed.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">While Arnold asserts that he raised the <em>Booker </em>issue both at trial and on direct appeal, the record does not support this assertion. Arnold\u2019s sentencing \u201caffidavit\u201d did not object to the district court\u2019s estimation of the tax loss under the preponderance standard, raise his jury trial rights under the Sixth Amendment, nor cite to any case in the <em>Apprendi </em>line. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that appellant\u2019s non-constitutional sentencing objection failed to preserve <em>Booker </em>error, where the objection made no reference to the Sixth Amendment, the role of judge as fact-finder, the right to jury determination of disputed facts, or the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">However, when reviewed under the liberal standards applicable to pro se arguments, <em>see Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.2000), Arnold\u2019s initial brief on appeal does appear to raise a Booker-type claim. Specifically, Arnold argued that his sentence violated constitutional due process guarantees because the tax loss amount was never tried before the jury, but instead was calculated after trial. Appellant Brief at 50. Given our obligation to liberally construe pro se filings, we hold that Arnold\u2019s appellate-brief arguments are sufficient to raise the <em>Booker </em>issue. Nonetheless, because Arnold did not raise any such issue below, we review his <em>Booker </em>claim only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Under plain error review, appellate courts have a limited power to correct errors that were not timely raised in the district court. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We may not correct such an error unless: (i) there is error; (ii) it is plain; and (iii) it affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If these three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In this case, the district court committed both constitutional and statutory <em>Booker </em>errors when it sentenced Arnold under a mandatory guidelines system based upon facts (the tax loss amount and Arnold\u2019s obstruction of justice) that were neither admitted by Arnold nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Though this error was not apparent at the time of sentencing, under <em>Booker </em>it is now plain. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">However, it does not appear that under the third prong of the plain-error test, Arnold\u2019s substantial rights have been affected. The third prong of plain error review requires Arnold to demonstrate that absent the error, there is a reasonable probability of a different result. <em>Id. </em>Where the effect of the error is indeterminate or if we would be left to speculate, that burden has not been satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. A close review of the record reveals no suggestion that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory sentencing system. As such, Arnold has failed to demonstrate that the <em>Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1301 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Accordingly, we reinstate our prior opinion with the exception of our discussion of the district court\u2019s tax calculation, for which we substitute the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">OPINION REINSTATED IN PART; AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
