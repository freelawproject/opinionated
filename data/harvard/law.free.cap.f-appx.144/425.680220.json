Warner is effectively challenging the magistrate judge\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">However, Warner argues that the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his request to proceed IFP on appeal was improper because the magistrate judge focused on the merits of his claims rather than his indigency. Warner has failed to show that the magistrate judge erred in determining that his appeal was not taken in good faith because Warner\u2019s underlying claims were frivolous. Thus, Warner has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 201-02. Accordingly, Warner\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Warner is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
