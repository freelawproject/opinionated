As he concedes, this contention is foreclos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Zavala also contends that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines contrary to the rule of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 769,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). Although there was an error, Zavala has failed to demonstrate a sufficient probability \u201cthat the district judge would have imposed a different sentence\u201d under advisory guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 733. Zavala thus fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights as he must do to meet the plain-error standard. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 502, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
