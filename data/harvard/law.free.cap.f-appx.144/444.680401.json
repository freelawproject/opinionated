California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Martinez-Montoya has filed a pro se response and argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>to object on the basis of the Sixth Amendment and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We decline to address Martinez^ Montoya\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, without prejudice, however, to his raising those claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 508, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Our independent review of the briefs, the record, and Martinez-Montoya\u2019s responses discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED. Counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
