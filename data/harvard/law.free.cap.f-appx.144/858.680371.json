On appeal, Fair asserts the district court erred in its analysis of her ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Fair argues she established both that her trial attorney\u2019s performance was defective because he failed to advise her of her right to testify in her own defense, and that she was prejudiced because her testimony would have changed the result of her trial. We review \u201ca district court\u2019s findings of fact in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding for clear error, and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>Garcia v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1341 (11th Cir.2005) (same). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>We previously affirmed Fair\u2019s 188-month sentence and convictions for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and maintaining a place for the distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). <em>United States v. Fair, </em>251 F.3d 162 (11th Cir.2001) (Table). In her \u00a7 2255 motion, Fair raised three claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, only one of which was designated in the district\u2019s certificate of appealability: whether Fair\u2019s trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise her that she had the right to testify in her own defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">After an evidentiary hearing, at which Fair, her trial counsel, and her husband\u2019s trial counsel testified, the magistrate judge entered a Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R). Applying the familiar two-part test for ineffective assistance of counsel enumerated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the magistrate judge concluded that although Fair satisfied the performance prong of <em>Strickland </em>by showing her counsel\u2019s representation was deficient, Fair\u2019s proffer of the testimony she would have provided if she had testified was \u201cirrelevant to the jury\u2019s determination\u201d of guilt. This finding was based, among other things, on (1) the speculative nature of Fair\u2019s argument that the testimony would have made a difference, and (2) the government\u2019s cross-examination of Fair at the evidentiary hearing on her \u00a7 2255 motion, after which the magistrate judge noted \u201ccertain credibility problems.\u201d Based on Fair\u2019s failure to satisfy her burden on the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice prong, the magistrate judge recommended denial of her \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R in part and denied Fair\u2019s motion. In its order, the district court, applying <em>Strickland, </em>concluded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-10\">Given the facts, viewed from the perspective of trial counsel, as they were known to him at the time of the representation, the court concludes that it is more likely than not that trial counsel followed his normal practice with petitioner, that petitioner knew that she had a right to testify, and that petitioner alone decided not to exercise that right. The court finds evidence that petitioner knew she had a right to testify. Petitioner expressed reluctance about testifying to her trial counsel and never affirmatively requested that she take the stand. In addition, petitioner was present during conversations about whether her husband should testify and knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>that he would be waiving his right at trial. The court further questions the magistrate judge\u2019s application of <em>[United States v. Teague, </em>953 F.2d 1525 (11th Cir.1992) ] to require that trial counsel explicitly articulate to a defendant that he or she has a right to testify and that the decision about whether to exercise that right belongs solely to him or her. Rather, the court believe that the focus should be on whether petitioner knew that such a right existed, that the ability to exercise that right was her choice, and that petitioner knowingly and willingly waived that right. Consequently, the court must deviate from the magistrate judge\u2019s findings here because it finds that petitioner failed to show that some action or inaction by trial counsel deprived her of \u201cthe ability to choose whether or not to testify in [her] own behalf.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>953 F.2d at 1534.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Thus, the district court found that Fair failed to meet the performance prong of <em>Strickland. </em>The court further concluded that the magistrate judge\u2019s analysis on the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland </em>was correct. Accordingly, the court denied Fair\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">After our thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no clear error in the findings of fact, or legal error in the district court\u2019s analysis, relating to the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice prong.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Fair did not satisfy her burden under <em>Strickland </em>and the district court correctly denied her \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">. The district court did not designate, and Fair does not make arguments relating to, the other two claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) but for the deficiency in representation, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To satisfy the deficient performance prong, the petitioner has the burden to prove that counsel made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the \"counsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The standard for counsel\u2019s performance under <em>Strickland </em>is \"reasonableness under the prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 100 S.Ct. 1945. The reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance is to be evaluated from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the alleged error and in light of all the circumstances, and the standard of review is highly deferential. <em>See Mills v. Singletary, </em>63 F.3d 999, 1020 (11th Cir.l995)(quotation and citation omitted). To satisfy the prejudice prong, a petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>446 U.S. at 694, 100 S.Ct. 1945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-4\">. We need not address the issue of counsel\u2019s effectiveness if prejudice is lacking. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\"[A] court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant ... If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d); <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000) (\"Because both parts of the test must be satisfied in order to show a violation of the Sixth Amendment, the court need not address the performance prong if the defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong, or vice versa.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
