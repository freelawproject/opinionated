To the extent the court denied relief under \u00a7 2241, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order affirm for the reasons cited by the district court. <em>See United States v. Lynch, </em>Nos. CA-05-464-1, CR-00-103 (E.D. Va. filed June 7, 2005; entered June 9, 2005). To the extent the court dismissed the petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, an appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Lynch has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief under \u00a7 2241, deny Lynch\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-15\"> To the extent Lynch may be seeking authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000) to file a second and successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion on the basis of the rules announced in <em>United States v.
