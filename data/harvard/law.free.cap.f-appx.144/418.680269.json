Jenkins contends that these convictions were part of a common scheme and should have been counted as separate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines, and more specifically, that court\u2019s determination whether prior sentences were part of a common scheme. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The record reflects that Jenkins\u2019s assault on a woman at a gas station during the second aggravated assault was inconsistent with Jenkins\u2019s common scheme to reunite with her girlfriend. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that the two prior convictions were unrelated and that Jenkins qualified as a career offender. <em>See Robinson, </em>187 F.3d at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Jenkins also argues that the district court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). She concedes that her argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005)(No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The district court\u2019s determination of career offender status does not implicate <em>Booker. United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Jenkins fails to demonstrate error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
