(\u201cBoral\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Continental Casualty Company (\u201cContinental\u201d), in Boral\u2019s action to obtain a declaration that its commercial general liability policy with Continental did not provide coverage for the underlying indemnity claim and, therefore, Continental had acted in bad faith by settling the claim for less than the policy deductible and then seeking to recover the total amount of the settlement from Boral. In a counterclaim, Continental sought recovery, under the policy deductible, of the $300,000 settlement payment. After the completion of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court, interpreting the \u201cright to settle\u201d provision in Boral\u2019s Continental policy, concluded that the provision, which was unqualified, permitted the settlement of the underlying claim and that Continental was entitled to full reimbursement since the deductible exceeded the settlement amount. Accordingly, it granted Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both Boral\u2019s claims and Continental\u2019s counter-claim. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. See Madray v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2000). A motion for summary judgment should be granted when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u2018Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1592, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">Interpreting the \u201cright to settle\u201d and deductible provisions in the Continental policy and applying Georgia law, the district court held that Boral, as a sophisticated corporate entity, had the opportunity to bargain for insurance without a provision that granted the insurer an \u201cunfettered right to settle claims.\u201d Thus, the court concluded, Boral, having contractually afforded the right to settle a claim like the underlying indemnity action here, was obligated to reimburse Continental for the settlement so long as Continental did not act with bad faith. On the record before it, the district court found no evidence of bad faith on Continental\u2019s part. Moreover, the district court determined that there was no genuine issue of fact that Continental had acted reasonably and in compliance with the unambiguous terms of the policy in (1) settling the underlying claim and (2) seeking reimbursement from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Boral for in an amount that was less than the deductible. Based on our review of the unambiguous policy provisions at issue in this appeal and the applicable Georgia law interpreting such unequivocal provisions in the same manner, we too conclude that Continental was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The district court also denied Boral\u2019s motion to compel discovery and motion for sanctions based on Continental\u2019s alleged failure to provide the requested discovery in a timely manner. These motions concerned Boral\u2019s request for production of correspondence between Continental and its \u201coutside counsel.\u201d Continental claimed that the requested items were protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege. After conducting an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the correspondence, the district court first noted that the requests to produce were untimely since discovery had closed four months before Continental\u2019s request. Moreover, the court found that the items, which were marked \u201cattorney-client privileged,\u201d contained information that was \u201clargely redundant of other correspondence and evidence produced in discovery and presently in the record.\u201d We can find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision on this issue. <em>See Harris v. Chapman, </em>97 F.3d 499, 506 (11th Cir.1996) (reviewing district court rulings on discovery motions and discovery sanctions under abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
