On appeal, Herrera-Barcenas\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), finding no meritorious issues for appeal. Herrera-Barcenas has filed a pro se supplemental brief, raising several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-26\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal based on the appellate waiver in the plea agreement. Although we find that the waiver was valid, it expressly exempted appellate claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>prosecutorial misconduct. Because Herrera-Barcenas seeks to raise claims of ineffective assistance, we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">An allegation of ineffective assistance should not proceed on direct appeal unless it appears conclusively from the record that counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Here, there is no evidence in the record supporting Herrera-Barcenas\u2019 claims. Nonetheless, if Herrera-Barcenas possesses other evidence on these issues, he is free to assert his claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, and we have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Herrera-Barcenas\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
