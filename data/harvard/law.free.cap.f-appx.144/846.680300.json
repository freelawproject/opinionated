On appeal, the petitioners argue that, contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, they were persecuted on account of a protected ground, as their refusal to support and pay money to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) \u201cwas akin to making a political statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case, not the BIA\u2019s, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum \u201cmust be upheld if it is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Likewise, the IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Having reviewed the record and briefs of the parties, we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision denying asylum, as the petitioners failed to establish that they were persecuted on account of a protected ground, and thus, the petition for asylum must be denied. Because the petitioners failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution sufficient to support their asylum claim, they could not establish that they were eligible for withholding of removal under the INA, which requires a greater burden of proof. Thus, the petition for withholding of removal is also denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-15\">. We reject petitioners' argument that \"[t]he BIA's one sentence affirmation of the decision of the U ... [was] a clear indication that it did not properly review and consider the proceedings below by applying the correct law to the facts and evidence of [their] case,\u201d and thus, denied them due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">. Petitioners also failed to present any evidence that the alleged harm that they suffered was \"inflicted at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official,\u201d or that, if they were to return to Colombia, it is \"more likely than not\u201d that they will be tortured with the \"consent or acquiescence of a public official,\u201d they did not establish eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
