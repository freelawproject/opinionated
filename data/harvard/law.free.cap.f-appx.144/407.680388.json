He contends that the district court denied him a fair trial by compelling him to go to trial in identifiable prison clothing. Collins has not established that district court\u2019s actions were the cause of his attire at trial. <em>See Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 504, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976)(habe-as corpus case); <em>Brooks v. Texas, </em>381 F.2d 619, 624 (5th Cir.l967)(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Collins contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for bank robbery. We have reviewed the record, and we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established Collins\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Gadison, 8 </em>F.3d 186, 190 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Collins asserts that the district court failed to provide sufficient reasons for the sentence imposed. He maintains that the court\u2019s rulings made it unclear whether it was imposing sentence on the basis of the original recommendation in the presentence report, the first addendum, or the second addendum. A review of the district court\u2019s presentencing order and the sentencing transcript reveals that the court based its sentence on a finding that Collins was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Collins cannot establish reversible error arising out of the court\u2019s reasons for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Collins contends that his prior attempted escape offense should not be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the career offender guideline because his escape constituted a \u201cwalkaway\u201d escape from a noncustodial facility. As Collins concedes, this issue is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676-77 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">Collins challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement to the base offense level based upon his role in the offense and another two-level enhancement based upon the fact that a death threat was issued during the offense. Collins\u2019s offense level was determined based upon the finding that he was a career offender; the enhancements listed above did not affect his sentence. We therefore decline to consider his arguments on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Collins asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based upon facts not submitted to or found by the jury. Because Collins\u2019s sentence was based upon a finding that he was a career offender, the applicable guideline was not based upon facts other than his prior convictions and does not constitute a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005). Collins also contends that the district court erred in imposing his sentence pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guideline regime that was held unconstitutional in <em>Booker. </em>He has not established that his sentence was the result of plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005). The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
