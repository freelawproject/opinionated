Jones appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). Jones alleged the following claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">(1) The magistrate judge applied the wrong standard of review when he held a hearing on Jones\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel did not pursue a \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity\u201d defense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">(2) Defense counsel was ineffective when he withdrew notice of a \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity\u201d defense and proceeded to a jury trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">(3) Defense counsel was ineffective in preparing for or countering trial testimony from a jail house informant that Jones confessed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">(4) The prosecution violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), when it failed to disclose Jones\u2019s confession to the expert who evaluated Jones\u2019s sanity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">By order, we granted a certificate of appealability as to Claims (1), (2), and (4). The Respondent has filed an informal preliminary brief as to those claims, and Jones has filed a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 filings and the record on appeal, we conclude Claim (1) is meritless, and we affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s actions as to that claim. As for Claims (2) and (4), we affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s disposition of those claims based upon the reasoning of the magistrate judge. We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss as to Claim (3) based upon the reasoning of the magistrate judge. <em>See Jones v. Johnson, </em>No. CA-03-466-3 (E.D.Va. Nov. 8, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal issues are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
