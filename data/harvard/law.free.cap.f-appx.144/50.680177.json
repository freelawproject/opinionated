Reyes asserts the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. Reyes does not claim the Government failed to produce evidence on any element of the offenses; rather, he contends the testimony of the co-conspirators was not credible, was unbelievable on its face, and that under no construction of the evidence could the jury have found Reyes guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in favor of the government and the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005). Reyes\u2019s conviction must be affirmed unless, under no reasonable construction of the evidence, could the jury have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u201cCredibility determinations are the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cFor testimony of a government witness to be incredible as a matter of law, it must be unbelievable on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cIt must be testimony as to facts that the witness physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). Moreover, judgment of acquittal is not required \u201cbecause the government\u2019s case includes testimony by \u2018an array of scoundrels, liars, and brigands\u2019.\u201d <em>United States v. Hewitt, </em>663 F.2d 1381, 1385 (11th Cir.1981) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Reyes\u2019s arguments with respect to the inconsistency and incredibility of the witnesses are without merit. By their verdict, the jury found the testimony of the Government\u2019s witnesses credible. <em>See Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1325. None of Reyes\u2019s claims regarding inconsistencies or bias constitute evidence the testimony was \u201cunbelievable on its face\u201d or contained facts or events that could not have possibly occurred. Based on the testimony, the jury could reasonably conclude Reyes conspired to distribute and possessed with the intent to distribute the methamphetamine charged. Thus, the district court did not err by denying Reyes\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
