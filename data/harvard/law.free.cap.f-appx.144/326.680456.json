Sligh was sentenced to an 84-month term of imprisonment for Count One and a consecutive 60-month term for Count Two. We affirm the convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">On appeal, Sligh\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. Although Sligh was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-20\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>As stated in <em>Hughes, </em>we will affirm a post-Boo&amp;er sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">Sligh\u2019s 84-month sentence on Count One was both at the lowest end of the guideline range and well below the statutory maximum of forty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The imposition of a consecutive 60-month sentence on Count Two was mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Furthermore, as the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>peal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
