Newsome argues that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the sentencing following the revocation of his supervised release, the district court expressly directed that his supervised release would be \u201con the same terms as we had before.\u201d Newsome further argues that neither the previous supervision order nor the court\u2019s oral pronouncement prohibited him from possessing a dangerous weapon. Newsome argues that the condition barring his possession of \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d must be stricken from the written judgment because it conflicts with the sentence orally pronounced by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">For the reasons outlined in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003), we conclude that the district court\u2019s omission of the dangerous weapon prohibition during the oral pronouncement of sentence did not create a conflict with the sentence set forth in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
