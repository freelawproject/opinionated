Harris does not challenge his conviction on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">Including several enhancements, the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined that Harris\u2019 Sentencing Guidelines range was seventy to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. In written objections, Harris asserted that the judicial enhancements listed in the PSR violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). However, at the time Harris was sentenced, this court had held that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Accordingly, the district court overruled Harris\u2019 objections and adopted the PSR. Nevertheless, Harris\u2019 counsel renewed his objections to preserve the issues on appeal. In imposing a sentence of seventy-two months, the district court stated that it had followed the Sentencing Reform Act and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (2000). The court also stated that the sentence it imposed is \u201cwhat I would impose upon my discretionary authority pursuant to the statutes that I have mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">Because Harris objected in the district court to the guidelines calculation under <em>Blakely, </em>he need not establish plain error. <em>Cf. United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). Under Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a), however, \u201c[a]ny error ... that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Because the district court expressly stated that after considering the guideline range and section 3553, it would have imposed the same sentence, we conclude that any error under <em>Booker </em>is harmless. Moreover, we conclude that because the district court stated it considered section 3553, and imposed a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>within the now-advisory guidelines range and below the statutory maximum for the offense, the sentence was reasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767) (noting after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts should determine the sentencing range under the guidelines, consider the other factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Harris\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
