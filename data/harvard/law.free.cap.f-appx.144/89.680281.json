We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency decision subject to review. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence an IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum. <em>Id. </em>To qualify for asylum, an alien must show past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution \u201con account of\u2019 her political opinion (or another protected ground). <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">The IJ concluded that Dumercy\u2019s testimony was vague and conflicting on key issues. In support of her claim of past persecution or fear of future persecution, Dumercy, a native and citizen of Haiti, maintained that her boyfriend (Mark Henry Fleurival) was shot and killed by the Lavalas gang in Haiti for political reasons. She submitted Fleurival\u2019s death certificate for the IJ\u2019s consideration and contended that because Fleurival was killed due to his political opinion, the Lavalas group will seek to persecute her if she is returned to Haiti. She testified that she was tortured physically and mentally by the threat of violence and Fleurival\u2019s death, and that relocation was not an option as the Haitian government is unable to control the Lavalas. But substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s rejection of Fleurival\u2019s death certificate and the police complaint presented by Dumercy in support of her application\u2014 the death certificate was determined to be fraudulent and the police complaint was suspicious due to numerous irregularities. Without other evidence to support her claim, substantial evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>IJ\u2019s conclusion that Dumercy failed to meet her burden to establish ineligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Furthermore, because she is not entitled to asylum, Dumercy cannot qualify for withholding of removal, which has a more stringent standard for eligibility. <em>See Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1324 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). Similarly, she is unable to meet the burden on her claim for CAT relief which also has a higher burden than that imposed on the asylum seeker. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Finding Dumercy\u2019s claims without merit, we deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
