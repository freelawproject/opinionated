California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Barber has filed a response claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; and challenging the factual basis supporting his guilty plea and the district court\u2019s application of the statutorily-mandated minimum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-24\">Our independent review of the brief, the record, and Barber\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. We decline on direct appeal to address Barber\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 908, 119 S.Ct. 247, 142 L.Ed.2d 203 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-25\">Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is <em>GRANTED. </em>Counsel is excused from further responsibilities in this case, and the appeal is <em>DISMISSED. See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-17\"> Pursuant <em>to 5m Cir. </em>R. 47.5, the <em>court has </em>determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
