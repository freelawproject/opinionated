McShane argues that the court erred in concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed on whether McShane established a <em>prima facie </em>case of Title VII retaliation, and, if she did, whether the defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its allegedly retaliatory conduct was pretextual. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">McShane, a former female employee of the defendant, filed a counseled amended complaint against the defendant, alleging the following facts. McShane, who was an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Florida, began her employment with the defendant on October 19, 1998, as a \u201cParalegal Specialist\u201d with the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program (\u201cHID-TA\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Miami, Florida. Although McShane was paid through a temporary agency until she passed her background check, she later was paid as an employee of the Monroe County Sheriffs Office. Regardless of this employment relationship, (1) David Troyer, an Assistant U.S. Attorney and the Deputy Chief of this HIDTA task force, interviewed her and recommended that Doug Hughes, the Director of the HIDTA task force, hire her; (2) the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office conducted McShane\u2019s training; and (3) Troyer served as her immediate supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">McShane further alleged that Troyer (1) hired a non-litigating male attorney to perform essentially the same work as McShane, but at a higher salary; (2) became hostile when McShane requested to have her title changed to \u201cpost conviction attorney\u201d; (3) deleted e-mail from her without reading it; and (4) failed to respond to harassing conduct she received from agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). McShane also claimed that the defendant (1) made false accusations about her psychological state; (2) denied her training manuals; (3) preprinted her telephone extension on Federal Express package slips, resulting in a call to her each time a package arrived; and (4) talked to McShane\u2019s coworkers about her alleged personal problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">In response to this conduct, McShane (1) complained to Hughes, Troyer, and Kathleen Amstutz, McShane\u2019s supervisor within the Monroe County Sheriffs Office, during a meeting on February 11, 1999; and (2) filed an internal complaint of gender discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Employment Opportunities Office of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Troyer, thereafter, used his position to \u201cget [her] fired.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Based on these allegations, McShane asserted that the defendant retaliated against her (1) for making \u201cinternal complaints\u201d opposing gender discrimination by Troyer, in violation of the \u201copposition clause\u201d (\u201cCount 2\u201d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) for participating in prior Title VII litigation, in violation of the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d (\u201cCount 3\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">After answering this complaint, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, with an incorporated statement of facts and a memorandum of law. The defendant argued, in relevant part, that McShane could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of Title VII retaliation because she could not show, under Title VII\u2019s opposition clause, that she had \u201ca good faith, reasonable belief that [the defendant had] engaged in unlawful employment practices.\u201d The defendant further contended that, even if McShane had made such a showing, she had failed to show that her protected activity was causally related to an adverse employment action because (1) the persons involved in the decision to terminate her employment all testified that this decision was based on McShane\u2019s inability to get along with her coworkers, and (2) the ultimate decision-maker considered, but did not rely on, information supplied by Troyer. Finally, the defendant argued that McShane could not show that its reason for the termination, that is, that she could not get along with others, was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">In support of this motion, the defendant submitted Troyer\u2019s deposition, in which he testified that McShane\u2019s primary job duties involved researching and writing draft responses to post-conviction petitions. In November 1998, McShane complained to Troyer about her lack of secretarial help, expressed concerns about security matters, and stated that she had discovered one of the secretaries working on McShane\u2019s computer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In early January 1999, McShane also told Troyer that (1) someone had stolen a pen from her office, and (2) Wanda Hubbard, McShane\u2019s secretary, had used McShane\u2019s office without permission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Troyer further testified that, on February 9, 1999, McShane told him that (1) her relationships with the secretarial support staff had deteriorated; (2) she was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>cerned about secretaries and DEA agents having access to attorneys\u2019 offices; and (3) she was considering filing a complaint about her concerns, without specifying the nature of this complaint. After Troyer advised Hughes of this discussion and suggested scheduling a meeting, Hughes instructed Troyer to document in a memorandum his encounters with McShane. On February 10, 1999, Troyer prepared a memorandum, documenting his conversations with McShane on February 9 and 10, 1999, and noting his observations of her behavior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Troyer also clarified that he expressed these observations to protect the safety and well-being of the people working in the office, including McShane.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Jean Cockshutt, the fiscal officer for the HIDTA office and Amstutz\u2019s supervisor, also testified as part of a deposition, stating that, on December 16, 1998, McShane complained to her that McShane had not been invited personally to the HIDTA Christmas party, and that her coworkers were treating her differently. Cockshutt responded that, instead of giving out personal invitations to the Christmas party, the office posted an invitation on the door.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Hughes declared that, on February 11, 1999, he conducted a meeting with McShane, Amstutz, Cockshutt, and Troyer, (1) to give McShane the opportunity to express her concerns, and (2) to determine if appropriate actions were necessary and could be taken. During this meeting, McShane expressed her concern that coworkers were conspiring against her. McShane, however, neither complained that she was being discriminated against, nor indicated that she intended to file a discrimination complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hughes and Cockshutt were left with the impression that McShane\u2019s perception of reality was distorted, and that there was no way to resolve her concerns. Moreover, after this meeting, McShane continued having problems with her supervisors and coworkers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Hughes further declared that, at some point, he, Amstutz, and Cockshutt came to the agreement that McShane\u2019s employment with the defendant should be terminated prior to the completion of her probationary period. After Hughes consulted with Mark Willis, counsel for the Sheriffs Office, who concurred with this decision, Hughes obtained the authorization and approval of the Monroe County Sheriff for this employment action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In making this employment decision, Hughes (1) acted because of the detrimental effect on the workplace environment of McShane\u2019s inability to get along with her coworkers; (2) did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>any recommendations regarding McShane\u2019s termination; and (3) considered Troyer\u2019s input, but made his decision to terminate McShane\u2019s employment based on the totality of the circumstances, including the independent observations of Hughes, Cockshutt, and Amstutz.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The defendant also included documentation showing that, (1) on or about February 25 or 26, 1999, McShane contacted Charlotte Zamora Griffith, the defendant\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity contact person, and asked Griffith how she could file a discrimination complaint. On August 8, 1999, McShane filed a formal E.E.O.C. complaint of discrimination against the defendant. On January 8, 2003, following an investigation, the Department of Justice issued a final agency decision, determining that the defendant should be treated as McShane\u2019s employer, but that the evidence did not support McShane\u2019s discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">McShane responded to this motion for summary judgment by arguing, in relevant part, that she engaged in protected activity under the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d of Title VII by being a party in a Title VII lawsuit in Brevard County, helping a client file an E.E.O.C. charge, and by initiating an E.E.O.C. complaint a few days before she was fired from HIDTA. She asserted, as such, that her good faith, or lack thereof, was not relevant. In support of McShane\u2019s argument that her internal discrimination complaints were based on a reasonable, good faith belief that she had suffered discrimination, she cited to the facts that (1) when she confronted Troyer about her dissatisfaction about her title of \u201cParalegal Specialist,\u201d Troyer mocked her by making the Sign of the Cross and \u201cordaining\u201d her an attorney; (2) she was not assigned enough work; (3) she received no support from Troyer on office systems or with secretarial support; (4) Troyer made demeaning comments about women paralegals in general;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (5) Troyer, Hughes, and her administrative supervisors knew about her prior Title VII litigation; and (6) she received a strange phone call from a law enforcement agent who had been the defendant in the prior Title VII case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">McShane also argued that the defendant subjected her to an adverse employment action that was causally related to her protected activity because, although the Monroe County Sheriff actually terminated her employment, under the \u201ccats paw\u201d theory of liability, he was manipulated by Troyer\u2019s improper February 10, 1999, memorandum. McShane asserted, as well, that a causal connection was established by the close temporal relationship between February 24, 1999, when she contacted Zamora Griffith about initiating a charge, and March 4, 1999, when her employment was terminated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Furthermore, McShane argued that she established that the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment was pretextual because the defendant presented inconsistent testimony on whether (1) Troyer knew that McShane intended to file a complaint targeting his behavior; (2) Troyer gave Za<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>mora Griffith the February 10, 1999, memorandum; (8) there were problems with McShane\u2019s work product; (4) Troyer did not assign McShane more cases because there was a \u201cdrought\u201d of work; and (5) other employees complained about McShane. McShane also cited as evidence (1) deposition testimony from Ed Ryan and Charles White, two Assistant U.S. Attorneys, that they did not observe McShane behave as described in the February 10, 1999, memorandum; and (2) documentation showing that her employment was terminated shortly after she initiated an E.E.O.C. complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The defendant replied that McShane had failed to explain why her conduct before February 25 or 26, 1999, constituted Title VII protected activity because the behavior of which she complained neither was discriminatory, nor sufficiently severe or pervasive as to constitute legal harassment. The defendant further contended that, by February 1999, the defendant had expressed serious concerns about McShane\u2019s ability to get along with others. In addition, the defendant asserted that it had offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for McShane\u2019s termination, and that McShane had not shown that this reason was pretextual. On the issue of pretext, the defendant specifically explained that the alleged inconsistencies either were immaterial to the reason for her termination, or were insufficient to show that the reason was untrue. Finally, the defendant contended that McShane had failed to present evidence to dispute that she was having difficulties getting along with her HIDTA coworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The district court granted the defendant summary judgment on all of McShane\u2019s claims in her amended complaint. The court initially explained that it was assuming, without deciding, that McShane was an employee of both Monroe County and the defendant. The court generally concluded that McShane\u2019s complaints, about such matters as her job title, which the court noted had been changed officially to \u201cpost-conviction attorney,\u201d and the office Christmas party, \u201crather than forming the basis of a claim for sex discrimination or even retaliation, instead [gave] credence to the employer\u2019s reason for her discharge, i.e. her inability to get along with others.\u201d The court also explained that the termination of McShane\u2019s employment \u201cobviously\u201d was an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The court then discussed that, to the extent McShane had alleged that she had engaged in Title VII protected conduct under the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d by participating in prior Title VII litigation against a former employer and by representing a female employee of the City of Miami Beach Police Department, the prior litigation was too remote and unrelated to constitute protected activities relating to the instant retaliation claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court determined that, to the extent McShane had alleged that she had engaged in protected conduct under the \u201copposition clause\u201d by making informal complaints of discrimination and by initiating contact with Zamora Griffith after filing a Title VII action, McShane had failed to show that she had a \u201cgood faith reasonable belief\u2019 that the defendant had engaged in unlawful discrimination. On this last point, the court explained that (1) MeShane\u2019s complaints about the workplace were not related to unlawful discrimination, (2) although Troy-er allegedly made derogatory comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>about female paralegals, these comments were not directed at McShane, and (3) Hughes was the person who ultimately decided to terminate McShane\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The court also determined that, even if McShane had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, she had failed to show that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating her employment was pretextual. The court acknowledged that McShane had identified some inconsistencies in the defendant\u2019s testimony, but it concluded that these inconsistencies either were unrelated to her Title VII claim and the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for the termination of her employment, or did not establish pretext because Troyer was not the decision-maker. The court found that Troyer\u2019s observations in his February 10, 1999, memorandum about McShane\u2019s mental state were corroborated by the observations of other HIDTA employees, including Amstutz and Cockshutt. Finally, the court noted that, although Hughes, in deciding to terminate McShane\u2019s employment, considered the contents of Troyer\u2019s February 10, 1999, memorandum, Hughes independently conducted an investigation and considered the input of several employees before making his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">McShane specifically argues on appeal that the court implicitly failed to view all of the facts in the light most favorable to her when it concluded that her complaints were more indicative of her difficulties with getting along with others, instead of evidence of discrimination. McShane also asserts that the court erred in concluding that her initiating an E.E.O.C. complaint was activity protected under Title VII\u2019s \u201copposition clause,\u201d and, thus, required a showing that she had a \u201cgood-faith, reasonable belief\u2019 that the conduct complained of constituted gender discrimination. McShane contends that the court, instead, should have construed this conduct as protected activity under the \u201cparticipation clause.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">In addition, McShane argues that she established that the termination of her employment was causally related to her protected activity because the termination occurred only three business days after she initiated the filing of an E.E.O.C. charge. She asserts that Troyer caused the termination of her employment by using Hughes and the Monroe County Sheriff as \u201ccat\u2019s paws.\u201d Alternatively, McShane contends that the hybrid structure of the HIDTA office resulted in Troyer having <em>de facto </em>control over her employment. Finally, McShane asserts that Troyer had \u201cample motive\u201d to include false statements about McShane in his February 10, 1999, memorandum, because he knew that McShane was intending to file a Title VII complaint that focused on his illegal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Finally, McShane argues that the court erred in concluding that she failed to show that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>criminatory reason for terminating her employment was pretextual. McShane contends that she established pretext by showing that, although she did not get along with her coworkers beginning on October 19, 1998, her first day of employment, her employment was not terminated until March 3, 1999, shortly after she initiated her E.E.O.C. charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">A court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>\u201cview[ing] all evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Miller v. King, </em>384 F.3d 1248, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIssues of credibility and the weight afforded to certain evidence are determinations appropriately made by a finder of fact and not a court deciding summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1259 (quotation omitted). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when \u2018the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits,, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). To survive a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must proffer evidence beyond what is asserted in the pleadings. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.E.2d 265 (1986) (citing Fed. R. Civ.P. 56(e)). Where the nonmoving party has failed \u201cto establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,\u201d no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Id. </em>at 322-23, 106 S. Ct. at 2552.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">As discussed above, McShane has raised a preliminary challenge to the district court\u2019s review of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In granting this motion, however, the court accepted McShane\u2019s alleged facts as true and determined that (1) McShane\u2019s prior suits were too remote and unrelated to her employment to constitute protected activities relating to the instant retaliation claim, and (2) McShane had failed to show that she had a good faith, reasonable belief that the defendant had engaged in the unlawful discrimination that formed the basis of her protected activity under the opposition clause. Moreover, in determining that McShane failed to show pretext, the court accepted as true her alleged facts, but found that they did not show that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination of McShane\u2019s employment was untrue. Thus, instead of showing that the court made improper credibility determinations and findings of fact, the record reflects that the court properly concluded that McShane had failed to show that a genuine issue of material fact existed. <em>See Miller, </em>384 F.3d at 1259.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court, therefore, did not apply the wrong standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">To the extent McShane also is challenging the court\u2019s legal conclusions, it is unlawful under Title VII for an employer to retaliate against an employee \u201cbecause [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice ... or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter [of Title VII].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Where direct evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>dence of retaliation is unavailable\u2014as here\u2014a plaintiff, nevertheless, may present circumstantial evidence of discrimination sufficient to create a jury question. <em>See Sullivan v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>170 F.3d 1056, 1059 (11th Cir. 1999) .</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">For claims based on circumstantial evidence, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Silvera v. Orange County School Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001). If the plaintiff is successful, the defendant must \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [adverse employment action].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff then may attempt to demonstrate that the proffered reason was, in fact, merely pretext for the defendant\u2019s acts. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cThe ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the plaintiff does not proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant\u2019s articulated reasons is pretextual, the [defendant] is entitled to summary judgment.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir. 2000) <em>(en banc) </em>(discussing pretext in context of discrimination involving age and disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">To successfully assert a <em>prima facie </em>case of Title VII retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action was causally related to the protected expression. <em>Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 740 (11th Cir.2004). The defendant has not contested, under the second element of this <em>prima facie </em>case, whether McShane suffered an adverse employment action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, the defendant is arguing that McShane failed to show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression, and (2) the adverse employment action was caused by this expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Moreover, as discussed above, McShane only is arguing on appeal that the court erred in treating her conduct in initiating an E.E.O.C. complaint as activity under the opposition clause and, therefore, requiring a showing of a \u201cgood-faith, reasonable belief\u2019 that the conduct complained of constituted gender discrimination. The Supreme Court in <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), mandated a liberal pleading standard for civil complaints. <em>Id., </em>534 U.S. at 510-11, 122 S.Ct. at 997. \u201cThis standard[,] however[,] does not afford plaintiffs with an opportunity to raise new claims at the summary judgment stage.\u201d <em>Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2004). We explained in <em>Gilmour </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ads\">Efficiency and judicial economy require that the liberal pleading standard under <em>Swierkiewicz </em>and Rule 8(a) are inapplicable after discovery has commenced. At the summary judgment stage, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>proper procedure for plaintiffs to assert a new claim is to amend the complaint in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). A plaintiff may not amend [his] complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1315. Although issues not raised in the pleadings may be treated as if they were properly raised when they either are \u201ctried by express or implied consent of the parties,\u201d or \u201care included in a pretrial order,\u201d these exceptions are not applicable if an opposing party objects to the assertion of such a claim without the filing of a supplemental pleading. <em>Steger v. General Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1077 &amp; n. 11 (11th Cir.2003) (citing to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In the instant case, outside of stating that she raised \u201cinternal complaints,\u201d McShane did not assert in her amended complaint that she engaged in protected activity under Title VIPs participation clause by initiating an E.E.O.C. complaint with the defendant\u2019s human resource personnel. McShane also has not contended that she sought leave to amend her amended complaint. Moreover, as discussed above, although the parties agreed in their \u201cjoint pretrial stipulation\u201d that McShane engaged in protected activity when she made inquiries on or about February 25 or 26,1999, as to how she could file a discrimination complaint, they did not agree that this activity was protected under Title VIPs participation clause. <em>See Steger, </em>318 F.3d at 1077 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11. Thus, the district court did not err in failing to consider this claim before granting summary judgment. <em>See Gilmour, </em>382 F.3d at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Even if we were to construe McShane\u2019s amended complaint as raising this claim under Title VIPs participation clause, no genuine issue of material fact existed on whether McShane established a <em>prima facie </em>case. Title VIPs participation clause \u201cprotects proceedings and activities which occur in conjunction with or after the filing of a formal charge with the [E.E.O.C.]; it does not include participating in an employer\u2019s internal, in-house investigation, conducted apart from a formal charge with the [E.E.O.C.].\u201d <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>221 F.3d at 1174. Thus, \u201cat a minimum, some employee must file a charge with the [E.E.O.C.] (or its designated representative) or otherwise instigate proceedings under the statute for the conduct to come under the participation clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">In <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>we examined whether a plaintiffs taking part in her employer\u2019s internal investigation of allegations of sexual harassment constituted protected activity under Title VIPs participation clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1174. We concluded that, because no E. E.O.C. complaint had been filed before the termination of the plaintiffs employment, the plaintiffs participation in the internal investigation did not constitute protected expression under the participation clause. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this conclusion, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">We do not believe Congress intended to protect absolutely every [Title VII] complaint made to any employer\u2014no matter how informal or knowingly false\u2014as a protected activity under the participation clause. The statute\u2019s opposition clause would be rendered largely meaningless, having been engulfed by the participation clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1174 n. 3. We also discussed that the case was materially different from our decision in <em>Clover v. Total System Servs., </em>176 F. 3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir.1999), wherein we concluded that an employee\u2019s participation in an employer\u2019s internal investigation was protected under the participation clause because the employer conducted an investigation in response to receiving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>notice of charge of discrimination from the E.E.O.C. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>221 F.3d at 1174 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">On February 25 or 26, 1999, McShane contacted Zamora Griffith and asked her about the mechanics of filing a discrimination complaint. However, McShane did not file a formal E.E.O.C. complaint of discrimination against the defendant until August 8, 1999. Although McShane characterizes Zamora Griffith as a \u201ccontact person\u201d with the E.E.O.C., Zamora Griffith, instead, was a human resources employee in the defendant\u2019s administrative division. McShane also has cited to our decision in <em>Eastland v. Tennessee Valley Auth., </em>704 F.2d 613 (11th Cir.1983), in which we noted that \u201c[ejvidence that the adverse treatment followed closely upon the protected activity (i.e. contacting an [E.E.O.C.] officer) may be sufficient to establish a causal connection.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 627. Unlike the facts here, however, <em>East-land </em>involved a plaintiff who consulted an E.E.O.C. counselor, who, in turn, recommended that the employer conduct a service review of the plaintiffs performance. <em>See id. </em>Thus, McShane failed to show that this conduct was protected under Title VII\u2019s participation clause and she, therefore, had to show a good-faith, reasonable belief that she suffered discrimination. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>221 F.3d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Furthermore, even if we were to determine that McShane engaged in protected activity under the participation clause, McShane failed to show that this activity was causally related to the termination of her employment. \u201cTo establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Shannon v. Bellsouth Telecommunications, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). \u201cClose temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action may be sufficient to show that the two were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716-17 (quotation omitted). Nevertheless, \u201cneither a court nor a jury may impute knowledge to a decision-maker who has sworn he had no actual knowledge.\u201d <em>Brochu v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>304 F.3d 1144, 1156 (11th Cir.2002). Moreover, \u201cmere coincidence in time [may not] raise an inference of actual knowledge \u2018where there is unrebutted evidence that the deeision[-]maker did not have knowledge that the employee engaged in protected conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">As discussed above, McShane contends that the relevant decision-makers knew about her contacting Zamora for information about filing a E.E.O.C. complaint before it terminated her employment. In support, McShane asserts that (1) Michael McShane declared that he told Hughes on February 26, 1999, that Joanne McShane had filed a \u201cformal complaint\u201d; and (2) Zamora Griffith stated that either she, or another employee, told Troyer about McShane\u2019s E.E.O.C. complaint and asked Troyer to fax her a copy of the February 10, 1999, memorandum. Indeed, the period between McShane\u2019s initiation of her complaint on February 25 or 26, and the termination of employment on March 3, was a \u201cclose temporal\u201d proximity that ordinarily would be sufficient to show that the two \u201cwere not wholly related.\u201d <em>See Shannon, </em>292 F.3d at 716; <em>see also Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004) (noting that we had determined that a period of as much as one month between the protected expression and the adverse action is not too protracted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">However, Hughes testified that he, not Troyer, made the recommendation that the Monroe County Sheriff terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>McShane\u2019s employment. <em>See Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, Orange County, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1119 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cIt is not enough for the plaintiff to show that someone in the organization knew of the protected expression; instead, the plaintiff must show that the person taking the adverse action was aware of the protected expression\u201d). Hughes stated that he did not know of McShane making a complaint about discrimination based on her gender. Moreover, although Michael McShane told Hughes that his wife filed a \u201cformal complaint,\u201d Michael McShane did not specify with whom she filed the complaint, or the contents of the complaint. McShane, therefore, failed to establish a causal connection by showing that the ultimate decision-maker knew of her protected activity when he made the decision. <em>See Brocha, </em>304 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Finally, to the extent McShane is challenging whether Hughes was a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d for Troyer, and that Troyer had a motive to retaliate, McShane has cited to evidence showing that (1) Troyer initially interviewed her and supervised her daily work; and (2) the Monroe County Sheriff testified that he signed off on the termination after reading Troyer\u2019s February 10, 1999, memorandum, which suggested that she was mentally unstable. We, however, have determined that, although causation may be established, even when the person with the unlawful animus is not the decision-maker, the actual decision-maker must have acted in accordance with this person\u2019s decision, without the actual decision-maker himself evaluating the employee\u2019s situation. <em>Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab., Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir.1998). In a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d situation, the person with the unlawful animus \u201cclearly causes the tangible employment action, regardless of which individual signs the employee\u2019s walking papers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Here, Hughes declared that, although he considered McShane\u2019s input, Hughes made the employment decision based on the totality of the circumstances, including the independent observations of Hughes, Cockshutt, and Amstutz. In addition, McShane has not produced evidence contradicting this assertion. Thus, regardless of who was supervising and evaluating her work, McShane has failed to establish that Hughes was merely a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d for Troy-er. <em>See Llam/pallas, </em>163 F.3d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Even if we were to conclude that McShane established a <em>prima facie </em>case of Title VII discrimination, she failed to show that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its alleged retaliatory conduct was pretextual. As discussed above, once a plaintiff successfully alleges a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, and once the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action, the plaintiff must proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer\u2019s articulated reasons is pretextual. <em>Sullivan, </em>170 F.3d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The question the factfinder must answer is whether the employer\u2019s proffered reasons were \u201ca coverup for a ... discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2002) (we are \u201cnot in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair\u201d). Thus, after considering all of the evidence, the court must ascertain whether the plaintiff has cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder to determine that these reasons were \u201cnot what actually motivated its conduct.\u201d <em>Silvera, </em>244 F.3d at 1258. In casting such doubt, the plaintiff must demonstrate \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact-finder could find [all of those reasons] unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Here, the defendant offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason why it terminated McShane\u2019s employment, that is, because she could not get along well with others. Amstutz testified that, approximately one month after McShane began her employment with the defendant, she appeared less friendly; was disturbed by the background process; and objected to signing standard forms. As documented in his February 10, 1999 memorandum, Troyer asserted that McShane had, among other things, become \u201cvirtually reclusive,\u201d engaged in \u201crecent bizarre behaviors,\u201d and might be a danger to herself and others. Moreover, after Hughes met with McShane on February 11, 1999, the defendant continued having problems with McShane.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We have concluded that the \u201cability to handle reasonably necessary stress and work reasonably well with others are essential functions of any position.\u201d <em>See Williams v. Motorola, Inc., </em>303 F.3d 1284, 1291 (11th Cir.2002) (discussing whether the plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d)). \u201cIf the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot recast the reason but must meet it head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir.2004). McShane concedes on appeal that she did not get along with others since her first day of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">To the extent McShane, instead, speculates that the defendant would have terminated her employment immediately upon hire if its reason for the decision was that she could not get along with others, and she cites to the fact that her employment was terminated within three business days of her initiating an E.E.O.C. complaint, \u201ca close temporal proximity between two events may support a finding of a causal connection between those two events.\u201d <em>See Wascura v. City of South Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1244-45 (11th Cir. 2001). Such a showing, standing alone, however, does not necessarily establish that an employer\u2019s articulated reasons for taking adverse actions were pretextual. <em>See id. </em>at 1245 (concluding that pretext in ADA case was not established solely by the three and one-half month period between the plaintiffs notifying her employer of her son\u2019s illness and her subsequent termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">As discussed above, Hughes, the decision-maker, stated that he did not know that McShane made a complaint about discrimination based on her gender. The defendant also initially took steps to deal with McShane\u2019s problem with dealing with others, other than terminating her employment, which included installing a lock on her office door. In addition, on February 11, 1999, after Troyer informed Hughes of McShane\u2019s complaints, but before McShane allegedly initiated an E.E.O.C. complaint, Hughes conducted a meeting with McShane, Amstutz, Cockshutt, and Troyer, (1) to give McShane the opportunity to express her concerns, and (2) to determine if appropriate actions were needed and could be taken. When it became clear that there was no way to resolve McShane\u2019s concerns, Hughes, Amstutz, and Cockshutt came to the agreement that McShane\u2019s employment with the defendant should be terminated before the completion of her probationary period. Thus, although McShane\u2019s alleged protected activity and the termination of her employment were only separated by three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>business days, McShane has simply failed to produce evidence of pretext.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on McShane\u2019s Title VII relation claims. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\">. A HIDTA is a designation assigned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which provides resources and funding to enhance law enforcement efforts in areas where major drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution exists. The HIDTA task force at issue here was staffed by employees of various local, state, and federal agencies, and was located physically within the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\">. Title VII's retaliation provisions protect certain kinds of activity. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Total System Services, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2000). Under its opposition clause, an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee \"has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this sub-chapter.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). On the other hand, under its participation clause, an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee \"has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">. McShane also included in her amended complaint a claim of gender discrimination, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 (\u201cCount 1\u201d). The district court, however, granted summary judgment on this count because McShane conceded that \"discovery [had] failed to produce evidence sufficient to support\u201d this claim. Because McShane has not challenged this determination on appeal, we deem arguments on it abandoned, <em>see Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (issues not argued in initial brief are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-13\">. Amstutz also testified that, approximately one month after McShane began her employment with the defendant, McShane (1) appeared less friendly; (2) was disturbed by, and asked questions about, the background process; (3) made phone calls to the defendant's personnel office; and (4) objected to signing standard forms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b808-14\">. Amstutz testified that, after this complaint, and on McShane's request, a lock was installed on McShane's office door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. These observations included that McShane (1) had become \"virtually reclusive\u201d and had engaged in \"recent bizarre behaviors\u201d that were unexplainable; (2) \"might be mentally unstable, as she seem[ed] paranoid and [did] not appear to be dealing with reality\u201d; (3) \"[might] be a danger to herself and others, particularly those whom she views as enemies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. McShane also complained to Amstutz and Troyer about not being invited personally to the office Christmas party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. Although McShane did not complain of discrimination, she vaguely stated during this meeting that she believed that Troyer had \"a problem dealing with women,\u201d and that Troy-er and the secretarial staff did not like her because an HIDTA agent had been a defendant in a Title VII case in which McShane had represented the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">. These problems included McShane initially refusing to sign a standard appointment form for all employees of the Sheriff\u2019s Office at HIDTA, and making a written complaint to Amstutz about McShane\u2019s secretary, Wanda Hubbard, which Amstutz determined to be unjustified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b809-16\">. On March 3, 1999, the Sheriff's Office issued a notice of withdrawal of McShane\u2019s employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">. These comments allegedly included that \"those paralegal specialists, those women, don\u2019t respond well to light. They are just glorified secretaries and they are basically useless.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. McShane also filed in support a declaration by her husband, Michael McShane, that, on February 26, 1999, she told Hughes that his wife had filed a \"formal complaint\u201d; and Zamora Griffith's testimony that she, or another employee, told Troyer, around the time period of February 25, 1999, about McShane\u2019s E.E.O.C. complaint and asked Troyer to fax her a copy of the February 10, 1999, memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. Although the parties agreed in their \"joint pretrial stipulation\u201d that McShane engaged in protected activity when she made inquiries on or about February 25 or 26, 1999, as to how she could file a discrimination complaint, they did not agree that this activity was protected under Title VII\u2019s participation clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. In raising this appeal, McShane explains that she is not appealing the court's determination that her prior participation in Title VII actions was too remote to be relevant in this action. McShane also has not raised arguments challenging the court\u2019s determination that her protected activity under the opposition clause was not based on a \"good faith, reasonable belief\u201d that she was the victim of discrimination. <em>See Lipphardt v. Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 1183, 1187 (llth Cir.2001) (a plaintiff asserting a claim under the opposition clause must show that a \"good faith, reasonable belief\u201d that she was the victim of discrimination lead her to engage in the protected activity). Finally, McShane concedes that she failed to assert that her initiating a complaint with Zamora constituted protected activity under Title VII's \"participation clause\u201d until she filed her opposition to summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. Although McShane cites in support of this argument to the court\u2019s preliminary statement that her complaints, \u201crather than forming the basis of a claim for sex discrimination or even retaliation, instead [gave] credence to the employer\u2019s reason for her discharge, i.e. her inability to get along with others,\u201d the court explained in greater detail later in its opinion why, even accepting these complaints as true, they did not support McShane's retaliation claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">. The Supreme Court set out this three-part burden-shifting framework in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">. To be considered an adverse employment action under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, the action \"must either be an ultimate employment decision or else must \u2018meet some threshold level of substantiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Stavropoulos v. Firestone, </em>361 F.3d 610, 616-17 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1850, - L.Ed.2d -- (2005). Ultimate employment decisions include decisions such as termination, failure to hire, or demotion. <em>See id. </em>at 617.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b819-18\">. As the defendant asserts, under the mixed-motive defense, an employer may avoid liability in a Title VII retaliation case if it would have made the same disputed employment decision in the absence of the alleged bias. <em>See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1269 (11th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, because McShane has failed to show that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination was pretextual, we need not determine whether this defense was applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
