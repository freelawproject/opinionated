For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Green applied to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and bring this action against Defendants under \u00a7 1983. Green alleges that he has Hepatitis C and is being denied lifesaving medical treatment. He seeks both injunctive and monetary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In determining whether Green was entitled to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the district court noted that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) prohibits a prisoner from bringing a civil action or from appealing a judgment in a civil action \u201cif the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(g) (West Supp.2005). Under this statutory provision, the district court concluded that \u201cPlaintiff has had numerous actions dismissed on the grounds that they are frivolous or fail to state a claim.\u201d J.A. 12. In particular, the district court pointed to \u201cAction Numbers 2:94cv487, 2:97cv26, and 2:97cv937,\u201d as \u201cdismissed for frivolousness or failure to state a claim.\u201d J.A. 12-13. In fact, however, two of these cases were dismissed as frivolous and one was dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the district court permitted Green to proceed because \u201cplaintiffs current complaint may allege a situation that would place him in imminent danger of serious physical harm.\u201d J.A. 13. The district court determined that this action fell within the exception to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule set forth in \u00a7 1915(g), permitting prisoners with three strikes to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>when there is an imminent danger of serious physical harm. Based upon this analysis, the district court granted Green\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Defendants answered and filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. After Green responded by filing his own motion for summary judgment and memorandum opposing Defendants\u2019 motion, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. The district court found that Green failed to provide any evidence from which a fact finder could reasonably conclude either (1) that Green was denied adequate medical care in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment or (2) that the non-medical prison officials named as defendants, who relied on the expertise of the prison doctors for Green\u2019s medical treatment, acted with deliberate indifference to Green\u2019s medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">From this judgment, Green appeals and raises two arguments. We reject both arguments as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Green first challenges the district court\u2019s determination that a dismissal without prejudice for want of exhaustion should count as a \u201cstrike\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g). Green contends that an action dismissed for failure to exhaust is not a suit \u201cthat was dismissed on the grounds that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Whether an action dismissed for failure to exhaust under the PLRA amounts to a \u201cstrike\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g) is a question of statutory construction reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Pressley, </em>359 F.3d 347, 349 (4th Cir.2004). The district court determined that Green fell within the \u201cimminent danger of serious physical harm\u201d exception to the three strikes rule and allowed this action to proceed to resolution on the merits of Green\u2019s claims. Even if it was error for the district court to count a dismissal for failure to exhaust as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), therefore, Green was not prejudiced by the district court\u2019s finding. We thus express no opinion as to whether the district was in error, and proceed to examine the merits of Green\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Green next argues that the district court should not have granted summary judgment to Defendants because a genuine issue of material fact existed for trial as to his \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the standard required under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Wachovia Bank v. Fed. Reserve Bank, </em>338 F.3d 318, 320 (4th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper \u201cunless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party. If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (internal citations omitted). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the facts and inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See id. </em>at 255,106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">We have carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments, both in their briefs and at oral argument, and cannot find any evidence in the record creating a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Therefore, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> Section 1997e(a) requires that inmates exhaust all administrative remedies before filing an <em>in forma pauperis </em>action challenging prison conditions under federal law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1997e(a) (West 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
