The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). As to claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Hallums has not satisfied either standard. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>miss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
