Because the petitioners\u2019 asylum proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply. <em>See Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this court \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). This court \u201ccannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may [it] weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the petition for review is due to be denied because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that (1) Lopez-Molano\u2019s testimony was not credible; (2) the petitioners were not eligible for asylum because they failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of Lopez-Molano\u2019s political activities; and (3) Lopez-Molano was not eligible for withholding of removal because he failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to Columbia. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
