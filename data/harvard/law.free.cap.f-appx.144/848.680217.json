Garcia, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 885 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The case is back before us on remand from the Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">The appellant did not raise any <em>Booker-related </em>issue in his brief to this court. The first time he raised any Booker-related issue in any court was in his certiorari petition to the Supreme Court. For that reason, our decision on this remand is controlled by <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), which held in materially identical circumstances that the appellant was procedurally barred from relief on the <em>Booker </em>issue because of his failure to raise the issue when the case was first before us. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63; <em>see also United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Pipkins, </em>412 F.3d 1251, 1251 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case affirming the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-25\">OPINION REINSTATED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b874-26\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASY\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-27\">The court declines to consider appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits because appellant failed to present the claim in his initial brief on appeal. Binding precedent requires us to disregard the claim for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>reason. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>273 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2001), and its progeny, e.g., <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005), cited by the court. Ante at-. I therefore concur in the court\u2019s judgment. Were we writing on a clean slate, I would, for the reasons I have previously expressed, entertain appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>418 F.3d 1136 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
