Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s conviction for bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d). <em>See United States v. Billingslea, </em>107 Fed.Appx. 182 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">In his initial brief, Billingslea argued that: (1) the district court abused its discretion by empaneling an anonymous jury; (2) the district court abused its discretion by allowing a government witness to testify via satellite video transmission; (3) the district court plainly erred by admitting an unavailable declarant\u2019s photograph identification of Billingslea; and (4) there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. Nowhere in his initial brief did Appellant raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence or assert any error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny. Thus, Appellant\u2019s <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim was not timely raised in this Court. As there is nothing in the Supreme Court remand suggesting that we treat this claim as timely, we deem Appellant\u2019s untimely <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim abandoned. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">OPINION REINSTATED; CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b125-13\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">The court declines to consider appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits because appellant failed to present the claim in his initial brief on appeal. Binding precedent requires us to disregard the claim for that reason. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>273 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2001), and its progeny, e.g., <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005), cited by the court. Ante at-. I therefore concur in the court\u2019s judgment. Were we writing on a clean slate, I would, for the reasons I have previously expressed, entertain appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>418 F.3d 1136 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
