He was sentenced to 37 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-25\">The Government correctly argues that Urquilla-Avalos\u2019 unconditional guilty plea waived all non-jurisdictional defects in the trial court proceedings against Urquilla-Avalos and bars an as-applied constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). <em>United States v. Spruill, </em>292 F.3d 207, 215 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>194 F.3d 657, 659 (5th Cir.1999), <em>vacated on other grounds and remanded, </em>530 U.S. 1201, 120 S.Ct. 2193, 147 L.Ed.2d 230 (2000), <em>prior opinion reinstated with modification, </em>246 F.3d 749 (5th Cir.2001). However, Urquilla-Avalos\u2019 unconditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>guilty plea did not waive his right to assert that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) was facially unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Knowles, </em>29 F.3d 947, 952 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 62, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975) (state court conviction)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">For the first time on appeal, Urquilla-Avalos contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As Urquilla-Avalos concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 22, 2005) (No. 05-5469).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not he published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
