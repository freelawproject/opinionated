After <em>de novo </em>review of Boone\u2019s sentence in consideration of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b838-18\">A. Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b838-19\">Boone pled guilty without a plea agreement to conspiracy to cultivate marijuana plants on federal property and for cultivating marijuana plants on federal property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b838-21\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), National Park Service (\u201cNPS\u201d) agents noticed a vehicle, with no permit, parked at the entrance to the Big Cypress National Preserve (\u201cPreserve\u201d). Upon investigating the vehicle, an NPS agent saw a piece of paper listing several items, many of which are common in plant cultivation. Agents established surveillance of the vehicle and saw Boone, co-defendant Timothy Scott Howell, and another man leave the Preserve and approach the vehicle. NPS Agents located the men\u2019s camp, and found a crossbow and marijuana plants growing in buckets. Later, agents found marijuana seedlings in pots with fresh soil and water. The agents\u2019 surveillance camera captured images of Boone, Howell, and a third person engaging in activities related to the cultivation of marijuana at the camp. On another occasion, agents saw a shotgun and a crossbow in two tents at the camp. On several occasions, Boone and Howell were recorded watering, fertilizing, and tending to marijuana plants at the camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-22\">Agents executed a search of Boone\u2019s house and found marijuana residue, pieces of marijuana, and evidence of marijuana use. On May 22, 2004, Boone and Howell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>were arrested as they were leaving the Preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The PSI set Boone\u2019s base offense level at 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(15). The PSI assigned a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), because the offense involved a firearm. Further, the PSI recommended a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). With a total offense level of 10 and a criminal history category of I, Boone\u2019s Guidelines range was 6-12 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI noted, however, that the minimum Guidelines term could be satisfied by a term of probation with certain conditions, one of which was home detention. The PSI established the statutory range of probation as 1-5 years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Boone filed a written objection to the two-level enhancement for possessing a weapon, arguing that the weapons were not used in connection with the marijuana cultivation and possession, and that the enhancement violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Specifically, Boone argued that the weapons were present at the campsite only because he was camping in the forest.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">At the sentencing hearing, Boone testified that he had a camp and that there were a shotgun and crossbow at the camp. He stated that he used the crossbow to shoot deer and was not sure whether he had any arrows left. There also were other hunting items at the camp, such as turkey decoys, a turkey call, and a tree stand. Boone was aware that there was a shotgun at the camp. Boone never thought to use the weapons to protect the marijuana he was growing.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">At sentencing, Boone objected again to the two-level firearm enhancement. Boone also argued that the Guidelines were unconstitutional under <em>Blakely, </em>and that the two-level firearm enhancement was unconstitutional under <em>Blakely. </em>The district court overruled Boone\u2019s objection to the enhancement, finding that Boone had not shown that it was clearly improbable that the weapons were not used in connection with the marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">[T]he defendant has the burden of showing that it is clearly improbable that the weapon is connected to the offense. Based upon all the testimony, common sense just tells me that he has not met that burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-13\">I don\u2019t doubt that the weapons were used for hunting as well, although unsuccessfully used in that manner. But when you have a camp four miles from anywhere, growing marijuana, and you\u2019ve got weapons there, it seems pretty clear to me that part of the purpose of the weapons is for protection of the growers, as well as the crop. And ... the Court is going to overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">The district court also overruled Boone\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument, determining that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the Guidelines. The district court adopted the factual statements in the PSI and the PSI\u2019s application of the Guidelines, including the Guidelines range of 6-12 months\u2019 imprisonment. Boone requested home detention instead of imprisonment. Although the district court had discretion to impose a 1-year probation sentence, the district court then sentenced Boone to 3 years\u2019 proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>tion, including 6 months of home detention as a condition of that probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">On appeal, Boone argues that the district court committed constitutional <em>Booker </em>error by imposing the two-level enhancement for possessing dangerous weapons in connection with the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005). Under <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthere are two types of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1297. The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Based on <em>Booker, </em>we conclude that the district court violated Boone\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on a judicial fact finding. Under the Guidelines, a defendant receives a two-level enhancement if he possessed a firearm. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 states that the adjustment should be applied if the firearm was present, \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 3. A district court\u2019s determination that a weapon \u201cwas connected with\u201d the offense is a factual one. <em>See United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir. 1998) (analyzing the positive connection between the drug transaction and the firearm and holding \u201cthat the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1303 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that it was improbable that the firearms found in Clay\u2019s residence were connected to the offense.\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>344 F.3d 562, 567 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201cIn order to prevail on appeal, a defendant must show that a district court committed clear error in finding that he or she has not met the \u2018clearly improbable\u2019 burden of proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">In this case, while there was sufficient evidence to support the two-level enhancement, the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement violated Boone\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights because his sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory Guidelines system, based on facts neither found by a jury nor admitted by Boone. The Sixth Amendment violation stemmed not from the district court\u2019s extra-verdict enhancements, but from the district court\u2019s use of those extra-verdict enhancements in sentencing Boone in a mandatory Guidelines scheme. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>constitutional error was harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Paz, </em>which was a Aoo/cer-constitutional-error case, we ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>plained that harmless error analysis puts the burden on the government to show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948. Thus, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We first note that the district court correctly calculated Boone\u2019s Guidelines range of 6-12 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cIn other words, as was the case before <em>Booker, </em>the district court must calculate the Guidelines range accurately.\u201d). Furthermore, the district court correctly determined that Boone\u2019s term of imprisonment could be satisfied by a term of probation between 1-5 years. Given these correct determinations, the district court exercised its discretion and sentenced Boone to 3 years\u2019 probation with certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Because the district court already had the discretion to sentence Boone to a term of probation of less than 3 years and elected not to do so, we conclude that the government has met its burden to show that the <em>Booker </em>constitutional error in this case was harmless. There is absolutely no reason to believe the district court would exercise its discretion differently under <em>Booker </em>than it did under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Giovani, </em>416 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-12\">. The transcript of the plea colloquy is not in the record.
