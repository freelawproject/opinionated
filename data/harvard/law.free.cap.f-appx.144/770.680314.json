On appeal, Coale argues that the district court: (1) erred in applying the offense Guideline\u2019s cross-reference for manufacturing a controlled substance; and (2) violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by improperly enhancing his sentence based on facts that were not admitted by him in his plea agreement. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AA2\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Coale pled guilty to possession of chemicals, products, and materials which may be used to manufacture methamphetamine, knowing, intending, and having reasonable cause to believe that such chemicals, products, and materials would be used to manufacture methamphetamine. During the plea colloquy, the government set forth the following facts, which Coale admitted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-21\">On December 5, 2003, the Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) executed a search warrant of a Coconut Creek, Florida, apartment and found a dismantled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>methamphetamine laboratory. Some of the items the DEA agents found included: (1) numerous pieces of glassware; (2) iodine crystals; (3) pseudoephedrine; and (4) other items used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The items were located in a common area of the apartment, and had been placed in a large plastic storage container. The DEA agents also discovered numerous personal documents and items in defendant Coale\u2019s name in a bedroom in the apartment. Also in the bedroom were multiple pseudoephedrine tablets and two clear vials containing methamphetamine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Prior to executing the search warrant, DEA agents observed defendant Coale and co-defendant David Bryant leaving the apartment. Coale was detained at the scene and was found to be in possession of small bags containing a white substance that tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), co-defendant Bryant admitted that he had manufactured methamphetamine and Coale admitted that he resided in the searched apartment. Further, the search of the apartment and Coale\u2019s person resulted in the confiscation of 1.36 grams of methamphetamine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and materials sufficient to manufacture 46.3 grams of methamphetamine. Accordingly, the PSI held Coale accountable for 47.66 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Section 2D1.12 of the Guidelines applies to the offense of possession, manufacture, distribution, transportation, exportation, or importation of chemicals, products, and materials which may be used to manufacture methamphetamine. Section 2D1.12(c)(l) provides that if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance, the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1 should be used, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">If the offense involved unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance, or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully, apply \u00a7 2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(l). The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.12 defines the phrase \u201coffense involved unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance, or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully\u201d as used in \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(l), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">\u201cOffense involved unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully,\u201d as used in subsection (c)(1) means that the defendant, or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), completed the actions sufficient to constitute the offense of unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12, cmt. n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">Thus, the PSI applied the cross-reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and recommended a base offense level of 24 pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(8). With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Coale\u2019s total offense level was 21. With a criminal history category of VI, Coale\u2019s Guidelines range was 77-96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Prior to sentencing, Coale objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a four-level minimal-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. At sentencing, the district court granted a three-level role reduction, which reduced Coale\u2019s offense level to 18 and his Guidelines range to 57-71 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Also prior to sentencing, Coale objected to the application of the \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(l) cross-reference to \u00a7 2D1.1, contending that the cross-reference did not apply to him because he had not pled guilty to a crime that included an intent to manufacture methamphetamine as an element. The government conceded that it could not establish that Coale had himself manufactured methamphetamine, but argued that Coale had pled guilty to possession of manufacturing equipment, and that the relevant conduct provided a sufficient basis for application of the cross-reference. The government also noted that Coale\u2019s co-defendant Bryant had admitted to manufacturing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In arguing for application of the cross-reference, the probation officer also emphasized Coale\u2019s relevant conduct, asserting that Coale and Bryant were in the business of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine. The probation officer further pointed out that Coale had been found in the possession of methamphetamine packaged in small baggies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The district court determined that the \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(l) cross-reference to \u00a7 2D1.1 applied for the reasons stated by the probation officer. Noting a lengthy history of drug-related offenses, the district court sentenced Coale to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">A. Section 2D1.12(c)(l) Cross-Reference</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">On appeal, Coale argues that the district court erred in applying the offense Guideline\u2019s cross-reference for manufacturing a controlled substance, contending that his base offense level should have been determined by the offense Guideline\u2019s own specifications, set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coale asserts that the cross-reference in \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(l) did not apply to him because his offense of conviction did not require, as an element of proof, that he intended to manufacture methamphetamine. Coale concedes that he knew the chemicals he possessed would be used to manufacture methamphetamine, but submits that he never manufactured methamphetamine himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">As stated above, Coale\u2019s offense Guideline was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12, the Guideline for possession of chemicals, products, and materials which may be used to manufacture methamphetamine. However, the district court found that because Coale\u2019s conduct also involved the manufacture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>methamphetamine, the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(1) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 should be applied. Section 2D1.12(c)(l) provides that if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance, the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1 should be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">As noted earlier, the commentary to \u00a7 2D1.12 states that the cross-reference should be applied if \u201cthe defendant, or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), completed the actions sufficient to constitute the offense of unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12, cmt. n.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, in determining whether to apply the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12(c), the district court was required to consider all of Coale\u2019s relevant conduct, including his joint enterprise with Bryant to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine. Nothing in the cross-reference or the Guideline commentary requires that the cross-reference be applied only when the manufacture or attempted manufacture of controlled substances is an element of the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The district court\u2019s decision to impose the cross-reference was based on a number of factors, including that: (1) Coale had possessed materials used in manufacturing methamphetamine; (2) Coale admitted to possession of those materials knowing, intending, and having reasonable cause to believe that such chemicals, products, and materials would be used to manufacture methamphetamine; (3) a disassembled methamphetamine laboratory had been found in an apartment Coale admitted was his; (4) Coale\u2019s co-defendant admitted manufacturing methamphetamine; (5) Coale himself had been found in possession of small baggies containing methamphetamine; and (6) one gram of methamphetamine had been found in Coale\u2019s bedroom. A1 of these facts fall within the offense conduct or, at a minimum, relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that Coale\u2019s offense involved the manufacture or attempted manufacture of methamphetamine was not clearly erroneous, and its application of the \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(l) cross-reference to Coale\u2019s case was not legal error. Accordingly, the district court properly applied the cross-reference to \u00a7 2D1.1 found in \u00a7 2D1.12(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">B. <em>Booker </em>Error</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">For the first time on appeal, Coale argues that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the district court applied the cross-reference based on facts neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we review Coale\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument for plain error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Under <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthere are two types of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">In this case, there is a Sixth Amendment violation because the district court applied the cross-reference, thereby enhancing Coale\u2019s sentence based on its fact-finding that Coale\u2019s relevant conduct involved the manufacture of methamphetamine. If Coale had been sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.12, without the cross-reference, his base offense level would have been 9.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the district court applied the cross-reference based on its findings of fact, which increased Coale\u2019s base offense level to 24, thereby enhancing Coale\u2019s sentence. The Sixth Amendment violation stemmed from the fact that the district court applied the cross-reference under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Because a Sixth Amendment violation exists in this case, Coale has established the first two prongs of plain-error review. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298-99. However, as to the third prong, Coale has not established that the <em>Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights. The third prong of the plain-error test \u201calmost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cThe standard for showing that is the familiar reasonable probability of a different result formulation, which means a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">In this particular case, the sentencing record provides no basis for a conclusion that Coale has shown a reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme. The district court did not sentence Coale to the low-end of the Guidelines range and did not make any comments indicating that the Guidelines sentence was too severe. <em>Cf. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1332-33 (concluding that defendant met the third <em>prong of </em>plain error where district court sentenced defendant at the low end of the Guidelines range and commented on the severity of the sentence). Instead, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>specifically noted that Coale had a criminal history including \u201ca number of drug offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm Coale\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. One gram of methamphetamine was found in the apartment bedroom and 0.36 grams were found on Coale\u2019s person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. Specifically, the probation officer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">The offense, as a whole, these two individuals were in the business of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine.

They were packaged in small baggies on this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">There was another gram of methamphetamine found in the defendant\u2019s bedroom.
