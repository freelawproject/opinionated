The district court found that plaintiff failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-7\">On December 7, 1981, an unidentified citizen found Darrell Burch wandering on the highway. Concerned for Burch, this citizen took him to the Apalachee Community Mental Health Services, Inc., (ACMHS), a facility designated to receive patients suffering from mental illnesses. Upon his arrival, Burch was confused and disoriented; one evaluation form states that Burch thought he was in heaven. At the request of ACMHS, Burch signed a voluntary admission form and an authorization for treatment form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1659-8\">ACMHS diagnosed Burch as having paranoid schizophrenia and began to give him psychotropic drugs. The facility lacked the ability to give Burch the full treatment he needed, however, and transferred him to the Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee, Florida (FSH) on December 10, 1981. Before transferring Burch, ACMHS had Burch sign a form requesting voluntary admission to FSH, along with a form authorizing treatment at FSH.</p>\n<p id=\"AvGk\">Upon his arrival at FSH, that facility also had him sign a request for voluntary admission form, despite the fact that he remained in a psychotic state. On December 23, 1981, FSH had Burch sign another authorization of treatment form. FSH kept Burch as a patient until May 7, 1982, allegedly against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-14\">Burch subsequently sued ACMHS and the FSH employees (Employees) who were connected with his admission or treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Burch alleged that these defendants had confined and treated him against his will, without any judicial determination of his need for treatment as required by Florida law and the United States Constitution. Burch alleged that the defendants had deprived him of his liberty without due process of law and sought relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1659-15\">All of the defendants moved the district court to dismiss Burch\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The district court granted their motion, holding that under <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), Florida\u2019s post-deprivation procedures satisfied the requirements of due process and precluded a section 1983 action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Burch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>now appeals. As did the district court, we take the material allegations of Burch\u2019s complaint as true and construe them liberally in his favor. <em>See Fundiller v. City of Cooper City, </em>777 F.2d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-5\">At the time that Burch was in defendants\u2019 care, Florida law mandated a certain procedure for the emergency admission of mental health patients. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.463(1) (1981) (amended 1984). This procedure allowed a mental health facility to provide emergency, involuntary treatment to a patient if the patient met certain criteria.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Within forty-eight hours of the patient\u2019s admission, however, the facility had to release the patient, get his voluntary \u201cexpress and informed consent to evaluation or treatment,\u201d or initiate \u201ca proceeding for court-ordered evaluation or involuntary placement.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.463(l)(d) (1981) (amended 1982). A patient could enter (or remain in) a facility voluntarily if he \u201cma[de] application by express and informed consent for admission.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.465(l)(a) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-6\">Taking Burch\u2019s allegations as true, we cannot doubt that he has a colorable claim that the defendants failed to follow the statutory procedure. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), however, held that the eleventh amendment bars a federal court from granting relief against state officials on the ground that they violated state law. Thus, a plaintiff seeking federal relief against state officials must allege and prove a violation of the United States Constitution or of a federal law. Burch grounds his complaint in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, urging us to hold that the State deprived him of an unspecified substantive right or failed to grant him adequate procedures. We cannot comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-8\">The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment gives rise to three types of claims: (1) for violations of incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights; (2) for violations of the substantive component of the due process clause; and (3) for violations of procedural due process. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 679, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring); <em>Gilmere v. City of Atlanta, 774 </em>F.2d 1495, 1499-1502 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1970, 90 L.Ed.2d 654 and \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1993, 90 L.Ed.2d 673 (1986) (allowing recovery under \u00a7 1983 on two theories: violations of substantive due process and of the fourth amendment). Properly construed, Burch\u2019s claim falls in the third category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-13\">An individual has a protected liberty interest in remaining free from long-term mental institutionalization until he voluntarily seeks help or is involuntarily committed after a hearing. <em>See Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 425, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1809, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) (the Supreme Court \u201crepeatedly has recognized that civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>see also Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980) (prisoner entitled to procedural safeguards before being transferred to mental institution). If the state follows the proper procedures, its confinement of an individual in need of care to a mental rehabilitation facility does not infringe upon any substantive right. <em>See Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980); <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979); <em>cf. Gilmere, </em>774 F.2d at 1500 (defining substantive due process claims as those which \u201callege that certain governmental conduct would remain unjustified even if it were accompanied by the most stringent of procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>safeguards\u201d). In this case, Burch cannot claim that the State of Florida lacked the constitutional power to place him, even involuntarily, into a hospital for treatment of his mental illness. Nor do we find in Burch\u2019s complaint any noneonclusory allegation that the governing boards or supervisory employees at ACMHS or FSH had a policy or regular practice of ignoring the State\u2019s regulations concerning the admission of patients needing mental care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we read Burch\u2019s complaint as alleging that ACMHS and Employees, by willfully <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> confining and treating him without a valid consent, deprived him of his procedural due process right to a judicial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-5\">The fourteenth amendment is not \u201ca font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States.\u201d <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1160, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). To prevent turning the due process clause into a mere duplication of the common law tort system, the Supreme Court in <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), explained the circumstances under which a state could be found to have deprived an individual of his right to procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-8\">In <em>Parratt, </em>a state prisoner sued the prison warden for allegedly depriving him of his property without due process of law. The plaintiff claimed that the warden\u2019s action, negligently losing a hobby kit that the plaintiff had ordered through the mail, entitled him to relief under section 1983. The Supreme Court disagreed. Implicitly holding that the defendants had not deprived the plaintiff of any substantive due process right,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the <em>Parratt </em>Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was one for a negligent deprivation of procedural due process. The Court then stated that \u201cthe impracticality of providing any meaningful predeprivation process, when coupled with the availability of some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the State\u2019s action at some time after the initial taking, can satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 539, 101 S.Ct. at 1915 (footnote omitted). Determining that the State could not provide any \u201cmeaningful predeprivation process\u201d if it could not predict when its employees would violate its own law and that the State offered a sufficient postdeprivation remedy in the state courts, the Court held that the State had not deprived the plaintiff of procedural due process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1661-14\">In <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), the Supreme Court extended <em>Parratt, </em>holding that Parratt's reasoning also applied to intentional deprivations of property. In <em>Hudson, </em>a state prisoner sued a prison officer for allegedly destroying some of his property during a search of his cell. The Court observed that a state can no more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>predict an employee's intentional disregard of state law than his negligent disregard, and held that the postdeprivation remedy the State made available to the prisoner satisfied the constitutional requirement of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-5\">Both <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>dealt with plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the state had deprived them of their property without procedural due process. We must now decide whether the logic of <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>is applicable in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that the language of the fourteenth amendment, and Supreme Court precedent, demand that we avoid the treacherous path of attempting to rank the three fundamental rights mentioned together in the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-6\">The fourteenth amendment declares that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIY, \u00a7 1. The Reconstruction Congress adopted the amendment, at least in part, to protect the substance of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 from claims that it was unconstitutional and to prevent future congresses from easily repealing the federal protection of citizens against state abuses. <em>See </em>Gressman, <em>The Unhappy History of Civil Rights Legislation, </em>50 Mich.L.Rev. 1323, 1328-29 (1952); <em>see also Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., </em>405 U.S. 538, 544, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 1118, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972). Both the language and the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 leave no doubt that the post-war Congress passed the Act out of concern for both the liberty and right to own property of the newly freed slaves, without distinguishing between the relative importance of these rights. <em>See </em>Gressman, <em>supra, </em>at 1325-27. This brief history of legislation enacted before the adoption of the fourteenth amendment indicates to us that the framers of that amendment valued all three rights protected by the due process clause; rather than ranking these rights, the Congress chose to protect all of them from abusive state power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-10\">Our conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which included the section now codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In that act, through which Congress sought to enforce the fourteenth amendment, Congress substantially reenacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Here again, Congress demonstrated equal concern for the rights of life, liberty, and property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1662-11\">[T]he rights that Congress sought to protect in [that] Act ... were described by the chairman of the House Select Committee that drafted the legislation as \u201cthe enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1662-12\"><em>Lynch, </em>405 U.S. at 545, 92 S.Ct. at 1118 (quoting Rep. Shellabarger, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 69 (1871) (other citations omitted)); <em>see also </em>Note, <em>Civil Procedure: Section 13Jf3(3) Jurisdiction and the Property-Personal Right Distinction, </em>1970 Duke L.J. 819, 833-37, 833 (\u201c[T]he framers of the fourteenth amendment and the 1871 Act from which both section 1983 and section 1343(3) were derived evidenced no intention to distinguish between the protection of proprietary or personal interests.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-13\">To hold that a plaintiff\u2019s claim that the state denied him procedural due process regarding a liberty right is constitutionally distinct from a similar claim relating to a property right would take us into the eddies of confusion and inconsistencies that the Supreme Court forsook in <em>Lynch. </em>Pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>or to that case, the Court attempted to resolve a seeming inconsistency among jurisdictional statutes by differentiating between property rights and the rights to life and liberty. <em>See Hague v. C.1.0., </em>307 U.S. 496, 527-32, 59 S.Ct. 954, 969-71, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (plurality) (Stone, J., concurring) (requiring minimum jurisdictional amount for property claims, but not liberty claims, under predecessor to section 1983). This approach led to unsupportable line drawing and generated much criticism. <em>See Lynch, </em>405 U.S. at 551 n. 20, 92 S.Ct. at 1121 n. 20 (citing scholarly criticism and confusion among the courts); <em>see also </em>Eisenberg, <em>Section 1983: Doctrinal Foundations and an Empirical Study, </em>67 Cornell L.Rev. 482, 486 (1982) (\u201cThe Court has toyed with intermediate approaches under which section 1983 protects only \u2018civil\u2019 rights or only \u2018personal\u2019 rights, but these never have come to represent a coherent approach to the section.\u201d) (footnotes omitted). In <em>Lynch, </em>the Court reexamined the legislative history of the fourteenth amendment and the civil rights laws enacted pursuant to it and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1663-4\">[T]he dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one. Property does not have rights. People have rights. The right to enjoy property without unlawful deprivation, no less than the right to speak or the right to travel, is in truth, a \u201cpersonal\u201d right, whether the \u201cproperty\u201d in question be a welfare check, a home, or a savings account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1663-5\"><em>Lynch, </em>405 U.S. at 552, 92 S.Ct. at 1122. We find no reason to question <em>Lynch\u2019s </em>continuing vitality and thus have no reason to limit <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>to cases involving property claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-6\">We note that we are not the first court to conclude that the law should analyze claims alleging the deprivation of procedural due process in an identical fashion, regardless of whether the procedure affected the right to life, liberty, or property. Two other courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion as we do today. <em>See Wilson v. Beebe, </em>770 F.2d 578, 584 (6th Cir.1985) (en banc) (\u201cWhen the underlying rationale of <em>Parratt v. Taylor </em>is considered, the conclusion that its holding applies only to the deprivation of property lacks foundation.\u201d); <em>Thibodeaux v. Bordelon, </em>740 F.2d 329, 339 (5th Cir.1984), (\u201c[W]e hold that <em>Parratt </em>applies to deprivations of liberty____\u201d). Similarly, in <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>748 F.2d 229 (4th Cir.1984) (en banc), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the State deprived him of his liberty without due process of law was untenable, because negligent acts do not implicate the fourteenth amendment and, alternatively, because under <em>Parratt </em>the plaintiff had failed to show inadequate state remedies to redress his liberty claim. <em>Cf Ellis v. Hamilton, </em>669 F.2d 510 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 488, 74 L.Ed.2d 631 (1982) (holding that available state remedies precluded plaintiff\u2019s claim that she was deprived of liberty interest without procedural due process). Other courts have distinguished <em>Parratt </em>on other grounds, as our en banc court did in <em>Gilmere, </em>and have thus not decided whether property claims are distinct from life or liberty claims. <em>See Haygood v. Younger, </em>769 F.2d 1350 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3333, 92 L.Ed.2d 379 (1986) <em>(Parratt </em>does not apply to state action taken pursuant to established policy); <em>Piatt v. MacDougall, </em>773 F.2d 1032 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc) (same); <em>Patterson v. Coughlin, </em>761 F.2d 886 (2d Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 879, 88 L.Ed.2d 916 (1986) <em>(Parratt </em>applies only to random acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-16\">We find additional support for our position in recent decisions of the Supreme Court. In <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), and <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986), the Court examined the state of mind requirement for a section 1983 case. Both cases involved an alleged liberty deprivation, and in both the Court held that mere negligence does not \u201cdeprive\u201d an individual of his lib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>erty as the term is used in the fourteenth amendment. In neither case did the Court indicate that it would have ruled any differently had the alleged deprivation involved life or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-4\">Finally, in <em>Parratt </em>itself the Supreme Court stated that its analysis was harmonious with that of <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977), which involved the alleged deprivation of a liberty interest. <em>See Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 542, 101 S.Ct. at 1916. In <em>Ingraham </em>two students claimed that, among other things, the due process clause entitled them to notice and a hearing before public school officials inflicted corporal punishment. <em>Ingraham, </em>430 U.S. at 653, 97 S.Ct. at 1403. The Supreme Court agreed \u201cthat corporal punishment in public schools implicates a constitutionally protected liberty interest, but [held] that the traditional common-law remedies are fully adequate to afford due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672, 97 S.Ct. at 1413. Thus, despite the presence of a recognized liberty claim, the Court found that state tort law provided sufficient protection against official abuse to afford all of the constitutionally required due process. <em>See id. </em>at 676-78, 97 S.Ct. at 1415-16. In light of the liberty deprivation at issue in <em>Ingraham, </em>we see the <em>Parratt </em>Court\u2019s approving citation to that case as further proof that the <em>Parratt </em>test equally applies to cases involving liberty or property claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1664-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-6\">Having concluded that Burch\u2019s claim is one for a deprivation of procedural due process and that <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>are controlling, we must now examine whether Burch has established a claim cognizable in federal court. First, we find that Florida could not offer a meaningful predeprivation process under the facts Burch alleges. As we stated earlier, at the time of Burch\u2019s confinement Florida had established a system for the involuntary commitment of people with mental disorders. The State had designed its laws to ensure that a person would not be wrongly deprived of his liberty. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.463(1) (1981) (amended 1982). Burch has not alleged that Florida\u2019s statutory procedures were constitutionally inadequate; nor has he made a colorable claim that the governing boards of ACMHS or FSH had a policy, custom, or regular practice of not following the mandated procedure. In light of these facts, we cannot see how Florida could predict that in Burch\u2019s case its employees at ACMHS and FSH would ignore the State\u2019s command. Thus, as in <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson, </em>this case does not present a situation where the state could establish any type of predeprivation hearing, beyond that provided by the statutory commitment procedures, to protect Burch from random and unauthorized acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-9\">We next examine Florida law to see if it provides an adequate remedy for the harm Burch allegedly suffered. We find that the State provides a constitutionally adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-10\">If Burch can prove the facts he alleges, Florida law would allow him to recover damages from ACMHS. Even though Burch alleges that ACMHS is a state agency, the State has partially waived its sovereign immunity in state courts, thus eliminating that possible obstacle to a lawsuit. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 768.28 (1981);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number><em>mercial Carrier Corp. v. Indian River County, </em>371 So.2d 1010 (Fla.1979) (sovereign immunity waived for decisions not involving broad policy or planning matters). Thus, we conclude that existing state law provides Burch with a sufficient opportunity to pursue his claim against ACMHS in state court to comport with due process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, although Burch chose not to sue FSH as an entity, we see no reason why he could not rely on Florida\u2019s partial waiver of sovereign immunity to seek recovery from that state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-4\">We also conclude that Burch has adequate state remedies available to him in his suit against Employees. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.-459(13) (1981) provides that \u201c[a]ny person who violates ... [the mental health act] shall be liable for damages.\u201d The law excepts those who acted in good faith compliance, but does not immunize a person from liability merely because his act was negligent rather than intentional.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition to the statute, however, Burch\u2019s allegations also contain the elements of the common law tort of false imprisonment. Florida authorizes suits on that tort theory when a person has been \u201cunlawful[ly] restrain[ed] ... against his will.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Weiner, </em>155 Fla. 169, 19 So.2d 699, 700 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-7\">In sum, we find that the principles of <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517,104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), are controlling in this case, where \u201cthe deprivation occurred as a result of the unauthorized failure of agents of the State to follow established state procedure.\u201d <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 543, 101 S.Ct. at 1917. Burch\u2019s claim is, at most, one for damages resulting from the denial of procedural due process, and Florida provides him with a postdeprivation remedy sufficient to satisfy the Constitution\u2019s requirement. The judgment of the district court is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1659-9\">. Burch attached to his complaint, and incorporated therein by reference, all the forms, documents, and correspondence mentioned in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1659-10\">. Burch\u2019s complaint also named as a party defendant the county sheriff who had transported him from ACMHS to FSH. The sheriff, apparently having been dropped from the litigation, is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1659-11\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-12\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1659-19\">. At the time Burch was confined, Florida provided that any person who violated a right guaranteed to a patient under state law would be liable to the patient, unless the defendant acted in a good faith attempt to comply with the law. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.459(13) (1981); <em>see abo infra </em>note 14 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1660-7\">. Burch does not allege that Florida\u2019s statutorily-prescribed procedures were constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1661-9\">. Burch\u2019s complaint incorporates by reference a letter from the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services indicating that it had informed the administration of the Florida State Hospital that it was probably asking patients voluntarily to commit themselves when they were incapable of making such a decision. Nothing in Burch\u2019s complaint, however, alleges a hospital policy or regular practice to effect those commitments, and we find that the context of the letter makes this statement an insufficient basis for us to read his complaint as making such an allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1661-10\">. As we read Burch\u2019s complaint, he alleges that the defendants acted \"willfully\u201d in the sense of \u201chaving intent,\u201d not that they acted with malice toward him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1661-15\">. We find this an implicit holding of <em>Parratt </em>because the prisoner\u2019s complaint, in alleging a deprivation of due process, did not differentiate between substantive and procedural due process. <em>See Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 529, 101 S.Ct. at 1910. In restricting its discussion to procedural due process, the Court obviously rejected any notion that the negligent deprivation of the prisoner\u2019s hobby kit could infringe a substantive right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1661-16\">. In <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), the Supreme Court overruled <em>Parratt </em>to the extent that <em>Parratt </em>held that an official\u2019s negligence could implicate the due process clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"A9Vj\">. In <em>Gilmere v. City of Atlanta, </em>774 F.2d 1495 (1985) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1970, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014, and \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1993, 90 L.Ed.2d 654 (1986), this court held that Parratt's analysis did not apply to cases where a plaintiff had been deprived of a substantive, rather than procedural, constitutional right. In a footnote, we noted in dictum that <em>Parratt </em>might also be limited to cases involving property claims and not apply to allegations of procedural deprivations of life or liberty. <em>Id. </em>at 1499 n. 4. As we noted there, however, \u201cour disposition of this case makes it unnecessary for us to use this form of analysis.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1664-7\">. Our decision today does not, of course, mean that every state remedy that is \"adequate\u201d for one interest protected by the due process clause is necessarily adequate for another. <em>Cf. Thibodeaux v. Bordelon, </em>740 F.2d 329, 338 n. 9 (5th Cir.1984); Smolla, <em>The Displacement of Federal Due Process Claims by State Tort Remedies: </em>Parratt v. Taylor <em>and </em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Company, 1982 U.Ill.L.Rev. 831, 871 (\"\u2018adequacy\u2019 is a matter of federal <em>constitutional </em>concern\"). We note that a party relying on an \"adequate state remedy\u201d argument, or seeking to defeat such an argument, has a duty to demonstrate that predeprivation remedies are or are not possible, and that postdeprivation remedies are or are not available and adequate. An investigation of \u201cadequacy\u201d must, of course, consider the extent to which a state has waived its sovereign immunity and whether individual defendants are somehow insulated from liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1664-12\">. At the time Burch\u2019s cause of action arose, Florida\u2019s sovereign immunity law stated in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>[a]ctions at law against the state or any of its agencies or subdivisions to recover damages in tort ... for injury ... caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the agency or subdivision while acting within the scope of his office or employment under circumstances in which ... a private person, would be liable to the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ake\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 768.28(1) (1981). The State has since amended the statute, but adheres to its partial waiver of sovereign immunity. Although the law does limit the amount of money a claimant can recover from the State, and requires that a plaintiff submit a claim to the State within three years after it arises, neither provision is so unreasonable as to deny Burch an \"adequate\u201d state remedy. <em>See Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 544, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1917 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (\u201cAlthough the state remedies may not provide ... all the relief which may have been available ... under \u00a7 1983, that does not mean that the state remedies are not adequate to satisfy the requirements of due process.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1665-14\">. Under any reading of \u00a7 1983 and <em>Parratt, </em>Burch would lack a federal cause of action against ACMHS if further development of the facts disclosed that the facility was not acting \u201cunder color\u201d of state law. He could, of course, sue the clinic in state court under state tort law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1665-17\">. In full, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.459(13) (1981) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-18\">Any person who violates or abuses any rights or privileges of patients provided by this act shall be liable for damages as determined by law. Any person who acts in good faith in compliance with the provisions of this part shall be immune from civil or criminal liability for his actions in connection with the admission, diagnosis, treatment, or discharge of a patient to or from a facility. However, this section shall not relieve any person from liability if such person is guilty of negligence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1665-19\">. ACMHS also urges that we affirm the district court on the grounds that Burch\u2019s claim was impermissibly predicated upon the doctrine of respondeat superior liability and that it is not a \"person\" under section 1983. All defendants also claim that they are protected from liability by the eleventh amendment. Because of our disposition of this case, we need not reach these contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
