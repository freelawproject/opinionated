Celli was fired when he threatened, in the course of one of these grievance discussions with management, to \u201cdrop-a-dime.\u201d Petitioner contends that by that phrase, Celli meant a threat to call the IRS and suggest that they take a look at the company\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">The NLRB found that these facts did not mitigate against the finding of unfair labor practices in relation to Celli\u2019s discharge as found by the AU. Subsequent to an initial finding by the AU and an appeal by the company, the NLRB remanded for a supplemental decision as to whether or not the discharge would have taken place under the standards set forth in the <em>Wright Lane </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-22\">Thus, for the reasons set forth above, we shall henceforth employ the following causation test in all cases alleging violation of Section 8(a)(3) or violations of Section 8(a)(1) turning on employer motivation. First, we shall require that the General Counsel make a prima facie showing sufficient to support the inference that protected conduct was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s decision. Once this is established, the burden will shift to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-23\"><em>Wright Lane, Inc., </em>251 NLRB 1083, 1089 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-24\">The AU made a careful review of the previous incidents and safety issues in which Celli had been involved in arguments with management and found them to be protected activity under the Act and that Celli\u2019s profane language was not egregious conduct which exceeded the bounds of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tected activity. By this finding, Celli met the first prong of the <em>Wright Line </em>test and thus the burden shifted to the company to demonstrate that the discharge would have taken place in the absence of protected conduct. This burden, the AU found, had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Our review of the record indicates that there is substantial evidence to support the findings and conclusions of the ALJ and the Board. The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
