Plaintiffs claim that their due process rights were violated when defendants, Neely and Hammond, state trial court judges presiding over the contempt hearings, failed to appoint counsel for plaintiffs, who were indigent at the time. The district court dismissed the action on <em>Younger </em>abstention grounds. Finding that plaintiffs\u2019 claim, cognizable only in a habeas corpus application, has not been presented to the state courts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, we reverse and remand the action to the district court with instructions that the court dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Leonard and Casselbury were held, in separate state court proceedings, to be in civil contempt for failure to pay child support in the sums of $2,898.00 and $2,894.17, respectively. At the hearings, the presiding state judges, Neely and Hammond, imposed the incarceration orders without: (1) inquiring as to plaintiffs\u2019 indigency status; (2) addressing whether counsel should be appointed; (3) notifying plaintiffs of their right to counsel; or (4) appointing counsel to represent plaintiffs. Both men were imprisoned for indefinite periods until child support payments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">On April 4, 1984, plaintiffs, while incarcerated under the contempt orders, filed this action, styled \u201cComplaint and Habeas Corpus Petitions,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that their constitutional right to due process had been violated. They sought release from custody, preliminary and permanent injunctions against the imprisonment of plaintiffs in any nonsupport proceeding where counsel were not provided to the indigent plaintiffs, and a declaratory judgment that no indigent person be incarcerated in a nonsupport civil contempt hearing without appointment of counsel. Plaintiffs asserted that the requested relief was authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff Casselbury was released from jail, and on April 12, 1984, an amended complaint was filed so stating. Also on April 12, a motion for temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction was filed seeking Leonard\u2019s release from jail and enjoining any future contempt hearings for plaintiffs without appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">On April 18, the lower court entered an order finding that the August 12 TRO and preliminary injunction motion sounded in habeas corpus, and thus, Leonard must exhaust his state court remedies pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). On April 27, Leonard withdrew the TRO and preliminary injunction motion, since he already had been released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and defendants filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. Adopting the findings and recommendations of the magistrate, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Viewing plaintiffs\u2019 claim as one actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the court reasoned that it should abstain from deciding the constitutional claim under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">At the outset, we find that plaintiffs\u2019 claim should not have been viewed as a \u00a7 1983 action. Their claim is cognizable only in habeas corpus. When plaintiffs filed this action, both were in prison. Their complaint, entitled \u201cComplaint and Habeas Corpus Petitions,\u201d challenged the constitutionality of their confinement and sought their release. It matters not that habeas corpus petitions were never filed, and plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings sought relief pursuant to other authorities. If a state prisoner, in his complaint, is attacking the validity of his confinement and seeking release, habeas corpus is the <em>exclusive </em>remedy. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); <em>Preiser v. Rodriquez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). The <em>Preiser </em>Court specifically stated that a prisoner \u201ccannot bring a \u00a7 1983 action, even though the literal terms of \u00a7 1983 might seem to cover such a challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 93 S.Ct. at 1836.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Relying on <em>Preiser, </em>this court has consistently precluded plaintiffs from challenging their imprisonment guised as other actions. <em>See, e.g., Alexander v. Johnson, </em>742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir.1984) (although complaint against imprisonment is cast in \u00a7 1983 terms, claim is remedial only in habeas corpus); <em>Todd v. Baskerville, </em>712 F.2d 70 (4th Cir.1983) (case to be considered in habeas when release sought); <em>Hamlin v. Warren, </em>664 F.2d 29 (4th Cir. 1981) (although prisoner\u2019s complaint was confined to \u00a7 1983 claim and request for declaratory and injunctive relief, pleading was to be construed as one in habeas), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 911, 102 S.Ct. 1261, 71 L.Ed.2d 451 (1982). The significance in limiting plaintiffs\u2019 remedy solely to a writ of habeas corpus is the \u201cconcomitant requirement of exhausting state remedies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. at 2973. This total exhaustion rule is rigorously enforced so that state courts are given the first opportunity to review claims of constitutional error. <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 518-19, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1203, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Plaintiffs herein failed to exhaust their state remedies before seeking redress in federal court. They could have presented their claim and sought relief in state court pursuant to N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 5A-22(b): N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 60(b) of the N.C.Rules of Civil Procedure; or Rules 21 and 23 of the N.C.Rules of Appellate Procedure (writs of certiorari and supersedeas).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Plaintiffs contend that it would be futile for them to raise the constitutional question in state court since the North Carolina Supreme Court has already ruled on the issue. In <em>Jolly v. Wright, </em>300 N.C. 83, 265 S.E.2d 135 (1980), the court refused to recognize an automatic right to counsel for indigents in nonsupport civil contempt proceedings, reasoning that such cases generally do not involve numerous or complex issues.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-4\">Since the nature of nonsupport civil contempt cases usually is not complex, due process does not require that counsel be automatically appointed for indigents in such cases; rather, the minimum requirements of due process are satisfied by evaluating the necessity of counsel on a case-by-case basis____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 94, 265 S.E.2d at 143 (citing <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 779, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1758, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973), for the proposition that whether due process requires an automatic or case-by-case approach to appointment of counsel depends on the type of proceedings under consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that based on <em>Jolly, </em>it would be futile to require them to seek remedy in state court. First, applying the <em>Jolly </em>case-by-case approach to the instant facts, a state court may find plaintiffs entitled to appointment of counsel. Second, we are uncertain that the North Carolina Supreme Court would follow <em>Jolly </em>if asked by plaintiffs to recognize an automatic constitutional right to appointed counsel under the instant facts. Subsequent to the <em>Jolly </em>decision, the United States Supreme Court revisited the question of litigant\u2019s right to appointment of counsel. <em>See Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981). Although the Court applied a case-by-case approach to the <em>Lassiter </em>facts (parental termination proceedings), the Court recognized that a presumption that an indigent has a right to appointed counsel arises when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty. Arguably, such presumption is present in a North Carolina nonsupport civil contempt case. Accordingly, the North Carolina Supreme Court, if requested, may modify or reverse <em>Jolly </em>in order to comport with <em>Las</em>siter,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">We disagree with plaintiffs\u2019 position that the state\u2019s high courts have been given the chance and refused to alter the <em>Jolly </em>decision. Although the Court of Appeals has upheld <em>Jolly </em>in cases decided subsequent to <em>Lassiter, see, e.g., Daugherty v. Daugherty, </em>62 N.C.App. 318, 302 S.E.2d 664 (1983); <em>Hodges v. Hodges, </em>64 N.C.App. 550, 307 S.E.2d 575 (1983), the court had no choice. The North Carolina Court of Appeals is without authority to reverse or modify precedent of the North Carolina Supreme Court. <em>See Cannon v. Miller, </em>313 N.C. 324, 327 S.E.2d 888 (1985). In addition, since <em>Lassiter </em>the North Carolina Supreme Court has not addressed the right to appointed counsel in a nonsupport civil contempt case. The court did consider the issue in a civil paternity proceeding. <em>See Wake County, ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, </em>306 N.C. 333, 293 S.E.2d 95 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1113, 103 S.Ct. 745, 74 L.Ed.2d 965 (1983). Although the court applied the <em>Jolly </em>case-by-case approach to the <em>Townes </em>facts, the risk of physical confinement was not involved therein. Indeed, the court, recognizing that due process presumptively requires appointed counsel for indigents whose physical confinement is a likely result, relied on <em>Lassiter </em>to conclude that the instant paternity proceeding lacked a sufficient threat to personal liberty, and thus a case-by-case determination was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">Our decision in the case at hand applies only the settled principles of exhaustion of state remedies. We express no view on how the North Carolina courts should resolve the underlying constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Next we must address what effect, if any, plaintiffs\u2019 releases from jail have on this habeas corpus action. The releases raise two possible issues: federal jurisdiction and mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The federal habeas corpus statute requires that plaintiffs must be \u201cin custody\u201d when the application for habeas is filed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; <em>see also Carafas v. LaVallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968). The facts herein show that both plaintiffs were in jail when the original complaint was filed. Thus, federal jurisdiction was established. <em>See </em>17 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 4262, at 609 (1978) (hereinafter referred to as <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction). </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent releases have no effect on that jurisdiction. \u201c[Ojnce the federal jurisdiction has attached in the District Court, it is not defeated by the release of the petitioner prior to completion of proceedings on such application.\u201d <em>Carafas, </em>391 U.S. at 238, 88 S.Ct. at 1559 (quoted in <em>Kemplen v. Maryland, </em>428 F.2d 169, 171 (4th Cir.1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The question of mootness is separate and distinct from the jurisdictional issue. Establishing jurisdiction is a matter of satisfying the \u201cin custody\u201d statutory requirement. \u201cIn general a case becomes moot \u2018when the issues presented are no longer \u201clive\u201d or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy v. Hunt, </em>455 U.S. 478, 481, 102 S.Ct. 1181, 1208, 71 L.Ed.2d 353 (1982) (quoting <em>United States Parole Commission v. Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 396, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1208, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980)). Two exceptions to the mootness doctrine have evolved: (1) \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d; and (2) \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Carafas, </em>391 U.S. at 237, 88 S.Ct. at 1559; <em>Murphy, </em>455 U.S. at 482, 102 S.Ct. at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">The \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d exception was enunciated in <em>Carafas, </em>391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556. The Court held that where a conviction results in collateral consequences sufficient to create \u201c \u2018a substantial stake in the ... conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence,\u2019 \u201d the habeas claim is not moot. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 88 S.Ct. at 1559 (quoting <em>Fiswick v. United States, </em>329 U.S. 211, 222, 67 S.Ct. 224, 230, 91 L.Ed. 196 (1946)). This court has applied the exception on several occasions. <em>See, e.g., Broughton, </em>717 F.2d at 148-49, <em>Kemplen, </em>428 F.2d at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">The \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception was first enunciated in <em>Southern Pacific Terminal v. ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911). This doctrine has been applied to numerous factual situations, <em>see Weinstein v. Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct. 347, 348, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975), including habeas corpus claims. <em>See Broughton, </em>717 F.2d at 149; <em>Rastelli v. Warden, Metropolitan Correctional Center, </em>782 F.2d 17 (2d Cir. 1986); <em>Tyars v. Finner, </em>709 F.2d 1274 (9th Cir.1983). Two elements are required to employ this exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-15\">(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKF\"><em>Weinstein, </em>423 U.S. at 149, 96 S.Ct. at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">Applying the law on mootness to the facts of this case, it is clear that the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception applies. Although free now<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, plaintiffs have the substantial risk of again being held in civil contempt and incarcerated without appointed counsel, if they fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>make child support payments. This probability and reasonable expectation that the controversy will recur involving plaintiffs, meet one of the two elements necessary to apply the exception. <em>See Murphy, </em>455 U.S. at 482, 102 S.Ct. at 1183. The other element is also met by the facts presented herein. The controversy involved is \u201cshort run.\u201d Because civil contemnors generally remain in jail for brief time periods, the challenged actions \u201cdo not last long enough for complete judicial review of the controversies they engender.\u201d <em>Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, </em>416 U.S. 115,126, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 1700, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). Thus, the habeas claim is not moot, as it presents a controversy \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the issue herein is still a \u201clive\u201d one, with plaintiffs retaining interests in the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">In sum, we find that the core of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, though cast in \u00a7 1983 terms, is cognizable only in a habeas action. Notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 releases from custody subsequent to filing their claim, federal jurisdiction still exists and the controversy is not moot. Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their state remedies pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). Accordingly, plaintiffs must first present their claims to the state courts before seeking federal review. <em>See Alexander v. Johnson, </em>742 F.2d 117, 126 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Generally, when plaintiffs have failed to exhaust state remedies, the actions are dismissed, thereby forcing plaintiffs \u201cto completely begin their quest for relief anew.\u201d <em>Grace v. Butterworth, </em>635 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 3053, 69 L.Ed.2d 421 (1981); <em>see also Alexander, </em>742 F.2d at 126-27. <em>Cf Slayton v. Smith, </em>404 U.S. 53, 92 S.Ct. 174, 30 L.Ed.2d 209 (1971); <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 4264, at 655 (1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Therefore, we remand the action to the district court with instructions that it be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-12\">. Although mentioned in the complaint, apparently plaintiffs never filed habeas corpus petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-6\">. Although <em>Preiser </em>involved a criminal prison term, its holding is equally applicable to imprisonment for civil contempt. As the <em>Preiser </em>court stated, the essence of habeas corpus is an attack upon the legality of physical confinement, whether that confinement is \"by executive direction alone, or by order of a court, or even by private parties.\u201d <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 484, 93 S.Ct. at 1833. Indeed, other courts have recognized that habeas relief is appropriate in civil actions. <em>See, e.g., Ridgway v. Baker, </em>720 F.2d 1409 (5th Cir.1983) (writ of habeas corpus sought in nonsupport civil contempt imprisonment); <em>National Discount Corp. v. O\u2019Mell, </em>194 F.2d 452, 456 (6th Cir.1952) (\"Although the writ of habeas corpus is usually sought and granted in cases involving imprisonment for crime, it is not restricted to such type of imprisonment. It is appropriate procedure in cases ... of a civil nature.\"). In addition, this court has previously recognized the availability of habeas relief in a contempt imprisonment case. <em>See Broughton v. North Carolina, </em>717 F.2d 147 (4th Cir.1983) (criminal contempt for outburst during a civil trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 940, 104 S.Ct. 1917, 80 L.Ed.2d 464 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">. In a \u00a7 1983 action, plaintiff \"need not first seek redress in a state forum.\u201d <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 477, 93 S.Ct. at 1829. It is this distinction between \u00a7 1983 and habeas actions that underlies the rule limiting plaintiffs relief exclusively to habeas corpus. Consideration of federal-state comity would be circumvented by prisoners bringing \u00a7 1983 actions to attack their incarceration and to seek freedom. <em>Id. </em>at 489-91, 93 S.Ct. at 1836-37.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-10\">The underlying rationale of the [exhaustion] requirement is that \"it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-11\"><em>Patterson v. Leeke, </em>556 F.2d 1168, 1170 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Darr v.

As stated above, in determining whether due process requires appointment of counsel, the <em>Jolly </em>court focused primarily on the complexity of the proceeding.
