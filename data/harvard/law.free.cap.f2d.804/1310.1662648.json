The underlying action had been dismissed for protracted failure to file an opposition to a motion to dismiss filed by the Department of Treasury. Attorneys for Mr. Lepkowski argued before the District Court that their failure to file a timely response to a motion to dismiss was \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d within the meaning of Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court was unpersuaded that counsel\u2019s un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>disputed neglect was, in fact, excusable. As we may review the trial court\u2019s Rule 60(b) determination only for abuse of discretion, <em>Browder v. Director, Illinois Department of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978), this court cannot lightly overturn that decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As no substantial reason for reversal has been advanced, we are constrained on the record before us to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Mr. Lepkowski\u2019s complaint under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982), was filed in September 1984 by his attorney of record, Jack B. Solerwitz, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s principal law offices, as we understand from his various filings, are located in Mine\u00f3la, New York. In November 1984, the Government moved to dismiss the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the applicable statute of limitations and for failure to state a claim for relief under the Privacy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">Rule l-9(d) of the Local Rules of the District Court requires that an opposition to a motion to dismiss be filed within ten days; the Rule further provides that \u201c[i]f such opposing statement is not filed within the prescribed time, the court may treat the motion as conceded.\u201d The opposition was due in early December 1984, yet as confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s associate, a timely response was never filed or served. Hearing Transcript at 4 (Feb. 27, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">Some time after the due date, although ultimately to no avail, the District Judge\u2019s law clerk telephoned Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s law offices to inquire about the matter. According to the testimony of Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s associate, he and Mr. Solerwitz (the sole attorney of record) drafted another opposition for the latter\u2019s signature, which was then mailed. <em>Id. </em>However, neither the court nor opposing counsel received that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">A number of telephone conversations between the Clerk\u2019s Office of the District Court and Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s office over the next two months failed to produce the long-awaited opposition. <em>Id. </em>at 2. On January 29, 1985, again prompted by the Clerk of the Court, Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s associate either \u201credrafted,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 5, or \u201cran off,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2, yet another copy of the opposition for Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s signature. Again, neither court nor counsel received the elusive document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">The District Court finally set the motion for hearing at a status conference on February 27, 1985, three months after the motion to dismiss had been filed. Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s associate attended the status conference,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with a copy of the unfiled January 29th opposition and certificate of service (dated Jan. 30,1985) in hand, which he then personally furnished to opposing counsel. The attorney failed, however, to file the opposition with the District Court. No opposition ever having been received, no explanation for the delay ever having been provided, and no tenable defense to the statute of limitations defense having been interposed, the District Court treated the motion to dismiss as conceded under Local Rule l-9(d) and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Order, Civ. No. 84-2964 (Feb. 27, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-11\">In mid-April 1985, Mr. Solerwitz filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 60(b), contending that his failure to file an opposition had been \u201cunintentional and inexplicable,\u201d Motion to Reconsider at 10 (Apr. 16, 1985), the result of \u201claw office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>failure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. This motion was heard in June 1985. Although Mr. Solerwitz was himself a member of the District Court bar, the firm chose not to send one of its own attorneys to the hearing, but instead retained local counsel in the District of Columbia to argue the motion. The local attorney offered argument on the underlying merits of Mr. Lepkowski\u2019s cause of action, Transcript at 5 (June 28, 1985), and on the reasons for the post-dismissal delay in seeking reconsideration, <em>id. </em>at 6, but never advanced any explanation for Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s neglect, as sole counsel of record, to file any response to the dismissal motion, other than to observe that \u201c[h]e is a busy lawyer, who had an associate who was assigned to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-4\">This continuing course of conduct has nowhere been justified in the record. Mr. Solerwitz describes his failure to respond to a motion to dismiss his client\u2019s complaint as merely an \u201cirregular presentation,\u201d Motion to Reconsider at 11. But, in truth, it was no presentation at all. Mr. Solerwitz has never, to this day, filed an opposition with the District C\u00f3urt; it appears in the record as an appendix to the Motion for Reconsideration. Although counsel was aware of his own default throughout the entire period, and indeed received repeated notice to that effect from the court, he failed to exert the minimal effort which would have cured his omission. Mr. Solerwitz readily concedes that the failure to respond was strictly due to the neglect of his office, yet he claims that his lack of attention in this matter was excusable. The only \u201cexcuse\u201d offered, however, has been the reiteration of the protracted derelictions of counsel. Not a word of explanation nor a justification for the manifest negligence in this chroniele of events has been forthcoming. Mr. Solerwitz does indeed go to great lengths to explain why the Motion to Reconsider was not unduly delayed; this, however, is scarcely relevant to the point at hand and cannot do service as a justification for the failure to respond in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">On this record, we are unable to say that the District Court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion rose to the level of an abuse of discretion. It was well within the bounds of the court\u2019s permissible discretion to find that Mr. Lepkowski\u2019s counsel had riot even attempted to demonstrate that his dilatory failings were the product not of mere neglect but, rather, <em>excusable </em>neglect, for which his client should not be penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">In a recent decision, <em>Shea v. Donohoe Construction Co., </em>795 F.2d 1071 (D.C.Cir. 1986), this court has had occasion to analyze decisions in which excusable neglect was raised as the basis of either a direct appeal or a Rule 60(b) motion for reinstatement. Unlike <em>Shea, </em>this is not a case in which dismissal reflected an exercise of the court\u2019s inherent power to control its docket. <em>See also Instantwhip v. Aeration Processes, Inc., </em>797 F.2d 1093 (D.C.Cir.1986) (dismissal at pretrial conference was improper discovery sanction; no violation of a court rule or court order). Rather, a neutral rule of general application required a response to a motion within ten days. Dismissal under such a neutral rule is by no means an ad hoc sanction for misconduct; in such situations, violation of the rule itself indicates prejudice to an already overburdened system of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">In this case, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss challenged the very timeliness of Mr. Lepkowski\u2019s complaint. The Local Rule gave notice to the world that failure to respond within the prescribed time could be treated by the trial court as a concession of the motion. Moreover, as we have seen, the District Court did not act precipitously, but to the contrary, took steps to ensure that the litigation process could get back on track, repeatedly attempting to pry out an opposition to the motion. Through his continued silence, Mr. Solerwitz conceded this legal issue. In pursuing reopening of the judgment, no showing was made that the client was misled by counsel as to the status of his case or even that he was unaware of his counsel\u2019s action. <em>Jackson v. Washington Monthly Co., </em>569 F.2d 119, 122 &amp; nn. 12, 16, 18 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>Finally, motions for relief under Rule 60(b) are not to be granted unless the movant can demonstrate a meritorious claim or defense; we cannot escape the fact that the complaint and the proposed opposition were insufficient as a matter of law to defeat the motion on the statute of limitations ground.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in denying relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">Our concurring colleague is troubled that our analysis embodies a form of mechanical jurisprudence which exalts the Local Rule to a role of unduly dispositive preeminence. We seek to allay these concerns for we have no such intent. To the contrary, we emphatically do not countenance the rigid imposition of the sanctions of dismissal, as an automatic or reflexive response to the violation of a neutral rule of general application. Indeed, we have carefully canvassed the entire record of this case and reviewed the totality of the circumstances leading up to the District Court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See supra </em>at 1311-12. It is based upon that comprehensive review, pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard, that we have arrived at the judgment that the District Judge acted appropriately under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">Nor do we take issue with the formidable body of case law so meticulously elaborated by our colleague.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>decisional law, however, is that each case must be analyzed on its own merits under an abuse of discretion standard. That is precisely what we have sought to do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"ApN\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">. Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfH\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-13\">(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1420-7\">. The order of dismissal on the merits, rendered on February 27, 1985, is not before us for review. That order was never appealed, and post-judgment motions under Rule 60(b) do not toll the time for appeal of the underlying judgment. <em>Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. at 560 n. 7. Moreover, the appeal of a Rule 60(b) disposition \"does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\" <em>Id.; Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, </em>473 F.2d 118, 124 n. 28 (D.C.Cir.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">. Despite the local rules governing appearances before the District Court, Mr. Solerwitz\u2019s associate was not a member of the bar of the court and did not seek admission <em>pro hoc vice </em>Local rules also require lawyers appearing before the court to have a local office; Mr. Solerwitz used a local address in signing the complaint, but both he and his associate practiced in New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">. Although no opposition had been filed, the District Court did entertain a brief argument on the merits by Government counsel which accurately summarized Mr. Lepkowski's response to the statute of limitations challenge. <em>See </em>Hearing Transcript at 5-6 (Feb. 27, 1985). The flaw in the proposed, unfiled opposition was that it did not set forth facts (or support any facts by affidavits or other material) as to when Mr. Lepkowski in fact received a letter from the Department of Treasury dated September 14, 1982, which at the very latest, put him on notice of any cause of action that he might have.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">. Our colleague emphasizes two cases from this circuit, which in our view, are entirely compatible with our totality-of-the-circumstances approach. In <em>Bibeau v. Northwest Airlines, </em>429 F.2d 212 (D.C.Cir.1970), for example, the court in overturning the District Court dismissal was influenced by the considerable trial preparations that had already been completed; that the dismissed plaintiffs were minor children; and, most important, that the rule permitting dismissal for want of prosecution required notice to the parties, yet such notice was never given. <em>Id. </em>at 213. There was thus a violation by the trial court of its own rule upon which the dismissal was purportedly based. <em>Compare Sheaffer v. Warehouse Employees Union, Local No. 730, </em>408 F.2d 204, 206 (D.C.Cir.) (dismissal upheld \"in view of the long history of procedural ineptness and delay\u201d and violations of local rules), <em>cert. denied </em>395 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 1996, 23 L.Ed.2d 449 (1969). As the <em>Sheaffer </em>court, speaking through Judge Tamm, indicated, we are to examine whether the trial judge\u2019s action was \u201cbased upon the particular history of the case.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 206. That is precisely what we have done in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">The richness of the case law from other circuits attests eloquently to the fact-specific nature of the appellate review function. Our colleague emphasizes the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ramsey v. Signal Delivery Service, </em>631 F.2d 1210 (1980), as \u201cstrikingly similar to.the one now before us.\u201d Concurring Opinion at 1316. But <em>Ramsey </em>did not involve, as here, the painstaking efforts undertaken by the District Court to obtain a responsive filing from the plaintiffs counsel in order to bring the litigation to a point ripe for resolution. From all that appears in <em>Ramseys </em>abbreviated, one-paragraph description of the pertinent facts, 631 F.2d at 1214, the trial judge employed the rigidly mechanical approach that our concurring colleague rightly denounces. In <em>Boughner v. Secretary of HEW, </em>572 F.2d 976 (3rd Cir.1978), on the other hand, an elaborate showing was made that the prior counsel in the case had failed to file responsive pleadings in 52 similar cases (involving claims for benefits under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act). That showing, the Third Circuit found, was \u201csufficiently exceptional and extraordinary to mandate relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978. In stark contrast, no such showing has ever been attempted, much less made, in the case at hand. <em>Witt v. United States, </em>681 F.2d 1144 (9th Cir. 1982), likewise invoked by our brother, involved a <em>pro se </em>litigant whose case was dismissed for failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Wifi's pertinent facts, as in <em>Boughner, </em>are set forth in the space of a bare-bones, solitary paragraph. Nonetheless, from what appears in that skeletal rendition of facts, there was in <em>Witt </em>no indication whatever that the District Court, as here, sought to elicit the required filing from the litigant. Moreover, it appears that the <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s legal position had been fully set forth in the complaint, itself, thereby suggesting that the District Court was reflexively enforcing the Local Rule for its own sake, rather than to promote the ends of justice. Needless to say, such unthinking, blind enforcement could, we believe, work an abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>cretion. In this case, of course, Lepkowski filed no such statement of position; what is more, his unfiled opposition is so lacking in persuasive force that our colleague is willing to opine that \"Lepkowski\u2019s claim has little or no chance of surviving the dismissed-motion's objection that it became time-barred.\u201d Concurring Opinion at 1321. The fact of the weakness of Lepkowski's position on the statute of limitations defense, we again observe, <em>see supra </em>note 4, was brought before the District Court during the course of the final hearing. That fact was thus part of the totality of the circumstances that moved the District Court to dismiss the case, a result which our colleague, like we, would sustain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Axob\">. <em>Id. </em>at 1313.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1423-6\">SP0TTSW00D W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ach\">concurring in the judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">Today\u2019s majority opinion leaves me more than just a little unsure as to what it decides. My colleagues seem first to espouse the novel legal theory that Rule 1-9(d) of the District Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in permitting a motion to dismiss to be treated as conceded absent a timely opposition, removes any need for broader consideration of the propriety of a dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[Violation of the rule,\u201d they say, \u201citself indicates prejudice to an already overburdened system of litigation,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which may itself be enough to justify riddance of the transgressor\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Invocation of this \u201cneutral rule of general application\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would thus displace an exercise of judicial discretion determining whether, under all circumstances relevant, the judicial process should be vindicated by imposing a sanction on a delinquent lawyer rather than by dismissal of the suit of his apparently blameless client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">My colleagues then execute what looks to me like an about-face. They disavow any purpose to elevate the rule \u201cto a role of unduly dispositive preeminence,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and insist that they \u201cemphatically do not countenance the rigid imposition of the sanction of dismissal as an automatic or reflective response to the violation of a neutral rule of general application.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Disposition of the appeal, they say, rests upon a measure of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances leading up to the District Court\u2019s dismissal\u201d by \u201can abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">Were it up to me, I would put two matters completely to rest. First, I would hold that any attempt to herald rule-violation dismissals as unfailingly appropriate is simply unsupportable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, viewing dismissal of Lepkowski\u2019s action as an exercise of discretion, I would conclude that dismissal was so drastic a measure as to constitute an abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the end, however, I am satisfied that Lepkowski\u2019s defense to the motion to dismiss is too anemic to warrant a reopening of the order of dismissal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, and solely for the latter reason, I concur in affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-19\">There already is binding precedent in this circuit for the proposition that a dismissal for infraction of a local rule designed to curtail delay in litigation of claims may involve an abuse of judicial discretion. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number><em>Bibeau v. Northeast Airlines, </em>Inc.,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we reversed the District Court\u2019s refusal to reinstate a wrongful death action terminated under a local rule providing for dismissal for failure of a plaintiff actively to prosecute her claim for six months.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While \u201cwe recognize[d] and wholeheartedly approve[d] of the District Court\u2019s justifiable interest in eliminating the \u2018dead wood\u2019 from its calendar^]\u201d we admonished that \u201cat the same time the interests of justice require that the dereliction of counsel should not uniformly bar plaintiffs with valid claims from recovery through an inflexible application of the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And \u201c[w]hile it [was] within the discretion of the District Court to deny a motion to reinstate a case which has been dismissed for lack of prosecution,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we held, in light of the cumulative weight of the circumstances, that the bounds of discretion had been exceeded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">In <em>Sheaffer v. Warehouse Employees Union Local </em>730,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we gave a local rule somewhat greater prominence in an involuntary dismissal, yet our ruling was bottomed on the District Court's exercise of discretion, as distinguished from a bare application of the rule. For more than four years, the case had been handled in the District Court \u201cin an extremely dilatory fashion,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> accentuated by \u201cnumerous violations of our local court rules and pretrial orders, and a complete lack of diligence in bringing the case to trial <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and eventually was dismissed for want of prosecution. In affirming, we called attention to the local rule involved in Bibeau,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and said that it had \u201clegal efficacy and should be enforced.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Our affirmance, however, was predicated, not on the rule,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but rather on the District Court\u2019s inherent power to dismiss for lack of prosecution.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201c[N]o abuse of discretion occurred here,\u201d we said, \u201cin view of the long history of procedural ineptness and delay on the part of appellants.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">Cases from other circuits adhere virtually uniformly to this treatment: that dismissal pursuant to a local rule of this nature demands nonetheless an exercise of judicial discretion that is reversible for abuse. In <em>Ramsey v. Signal Delivery </em>Service,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a case strikingly similar to the one now before us, the plaintiffs did not respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss within the ten-day limit set by local rule, which further provided that such an omission would indicate that there was no opposition. The District Court, after waiting almost three months for the response, grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>ed the motion as unopposed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> On appeal, this disposition was held to be erroneous despite the authority purportedly conferred by the rule.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court said that \u201c \u2018[b]efore a trial judge dismisses a complaint with prejudice, there should be a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct, and a finding that lesser sanctions would not serve the system of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court was particularly concerned by the failure of the District Court to consider lesser sanctions<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and held that in any event \u201c[t]he three-month delay between the filing of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and entry of judgment against plaintiffs did not constitute the type of extreme delay\u201d justifying dismissal.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\">Similarly, in <em>Boughner v. Secretary of </em>HEW,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> a local rule accorded ten days for responses to motions and specified that \u201c[a]ny respondent who fails to comply with this rule shall be deemed not to oppose such motion.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, through negligence of their attorney, did not oppose summary judgment motions in timely fashion, and the motions were granted. On appeal, the Third Circuit was \u201cnot unmindful of the need for judicial eagerness to expedite cases, to fully utilize the court\u2019s time, to reduce overcrowded calendars and to establish finality of judgments,\u201d but reversed with the observation that \u201cthese commendable aspirations should never be used to thwart the objectives of the blind goddess.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-18\"><em>Witt v. United Stated</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is yet another example of disapproval of mechanical application of a local dismissal rule. The plaintiff\u2019s <em>pro se </em>suit was dismissed when he neglected to file a memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit noted, however, that the case had been filed only three months previously and that nothing in the record suggested that alternative sanctions had been considered.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u201cUnder these circumstances,\u201d the court held, \u201cthe dismissal ... was an abuse of discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-19\">Other decisions reach much the same conclusion.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Even when appellate courts have upheld dismissals under local rules, they have subjected the ruling to abuse-of-discretion criteria.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Cases involving noncompliance with court orders rather than court rules are reviewed under these standards as well.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The unavoidable conclusion is that the presence of a local rule or a specific order setting time limits for procedural activity does not alter significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>the body of well-settled principles governing review of dismissals for tardiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">More fundamentally, any notion that omission of a timely procedural step always justifies the grant of a motion to dismiss is totally at odds with the doctrinal foundation of involuntary dismissal for want of prosecution. From ancient times, courts have invoked this sanction as a means of curbing undue delay in the disposition of litigation and resulting congestion in their calendars.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Authority to do so, the Supreme Court instructs, \u201chas generally been considered an \u2018inherent power\u2019 governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> So, while Federal Civil Rule 41(b)<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> partly codifies this authority<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and local district court rules attest its wide usage,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> they are but manifestations, not sources, of the power.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The absence of a local rule on the subject does not preclude dismissal,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> nor can the existence of such a local rule expand the power beyond its accustomed limits.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Dismissal of a lawsuit \u2014 a drastic step \u2014 must rest on acceptable grounds, and a local rule purporting to authorize dismissal on less than what Rule 41(b) and its historical forerunners demand is beyond the power of the court promulgating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-12\">It is vitally important to appreciate that the authority to dismiss for want of prosecution is simply the prerogative to do so if and when the facts of the case warrant that course. It is universally held that such a dismissal implicates the discretion of the court<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and is reversible for abuse.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>All pertinent circumstances in the particular case must be examined and weighed in determining whether dismissal is the appropriate course.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The necessarily limited purview of the local rule before us is obviously incompatible with the wide lens of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">My colleagues assert that' violation of the rule \u201citself indicates prejudice to an already overburdened system of litigation,\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> thereby implying that nothing else in the case is worthy of consideration. To be sure, we reminded very recently that procrastination in the prosecution of litigation may \u201cput an intolerable burden on a district court by requiring the court to modify its own docket and operations in order to accommodate the delay.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> But the impact of which we spoke is one \u201crequirfing] the court to expend considerable judicial resources in the future in addition to those it has already wasted, thereby inconveniencing many other innocent litigants in the presentation of <em>their </em>cases ...;\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and, even then, any sanction is to follow as the product of an exercise of discretion,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> not a blind adherence to a text insensitive to circumstances and consequences. Every dereliction causing delay drains judicial resources to some degree and makes its own contribution to calendar congestion, but it does not necessarily follow that dismissal is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">This is not to say that the court must tolerate procrastination by attorneys and the impositions it visits upon courts and the legal system they administer. It is to say only that these burdens must be balanced against the harshness of involuntary dismissal of a litigant\u2019s case. Ofttimes the judicial process can be vindicated by sanctioning the blameworthy lawyer and not the innocent client. The problem is not whether there should be vindication, but how.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">Because I believe that the District Court\u2019s local rule is not entitled to any special significance in our review of the disposition of Lepkowski\u2019s case, I would resolve this facet of the appeal by resort to the principles articulated in the many decisions, in this circuit and elsewhere, dealing with involuntary dismissals for some lack in prosecution. Any canvass of these decisions \u2014 even a modest one \u2014 reveals the great reluctance of the courts to punish clients for their attorneys\u2019 misdeeds absent some paramount concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\"><em>Jackson v. Washington Monthly </em>Co.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> spoke to the anomaly of \u201c[dismissals for misconduct attributable to lawyers and in no wise to their clients[,] [which] invariably penalize the innocent and may let the guilty off scot-free.\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> There under review was a dismissal with prejudice based largely on the failure of the plaintiffs counsel to report on settlement progress as directed by the District Court. We recognized the central role of judicial discretion in decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>on sanctions,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> but warned that \u201ca sound discretion hardly comprehends a pointless exaction of retribution.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We said that \u201c[w]hen the client has not personally misbehaved and his opponent in the litigation has not been harmed, the interests of justice are better served by an exercise of discretion in favor of appropriate action against the lawyer as the medium for vindication of the judicial process and protection of the citizenry from future imposition.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Our subsequent decisions have often reiterated these observations.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Even where we have affirmed dismissals, we have been solicitous of the client\u2019s welfare, insisting upon some fault of his own, some prejudice to his opponent, some threat to the efficiency of the judicial process or some need for deterrence of similar misbehavior in the future.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Other circuits are in harmony and have required similar demonstrations.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> There is no reason for dishonoring these established principles here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">As just indicated, a point may be reached at which a party, though innocent of any personal fault, may be held bound by the misdoings of his attorney. <em>Link v. Wabash </em>Railroad<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> declared that, even when confronted by the prospect of a dismissal not of his own making, a litigant who has voluntarily chosen his counsel cannot \u201cavoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> <em>Link, </em>however, had been pending for more' than six years<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and involved a history of deliberate procrastination by the litigant\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Court was careful to note that the dismissal had been predicated \u201con <em>all </em>\u201d the circumstances that were brought to the judge\u2019s attention, including the earlier delays caused by counsel.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The Court specifically left undecided \u201cwhether unexplained absence from a pretrial conference would <em>alone </em>justify a dismissal with prejudice if the record showed no other evidence of dilatoriness on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">Certainly the performance of Lepkowski\u2019s counsel respecting an opposition to the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss is shocking, but that is not the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>inquiry.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> There remains the question whether, all circumstances considered, dismissal as the sanction was so severe as to venture beyond the limits of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">Approximately two months after Lepkowski\u2019s suit was filed, his adversaries moved to dismiss on the ground that it was barred by a statutory limitation. In contrast to <em>Link\u2019s </em>six-year history of procedure al skirmishing,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Lepkowski\u2019s action was barely five months old when the District Court decreed its demise. Lepkowski\u2019s counsel caused at most a delay of three months, with no irremediable prejudice to his opponents. Nothing suggests that the failure to respond to the motion was deliberate rather than incredibly negligent, nor is there any indication that Lepkowski contributed to or knew \u2014 or even now knows\u2014 of his attorney\u2019s derelictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Since the District Court expressly based its dismissal solely on the concession the local rule purports to furnish, one cannot be sure about what other circumstances, if any, were taken into account when the ruling under review was made. But the total absence from the District Court\u2019s hearings of any mention of an available lesser sanction<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> renders highly improbable consideration of such an alternative as a means of vindicating the judicial system and deterring delinquence while preserving the claim of a guiltless litigant. Were this all to the case, I would vacate the order of dismissal and remand the case for reconsideration of a sanction appropriate under orthodox principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">While I do not subscribe to the central theses advanced by my colleagues, I do join in affirmance of the dismissal of Lepkowski\u2019s suit for a different reason, and for that reason only. By my assessment, Lepkowski\u2019s claim has little or no chance of ultimately surviving the dismissal-motion\u2019s objection that it became time-barred before it was asserted in the District Court.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>Lepkowski is a former employee of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He was discharged, seemingly in 1982 on grounds of misconduct, and litigation seeking his reinstatement has gone for naught.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> His complaint in the instant case alleges that pursuant to his written request on August 23, 1982, he was allowed to examine the report of an IRS investigation of his on-the-job behavior, and thereupon learned that photographs and related workpapers were missing therefrom.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The complaint further avers that by letter dated September 14, 1982, IRS for the first time informed him that the missing items had been destroyed.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The record discloses that on September 24, 1984, Lepkowski filed in the District Court his complaint<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> maintaining that destruction of these parts of the investigative file defied the command of the Privacy Act of 1974<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> that each covered agency \u201cmaintain all records which are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The Act confers upon an affected individual a right of action for failure to observe this requirement,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> and Lepkowski\u2019s complaint sought injunctive relief and damages.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-14\">A motion to dismiss challenged Lepkowski\u2019s action as untimely under the terms of the Act.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> If that position is correct, disposition of the case is removed from the ambit of judicial discretion into an area in which the legislature has already expressed its will. I think Lepkowski\u2019s showing is far too meager to establish that he has any meritorious defense to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-15\">Any supplication for relief from a judgment, much like a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution, calls for a sound exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Courts thus have demanded, as a precondition to relief of that nature, demonstration of a good claim or defense in order to avoid needless protraction of th\u00e9 litigation.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Not only must a petitioner for review under Rule 60(b) meet the strictures set forth in that rule; he must also show that his position in the underlying contest is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-16\">The Privacy Act specifies, with an exception plainly inapposite here, that an action to enforce any liability created thereunder must be brought \u201cwithin two years from the date on which the cause of action arises____\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Lepkowski\u2019s cause of action accrued no later than the date upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>he received IRS\u2019 letter of September 14, 1982, apprising him of destruction of the photographs and associated workpapers. As has been noted, however, Lepkowski\u2019s suit was not filed until two years and ten days after the date of that letter. As to this, the most that has ever been offered in Lepkowski\u2019s behalf is the argument that a September 14 mailing of the letter<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> does not establish that it was received prior to September 24.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Well-settled principles constrain me to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">Deposits of properly-addressed postage-prepaid matter in the mail are presumed to have been delivered to the addressee,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> and to have reached him in due course of the mail.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> That governmental mail posted in the District of Columbia is regularly delivered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, within nine days or less is a fact hardly open to dispute.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Moreover, it is firmly established that failure of a party to bring forth evidence within his control warrants an inference that the evidence is unfavorable to his cause.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Only Lepkowski could know positively just when the letter arrived, and if indeed it did so more than nine days after mailing, it was easy enough for his counsel to have said so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">. \u201cWithin ten days of the date of service or such other time as the court may direct, an opposing party shall serve and file a statement of points and authorities in opposition to the motion, together with a proposed order.

I suggest, however, that the rule cannot be removed from the mainstream of involuntary dismissal for want of prosecution. It makes no difference whether authority to promulgate the rule is attributed to the court's inherent power or to the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) since each summons an exercise of judicial discretion.

The attack on the dismissal under scrutiny might superficially be viewed as one predicted procedurally on \"excusable neglect\u201d under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). Concededly, Lepkowski\u2019s counsel was negligent; under <em>Link, </em>that negligence is imputable to Lepkowski; and, on the record as it now stands, it was totally inexcusable. Nonetheless, it does not follow that Rule 60(b) is unavailable as the procedural vehicle for setting the dismissal aside. Indeed, the <em>Link </em>Court itself left open the question whether denial of a Rule 60(b) motion accompanied by a more adequate explanation for the absence of Link\u2019s attorney from the pretrial conference would have constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Link v. Wabash R.R., supra </em>note 41, 370 U.S. at 635-36, 82 S.Ct. at 1391, 8 L.Ed.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">In my view, Rule 60(b)(1) need not be considered at all. Rule 60(b)(6), authorizing relief from the operation of a judgment or order for any \"other reason justifying [it],\u201d \"vests power in courts adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\u201d <em>Klapprott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 614-15, 69 S.Ct. 384, 390, 93 L.Ed. 266, 277, <em>modified in another respect, </em>336 U.S. 942, 69 S.Ct. 398, 93 L.Ed. 1099 (1949). We have heretofore held that Rule 60(b)(6) is applicable when counsel has been grossly negligent and has misled the client on that score. <em>Jackson v. Washington Monthly Co., supra </em>note 56, 186 U.S.App.D.C. at 291-92, 569 F.2d at 122-23; <em>L.P. Steuart, Inc. v. Matthews, </em>117 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 280-81, 329 F.2d 234, 235-36 (1964). The mutual exclusivity of Rules 60(b)(1) and (6) does not affect a situation of that kind since more than neglect of counsel is involved. I cannot meaningfully distinguish a situation in which gross neglect of counsel is coupled with complete ignorance thereof by a client who is kept totally in the dark and has no reason to inquire or suspect. In each instance, there is a highly unusual turn of events which the client cannot reasonably be expected to have anticipated and from which he is powerless to protect himself.

Cirami, </em>563 F.2d 26, 35 (2d Cir.1977); <em>Boughner </em>v. <em>Secretary of HEW, supra </em>note 31, 572 F.2d at 978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">. <em>Link v.
