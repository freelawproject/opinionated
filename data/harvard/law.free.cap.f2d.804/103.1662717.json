Francis, on her claim that the Secretary had improperly computed her past benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-22\">The district court referred Francis\u2019 claim to a magistrate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). The magistrate recommended that judgment be entered for Francis. The Secretary failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s report despite clear warning from the magistrate that to do so would bar his right to appeal the district court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court entered summary judgment for Francis on the basis of the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-23\">On appeal, the Secretary argues, alternatively, that he is not barred from review because (1) there is no \u201cwaiver\u201d rule to be found in either the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decisions or the local rules, and (2) even if such a rule exists, the facts of this case justify excusing his failure to object. Finally, the Secretary argues that the merits are controlled by <em>McKenzie v. Bowen, </em>787 F.2d 1216 (8th Cir.1986), which was resolved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>his favor. We reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In 1968, Congress enacted the Federal Magistrate\u2019s Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-639, \u201cto cull from the ever-growing workload of the U.S. district courts matters that are more desirably performed by a lower tier of judicial officers.\u201d H.R. 1629, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4252, 4255. In 1976, Congress amended \u00a7 101 of the Act. The amendment permits the United States district court judges to refer dispositive pretrial motions and petitions for writs of habeas corpus to a magistrate. Pub.L. 94-577, 90 Stat. 2729. Upon referral, the magistrate conducts appropriate proceedings and recommends dispositions. <em>Id. </em>Parties disagreeing with the magistrate\u2019s recommendation may then \u201cserve and file written objections\u201d to the report in order to obtain a de novo review by the district court judge. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C). The Act allows ten days for the filing of these objections with the district court judge. <em>Id. </em>The language of the statute does not, however, indicate that failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s recommendation will be an absolute bar to appeal from the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Lorin Corp. v. Goto &amp; Co., </em>700 F.2d 1202, 1206 (8th Cir.1983). <em>See also Messimer v. Lockhart, </em>702 F.2d 729, 730-31 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In <em>Thomas v. Am, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985), the Supreme Court held that the courts of appeals may adopt a rule conditioning an appeal from a district court\u2019s judgment adopting a magistrate\u2019s recommendation upon the filing of objections with the district court identifying those issues on which further review is desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In <em>Nash v. Black, </em>781 F.2d 665, 667 (8th Cir.1986), we summarized our holdings in <em>Lorin Corp. </em>and <em>Messimer, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">[A] plaintiff has not waived his right to appeal by failing to object when the questions involved are questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact, or when neither the local court rule nor the magistrate\u2019s notice has clearly informed the plaintiff that failure to object to the magistrate\u2019s report will result in waiver of the right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Because Francis\u2019 case involves only a question of law, we hold that the Secretary\u2019s appeal should proceed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Both parties now agree that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>McKenzie v. Bowen, supra, </em>controls the outcome of this case. Francis offers no arguments to counter the Secretary\u2019s contention that <em>McKenzie </em>resolves the issues in his favor. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the case to the district court with directions to enter judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-14\">. The following language appeared in the magistrate\u2019s recommended order following her signature: \u201d... Failure to comply with this provision shall operate as a forfeiture of the objecting party\u2019s right to seek review in the court of appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Thomas </em>found no distinction between failure to object to rulings of law or those of fact. The Court rejected Thomas\u2019 contention that the obligatory filings of objections extended only to findings of fact, holding that \u201cthe plain language of the Act recognizes no such distinction between questions of law or fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">The Court in <em>Thomas </em>held, however, only that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule was not <em>prohibited </em>by the Act. <em>Thomas, </em>106 S.Ct. at 472. The question whether the Act <em>mandated </em>such a procedural bar was left open. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it appears that the courts of appeals are free to adopt their own supervisory rules. The law/fact distinction, reaffirmed in <em>Nash, </em>is therefore not inconsistent with <em>Thomas.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
