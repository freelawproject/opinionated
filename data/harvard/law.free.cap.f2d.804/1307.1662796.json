United States Lines, </em>616 F.Supp. 613, 619 (E.D.N.Y.1985), <em>ajfd and modified, </em>792 F.2d 19 (2d Gir.1986). Safir, acting <em>pro se, </em>has brought a variety of actions against various subsidized shipping companies collectively known as the Atlantic and Gulf American Flag Berth Operators (\u201cAGAFBO\u201d), seeking to redress injuries inflicted upon him by predatory pricing behavior against his company. The tortuous history of this litigation need not be repeated here. <em>See, e.g., Safir v. United States Lines, </em>792 F.2d at 20-22; <em>Safir v. Kreps, </em>551 F.2d 447, 449-50 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 820, 98 S.Ct. 60, 54 L.Ed.2d 76 (1977); <em>Safir v. Gibson, </em>417 F.2d 972, 974-75 (2d Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 850, 91 S.Ct. 57, 27 L.Ed.2d 88 (1970). Although he has enjoyed an occasional success, the vast majority of Safir\u2019s claims arising out of the events of 1965-66 have been repeatedly rejected by the courts. <em>Safir v. United States Lines, </em>792 F.2d at 24. These appeals arise from two District Courts\u2019 affirmances of separate Bankruptcy Courts\u2019 dismissals, with awards of attorneys\u2019 fees, of involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed by Safir against American President Lines, Ltd. (\u201cAPL\u201d) and Farrell Lines, Inc. (\u201cFarrell\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">Safir\u2019s theory in opening a new front in his decades-old battle against the shipping companies is that because these companies may be found liable to him for \u201cgargantuan\u201d sums in related litigation, he must take steps to protect his rights as a potential creditor before they fraudulently dissipate their assets. Prior to involving his targets in involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, Safir has, without success, requested from the courts similar <em>pendente lite </em>relief, seeking to enjoin the sale of ships, stock, and other assets. He has also sought to have the proceeds of such sales placed in escrow, to enjoin a stockholders\u2019 meeting and to enjoin the government from paying subsidies and from approving a sale of one company\u2019s stock. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">At the heart of Safir\u2019s bankruptcy action is his claim that a multi-million dollar judgment in his favor is imminent. Therein, however, lies the rub. No such windfall has even been hinted at by any court; Safir\u2019s reliance on language in an opinion of this court holding that he had standing to bring an action to compel the United States Government to recover subsidies paid to members cf. AGAFBO, because as a potential competitor of AGAFBO Safir would \u201cprofit\u201d from the government\u2019s recovery of subsidy payments, <em>see Safir v. Kreps, </em>551 F.2d at 451, offers no sustenance for his belief that money is due him. The court clearly stated that the benefit to Safir would come to him, if at all, as a competitor of those shipping lines forced to return large sums of money to the government. Nothing in that standing opinion suggested that Safir was personally entitled to any money beyond what he had already recovered in earlier litigation. Moreover, six years later another panel of this court ruled that there was no longer any genuine likelihood Safir would reenter the shipping business and become a competitor of AGAFBO and thus he had no standing in the subsidy recovery litigation. <em>Safir v. Dole, </em>718 F.2d 475, 480-81 (D.C.Cir.1983). The court was \u201cconfident in saying that at least it is not likely this money, if recovered by the government, will find its way into plaintiff\u2019s hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-12\">Even prior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Safir v. Dole, </em>and more so in light of it, Safir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>has been unable to persuade a court that he is the holder of a cognizable claim against APL or Farrell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His allegations in the bankruptcy forum take on an even more disturbing tone when we note that neither APL nor Farrell was ever found liable, even to the government, for any subsidy refunds. The Maritime Administration and the Secretary of Commerce con-eluded .that APL and Farrell were merely \u201ctechnical violators\u201d of \u00a7 810 of the Merchant Marine Act, as they had never been in direct competition with Safir, <em>see Investigation of Alleged Section 810 Violations, </em>13 Shipping Reg.Rep. (P &amp; F) 809 (Maritime Subsidy Bd.1973); <em>Safir v. Dole, </em>718 F.2d at 478, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Safir\u2019s propensity to relitigate the same issues over and over is without parallel. In attempting to drag appellees into bankruptcy court to block business transactions he has been unable to reach in other forums, he has abused the powerful legal weapon that an involuntary petition offers bona fide creditors. Section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code explicitly and clearly prescribes the requirements for commencing an involuntary case under Chapter 7: it is initiated by the filing of a petition \u201cby three or more entities, each of which is either a <em>holder of a claim against such person that is not contingent as to liability or the subject o[fl a bona fide dispute, </em>or an indenture trustee representing such a holder.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b)(1) (emphasis added). Whatever Safir\u2019s own view of his prospect for eventual success in litigation seeking money from the shipping companies, he can hardly contend that his claim is neither contingent nor the subject of a bona fide dispute. However misguided his initial venture into bankruptcy court, his subsequent appeals can only be viewed as irresponsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s characterization of the action against Farrell as frivolous. We further agree with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that the petition was not filed in good faith. We hereby affirm the District Court and the Bankruptcy Court in No. 85-6049 in their dismissal of Safir\u2019s petition on the grounds that he is not a creditor of Farrell under \u00a7 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also find Safir\u2019s appeal in No. 84-5228 to be wholly without merit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and affirm the courts below in their dismissal of Safir\u2019s petition against APL on similar grounds, and for Safir\u2019s failure to comply with the Bankruptcy Rules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 both authorize appellate courts to impose sanctions on appellants and their counsel for filing frivolous appeals. <em>See Holmes v. District of Columbia, </em>801 F.2d 1371 (D.C.Cir.1986); <em>Mathes v. Commissioner, </em>788 F.2d 33, 35 (D.C.Cir.1986). In consequence we grant, in part, appellee Farrell\u2019s motion for double costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, in the amount of $500 against Safir on this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With respect to No. 84-5228, we abstain from assessing monetary sanctions at this time because APL has expressly declined to request them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">We are aware of the fact that Safir has failed to pay other such judgments for costs,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that monetary sanctions alone may be insufficient to put an end to his vexatious litigation. The District Court has suggested that we take action to prevent future recurrences of this kind, along the lines of an injunction granted by a New York district court. We believe, however, that relief of the sort awarded in <em>Safir v. United States Lines, </em>616 F.Supp. 619 (E.D. N.Y.1985), <em>aff\u2019d and modified, </em>792 F.2d 19 (2d Cir.1986), comes more appropriately following a hearing on the proper contours of such an injunction. We sincerely hope Safir will heed our warning to bring this harassment of appellees and abuse of this court\u2019s processes to an end, but in the event he does not, we respectfully remind the District Court of its authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) to enjoin further abuse of the judicial process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">. Safir\u2019s most recent attempts to collect money from APL, Farrell and other shipping lines, alleging an implied right of action for restitution under \u00a7 810 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227, were rejected, and resulted in an injunction being issued against him. <em>Safir v. United States Lines, </em>616 F.Supp. 613 (E.D.N.Y.1985), <em>aff'd and modified, </em>792 F.2d 19 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">. Safir\u2019s petition was also deficient in that it failed to comply with the three-creditor requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303. The Bankruptcy Court denied him the opportunity to solicit other creditors after the filing of the petition because it ruled that as a matter of law, Safir was not a creditor. Moreover, even under the \"good faith\u201d exception that some courts have recognized to the three-creditor requirement, <em>i.e., </em>a creditor who acted under the good faith but mistaken belief that the debtor had fewer than twelve creditors may amend the petition and join two more creditors, <em>see, e.g., In re Alta Title, </em>55 B.R. 133 (Bankr.D.Utah 1985), Safir must fail. Any reasonable person would have presumed that a shipping company like Farrell would have more than twelve creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1417-12\">. This court reserved for itself the prerogative of determining whether Safir's appeal was frivolous and whether it merited sanctions under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. <em>See In re American President Lines, Inc., </em>779 F.2d 714, 717 (D.C.Cir.1985). Safir\u2019s representations to the contrary notwithstanding, <em>see </em>Application for Extension of Time in Which to File Petition for Certiorari, <em>Safir v. United States Lines, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 19 (2d Cir.1986), this court never indicated or implied that such claims were \"serious and substantive (non-frivplous).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1417-13\">. The District Court dismissed with prejudice Safir\u2019s appeal citing his noncompliance with the requirements of Bankruptcy Rule 8006, which requires the timely service of a designation of items to be included in the record and a statement of the issues to be presented on appeal. Bankruptcy Rule 8001(a) authorizes dismissal of an appeal for noncompliance with Bankruptcy Rule 8006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-14\">Safir\u2019s petition against APL was deficient for failing to comply with the three-creditor requirement as well. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">. While we know that $500 does not likely cover the appellee\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, that sum is recoverable through forfeiture of the bond Safir was required to post on appeal. His allegedly indigent status together with the likelihood that a grant of full attorneys\u2019 fees would involve this court in another round of litigation about the precise amount of such fees make it seem more sensible to limit the fees to the bond amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"ANcG\">. In addition to the petitions against Farrell and APL, Safir filed two other involuntary bankruptcy petitions against other shipping companies. Both were dismissed and attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded to defendants. <em>See </em>In re Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., No. 83-289 (Bankr.D.D.C. Dec. 7, 1983) (awarding $23,686.77); In re Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., No. 83-290 (Bankr.D. D.C. Dec. 7, 1983) (awarding $25,888.75). Safir, insisting he is penniless and unemployed, has not paid these judgments. <em>Safir v. U.S. Lines, </em>616 F.Supp. at 618.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
