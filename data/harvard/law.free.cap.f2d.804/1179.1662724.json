We agree with appellant\u2019s contentions and, accordingly, remand the claim for further consideration of appellant\u2019s eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">Appellant applied for Social Security disability insurance and supplemental security income on the basis of alleged disability as of September 1983. She claimed disability as a result of hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis, as well as secondary infirmities resulting from these diseases. Appellant was 53 years old at the time of her application. She previously had been employed as a farm laborer, but had not worked since 1974. She had received social security benefits from 1975 through 1983 because of diabetes and kidney ailments, but these benefits were terminated in 1983. She did not appeal the termination in a timely fashion and subsequently filed the application now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">The Administrative Law Judge who reviewed her case determined that appellant did not have a \u201csevere impairment\u201d as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He thus did not continue evaluating the application under the sequential steps provided by the regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In concluding that appellant\u2019s impairments were not severe, the AU found that appellant\u2019s diabetes and hypertension were controllable, that the failure to control these diseases was the result of appellant\u2019s refusal to follow prescribed treatment, and that appellant\u2019s claims of arthritic pain and other physical infirmities were not credible in light of objective medical findings. The AU thus concluded that appellant \u201chas the ability to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels.\u201d Although stating that the record would have justified a finding of entitlement to benefits, the district court upheld the conclusion as supported by substantial evidence. As the district court recognized, judicial review of the AU\u2019s determination is limited. We must uphold the decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1422, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Arnold v. Heckler, </em>732 F.2d 881, 883 (11th Cir. 1984). We thus may not substitute our own judgment for that of the AU. Nevertheless, a reviewing court is under a duty to examine the record as a whole to ensure that the decision is supported by \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perales, </em>91 S.Ct. at 1427 (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). A reviewing court may not look \u201conly to those parts of the record which support the AU,\u201d but instead \u201cmust view the entire record and take account of evidence in the record which detracts from the evidence relied on by the AU.\u201d <em>Tieniber v. Heckler, </em>720 F.2d 1251, 1253 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Cir.1983). The decision of the ALJ need not be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, but it cannot stand with a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of support. <em>E.g., Flynn v. Heckler, </em>768 F.2d 1273 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">The rejection of the disability application here was based on the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant did not suffer from a \u201csevere disability\u201d as required by 20 C.F.R. 404.1806(c). For this conclusion to stand, we must find substantial support that the alleged impairment is \u201cmerely a slight abnormality with minimal effect on [the applicant\u2019s] general ability to work.\u201d <em>Flynn, </em>768 F.2d at 1273. Our examination of the record shows, however, that such a conclusion is based on the merest scintilla of evidence. None of the five doctors who examined appellant even remotedly suggested that she \u201chas the ability to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels,\u201d as was found by the ALJ. To reach this conclusion, the ALJ had to discount completely appellant\u2019s long history of hypertension and diabetes, for all the examining doctors indicated that these diseases imposed some limitations on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">The cornerstone of the ruling is thus the finding by the ALJ that appellant\u2019s hypertension and diabetes cannot be considered disabling because appellant has refused to follow prescribed treatment that would restore her ability to work. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1530. As none of the examining physicians stated that appellant has not followed treatment that would control her diseases, and appellant testified at her hearing that she follows the prescribed treatments as closely as her income will allow, the ALJ apparently arrived at his conclusion inferentially. He suggested that appellant\u2019s failure to lose a considerable amount of weight indicated that she was not adhering to the 1500-calorie-per-day diet prescribed for her. He similarly hinted at the hearing that a sudden improvement in appellant\u2019s blood pressure and blood sugar level during a hospitalization for acute hypertension indicated that she had not taken her medication properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">Perhaps, standing alone, this evidence would provide support sufficient to uphold the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant has not followed prescribed treatment. Here, however, this circumstantial evidence of nonadherence to treatment must be viewed in light of an explicit refutation of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion by the doctor who both prescribed the diet and treated appellant during her hospitalization. This doctor explained in a letter to the ALJ that the failure of the appellant to respond to treatment was caused not by her refusal to follow that treatment but by complications resulting from the combination of diseases afflicting appellant. The doctor stated that the medicine for appellant\u2019s arthritis exacerbates her hypertension and that the medicine for the hypertension complicates her problems with diabetes. The hypertension itself is controllable by medication, but organ damage caused by the hypertension makes it difficult to exercise and thus to lose weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">The opinion of a treating physician is to be given substantial weight in determining disability. <em>See Spencer on Behalf of Spencer v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 1090, 1093-94 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Wiggins, v. Schweiker, </em>679 F.2d 1387, 1389 (11th Cir. 1982). The ALJ here, however, chose to ignore the explanations regarding appellant\u2019s adherence to treatment offered by the very physician who prescribed the treatment. The ALJ stated that he rejected the treating physician\u2019s explanations because they were not supported by specific and complete clinical findings. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1526 (1986). He found particularly that the findings of examining consultants contradicted the treating physician\u2019s opinions of the severity both of appellant\u2019s arthritis and of her hypertension-related organ damage. Yet discrepancies regarding the severity of arthritis and organ damage in no way undermine the treating physician\u2019s explanation of the inability of the treatment he prescribed to control appellant\u2019s hypertension and diabetes. Even if the arthritis is not disabling in itself, the medication prescribed for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>treatment complicates the hypertension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Likewise, even if the hypertension is controllable by medication, that medication complicates the diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Finally and most significantly, the record is devoid of a finding by any physician that appellant\u2019s diabetes is controllable by medication, diet, or otherwise. The only evidence suggesting that the diabetes might be controlled is the decrease in appellant\u2019s blood sugar during her hospitalization. When the physician who treated appellant during that hospitalization expressly discounts the likelihood of controlling the diabetes due to complicating factors, a few days of successful treatment in the confines of a hospital does not provide substantial evidence that the disease is not disabling. This court has previously cautioned against rejecting the opinions of treating physicians in favor of the contrary conclusions of consultants who have merely examined an applicant\u2019s medical records. <em>Spencer, supra, </em>765 F.2d at 1094 (\u201c[Rjeports of physicians who do not examine the claimant, taken alone, do not constitute substantial evidence on which to base an administrative decision.\u201d). Here, however, the AU has rejected the opinions of the treating physician not even on the basis of a differing opinion expressed by another doctor, but rather because AU himself reached a different conclusion after viewing the medical records. Such circumstantial evidence cannot alone support a finding of a nonsevere disability in the face of an opposing conclusion by the treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Because the record does not contain substantial evidence to support the determination by the Administrative Law Judge that the diabetes and hypertension are not disabling because controllable, we REVERSE the decision of the district court and REMAND the case for further determinations regarding the elegibility of appellant for disability benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (1986) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-8\">(c) <em>You must have a severe impairment. </em>If you do not have any impairment(s) or combination of impairments which significantly limits your physical or mental ability to do basic work activities, we will find that you do not have a severe impairment and are, therefore, not disabled.

Although the consultants did not agree with the treating physician regarding the severity of appellant\u2019s arthritis, none suggested that appellant does not suffer from arthritis to some degree. The consulting physicians thus did not challenge the prescription of arthritis medication by the treating physician.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Au_\">.
