Hargrave, who was found guilty of first degree murder by a Florida jury and sentenced to death, presents three issues in this appeal from a federal district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus: (1) whether petitioner\u2019s eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment was violated (a) because the jury was not instructed that it could consider nonstatutory mitigating factors when rendering an advisory sentence, (b) because petitioner\u2019s counsel believed that he was limited to the presentation of statutory mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing, and (c) because the sentencing judge and the Supreme Court of Florida did not fully consider nonstatutory mitigating circumstances; (2) whether the State\u2019s introduction at the trial\u2019s sentencing phase of the testimony of a psychologist appointed by the court at petitioner\u2019s request violated petitioner\u2019s fifth amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and sixth amendment right to counsel, even though petitioner did not contemporaneously object; and (3) whether Fla.Stat. 921.141(5)(h) (1975), which defines a killing that is \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\u201d as an aggravating circumstance, was applied in an unconstitutionally vague manner in violation of the eighth amendment. We conclude that the district court properly disposed of each of these issues and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">Sometime in mid-May 1974, petitioner and his friend, Lawrence Karge, planned the robbery of a U-Tote-M convenience store in Miami, Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Karge was a former employee of the store and was familiar with the store\u2019s alarm system. In the early evening of May 17, petitioner entered the store alone. He approached the clerk, Joseph Jones, who was the only other person in the store. Petitioner pulled out a gun and told Jones it was a holdup. Jones raised his hands, and petitioner told him to hand over the money in the cash register. Jones tried to comply but could not, because the cash register was jammed. Petitioner stepped backward and told Jones, \u201cOpen it up.\u201d Jones replied \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s jammed. I can\u2019t.\u201d Then petitioner fired two shots at Jones; one missed, but the other hit Jones in the chest. Jones gasped and fell backwards to the floor. Petitioner walked behind the counter and tried, unsuccessfully, to open the register. As petitioner was walking back toward the front of the counter, a man entered the store and asked petitioner if the store carried pickled pigs\u2019 feet. Petitioner replied, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t. We\u2019re out of them right now.\u201d After the man walked out of the store, got into his car, and drove off, petitioner walked around to the front of the counter and shot Jones in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">Petitioner then left the store and walked to the parking lot of a nearby bar to wait for Karge, who arrived about two minutes later and drove petitioner home. After eating dinner and changing his clothes, petitioner left for his job as a night security guard for a shopping center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">About seven months later, petitioner was arrested for the murder of Joseph Jones. At the stationhouse following his arrest, petitioner waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a statement, confessing to the killing and identifying the location of the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-15\">Before trial, defense counsel informed the court that he doubted petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the offense and moved the court for the appointment of one or more experts to examine petitioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court appointed three experts, two psychiatrists and a psychologist, all of whom determined that petitioner was competent to stand trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>had been sane at the time of the Jones murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Petitioner\u2019s trial began on July 10,1975.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The guilt/innocence phase of the trial took five days and resulted in a jury verdict of first degree murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The sentencing phase of the trial began shortly after the jury returned its verdict and was completed the same day. The State called three witnesses: the court-appointed psychologist and two lay witnesses. The psychologist described petitioner as a sociopath who had <em>\u201ca </em>great deal of difficulty conforming to and adjusting to the mores or demands of society.\u201d He said that petitioner was insecure, apprehensive, and hostile. The psychologist also said that petitioner, who was nineteen at the time of the examination, had <em>\u201ca </em>mental age of sixteen to seventeen\u201d and had a history of using drugs, mostly marijuana. The two lay witnesses testified that, prior to petitioner\u2019s arrest, he said that he had killed someone before and it would not bother him to kill again. The defense called one of the court-appointed psychiatrists and petitioner\u2019s mother. The psychiatrist testified that petitioner had an \u201canti-social personality,\u201d acted impulsively, and could easily be used by other persons. Petitioner\u2019s mother stated that petitioner had been under Karge\u2019s influence for a long time. The jury recommended the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">On July 18,1975, the trial court convened a hearing to sentence petitioner. The court heard testimony from petitioner\u2019s mother and grandmother (who corroborated the mother\u2019s trial testimony), petitioner\u2019s allocution, and argument from counsel for the State and petitioner. The court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>four aggravating circumstances attended the Jones murder: (1) the murder was committed while the petitioner was attempting to commit a robbery; (2) the murder was committed \u201cfor the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest\u201d; (3) the murder was committed for pecuniary gain; and (4) the murder was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, in that, after initially shooting the victim and while the victim lay helplessly bleeding on the floor, the [petitioner] deliberately leaned over the counter and shot the victim in the head.\u201d The court found two mitigating circumstances: (1) petitioner had \u201cno significant history of criminal activity\u201d; and (2) petitioner\u2019s age \u2014 eighteen years. The court balanced the factors and agreed with the jury that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, the court imposed the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Petitioner unsuccessfully appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Florida.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Hargrave v. State, </em>366 So.2d 1 (Fla. 1978) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919, 100 S.Ct. 239, 62 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979). He then filed a motion in the trial court to vacate the judgment and sentence under Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This motion was denied, and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the denial. <em>Hargrave v. State, </em>396 So.2d 1127 (Fla. 1981) (per curiam). Petitioner filed a second post-conviction motion in the trial court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which also was denied. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the denial. <em>Hargrave v. State, </em>427 So.2d 713 (Fla.1983). Having exhausted his state remedies, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The district court, following a nonevidentiary hearing, denied his petition. He then took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Petitioner claims that he was denied his eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment because certain mitigating evidence was not considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>jury, the trial court, or the Supreme Court of Florida. There are several components to petitioner\u2019s claim. First, petitioner argues that although his counsel did not offer any nonstatutory mitigating evidence, to the extent that such evidence was elicited at trial \u2014 for example, petitioner\u2019s steady employment, below average intelligence, and history of drug use \u2014 the court prevented the jury from considering that evidence because of its limiting instructions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, he contends that his trial counsel believed that the presentation of mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of the trial was limited to evidence of statutory mitigating circumstances. Finally, petitioner contends that the trial court, when sentencing petitioner, considered only statutory mitigating circumstances and that both the trial court and the state supreme court did not accord any mitigatory weight to evidence of petitioner\u2019s below-average intelligence, simply because they found that the statutory requirement of \u201csubstantial [mental] impairment\u201d was not met. Each component of petitioner\u2019s claim is rooted in <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964-65, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality), which held that the eighth and fourteenth amendments require that a sentencer \u201cnot be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Before we can address a habeas petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional claim, we must first determine if that claim is properly before us. We begin by examining the procedural history of petitioner\u2019s jury instruction argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Petitioner did not object to the court\u2019s jury instructions on mitigating circumstances at trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor did petitioner object to those instructions on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida. No objection was made, in fact, until after the supreme court issued its opinion affirming petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence; the petitioner raised the issue for the first time in a petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">At the time of petitioner\u2019s appeal, Rule 3.14(b) of the Florida Appellate Rules (1962) governed the contents of a petition for rehearing: \u201cThe petition for rehearing shall not assume a new ground or position from that taken in the original argument or briefs upon which the cause was submitted----\u201d Thus, an argument could not have been raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing. <em>See Delmonico v. State, </em>155 So.2d 368.(Fla.l963) (initial presentation of matter on rehearing was improper) (footnote omitted); <em>Leslie Bros. v. Roope, </em>108 Fla. 289, 148 So. 212 (1933) (supreme court will not, on petition for rehearing after affirmance, reopen case to permit presentation of different theory from that adopted below); <em>Price Wise Buying Group v. Nuzum, </em>343 So.2d 115, 117 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977) (appellate court would not consider an issue raised for first time in petition for rehearing). In this case, the petition for rehearing contained arguments that had been briefed and addressed by the supreme court \u2014 for example, whether the trial court erred in sentencing the defendant without the benefit of a presentence investigation report. The petition also contained an argument that had not been briefed or decided by the supreme court \u2014 whether the jury was erroneously instructed about mitigating circumstances. Thus, claims that were both procedurally appropriate and inappropriate were raised in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">The supreme court summarily denied the petition for rehearing. We read that denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>to mean that the supreme court considered the merits of the claims that were properly before it and, in effect, dismissed the jury instruction claim because petitioner failed to comply with the governing rule of appellate procedure; consequently, the court never reached the merits of his jury instruction claim. In essence, petitioner sought another round of appellate review, and the Supreme Court of Florida properly declined to grant that unsanctioned opportunity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that petitioner committed state procedural default and has foreclosed his right to federal review of his jury instruction claim, unless he can show cause for the default and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation. <em>See Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982); <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">The second and third components of petitioner\u2019s mitigating evidence argument \u2014 his trial counsel incorrectly assumed that mitigating circumstances were limited to those listed in the statute and the trial court, in sentencing petitioner, considered only statutory mitigating evidence \u2014 were first raised after briefs were filed and oral argument was heard on direct appeal before the Supreme Court of Florida. Petitioner made those arguments for the first time more than a year and one-half after oral argument when he filed a supplemental brief, asking for a new sentencing hearing in order to present nonstatutory mitigating evidence. Ten days after petitioner filed his supplemental brief, the supreme court issued an opinion affirming petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence; the arguments made in petitioner\u2019s supplemental brief were neither acknowledged nor addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">We cannot presume that the supreme court\u2019s silence indicates that it reached the merits of those arguments, because the Florida Appellate Rules made no provision for a \u201csupplemental brief.\u201d The rule in force during petitioner\u2019s appeal provided for an appellant\u2019s main brief, an appellee\u2019s brief, and an appellant\u2019s reply brief, but for no other briefs or appendices \u201cexcept by special order of the appellate court.\u201d Fla. App.Rules 3.7(d) (1962). Moreover, that rule states that \u201c[s]uch assignments of error as are not argued in the briefs will be deemed abandoned and may not be argued orally.\u201d Fla.App.Rules 3.7(i) (1962). In short, the Florida Appellate Rules made no provision for supplemental briefing of abandoned claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">In this case, petitioner wished to raise certain claims that he never addressed in his main brief<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and never presented at oral argument. The Supreme Court of Florida did not issue a special order that would have allowed him to raise those claims. Petitioner\u2019s \u201csupplemental brief\u201d was thus a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">After the supreme court issued its opinion, petitioner again raised his mitigating evidence arguments in his petition for rehearing. For the same reasons given in our discussion of the jury instruction, we find that there was procedural default as to petitioner\u2019s contentions that his trial counsel incorrectly assumed that mitigating circumstances were limited to those listed in the statute and that the trial court (and thus the supreme court) considered only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>statutory mitigating evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because we have concluded that all three components of petitioner's mitigating evidence argument were procedurally barred in the state proceedings, we must next determine if there is \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d to advance petitioner\u2019s claim in this habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Petitioner argues in his brief that he was excused from objecting at trial and on direct appeal because the law at that time indicated that only statutory mitigating circumstances could be considered,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality), upon which his constitutional claim is based, was decided more than three years after his trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Reed v. Ross, </em>468 U.S. 1, 16, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 2910, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984), the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere a constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel, a defendant has cause for his failure to raise the claim in accordance with applicable state procedures.\u201d To determine whether the state of the law at the time of trial and appeal offered a reasonable basis upon which to make a constitutional challenge, the Court identified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-7\">three situations in which a \u201cnew\u201d constitutional rule, representing \u201ca clear break with the past,\u201d might emerge from this Court. First, a decision of this Court may explicitly overrule one of our precedents. Second, a decision may \u201covertur[n] a longstanding and widespread practice to which this Court has not spoken, but which a near-unanimous body of lower court authority has expressly approved.\u201d And, finally, a decision may \u201cdisapprov[e] a practice this Court arguably has sanctioned in prior cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, 104 S.Ct. at 2911 (citations omitted). None of those situations identified by the Court cover the case before us. <em>Lockett </em>did not overrule Supreme Court precedent and was not contrary to a near-unanimous body of lower court authority. And <em>Lockett </em>did not disapprove a practice that the Supreme Court had arguably sanctioned in earlier cases. Rather, the rule in <em>Lockett </em>was the product of evolving capital punishment law and \u201cfollowed from the earlier decisions of the [Supreme] Court and from the Court\u2019s insistence that capital punishment be imposed fairly, and with reasonable consistency, or not at all.\u201d <em>Ed-dings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 112, 102 S.Ct. 869, 875, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">Moreover, at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial in 1975, the ambiguous wording of Florida\u2019s statute left open the question of whether under Florida law the presentation of mitigating circumstances was limited to those factors enumerated in the statute. <em>Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227, 1238 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1002,104 S.Ct. 508, 78 L.Ed.2d 697 (1983).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>And although the Supreme Court of Florida had suggested that mitigating circumstances were limited to those found in the statute,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it did not address the scope of admissible evidence until after it issued its opinion in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In light of the evolving nature of capital sentencing law due to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), and the uncertain meaning attached to Florida\u2019s new capital sentencing statute,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we find no \u201ccause\u201d for petitioner\u2019s failure to object at trial or on direct appeal. Clearly there was a reasonable basis in 1975 upon which petitioner could have made the constitutional challenge he wishes to make today. We note further that, even if petitioner\u2019s perception of state law had been reasonable, the \u201cfutility of presenting an objection to the state courts cannot alone constitute cause for failure to object at trial.\u201d <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 130, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1573, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982); <em>see also Antone v. Strickland, </em>706 F.2d 1534, 1537 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1003, 104 S.Ct. 511, 78 L.Ed.2d 699 (1983). Because petitioner has failed to show cause for the procedural default of his <em>Lockett </em>claim, we are barred by <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>from considering the merits of that claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Petitioner next claims that the State, contrary to the fifth and fourteenth amendments, violated his right against self-incrimination. Petitioner argues that testimony by Dr. Robert W. Sylvester during the penalty phase of the trial violated his rights under <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), because Dr. Sylvester\u2019s testimony was based upon a competency examination during which petitioner received no <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We find <em>Smith </em>distinguishable and conclude that its underlying rationale does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">In <em>Smith, </em>the trial judge ordered <em>sua sponte </em>that the defendant be given a psychiatric examination to determine his competency to stand trial. The defendant was found to be competent and was subsequently convicted of a capital crime. At the penalty stage of his bifurcated trial, the State offered the testimony of the court-appointed psychiatrist who had examined the defendant. The psychiatrist testified that, based on the information he collected during the competency interview, he believed that the defendant would always be dangerous. Relying on this testimony, the jury answered special interrogatories in a manner that made the death penalty mandatory. <em>See Smith, </em>451 U.S. at 456-60,101 S.Ct. at 1870-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari on Smith\u2019s petition for habeas corpus and held that the State\u2019s use of the doctor\u2019s testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>ny had violated the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments. The Court found the situation at issue to be analogous to that in <em>Miranda </em>and thus ruled that Smith should have received <em>Miranda </em>warnings before speaking with the psychiatrist. <em>Id. </em>at 466-69, 101 S.Ct. at 1875-76. The Court further ruled that, under the sixth and fourteenth amendments, Smith\u2019s counsel should have been informed that the State could use the results of the examination in the penalty phase of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 469-72, 101 S.Ct. at 1876-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">After <em>Smith, </em>in <em>Battie v. Estelle, </em>655 F.2d 692 (5th Cir.1981),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the form\u00e9r Fifth Circuit held that <em>Smith </em>was to be applied retroactively. The court further held that a defendant did not waive his right to <em>Miranda </em>warnings merely because he initiated the request for a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">The <em>Battie </em>decision, which is binding upon us, makes it irrelevant that it was petitioner who requested the competency examination conducted by Dr. Sylvester. Nevertheless, we find significant distinctions between the principle at issue in the present case and that in <em>Smith. </em>Upon reflection, we find that there is no constitutional error when the State introduces psychiatric or psychological evidence during the penalty stage of a bifurcated trial to counter other psychiatric or psychological evidence the defendant has announced he will proffer. <em>See Smith, </em>451 U.S. at 472, 101 S.Ct. at 1878 (\u201c[A] different situation arises where a defendant intends to introduce psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">In <em>Smith, </em>the Court did not assert that the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it was based on the defendant\u2019s involuntary or coerced statements.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Instead, the Court was concerned more with the element of fairness implicit in the fifth amendment, which prohibits a defendant \u201cfrom being made the 'deluded instrument\u2019 of his own execution.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>451 U.S. at 462,101 S.Ct. at 1873. In the Court\u2019s view, the State clearly violated this fairness element when it introduced psychiatric testimony hased on the defendant\u2019s own statements, given that the defendant \u201cintroduced no psychiatric evidence, nor had he indicated that he might do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 101 S.Ct. at 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">In the case before us, however, we are not faced with a situation where the State, even unintentionally, deceived petitioner. At the beginning of the penalty phase, petitioner stated that he intended to call a psychiatrist to testify on his behalf, presumably to establish mitigating circumstances. When the trial judge asked whether either side planned to call Dr. Jarrett, and the State indicated that it did not, petitioner\u2019s counsel said \u201c[t]hen the Defendant will.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, before Dr. Sylvester began testifying, the State knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>the defense intended to present favorable psychiatric evidence.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Furthermore, petitioner made no contemporaneous objection to Dr. Sylvester\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This indicates to us that petitioner had not changed his mind about presenting psychiatric evidence to the jury and thus cannot claim that the State\u2019s strategy to counter his argument before he made it, rather than in rebuttal, violated his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">To us, petitioner\u2019s announced intention to present psychiatric testimony in his favor vitiated the <em>Smith </em>Court\u2019s concerns. There, the defendant was suddenly faced with the use of self-incriminating testimony on an issue he had never raised. In contrast, petitioner in the present case chose to bring psychiatric evidence to the jury\u2019s attention and cannot now complain because the State attempted to counter his argument with evidence of its own. Just as a defendant cannot take the stand and lie, secure in the knowledge that his prior confession will be excluded solely because he had not received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, <em>see Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), we find nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the State from introducing psychological opinions based on statements a defendant has given in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings when the defendant himself plans to make his mental abilities an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">We come to petitioner\u2019s final claim. Petitioner claims that Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(5)(h) (1975), which defines a killing that is \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d as an aggravating circumstance, was applied by the trial court and the Supreme Court of Florida in an unconstitutionally vague and overbroad manner. Specifically, petitioner contends that every stage of the state court proceedings was infected by this vague and overbroad application of section (5)(h), from the inadequate jury instruction, to the trial court\u2019s finding, to the supreme court\u2019s review of that finding. We disagree.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">At the beginning of the sentencing proceeding, the state trial court instructed the jury that an aggravating circumstance for its consideration was whether \u201cthe capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\u201d The court continued: \u201cheinous means extremely wicked or shockingly evil. Atrocious means outrageously wicked and vile, and cruel means designed to inflict a high degree of pain with utter indifference to or even enjoyment of the suffering of \u2022others.\u201d The jury returned a sentencing verdict of death. Because it submitted no written or oral findings, we have no way of knowing whether the jury found the aggravating circumstance under section (5)(h) applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>The trial court, however, in its findings of fact, specifically found section (5)(h) applicable to the killing: \u201c[T]he capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, in that, after initially shooting the victim and while the victim lay helplessly bleeding on the floor, the defendant deliberately leaned over the counter and shot the victim in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Recognizing .that its review of trial court findings in death penalty cases \u201csupplies the channeled discretion and deliberation necessary to avert the constitutional deficiencies condemned in <em>Furman v. Georgia,\u201d Hargrave v. State, </em>366 So.2d 1, 4-5 (Fla.1978) (per curiam) (citing <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976)), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919, 100 S.Ct. 239, 62 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979), the Supreme Court of Florida began by restating the trial court\u2019s findings. The supreme court then added: \u201cIn more common terms, the [petitioner] in a calculated fashion \u2018executed\u2019 the victim to avoid later identification.\u201d <em>Hargrave, </em>366 So.2d at 5.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court also noted the testimony of two people \u201cwho stated that [petitioner] had told each of them that he had killed someone before, and it would not bother him to kill again.\u201d <em>Hargrave, </em>366 So.2d at 5. The supreme court, affirming the trial court\u2019s finding, concluded that \u201c[t]he sum of all this evidence justifies a finding that the appellant\u2019s act of firing the third shot into the head of the victim was \u2018extremely wicked or shockingly evil.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">In <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), the Supreme Court struck down sentencing procedures that created a substantial risk that the death penalty would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. A capital sentencing scheme must provide a \u201cmeaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 188, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2932, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (quoting <em>Furman, </em>408 U.S. at 313, 92 S.Ct. at 2764 (White, J., concurring)). Consequently, the standards that a state enacts to channel the sentencer\u2019s discretion must be \u201cclear and objective,\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 198, 96 S.Ct. at 2936, (quoting <em>Coley v. State, </em>231 Ga. 829, 834, 204 S.E.2d 612, 615 (1974)), and \u201cmake rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.\u201d <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976). Thus, the Court has held that a finding that a killing was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman,\u201d used as a basis for implementing the death penalty, violated the eighth amendment because that standard, standing alone, in no way acted as a \u201crestraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 428, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 1765, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">Petitioner does not contend that section (5)(h) is unconstitutional on its face. In <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 255, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 2968, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976) (plurality), the Supreme Court stated that section (5)(h) must be considered in light of the Supreme Court of Florida\u2019s construction of that section. Because Florida\u2019s high court had previously construed section (5)(h) as applying only to killings that were \u201c \u2018especially\u2019 heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d in that they involved a \u201cconscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Tedder v. State, </em>322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla.1975); <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1, 9 (Fla.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>416 U.S. 943, 94 S.Ct. 1950, 40 L.Ed.2d 295 (1974)), the Court found that section (5)(h) sufficiently channeled a sentencer\u2019s application of that circumstance. What petitioner does contend, rather, is that, because neither the trial court nor the Supreme Court of Florida employed a sufficiently narrow construction of section (5)(h), the section was applied to him in an unconstitutionally vague manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">In <em>Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227,1263 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert denied, </em>464 U.S. 1002, 104 S.Ct. 508, 78 L.Ed.2d 697 (1983), this court was faced with an identical claim: \u201cwhether the construction of the [section 5(h)] aggravating factor evinced by the trial court\u2019s application of it to the facts ... comports with the eighth amendment requirement that death sentences be based on clear, detailed, and rationally reviewable standards.\u201d (Citation omitted.) We began by noting, as the Supreme Court had, that Florida\u2019s high court accorded a limited interpretation to \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d by requiring that the \u201chorror of the murder be accompanied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart from the norm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dixon, </em>283 So.2d at 9). We further noted that one set of \u201cadditional acts\u201d identified by the Supreme Court of Florida are those acts that make the murder \u201cconscienceless or pitiless\u201d because they are \u201cunnecessarily torturous to the victim.\u201d <em>Proffitt, </em>685 F.2d at 1263 (citations omitted). We concluded that the trial court had not employed a sufficiently narrow construction of section (5)(h). The trial court had concluded simply that the murder \u2014 resulting from a single knife stab to the victim\u2019s chest \u2014 was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; it did not state that the murder was torturous and did not identify the facts upon which it had relied. And because the Supreme Court of Florida\u2019s decision affirming the sentence did not indicate that it even considered the propriety of applying section (5)(h) to the facts, we concluded that its \u201creview \u2018in no way cured\u2019 the exercise of \u2018uncontrolled discretion\u2019 by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265 (quoting <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 429, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 1765, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980)). Finally, our independent examination of the facts in <em>Proffitt </em>led us to conclude that the murder was not \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d in light of the interpretation given that aggravating circumstance by the Supreme Court of Florida.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">A claim similar to the one presented here and in <em>Proffitt </em>was presented to the Supreme Court in <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980). There, the defendant was convicted of killing his wife and his mother-in-law by shooting each in the head with a shotgun. The sentencing jury found that the murder was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422,100 S.Ct. at 1762 (plurality). A plurality of the Court found that the application of this aggravating circumstance to the facts in <em>Godfrey </em>violated petitioner\u2019s eighth amendment right: not only had the Supreme Court of Georgia, when reviewing the case, not employed the limitations that it had previously held applicable to that aggravating circumstance \u2014 that the killing involve either aggravated battery or torture \u2014 but there was no way to distinguish that case from the many in which the death penalty was not imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 433, 100 S.Ct. at 1767.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">In sum, the state reviewing courts in both <em>Proffitt </em>and <em>Godfrey </em>failed to give any explanation or set forth any facts upon which the courts justified their findings of the particular aggravating circumstance under review. Moreover, upon an independent examination of the record, neither this circuit in <em>Proffitt </em>nor the Supreme Court in <em>Godfrey </em>could distinguish the facts in the case before it from the many in which the state courts had not found the particular aggravating circumstance to apply. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>this precedent in mind, we turn to the facts of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">In contrast to the courts in <em>Proffitt </em>and <em>Godfrey, </em>the trial court here identified the facts forming the basis of its finding that the murder was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d: the petitioner deliberately leaned over the counter and shot the store clerk while he lay bleeding, helplessly, on the floor. The Supreme Court of Florida upheld the trial court\u2019s finding, describing the killing as an execution committed to avoid later identification and noted the petitioner\u2019s statement that it would not bother him to kill again, a statement presumably relevant to his future dangerousness and his feelings of remorse. Our task is to determine whether these factors sufficiently narrowed section (5)(h) so as to comport with the requirement that \u201cdeath sentences be based on clear, detailed, and rationally reviewable standards.\u201d <em>Proffitt, </em>685 F.2d at 1263 (citing <em>Godfrey, </em>446 U.S. at 427-33, 100 S.Ct. at 1764-67).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Just as the Supreme Court of Florida has held the presence of torturous acts to limit sufficiently the meaning of \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel,\u201d <em>see Proffitt, </em>685 F.2d at 1263, it also has found that acts making a murder \u201cexecution-style\u201d appropriately fall into that category.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> An execution-style murder, as defined by the Florida courts, is typically one in which the defendant, without provocation, first renders his victim helpless \u2014 for example, by wounding the victim, tying the victim\u2019s hands, or ordering the victim to the floor \u2014 and then shoots the victim in the head at close range, often to eliminate the victim as a future witness. <em>Compare, e.g., Ferguson v.

At that point, Jones, bleeding on the floor, had been rendered helpless. A significant amount of time then passed, during which petitioner walked behind the counter and unsuccessfully tried to open the register, successfully diverted the attention of a potential customer, and waited for that person to leave the store, get into a car, and drive away. Petitioner then walked to the front of the counter, and because he was aggravated and afraid of getting caught,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> he shot Jones in the head.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The way in which this murder was committed can thus be described fairly as an execution of a victim, rendered helpless by the petitioner, for the purpose of witness elimination. This is a characterization of a murder \u201caccompanied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart from the norm.\u201d <em>Cooper v. State, </em>336 So.2d 1133, 1141 (Fla.1976) (per curiam) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 925, 97 S.Ct. 2200, 53 L.Ed.2d 239 (1977). We therefore find that the construction of (5)(h) given by the trial court and the Supreme Court of Florida \u201ccomports with the eighth amendment requirement that death sentences be based on clear, detailed, and rationally reviewable standards.\u201d <em>Proffitt, </em>685 F.2d at 1263 (citing <em>Godfrey, </em>446 U.S. at 427-33, 100 S.Ct. at 1764-67).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">The district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">.

In its opinion, the court held that <em>Estelle </em>was inapposite. <em>See Hargrave </em>v. <em>State, </em>427 So.2d 713 (Fla.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">. At the beginning of the trial\u2019s penalty phase, the court instructed the jury on aggravating circumstances. Then, after stating \"the mitigating circumstances which you may consider,\" the court listed the seven mitigating circumstances of Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(6) (1975). <em>See supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">.

Petitioner raised his jury instruction claim again in a motion to vacate sentence under Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850 (1977), filed with the trial court. The trial court did not reach the merits of the claim. It found the motion \"insufficient as a matter of law,\u201d because \"it present[ed] grounds that were actually litigated on direct appeal or were otherwise inappropriate for a motion to vacate.\u201d The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate sentence without reaching the merits of petitioner\u2019s jury instruction claim: \"The trial court found, and we so hold, that the issues raised by appellant either were or could have been raised on direct appeal, or they involve changes in decisional law not cognizable in a 3.850 motion.\u201d <em>Hargrave, </em>396 So.2d at 1127-28 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">. It appears from the record that petitioner did not file a reply brief on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">. Petitioner later raised the arguments found in his supplemental brief in a motion to vacate sentence under Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850 (1977) filed with the Florida trial court. Neither the trial court nor the Supreme Court of Florida addressed the merits of those claims. <em>See supra </em>note 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">. Petitioner, who was tried in 1975, cites a 1973 decision of the Supreme Court of Florida that said a finding of one aggravating circumstance renders a death sentence presumptively appropriate unless it is overridden \"by one or more of the mitigating circumstances provided\u201d in the statute. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>283 So.2d 1, 8 (Fla.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 943, 94 S.Ct. 1950, 40 L.Ed.2d 295 (1974). Petitioner also cites <em>Cooper v.

In <em>Cooper </em>is the statement that the Florida \u201cLegislature chose to list the mitigating circumstances which it judged to be reliable for determining the appropriateness of a death penalty for \u2018the most aggravated and unmitigated of serious crimes,\u2019 and we are not free to expand the list.\" <em>Cooper, </em>336 So.2d at 1139 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">.

The statute prefaced the list of aggravating circumstances with the statement that they \u201cshall be limited to the following: ...\" Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(5) (1975); <em>see supra </em>note 5. The list of mitigating circumstances was preceded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>statement that \"[mjitigating circumstances shall be the following: ...\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(6) (1975); <em>see supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">. <em>See supra </em>note 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">. The Supreme Court of Florida issued its opinion on petitioner's direct appeal on June 30, 1978. It was not until more than two months later, on September 7, 1978, that the supreme court squarely addressed the scope of admissible mitigating evidence, holding that its construction of the statute \"has been that all relevant circumstances may be considered in mitigation, and that the factors listed in the statute merely indicate the principal factors to be considered.\u201d <em>Songer v. State, </em>365 So.2d 696, 700 (Fla.1978) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 956, 99 S.Ct. 2185, 60 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"Al-\">. Florida was the first state in the wake of <em>Furman </em>to redraft its death penalty statute, just two years before petitioner\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">. The test enunciated by <em>Sykes </em>is two-pronged: a habeas petitioner must show both cause and prejudice for his procedural default in the state courts. Because the petitioner in this case did not show cause, we need not address the issue of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Petitioner also asserts that his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to counsel was violated because the State failed to inform petitioner's counsel that statements made by petitioner to Dr. Sylvester might subsequently be used by the State. We find no merit to this claim, in light of our conclusion regarding petitioner\u2019s self-incrimination theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">. In <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">. The <em>Smith </em>Court explicitly stated that \"no Fifth Amendment issue would have arisen\u201d had the examining psychiatrist\u2019s testimony been used solely for a determination of the defendant\u2019s competency. <em>Smith, </em>451 U.S. at 465, 101 S.Ct. at 1874. Thus, that decision clearly cannot be read as ordering the exclusion of a defendant\u2019s statement to a psychiatrist, given in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, on the ground that a psychiatric examination is inherently coercive or the statements a defendant makes during the course of it are inherently involuntary. Unlike the interrogation methods the Supreme Court barred in <em>Miranda, </em>the case before us lacks the coercive atmosphere and potentially unreliable confession that <em>Miranda </em>presented. This difference, and the <em>Smith </em>Court's emphasis on the <em>use </em>of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony rather than on the examination itself, further supports our conclusion that the fairness concerns in <em>Smith </em>are lacking in the facts of the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">. The defense actually called Dr. Corwin, not Dr. Jarrett, to testify. Nothing in the trial transcript indicates that the reference to Dr. Jarrett was anything more than confusion among the trial participants regarding Dr. Corwin\u2019s name. Both the State and defense had exchanged witness lists before the trial began, lists that included the names of the experts who had examined petitioner. Petitioner does not claim that the State \"sandbagged\u201d him by not revealing its intention to call Dr. Sylvester to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">. Petitioner does not contend that the State violated his rights merely by presenting its psychological witness before the defense did the same. Petitioner might have objected to the State\u2019s failure to adhere to the traditional order of proof, but we need not decide whether such an objection would be meritorious in the context of his <em>Smith </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">. Despite petitioner\u2019s failure to object to Dr. Sylvester\u2019s testimony, the Florida courts considered his claim on the merits in a collateral attack. <em>See supra </em>note 8. We are thus authorized to consider petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim. We note, however, that not only did petitioner\u2019s counsel not object to Dr. Sylvester\u2019s testimony, he also made extensive use of it when he urged the jury to show leniency in light of petitioner\u2019s mental problems. Petitioner\u2019s counsel relied much more on Dr. Sylvester's testimony than on that given by the psychiatrist who testified for the defense, making this case similar to <em>Witt v. Wainwright, </em>714 F.2d 1069 (11th Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), where \u201d[t]estimony ... clearly indicates that petitioner would have called the psychiatrist to testify during the sentencing phase of his trial had the state failed to do so.\u2019\u2019 714 F.2d at 1076-80.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">. Because we do not find that section (5)(h) was applied in an unconstitutionally vague or overbroad manner we need not reach the question whether, even if it were unconstitutionally vague as applied here, the imposition of the death penalty was nevertheless constitutional given the existence of at least one remaining aggravating circumstance and an adequately conducted proportionality review. <em>See Zant v. Stephens, </em>462 U.S. 862, 890, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 2750, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">. A short colloquy from the petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement to police is instructive on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-8\">DETECTIVE MAJOR: \"When you shot the clerk the third time, did you intend to kill him?\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-9\">THE DEFENDANT: \u2018Ves, I did.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-10\">DETECTIVE MAJOR: \u201cWhy did you want to kill the clerk?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiST\">THE DEFENDANT: \"Because I was scared, and I was aggravated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-JI\">DETECTIVE MAJOR: \"Why were you scared?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoS\">THE DEFENDANT: \"I was afraid I was going to get caught.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKSE\"><em>Hargrave, </em>366 So.2d at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">. The only physical act perpetrated on the victim in <em>Proffitt </em>was a single knife stab to the chest. We cited several cases having similar facts in which the Supreme Court of Florida had reversed the finding of a section (5)(h) aggravating circumstance. <em>See Proffitt, </em>685 F.2d at 1264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">. Further, the Supreme Court of Florida has held in the past that a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, although insufficient by itself, can be taken into consideration in determining whether a killing was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\" <em>Sireci v. State, </em>399 So.2d 964, 971 (Fla.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 984, 102 S.Ct. <em>2257, 72 </em>L.Ed.2d 862 (1982). In 1983, however, the supreme court held that lack of remorse should no longer be considered as, or contributing to, an aggravating factor, because it is often difficult to ascertain. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>State, </em>441 So.2d 1073, 1078 (Fla.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">. <em>See supra </em>note 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">. Petitioner contends in his brief that this court should overturn any finding, implicit in the trial court\u2019s findings, that the victim was alive after the first shot to his chest. Although he advances this argument to combat any conclusion that the killing was torturous, we assume he also would advance it to combat a conclusion that the shot to the victim\u2019s head was an \"execution.\u201d That Jones was alive after the first shot to his chest is implicit in the trial court\u2019s findings. This finding is one of fact and is presumed correct unless the petitioner cam prove, by convincing evidence, that the factual determination of the court was erroneous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1982). We find that a determination that the victim was still alive after the first shot is completely consistent with the evidence presented and, therefore, will not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"As1\">. In <em>Proffitt, </em>685 F.2d at 1262 n. 54, we found a jury instruction identical to the one given here, <em>see supra </em>note 9, to limit insufficiently the jury\u2019s discretion. In this case, that error was rendered harmless by the trial court\u2019s findings, which explained why (5)(h) is applicable, and by the supreme court's review, which discussed the propriety of applying (5)(h) to the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
