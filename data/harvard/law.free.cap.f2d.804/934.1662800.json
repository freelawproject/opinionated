(the Corporation), and its alleged alter ego, Cooper &amp; Cooper Painting (the Partnership). The NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding was filed because the Corporation unilaterally terminated the collective bargaining agreement it had with the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades of the United States and Canada, Local 768 (the Union). After the NLRB proceeding was initiated, the Corporation filed for bankruptcy. The three primary issues presented are: (1) whether this court has jurisdiction to determine whether the automatic stay of judicial proceedings created by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1) when the Corporation filed for bankruptcy applied to the NLRB proceeding; (2) whether the NLRB proceeding was stayed by operation of \u00a7 362(a)(1); and (3) whether the NLRB\u2019s order is enforceable against the Corporation, or against the Partnership, its alleged alter ego.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">For reasons discussed more fully below, we conclude: (1) we have jurisdiction to determine whether the automatic stay applied to the NLRB proceeding; (2) the proceeding was excepted from the stay by operation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(b)(4); and (3) the NLRB\u2019s order is enforceable against both the Cooper corporation and the Cooper &amp; Cooper partnership. Therefore, the NLRB\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">The findings of fact of the NLRB are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). The following facts are adopted from the Board\u2019s decision, and are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-18\">Henry Edward Cooper was the only shareholder and sole manager of the Corporation, which did business in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1981, he employed as many as six people, including his son, David Cooper, who was working foreman of the Corporation\u2019s painting operations. Prior to 1981, the Corporation negotiated and signed two collective bargaining agreements with the Union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each agreement had a term of two years, and expired on March 31, 1980, and March 31, 1982, respectively. In 1981, when one of its major customers decided to accept non-union bids for painting jobs, the Corporation experienced financial difficulty. By July 23, 1981, business was declining and the firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>had only three employees, Henry Edward Cooper, David Cooper, and Walter Young, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">On July 24, 1981, the Corporation unilaterally terminated both collective bargaining agreements effective August 1, 1981. This action violated the agreements and was an unfair labor practice in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Henry Cooper informed Walter Young, Jr., that he could continue to work if he was willing to work under non-union conditions. Young declined the offer, and the Union filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the NLRB. On September 17, 1981, the NLRB filed unfair labor practice charges against the Corporation, seeking backpay on behalf of Walter Young, Jr., and other unnamed employees, as well as equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">After termination of its relationship with the Union, the Corporation continued in the painting business. The business was operated essentially the same as before the union agreement was terminated, except that non-union employees replaced union employees. The offices, secretary, and telephone number of the business remained the same. The same type of painting work was performed. David Cooper continued as foreman, and Henry Edward Cooper remained owner and operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">In November of 1981, Henry Edward and David Cooper began operating their business as a partnership under the name Cooper &amp; Cooper Painting. After this organizational change, David Cooper received a salary instead of an hourly wage, participated in partnership decisions, and shared in the Partnership\u2019s profits on a forty percent basis. The Partnership continued the painting business previously carried on by the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">On December 4, 1981, the Corporation filed a petition in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although the Board had filed proof of claims with the bankruptcy court in the aggregate amount of $120,296, representing backpay due Walter Young, Jr., and other unnamed employees, the Corporation had been liquidated and the estate closed by order of the bankruptcy court by the time the Board rendered its decision and order on February 12, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">On May 17, 1982, Henry Edward Cooper, an individual, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and was discharged in bankruptcy on December 30, 1982, prior to the Board\u2019s decision and order. While the NLRB had notice of Henry Edward Cooper\u2019s personal bankruptcy, the Partnership did not raise his bankruptcy as a defense to enforcement of the NLRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">The Cooper &amp; Cooper partnership ended operations on November 4, 1982. Apparently, its business has been taken over by a new corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">The Board\u2019s order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires the Corporation, and its alter ego, the Partnership, to: (1) cease and desist certain unfair labor practices, including abrogation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement the Corporation had with the Union and termination of employees solely because they were members of the Union; (2) recognize and bargain with the Union as the designated bargaining representative in a bargaining unit defined in the Board\u2019s order; (3) abide by the terms of the abrogated collective bargaining agreement; (4) reimburse all employees and the Union for any losses suffered; (5) reinstate Walter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Young, Jr., with backpay; and (6) post NLRB-drafted notice of the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The first issue for consideration is whether this court, or the bankruptcy court, has jurisdiction to determine whether the automatic stay provision of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1) applies to the NLRB proceeding. The automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-6\">\u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a petition filed under section 301, 302, or 303 of this title ... operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0s\">\u201c(1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debt- or that arose before the commencement of the case under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-8\">\u201c(2) the enforcement, against the debt- or or against property of the estate, of a judgment obtained before the commencement of the case under this title; ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-9\">\u201c(b) The filing of a petition under section 301, 302, or 303 of this title ... does not operate as a stay\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-11\">\u201c(4) under subsection (a)(1) of this section, of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-12\">\u201c(5) under subsection (a)(2) of this section, of the enforcement of a judgment, other than a money judgment, obtained in an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">When the Corporation filed for bankruptcy, \u00a7 362(a)(1) automatically stayed \u201cthe commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding against the debtor____\u201d In addition, \u00a7 362(a)(2) prohibited the enforcement of any judgment against the Corporation which was obtained prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. However, \u00a7 362(b)(4) provides that the automatic stay does not affect \u201can action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power____\u201d Finally, \u00a7 362(b)(5) allows governmental units to enforce any judgment obtained in the exercise of their police or regulatory power, with the exception of a money judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-17\">Respondent contends that the bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the coverage, modification, or termination of the automatic stay. Therefore, respondent argues, we should \u201cremand\u201d this case to the bankruptcy court for a determination of whether the NLRB proceeding was excepted from the stay. We disagree, because the applicability of the automatic stay to an unfair labor practice proceeding is an issue of law within the competence of this court. <em>See In re Baldwin-United Corp. Litigation, </em>765 F.2d 343, 347 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-18\">Respondent cites our decision in <em>NLT Computer Services Corp. v. Capital Computer Systems, Inc., </em>755 F.2d 1253 (6th Cir.1985) for the proposition that only the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the exceptions to the automatic stay. Respondent places particular reliance on our statement in <em>NLT Computer </em>that \u201c[t]he stay provisions of section 362 are automatic and self-operating and those who have knowledge of the pendency of a bankruptcy action and stay are bound to honor the stay unless and until it is properly lifted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-19\">Respondent\u2019s reliance on this passage is misplaced because the statement was grounded on the assumption that the stay <em>otherwise applied </em>to the non-bankruptcy judicial proceeding, and that the bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>cy court therefore was the proper court to determine whether the stay should be lifted. In the course of providing the procedural posture of the case, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-5\">\u201cIn an opinion filed on January 31, 1983, the district court held that it was not prohibited from proceeding upon the merits of the government\u2019s claim despite the automatic stay provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, because it possessed the power to withdraw the order of reference of the involuntary proceedings to the bankruptcy court and then <em>lift the automatic stay provisions which would otherwise apply.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1256 (emphasis added). None of the litigants in <em>NLT Computer </em>asserted that the non-bankruptcy judicial proceeding was <em>excepted </em>from the automatic stay. The statement on which respondent relies was made in a non-bankruptcy judicial proceeding that was not even arguably excepted from the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Here, the NLRB contends that its proceeding against the Corporation is excepted from the \u00a7 362(a)(1) automatic stay because the NLRB proceeding is \u201can action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power,\u201d and, as such, excepted from the automatic stay by \u00a7 362(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">The decision of the Second Circuit in <em>Baldwin-United Corp. </em>is the only case which has explicitly held that the district and circuit courts have jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the automatic stay. However, in the context of an NLRB petition for enforcement of an unfair labor practice decision and order, two other circuit courts have <em>assumed </em>they had jurisdiction to answer the question and proceeded directly to the merits. <em>See Ahrens Aircraft, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>703 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>NLRB v. Evans Plumbing Co., </em>639 F.2d 291 (5th Cir.1981). <em>Evans Plumbing </em>was the first circuit court decision to hold that an NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding was excepted from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">We agree with the statement by the court in <em>Baldwin </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-10\">\u201cThe court in which the litigation claimed to be stayed is pending has jurisdiction to determine not only its own jurisdiction but also the more precise question whether the proceeding pending before it is subject to the automatic stay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9j\"><em>Baldwin-United Corp., </em>765 F.2d at 347 (footnote omitted). We hold that we have jurisdiction to determine whether the NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding was subject to the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">Respondent next argues that the NLRB\u2019s order is void because the NLRB failed to petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay before it proceeded with the unfair labor practice hearing. It also argues that the NLRB was required to petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the stay even though it believed that its proceeding was excepted from the stay. This contention has no support in the case law, and we conclude that a governmental unit which determines that its police power or regulatory proceeding is excepted from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4) is not required to petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the stay prior to continuing its proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">Section 362(b)(4) provides that the filing of a petition in bankruptcy <em>\u201cdoes not operate as a stay </em>... of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power.\u201d The statute provides that governmental actions to enforce police or regulatory powers are automatically excepted from the operation of the automatic stay. There is no occasion therefore to seek relief from a stay which has no application to the proceeding in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">In addition, the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 evinces a congressional intent that \u201can action by a governmental unit seeking to enforce its regulatory power is not automatically stayed by reason of the provisions of subsection (b)(4) but might nonetheless be enjoined by the [bankruptcy] court in appropriate circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>stances.\u201d 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>11362.-05 at 362-40 (15th ed. 1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">We hold that the NLRB, acting on the belief that its unfair labor practice proceeding was excepted from the operation of the automatic stay, permissibly proceeded with the hearing without obtaining relief from the stay in the bankruptcy court. However, the NLRB proceeded at its own risk. If it was later determined that the proceeding was <em>not </em>excepted from the automatic stay, the entire NLRB proceeding would be void <em>ab initio </em>as an act taken in violation of the stay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, an action by a governmental unit in the exercise of its police or regulatory powers is not void merely because it was taken in the belief that it was excepted from the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Section 362(b)(4) explicitly provides that proceedings undertaken by a governmental unit in the exercise of its police power are unaffected by the automatic stay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only if we find the action did not fall within the ambit of the \u00a7 362(b)(4) exception to the automatic stay will we declare the governmental unit\u2019s action void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">Arguably, a more orderly procedure would require the NLRB to petition the bankruptcy court for permission to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>ceed. \u201c[C]entralizing construction of the automatic stay in the Bankruptcy Court\u201d would result in \u201cuniformity on issues of law,\u201d and would assist that court\u2019s effort to \u201cassure equality of treatment among creditors.\u201d <em>Baldwin-United, Corp., </em>765 F.2d at 349. However, \u00a7 362 does not impose such a requirement, and the legislative history of that section provides that \u201c[b]y excepting an act or action from the automatic stay, the bill simply requires that the trustee move the court into action, rather than requiring the stayed party to request relief from the stay.\u201d S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5837.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Our conclusion does not leave the trustee or debtor-in-possession unable to halt the unfair labor practice proceeding. The legislative history of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">\u201cThe Court has ample other powers to stay actions not covered by the automatic stay. Section 105, of the proposed title 11, derived from Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 2a(15), grants the power to issue orders necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of title 11.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">5. Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5837. The bankruptcy courts have concluded that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 gives them the power to stay NLRB proceedings that are excepted from the operation of the automatic stay by \u00a7 362(b)(4) if the assets of the debtor\u2019s estate are threatened. <em>See, e.g., In re GHR Energy Corp., </em>33 B.R. 449, 450-51 (Bankr.D.Mass.1983). <em>Cf. In re Organized Maintenance, Inc., </em>47 B.R. 791, 797-98 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">Respondent also argues that the NLRB proceeding was \u201can attempt to enforce a money judgment\u201d and was therefore subject to the automatic stay by operation of \u00a7 362(b)(5). We disagree, and hold, on the facts of this case, that the NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding was excepted from the operation of the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4) and was not an attempt to enforce a money judgment under \u00a7 362(b)(5). The NLRB proceeding was wholly unaffected by the automatic stay which went into effect when the Corporation filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">Not every action or proceeding by a governmental unit is excepted from the automatic stay. The legislative history to the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 provides that, under \u00a7 362(b)(4),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-12\">\u201cwhere a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud, environmental protection, consumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws, or attempting to fix damages for violation of such a law, the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 343 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6299. The courts which have considered this issue have generally concluded that NLRB unfair labor practice proceedings are excepted from the automatic stay by \u00a7 362(b)(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>In re Nicholas, Inc., </em>55 B.R. 212, 214 (Bankr.D.N.J. 1985), the court summarized \u201cthe prevailing view among several other circuits\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avl\">\u201c[T]his Court necessarily reaches the conclusion that the automatic stay is inapplicable herein. The N.L.R.B. is a governmental unit exercising its police or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>regulatory powers. By the prevailing interpretations of the exceptions to the automatic stay, injunctive relief is unavailable against the Board on that ground. Moreover, the Court notes that the complained of proceedings have not yet reached the stage of enforcing a money judgment. Falling short of such prohibited activity, there is no basis to deny the exception to the stay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The bankruptcy courts have not yet developed a consistent test for determining whether an action by a particular governmental unit falls within the automatic stay. However, even under the narrowest reading of \u00a7 362(b)(4), the NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding in this case is within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Generally, one of two tests has been applied to determine whether a particular governmental action was excepted from the automatic stay: the pecuniary purpose test or the public policy test. <em>See In re Herr, </em>28 B.R. 465, 468-69 (Bankr.D.Me.1983). Under the pecuniary purpose test, the court asks whether the governmental proceeding relates <em>primarily </em>\u201cto the protection of the [government\u2019s] pecuniary interest in the debtors\u2019 property and not to matters of public safety and health.\u201d <em>In re State of Missouri, </em>647 F.2d 768, 776 (8th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1162, 102 S.Ct. 1035, 71 L.Ed.2d 318 (1982). The former purpose would subject the proceeding to the stay provision of \u00a7 362; the latter would not. In contrast, the public policy test \u201cdistinguishes between proceedings that effectuate public policy and those that adjudicate private rights: only the former are excepted from the automatic stay.\u201d <em>In re Herr, </em>28 B.R. at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The NLRB proceeding challenged herein passes muster under either test. First, an NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding is one which imposes sanctions on an employer for violations of the federal labor law. The Board\u2019s decision in this case is an adjudication that the Corporation violated federal labor law embodied in the National Labor Relations Act. It is not a proceeding for the primary purpose of protecting the government\u2019s claim of entitlement to a pecuniary interest in the debtor\u2019s estate. Second, the NLRB does not proceed on behalf of private persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-8\">\u201c[N]o private action arises under the Labor Act. Thus the NLRB is not functionally a forum where private parties may present labor disputes. Rather the NLRB determines which complaints it will act upon in its own name in furthering the policies of the federal labor laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\"><em>In re Adams Delivery Service, </em>24 B.R. 589, 592 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1982) (citation omitted). Congress has entrusted the NLRB with enforcement of the nation\u2019s labor laws, and has also committed \u201cthe matter of adjudicating unfair labor practices to the jurisdiction of the N.L.R.B.\u201d <em>In re Nicholas, Inc., </em>55 B.R. at 215. <em>See also, Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., </em>309 U.S. 261, 264-65, 60 S.Ct. 561, 563, 84 L.Ed. 738 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">In <em>NLRB v. Evans Plumbing Co., </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-11\">\u201cThe crucial issue is whether the NLRB is a governmental unit and whether this action is one to enforce police or regulatory powers. It is clear that the NLRB is a governmental unit. This action was undertaken to enforce the federal law regulating the relationship between employer and employee. We can safely conclude therefore that this is an exercise of police or regulatory powers which places it within the \u00a7 362(b)(4) exemption to the automatic stay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">639 F.2d at 293 (footnote omitted). We agree with the <em>Evans Plumbing </em>court, and hold that the NLRB\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint against respondent was excepted from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">Respondent argues that the NLRB proceeding against it was an attempt to reduce an unfair labor practice charge to a dollar amount for the benefit of private persons, namely the Union and those employees who lost wages. We reject this argument, primarily for the reason that \u201conce proceedings are excepted from the stay by section 362(b)(4), courts have al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>lowed governmental units to fix the amount of penalties, up to and including <em>entry </em>of a money judgment.\u201d <em>In re Herr, </em>28 B.R. at 469 (emphasis added). The legislative history of the statute states that \u00a7 362(b)(4) excepts a governmental unit from the automatic stay where it is \u201cattempting to fix damages for violation\u201d of a police or regulatory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">At most, the NLRB unfair labor practice proceeding against respondent resulted in the entry of a money judgment. Section 362(b)(5) provides that only attempts to <em>enforce </em>money judgments are subject to the automatic stay. In <em>Penn Terra Ltd. v. Department of Environmental Resources, </em>733 F.2d 267, 275 (3d Cir.1984), the court examined the meaning of the phrase \u201cenforcement of a money judgment,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 362(b)(5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-6\">\u201cQuite separate from the entry of a money judgment, however, is a proceeding to <em>enforce </em>that money judgment. The paradigm for such a proceeding is when, having obtained a judgment for a sum certain, a plaintiff attempts to seize property of the defendant in order to satisfy that judgment. It is this seizure of a defendant-debtor\u2019s property, to satisfy the judgment obtained by a plaintiff-creditor, which is proscribed by subsection 362(b)(5).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">We find the <em>Penn Terra </em>analysis of \u00a7 362(b)(5) persuasive, and hold that the Board\u2019s determination that the Corporation owed backpay to its former employees was excepted from the automatic stay by operation of \u00a7 362(b)(4). We thus affirm the <em>entry </em>of a money judgment, but do not <em>enforce </em>that judgment. <em>See In re D.M. Barber, Inc., </em>13 B.R. 962, 963-64 (Bankr.N. D.Tex.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">Respondent argues that Henry Edward Cooper\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy bars enforcement of the Board\u2019s order against the Cooper &amp; Cooper partnership. The Board argues that we should not review this claim because respondent failed to present it to the Board as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that this issue was presented to the Board, in effect, when respondent filed a \u201cPlea in Abatement due to Bankruptcy.\u201d The Board was cognizant of Henry Edward Cooper\u2019s pending bankruptcy proceeding and determined that its proceeding was excepted from the automatic stay. It therefore disregarded respondent\u2019s plea in abatement. We hold that this is sufficient to meet the standard of \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-16\">Nonetheless, we affirm the Board\u2019s conclusion that its order may be enforced against the Cooper &amp; Cooper partnership. The Partnership was a party to the proceeding below, where it was found to be the alter ego of the Cooper corporation, a conclusion that is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The partnership entity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>not Henry Edward Cooper, is the party to this proceeding, and the Board\u2019s order is fully enforceable against that entity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">For all the foregoing reasons, the Board\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">. The Corporation was a member of the Blue Grass Chapter of the Painting and Decorating Contractors of America (PDCA), the organization which negotiated the collective bargaining agreements to which the Corporation was a signatory.

The Board provided that the corporation would only be required to enforce the collective bargaining agreement through December 4, 1981, the date it filed its bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">The <em>Bildisco </em>Court held that after filing the petition for reorganization in bankruptcy, the debtor-in-possession is not required to bargain with the union, and may unilaterally terminate its labor contract. In later reviewing the termination of the labor contract, the bankruptcy court would have to \"weigh several equitable considerations to vindicate the prior labor contract abrogation.\u201d Gregory, <em>The Congressional Response to </em>NLRB v.

The effect of an exception is not to make the action immune from injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">\"The court has ample other powers to stay actions not covered by the automatic stay. Section 105, of proposed title 11, derived from Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 2a(15), grants the power to issue orders necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of title 11. The district court and the bankruptcy court as its adjunct have all the traditional injunctive powers of a court of equity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 164 as proposed in \u00a7 2266, \u00a7 201, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334, as proposed in \u00a7 2266, \u00a7 216. <em>Stays or injunctions issued under these other sections will not be automatic upon the commencement of the case, but will be granted or issued under the usual rules for the issuance of injunctions. By excepting an act or action from the automatic stay, the bill simply requires that the trustee move the court into action, rather than requiring the stayed party to request relief from the stay. </em>There are some actions, enumerated in the exceptions, that generally should not be stayed automatically upon the commencement of the case, for reasons of either policy or practicality. Thus, the court will have to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a particular action which may be harming the estate should be stayed. <em>******</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-7\"><em>\u201cParagraph (4) excepts commencement or continuation of actions and proceedings by governmental units to enforce police or regulatory powers. </em>Thus, where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud, environmental protection, consumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws, or attempting to fix damages for violation of such a law, the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASP8\">\"Paragraph (5) makes clear that the exception extends to permit an injunction and enforcement of an injunction, and to permit the entry of a money judgment, but does not extend to permit enforcement of a money judgment. Since the assets of the debtor are in the possession and control of the bankruptcy court, and since they constitute a fund out of which all creditors are entitled to share, enforcement by a governmental unit of a money judgment would give it preferential treatment to the detriment of all other creditors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apsq\">S.Rep.

Whether Ohio could process the worker\u2019s compensation claims <em>without </em>petitioning for relief from the stay was not at issue.

The Board found that there were only two differences between Edward Cooper Painting, Inc. and the Cooper &amp; Cooper partnership: One, the partnership does not hire union employees. Two, David Cooper acquired an ownership interest in the Partnership, whereas Edward Cooper was the sole owner of the Corporation. Since all other aspects of Edward Cooper Painting, Inc. were carried over to Cooper &amp; Cooper, and the Partnership began operations before the Corporation filed for bankruptcy, the Board\u2019s alter ego conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">.

The failure of respondent to raise particular issues before the Board deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider such contentions. <em>Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v.
