Teitelbaum of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b145-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</author>\n<author id=\"b145-6\">MANSMANN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The plaintiff, an association of physicians, seeks judicial review of the decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) to recoup alleged over-payments for medical services provided to Medicare Part B enrollees by members of the plaintiff association. The Secretary asserts that the services were provided in a non-certified nursing facility and thus should have been classified and reimbursed as nursing home services rather than skilled nursing facility visits. The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We agree with the district court that the facts alleged by the plaintiff do not provide jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(l)(B) or under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). However, in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>\u2014 U.S. ; 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986), we will reverse the decision and remand to permit the plaintiff to amend its complaint to allege jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The Medicare Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 et seq. consists of Part A, which provides for hospital insurance, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c-1395\u00cd-2, and Part B, which provides coverage for supplemental medical services, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395j-w. Part A benefits are funded by a wage tax and are generally available to all persons who are over the age of 64 or are disabled. Participation in Part B is elective, and benefit payments are funded by enrollees\u2019 premiums as well as by federal government appropriations. Individuals enrolled under Part B may request direct reimbursement for medical services or may assign the right to reimbursement to the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">Part B is administered by private intermediaries called \u201ccarriers\u201d who are authorized to set rates, review claims and make payments on behalf of HEW. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u. Medicare Part B patients or their assignees are paid on the basis of the amounts charged, subject to the carrier\u2019s responsibility to establish appropriate \u201creasonable amounts\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.501 <em>et seq. </em>By accepting assignment a physician agrees to charge a patient no more than the reasonable charge determined by the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-18\">The members of the plaintiff association, physicians on staff at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, rendered medical services to a number of Medicare Part B beneficiaries who assigned their claims to the plaintiff. During the period from October 1, 1980 to September 30, 1982 the plaintiff submitted to the carrier, Blue Shield of Pennsylvania, the assigned claims of fifteen Part B enrollees. The plaintiff was reimbursed at the rate for services performed in a skilled nursing facility. A later audit by the Health Care Financing Administration (\u201cHCFA\u201d) revealed that the Philadelphia Geriatric Center had not been a Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility during the period from October 1, 1980 to September 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">On instruction of the HCFA the carrier reopened the plaintiff\u2019s claims for the peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>od in question and conducted a post-payment review. The carrier determine^ that because the physician\u2019s services had not been rendered in a Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility, the services should have been reimbursed at the lower rate applicable to services performed in a nursing home. The carrier notified the plaintiff that it had been overpaid in the amount of $86,128 and requested repayment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">When a carrier determines that full reimbursement is not warranted, statute and regulations designate an agency appeal procedure culminating in a \u201cfair hearing\u201d before a hearing officer designated by the carrier. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1895u(b)(8)(C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.820 (1980). The plaintiff was given a Medicare fair hearing on April 2, 1985. Relying on an explicit HFCA policy, the hearing officer determined that the medical services provided to the Medicare patients by the members of the plaintiff association had been properly classified by the carrier as nursing home visits. A request for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The plaintiff filed this suit on August 16, 1985 seeking judicial review of the hearing officer\u2019s decision. The plaintiff alleges and the defendant admits that the sole basis for the retroactive reduction in the amount of benefits payable to the plaintiff was the determination that the professional services were not rendered in a skilled nursing facility certified by Medicare. Both parties also agree that the services provided by Medical Fund were equivalent to those provided in a skilled nursing facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">The plaintiff does not assert that the services were rendered in a Medicare-certified facility. It argues instead that the services were rendered in a facility which is certified by Medicaid as a skilled nursing facility and therefore should have been treated as certified for Medicare as well because the statutory requirements are the same. The district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the issue and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">The dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction by the district court raises a question of law subject to plenary review. <em>See Universal Minerals, Inc. v. C.A. Hughes and Co., </em>669 F.2d 98 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">In dismissing the action the district court relied on <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. 201, 102 S.Ct. 1650, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982). The Supreme Court noted in <em>Erika </em>that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff provides jurisdictional grants for judicial review of disputes relating to eligibility to participate in either Part A or Part B, and for judicial review of disputes concerning the amount of benefits to which an individual is entitled under Part A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 207, 102 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>at 1653. The Court held that by omitting a provision for judicial review of determinations of the amount of Part B awards, Congress intentionally foreclosed review of those determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 208, 102 S.Ct. at 1654.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In its motion to dismiss, the defendant asserted that the dispute before the hearing officer concerned only the amount of Part B benefits due the plaintiff under the assignment and that district court review was therefore precluded under <em>Erika. </em>The plaintiff on the other hand attempted to bring the decision within the review provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(1)(B) by characterizing the dispute as one regarding entitlement, <em>i.e., </em>the eligibility of the plaintiff\u2019s assignors to receive Part B benefits in an amount allowable for services performed in a certified skilled nursing facility-</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Section 1395ff as originally enacted allowed judicial review of determinations as to \u201centitlement\u201d under part A or part B, or as to \u201camount of benefits under part A.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff. In order to obviate the problems experienced by courts in distinguishing between questions of \u201centitlement\u201d and questions of \u201camount,\u201d the statute was amended in October, 1972. <em>See </em>generally <em>Bohlen v. Weinberger, </em>483 F.2d 918, 921 (3d Cir.1973). Under the current version, relied upon by the plaintiff, the only reviewable questions of entitlement to part B benefits are those involving the Secretary\u2019s determination after a hearing as to whether an individual \u201cis eligible to enroll and has enrolled\u201d in the Part B program.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">As the district court correctly concluded, this is not the question presented here. No one has disputed that plaintiff\u2019s assignors are properly enrolled. The overall question presented is simply which of two amounts is to be deemed reasonable reimbursement for the services performed by the members of the plaintiff Medical Fund. Judicial review is not available under \u00a7 1395ff(b)(l)(B). An attempt to recast the question as one of \u201centitlement\u201d to an amount rather than simply one of reasonableness of an amount will not bring a Part B amount determination within the review provisions of \u00a7 1395.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The plaintiffs also alleged jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 405(g) is the jurisdictional statute for review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions under subchapter II of the Social Security Act. While \u00a7 1395ff makes certain subsections of \u00a7 405 fully applicable to subchapter XVIII, subsection (g) is not among those listed. Therefore it is not an independent source of jurisdiction to review decisions under subchapter XVIII, the Medicare Act, but applies only as incorporated by 1395ff to delineate prerequisites and procedures for judicial review in the specific instances authorized by 1395. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. 1395\u00dc. Since 1395 does not provide for jurisdiction here, 405(g) is unavailing as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint also asserts, however, that there is only one set of statutory requirements for certification as a \u201cskilled nursing facility\u201d whether it be for Medicare or for Medicaid purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The plaintiff further asserts that \u201c[t]o require the place of service of plaintiffs professional services as a condition of payment, to be performed in a Medicare-certified facility, which, in fact, is already Medicaid-certified, is agency rule making in excess of statutory authority.\u201d These assertions amount to a claim that the agency policy of reimbursing Medicare services at a Medicaid-certified facility such as the Philadelphia Geriatric Center at a lower rate than that applicable if it were also Medicare-certified is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The district court did not specifically address that claim as a basis for jurisdiction. Section 1395ff makes no provision for administrative or judicial review of the legality of the regulations and policies which a hearing officer must apply in determining a reasonable amount of reimbursement on a Part B claim. Although the plaintiff did not allege jurisdiction under the general jurisdictional statutes, the Secretary argued in the district court that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984), judicial review of Medicare cases is precluded except to the extent that it is expressly authorized under the Social Security Act. The district court also cited <em>Ringer </em>in support of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In <em>Ringer, </em>the plaintiffs were claimants for Part A benefits who had not met the exhaustion requirements of \u00a7 405(g) prior to requesting judicial review. The Supreme Court declined to accept general review jurisdiction while arguably holding that the jurisdictional provisions of the Medicare Act itself are, to the exclusion of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, the sole avenue for judicial review of claims \u201carising under\u201d the Medicare Act. <em>Ringer </em>at 615, 104 S.Ct. at 2022.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The plaintiff now asserts on appeal that jurisdiction is proper under the holding in <em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986), a case decided by the Supreme Court after the district court rendered its decision in this case. In <em>Michigan Academy </em>the Supreme Court severely restricted the decision in <em>Ringer </em>by upholding a finding of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 in a suit filed to challenge the validity of a regulation authorizing payment of Medicare Part B benefits in different amounts for similar physicians\u2019 services. The Supreme Court rejected the Secretary\u2019s argument that Congress had forbidden judicial review of all questions affecting the amount of benefits payable under Part B of the Medicare program, \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2137, and held that Congress\u2019 intent was to foreclose review only of amount determinations remitted finally and exclusively to adjudication by private insurance carriers in a fair hearing. <em>Id. </em>at; 106 S.Ct. at 2141. Thus to the extent the plaintiff\u2019s claims involve matters not within the statutory jurisdiction of the hearing officer, review jurisdiction may be available under \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">It is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the hearing officer to decide claims when requests for payments under Part B \u201care denied or are not acted upon with reasonable promptness or when the amount of such payment is in controversy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(C); <em>U.S. v. Erika. </em>However, by regulation, the hearing officer \u201cis to comply with all the provisions of Title XVIII of the Act and regulations issued thereunder, as well as with policy statements, instructions, and other guides issued by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in accordance with the Secretary\u2019s agreement with the carriers.\u201d 42 CFR \u00a7 405.8670. The hearing officer may not interpret the statute differently than does the HCFA nor may he comment upon the legality of the Act or regulations issued thereunder. <em>See </em>Medicare Carrier\u2019s Manual \u00a7 12016 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">The allegations in this case seem to cover a substantial portion of the continuum between <em>Erika </em>and <em>Michigan Academy. </em>On the <em>Erika </em>side, the plaintiff alleges: \u201cThe facility, or place of service, where the professional serves were in fact rendered by plaintiff was, in fact, a \u2018skilled nursing facility,\u2019 within the meaning of Sec. 1861(j) of the Social Security Act, and met all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>other requirements prescribed by the defendant.\u201d If the plaintiff means by this allegation that the HFCA erroneously applied its own policy, this allegation would appear to be within the jurisdiction of the hearing officer and precluded from judicial review. On the <em>Michigan Academy </em>side, plaintiff alleges: \u201cTo require the place of service of plaintiffs professional services as a condition of payment, to be performed in a Medicare certified facility, which, in fact, is already Medicaid certified, is agency rulemaking in excess of statutory authority.\u201d This allegation, which either challenges an explicit HFCA policy in the Medicare Carrier\u2019s Manual or challenges its lawfulness as applied to situations like this one, lies outside the jurisdiction of the hearing officer, for it is not within the authority of the hearing officer even to comment upon the legality of policies established by the Secretary or the HCFA. <em>Michigan Academy, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2139 n. 6. Accordingly, this allegation is not precluded from judicial review by \u00a7 1395ff even though the resolution of the issue would affect the amount of payment of some part B claims. Between these two allegations lie a number of others whose legal bases are not adequately described as within the jurisdiction of the hearing officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If challenged, the district court must examine its jurisdiction over each claim on remand <em>(see infra), </em>as its jurisdiction depends on whether the claim lay outside the jurisdiction of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">There is no explicit provision in the Medicare Act for review of regulations and policies promulgated thereunder. However, <em>Michigan Academy </em>reemphasized \u201cthe strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2135, <em>citing Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 140, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). That presumption is even stronger for Medicare claims that lack an administrative forum, for it is implausible to think that Congress provided no forum to adjudicate statutory and constitutional challenges to the Secretary\u2019s policies although it provided review by Medicare carriers of claims over amounts Congress characterized as \u201ctrivial.\u201d <em>Michigan Academy, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2140. Accordingly, the mere fact that \u00a7 405(g) review is made available by \u00a7 1395ff over some acts will not alone support an inference that others are excluded from review. <em>Id. </em>at 2138.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">The district court was correct in finding an absence of review jurisdiction under \u00a7 405(g) or under \u00a7 1395ff, the statutes relied upon by the plaintiff. In light of <em>Michigan Academy, </em>however, <em>Ringer </em>can no longer be interpreted to exclude Medicare claims from jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 if those claims lie outside the jurisdiction of carrier hearing officers. Because we find the plaintiff\u2019s <em>pre-Michigan Academy </em>failure to assert jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 reasonable, we will reverse the decision of the district court and will remand the case with instructions that the plaintiff be permitted to amend its complaint to allege jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653. If after remand there is a jurisdictional challenge, the district court should consider exactly which of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations come properly before it and make its rulings on jurisdiction in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. The plaintiff further asserts that the carrier offset overpayment against later claims of the plaintiff, a fact denied by the defendant. Since the issue is not relevant to the jurisdictional question, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. 42 U.S.C.
