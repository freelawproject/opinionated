ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">For fully a half-century, federal legislation has exerted a profound influence on motor common and contract carriage, the two modes of transportation in which the interstate trucking industry principally engages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The central inquiry ultimately necessitated by this petition for review is the degree of precision with which the Interstate Commerce Commission must frame the operating permit of a motor contract carrier of property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when based upon a distinct need of shippers for a particularized transportation service,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to confine the service to shippers sharing that need. We hold that the Commission is statutorily empowered to issue such permits only in terms assuring that the provision of service will be so circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-13\">I. The Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"Aam\">At the heart of this litigation are the statutory concept of a motor contract carrier of property<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the role that concept has in extensions by interstate truckers of preferential services and rates to selected customers by means of individual agreements for the transportation of property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Authority to favor customers in this fashion has waxed and waned over the years concomitantly with action by Congress, the Commission and the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-14\">The Motor Carrier Act of 1935,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which initiated federal regulation of the trucking industry, defined a contract carrier simply in terms of one engaged in transportation for compensation under special and individual agreements with customers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A common carrier, in contrast, was one undertaking transportation over regular or irregular routes for compensation for any member of the general public desiring it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1956, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>Supreme Court read the definition of motor contract carrier expansively in holding that a trucker securing 69 contracts for transportation of steel products retained its status as a contract carrier.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If specialization was an indispensable ingredient of contract carriage, the Court said, that requirement was satisfied by the fact that the carrier hauled only strictly limited types of steel products under individual and continuing agreements with a comparatively small number of shippers throughout a large area.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Active solicitation of customers did not support a finding that the carrier was holding itself out as a supplier of transportation to the general public, the Court continued,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because it was free to search aggressively for new business within the limits of its license.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">In 1957, Congress amended the Motor Carrier Act to sharpen the distinction between common and contract carriage, and in the process effectively terminated the contract carrier practice which the Court had upheld.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Motor contract carriage was redefined as transportation for compensation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-10\">under continuing contracts with one person or a limited number of persons either (a) for the furnishing of transportation services through the assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time to the exclusive use of each person served or (b) for the furnishing of transportation services designed to meet the distinct need of each individual customer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, contract carriage thereafter necessitated a continuing contract between the carrier and the shipper, and either a dedication of equipment or a transportation service adapted to a distinct shipper\u2019s need. A carrier seeking contract-carriage authority by resort to the latter alternative must show that the shipper has a \u201c \u2018distinct need\u2019 for a different or a more select or a more specialized service,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that the carrier\u2019s service is \u201cspecialized and tailored to\u201d that need.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-11\">This definition of contract carriage remained substantively unchanged from 1957 to 1980.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> During that era, contract-carriage applicants attempting to demonstrate distinct shipper needs frequently sought to provide a particular service to only one shipper.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>occasions, however, the Commission approved permits for service to discrete classes of persons when a distinct need common to the shippers comprising the class could be shown.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Motor Carrier Act of 1980<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> freed both common and contract carriers from a number of regulatory controls but left the distinction between common and contract carriage largely intact. The definition of motor contract carriage was amended in but one respect: continuing agreements, which previously could have been made only with \u201cone person or a limited number of persons,\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> can now be made with \u201cone or more persons\u201d without numerical limit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Such was the relevant statutory law when the instant controversy arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-13\">II. The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-14\">Interstate Van Lines, Inc., applied to the Commission for authority to truck household goods<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> under continuing contracts with \u201ccommercial shippers.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In a statement accompanying its application, Interstate discussed what it deemed the distinct needs of \u201cnational account shippers,\u201d who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>apparently are synonymous with \u201ccommercial shippers,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and who generate movements of household goods in high volume. Global Van Lines, Inc., and Wheaton Van Lines, Inc., jointly protested Interstate\u2019s application,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> arguing that \u201ccommercial shippers\u201d did not constitute a class appropriate for service under a contract-carrier permit resting solely upon the distinct-needs clause.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">The Commission\u2019s Review Board No. 3 agreed with the protestants and denied Interstate\u2019s application.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On Interstate\u2019s administrative appeal,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> however, Division 1 of the Commission vacated the Review Board\u2019s decision, and not only granted the application but also widened Interstate\u2019s authority beyond its request.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Interstate was authorized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm\">[t]o operate as a <em>contract carrier, </em>by motor vehicle, in interstate or foreign commerce, over irregular routes, transporting <em>household goods, </em>between points in the United States (except Alaska and Hawaii), under continuing contracts) with persons (except individuals) as defined at 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-13\">Global and Wheaton petitioned this court for review of the order, and filed with the Commission a request for a stay. The Commission refused to grant a stay, but reopened the proceeding, <em>sua sponte, </em>with a view to clarification of the Division\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Similarly, this court denied a motion for a stay pending review.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-14\">Petitioners contend that the Motor Carrier Act does not allow the Commission to utilize the distinct-needs clause as the predicate for a contract-carrier permit conferring authority so great as to produce uncertainty as to whether the service to be furnished to each shipper will fit within the statutory definition of contract carriage.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As a threshold defense, the Commission argues that a separate statutory procedure provides the only method of challenging any such overbreadth.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Alternatively, the Commission and Interstate assert that the permit as written is guaranty enough that service in conformity with its terms will qualify as contract carriage within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">We conclude that petitioners were free to mount their overbreadth attack on the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>mit at the licensing stage. Additionally, after consideration of the statutory language, its legislative history, and explications of the distinct-needs requirement by the Commission and the courts, we hold that the Commission, in granting the permit, abdicated its responsibility to ensure that the transportation service it authorizes will harmonize with the Act\u2019s concept of contract carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\">III. The Methodology op Petitioners\u2019 Distinct-Needs Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">The Commission insists that the question whether shippers have distinct needs within the meaning of the statutory definition of motor contract carriage is not one to be addressed during the process of formulating the operating authority that a permit is to confer.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Commission analogizes a determination on distinct needs to one on whether particular property falls within the scope of a contract carrier\u2019s hauling authority, a matter which is not explored when the application for contract-carrier authority is under consideration.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Commission also notes that the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 established an administrative procedure enabling a motor common carrier<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> to complain that a motor contract carrier is providing common-carrier service,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and asserts that this furnishes petitioners\u2019 sole remedy for impugning a carrier\u2019s provision of service on the ground that it is inconsistent with the statutory concept of motor contract carriage.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">We reject this effort to defer consideration of petitioners\u2019 challenge, for it fails to take into account an affirmative duty imposed statutorily upon the Commission. Congress has decreed that \u201cftjhe permit for a motor contract carrier shall specify necessary conditions, including each person or class of persons ... for which the carrier may provide transportation^] ... to ensure that the carrier provides transportation as a motor contract carrier and within the scope of the permit.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It is evident from this unambiguous command that a permit for motor contract carriage must identify the person or class for which the carrier may furnish the service authorized, and that this, together with imposition of such other conditions as may be essential, must be done in order \u201cto ensure that the carrier provides transportation as a motor contract carrier\u201d \u2014 that is, service in conformity with the statutory concept of motor contract carrier \u2014 \u201cand within the scope of the permit.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">The impact of this directive on the instant case is very clear. When authority to conduct motor contract transportation is designed to accommodate a distinct need of a shipper or class of shippers, the permit must specify the potential customer or group of customers and any other necessary conditions with sufficient care and accuracy to safeguard against the possibility that a shipper lacking that need will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>served pursuant to that authority.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To the extent that a permit designates a class broader than those shippers who shared the need, the carrier will be left able to provide, consistently with the terms of the permit, at least some service that does not qualify as motor contract carriage. The permit will then have failed to ensure that the carrier provides the transportation authorized only as a motor contract carrier, and the Commission will have breached its duty to see that the permit does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">We have no difficulty in reconciling, on the one hand, the Commission\u2019s affirmative duty to craft permits keeping contract carriers within their proper operational sphere and, on the other hand, the statutory procedure dealing with common-carrier complaints of excesses by contract carriers. It is our duty to give effect to all parts of a single statutory scheme if possible,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and we detect no discord between these two provisions when the former is treated as applicable to licensing activities and the latter is given operation only in consequence of non-licensing or post-licensing events.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We hold that a party with the requisite standing<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> may urge the Commission to refuse a pending contract-carrier permit that would not foreclose authority to engage in common-carrier service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">IV. The Validity of Interstate\u2019s Permit</p>\n<p id=\"AYC\">The Commission ruled that the service sanctioned by Interstate\u2019s contract-carriage permit met the distinct-needs alternative of the statutory definition of motor-contract transportation.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Our analysis naturally begins with an examination of the elements of contract carriage that are critical to disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">A. <em>The Elements of Contract Carriage </em>Motor contract carriage includes motor vehicle transportation for compensation (a) \u201cunder continuing agreements\u201d (b) \u201cwith one or more persons\u201d (c) \u201cdesigned to meet\u201d (d) \u201cthe distinct needs\u201d (e) \u201cof each such person.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The continuing-agreement requirement was imposed by Congress almost three decades ago to limit the ambit of contract carriage by relegating the movement of single shipments to common carriage.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The specification of \u201cone or more persons\u201d is not a requirement at all; rather, it is a relaxation of the earlier statutory provision restricting contract carriage to service to one person or a limited number of persons.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Motor Carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>Act of 1980 left undisturbed a line of Commission decisions allowing a carrier to contract with groups of shippers shown to have distinct needs.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">The \u201cdesigned to meet\u201d component of contract carriage has been explained by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> An applicant for a contract-carriage permit must demonstrate that the service proposed is \u201cspecialized and tailored\u201d to a shipper\u2019s distinct needs.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Before the carrier can make this showing, it is necessary, of course, to identify those needs.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">The call for \u201cdistinct needs\u201d sharply reduces the sphere of contract carriage. A distinct need, the Supreme Court has said, is a need \u201cfor a different or a more select or a more specialized service\u201d than common carriage provides.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Illustrative is a \u201cnew service ... better tailored to fit the special requirements of a shipper\u2019s business, the length of its purse, or the select nature of the delivery service that is desired.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Contract carriage, moreover, must be designed to meet some distinct need \u201cof each\u201d shipper for whom it is authorized.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> These criteria, however, must be applied with due regard to the changing transportation needs of shippers.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-19\">B. <em>Interstate\u2019s Permit</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADy\">The permit at issue allows Interstate to operate as a motor contract carrier \u201ctransporting household goods ... under continuing contract(s) with persons (except individuals) as defined at 1 U.S.C. 1.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> It makes plain enough that this service must be furnished pursuant to continuing contracts with one or more persons, thus supplying those two elements of contract carriage. The permit, however, defines \u201cpersons\u201d in such manner as to encompass all private business entities.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> This poses the question whether the permit ensures that the transportation authorized will meet some distinct need of such an enormous and internally diverse class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-20\">The Commission makes several arguments in an effort to demonstrate that Interstate\u2019s service under the permit will be only that of a motor contract carrier. The Commission maintains that the class defined does have distinct transportation needs because, it urges, only entities with special requirements will bargain for and bind themselves to continuing contracts designed to fulfill such needs.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> It is not for us to say whether this hypothesis is true or false;<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> it is enough to reiterate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>Motor Carrier Act, separately from and additionally to its demand for a continuing contract, makes a distinct shipper need a prerequisite to motor contract carriage.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Had Congress believed that continuing contracts perforce identify shippers with such a need, retention of the independent distinct-needs requirement would have been wholly superfluous. Moreover, we have previously noted, we must construe a statute so as to give meaning to each of its parts,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and this can be accomplished only by holding that the mere existence of a continuing agreement between a carrier and a shipper is insufficient to ensure that the service to be provided is calculated to meet a distinct need of the shipper, or even that such a need exists. It follows that Interstate\u2019s permit, which demands no more than that the transportation authorized be afforded pursuant to a continuing contract, is deficient in that respect.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\">. The Commission further contends, however, that although Interstate\u2019s permit by its terms authorizes contract-carriage service to shipping entities indiscriminately, it was meant to allow that service only to national account shippers,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> a class assertedly congruent with those found in the past to have distinct needs.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> True it is that in seeking to clarify Division l\u2019s decision, the Commission attributed distinct needs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>that class of shippers,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> but any reliance at this juncture upon the needs claimed for national account shippers is misplaced if for no reason than that Interstate\u2019s permit did not specify them as the class it could serve. Even if the Commission had actually intended to restrict Interstate\u2019s authority to transportation for national account shippers, it did not discharge its statutory responsibility to incorporate that limitation into the permit itself.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> But equally importantly, it could not have been the agency\u2019s purpose to designate national account shippers as the class. Interstate asked for a class composed of \u201ccommercial shippers,\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the term by which national account shippers are also known.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> It was for the very reason that commercial shippers were too small a class to fully utilize Interstate\u2019s proposed service that the class was enlarged to the one defined in the permit.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">The Commission argues additionally that the permit granted Interstate is validated by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> That legislation reformed motor carriage in a number of ways with a view to reducing and promoting competition,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and in the process altered the definition of contract carriage to sanction continuing contracts made between carriers and \u201cone or more persons\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> \u2014 contracts which under earlier statutes could exist only with \u201cone person or a limited number of persons.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The Commission suggests that the distinct-needs requirement was also relaxed,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> but we see no indication of an intention to endow the Commission with authority to disregard a clear legislative command. In 1980, Congress modified but retained the dual scheme of motor common and contract carriage, and although Congress anticipated that this definitional change would strengthen motor contract carriage by enlarging the number of shippers who could be served,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> it plainly did not contemplate emasculation of a positive statutory requirement.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Nor can the Commission achieve that result by selective appeal to elements of the national transportation policy.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> While Congress announced its interest in stimulating increased competition among motor carriers, it explicitly contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>ued to insist that those who wished to operate as motor contract carriers either dedicate equipment for a shipper\u2019s exclusive use or devise a service to meet a distinct shipper need.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Moreover, the legislative history reveals with equal clarity that Congress did not mean to ease the demand for a distinct shipper need when it amended the definition of motor contract carriage.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Had Congress really been prepared to tolerate dilution of that longstanding provision, in order to enhance competition or for any other reason, it certainly could have chosen a much better way of doing so.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">The Commission\u2019s remaining arguments for affirmance of the order under review are even less impressive. It is said that the Commission can rely upon Interstate to serve only those shippers having distinet needs,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> at least until Interstate proves itself to be unworthy of this trust.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> To be sure, Interstate represented that it would so limit its contract-carriage operations<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> and the Commission credited this promise,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> but that is beside the point. Under , the governing statutory law, we repeat, every permit for contract carriage must specify the person or class to be served, and must do so with enough particularity to assure that the permittee\u2019s operations will remain those of a contract carrier.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Designation of shippers having distinct needs is the function of the Commission, and is not to be the fortuitous product of the carrier\u2019s activity.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>Lastly, it is insisted that the Commission found that Interstate\u2019s service is designed to meet the distinct needs of each shipper in the class defined by the permit.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The \u201cfinding\u201d referred to, however, is nothing more than the Commission\u2019s conclusion attributable to its faulty rationale that it sufficed that Interstate undertook to limit its service to shippers willing to enter into continuing contracts.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> We need not say more on this score than we already have.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">The Commission predicated Interstate\u2019s permit on the premise that it would engage in transportation of household goods under continuing agreements designed to meet distinct needs of each shipper. Had the permit actually confined exercises of the granted authority within these boundaries, it would have passed statutory muster. But though we give deference to the Commission\u2019s construction of the relevant statutory provisions,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> we must hold that the grant to Interstate was not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">Our decision today should not be read to discourage the Commission\u2019s issuance of class permits carefully circumscribed by the distinct needs of the class.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Moreover, a class permit may properly include not just one class but a series of defined classes with distinct needs. Interstate\u2019s permit, in contrast, allows it to haul household goods under continuing contracts with any of the numerous business entities that might desire its service, and whose diverse needs have not been shown to be invariably distinct. The permit thus does not specify the class to be served with the precision necessary to ensure that Interstate will function thereunder only as a motor contract carrier, and therefore defies an unambiguous mandate of the Motor Carrier Act. We accordingly reverse the order under review and remand this case to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-14\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1403-9\">.

In December, 1983, after its decision in this case, the Commission released a policy statement declaring that it would grant such permits in proper cases. <em>Motor Contract Carriers of Property </em>\u2014 Proposal <em>to Allow Issuance of Permits Authorizing Industry-Wide Service, </em>133 M.C.C. 298 (1983). This policy does not bear significantly on the case before us. The Commission recognized the \"relevant statutory limitation ... that the applicant who proposes to serve a class of persons or an industry under contract must still meet the criteria for contract carriage. It must show that it will meet either the equipment dedication or the distinct needs test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. The latter test could be satisfied, the Commission said, by \u201cevidence on the generic transportation requirements of the particular shipper class that would be better met by contract carriers than by common carriers.\" <em>Id. </em>On this basis, the Commission insisted that the \"policy to permit class or industrywide applications ... distinguishes] between common and contract operations, because applicants would still have to meet the contract carrier criteria, and provide service under continuing contracts with shippers.\" <em>Id. </em>at 302. In its discussion, the Commission referred to the case before us, but as one involving service to commercial shippers, <em>id. </em>at 300-301 \u2014 a characterization which, for reasons about to be discussed, we cannot accept.

The Commission rejected protests, accepted the applicants\u2019 contentions, and granted all three applications. This court affirmed, perceiving no error in the Commission\u2019s findings respecting the alleged equipment dedications or the class to be served.
