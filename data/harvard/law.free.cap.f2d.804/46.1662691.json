Christian. As discussed more fully below, this court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">On November 26, 1984, the Christians filed a joint petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. At a subsequent meeting of creditors conducted pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 341(a), the Bank and other creditors examined the Christians. Based upon the petition and information revealed at the creditors\u2019 meeting, the Bank became convinced that granting Chapter 7 relief to the Christians would be a substantial abuse of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">The Bank thereafter moved to dismiss the Christian petition under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b). The Chapter 7 Trustee and other creditors joined in the Bank\u2019s motion. The bankruptcy court denied the motions of the Bank, the Chapter 7 Trustee and the other creditors on the ground that the court alone could move to dismiss under \u00a7 707(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Only the Bank appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to the district court. That court affirmed the bankruptcy court \u201cin all respects.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">As a preliminary matter, this court must consider the Christians\u2019 contention that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order. The Christians argue that the order is interlocutory and therefore not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). Section 158(d) grants this court jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders and decrees entered by a district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel on appeal from a bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">In <em>In re Marin Motor Oil, </em>689 F.2d 445 (3rd Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1207, 103 S.Ct. 1196, 75 L.Ed.2d 440 (1983), the bankruptcy court denied a motion of a creditor\u2019s committee to intervene in adversary proceedings instituted by a bankruptcy trustee. The district court reversed and ruled that the committee could intervene. Construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b), the predecessor of \u00a7 158(d), this court determined that the district court\u2019s order was appeal-able. The court approached finality prag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>matically, looking at the effect of the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 447-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The same pragmatic approach was followed in <em>In Re Comer, </em>716 F.2d 168 (3rd Cir.1983), in which this court concluded it had jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a district court order reversing an order of a bankruptcy court refusing to lift an automatic stay. This court noted that effective review of the order could not await final disposition of the case in the bankruptcy court. <em>Id. </em>at 172. <em>See also In Re Amatex Corp., </em>755 F.2d 1034, 1036-41 (3rd Cir. 1985) (allowing appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 .1291 from district court order denying appointment of a representative for future claimants in an asbestos textile manufacturer\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">If the order here is not now appealable the entire bankruptcy proceedings must be completed before it can be determined whether they were proper in the first place. We do not view such a resolution as either desirable or practical. In light of <em>Marin Motor Oil, Comer </em>and <em>Amatex, </em>we therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s order in this case is a final order under \u00a7 158(d). Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to consider the Bank\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The Bank contends that the district court erroneously affirmed the bankruptcy court's order. We will address the Bank\u2019s four arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The Bank first contends that the lower courts erroneously concluded that the Bank lacks standing to move for dismissal under \u00a7 707(b). Our review of this legal issue is plenary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">\u00a7 707(b) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">After notice and a hearing, the court, on its own motion <em>and not at the request or suggestion of any party in interest, </em>may dismiss a case filed by an individual debtor under this chapter whose debts are primarily consumer debts if it finds that the granting of relief would be a substantial abuse of the provisions of this chapter. There shall be a presumption in favor of granting the relief requested by the debtor, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A10\">The Bank admits that it is a party in interest within the meaning of \u00a7 707(b), but nevertheless argues that it should be permitted to file motions to dismiss under \u00a7 707(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">The Bank suggests that the statute is ambiguous and does not preclude creditors from filing \u00a7 707(b) motions. It contends that if Congress had intended to preclude a creditor from filing a \u00a7 707(b) motion, it would have specifically so stated. The Bank then offers a number of practical reasons for permitting creditors to file \u00a7 707(b) motions, including the suggestion that allowing creditors to file these motions makes good sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-17\">We need not evaluate the wisdom of the Bank\u2019s suggestions. Indeed, we cannot, because the statute clearly prohibits .parties in interest from making \u00a7 707(b) motions. Since the statute is plain and unequivocal on its face, and the Bank does not refer to any legislative history indicating that parties in interest are entitled to make \u00a7 707(b) motions, the Bank\u2019s argument is without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Russello v. U.S., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>464 U.S. 16, 20, 104 S.Ct. 296, 299, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Bank next argues that the lower courts erred in determining that the Chapter 7 Trustee lacked standing to file motions to dismiss under \u00a7 707(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">After the bankruptcy court denied the motions to dismiss of the Bank, the Chapter 7 Trustee, and the other creditors, only the Bank appealed to the district court. The record does not indicate that the Bank asserted standing in the district court to raise the issue of the Chapter 7 Trustee\u2019s ability to move for dismissal under \u00a7 707(b). Under these circumstances, the right of the Chapter 7 Trustee to move for dismissal under \u00a7 707(b) was not before the district court, and is not properly within the scope of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Under these circumstances, the Bank\u2019s contention will not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The Bank argues that the lower courts erred in concluding that the U.S. Trustee lacked standing to file motions under \u00a7 707(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The motion to dismiss in the bankruptcy court was filed by the Bank and later joined by other creditors and the Chapter 7 Trustee. The U.S. Trustee did not join the motion, and the record does not indicate that any moving party asserted standing to raise the issue of the U.S. Trustee\u2019s ability to file a \u00a7 707(b) motion. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order denies the motions of the Chapter 7 Trustee, the Bank and the creditors, and makes no mention of the U.S. Trustee. Since the right of the U.S. Trustee to file a \u00a7 707(b) motion was not decided by the bankruptcy court, that issue was not before the district court on appeal and is not properly within the scope of the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">Under these circumstances, the Bank\u2019s contention will not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">Finally, the Bank contends that the lower courts erroneously concluded that the motion by the Bank, the other creditors and the Chapter 7 Trustee so tainted the proceedings that the bankruptcy court could not thereafter consider dismissal under \u00a7 707(b) <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">In the bankruptcy court, counsel for the Christians suggested that the motions may have tainted the case. The bankruptcy court\u2019s opinion indicates that the court believed this would not be an absurd result. \u201cThe analogy discussed in oral argument, that the fruits of the tree are tainted, is in fact appropriate in this case.\u201d The bankruptcy court did not hold, however, that it would be unwilling to consider dismissal under \u00a7 707(b) <em>sua sponte. </em>The order of the bankruptcy court makes no mention of the issue. Since this issue was not decided by the bankruptcy court, it was not before the district court on appeal, and is not properly within the scope of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">Because the taint issue is not covered by the district court\u2019s order, it will not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-19\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b159-20\">The order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the Bank\u2019s motion will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\">. The Christians\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal will therefore be denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">. Both houses of Congress have recently taken steps to correct perceived problems with \u00a7 707(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Section 223(b) of the Senate version of H.R. 2211 appears to permit the bankruptcy court to consider dismissal under \u00a7 707(b) even after a party in interest has moved for dismissal under the section. H.R. 2211, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., 132 Cong.Rec. S5643, S5649 (daily ed. May 8, 1986). Section 238(a) of the Senate version of the bill would amend the duties of the Chapter 7 Trustee to require him to alert the bankruptcy court to such information as would enable the court to carry out its responsibilities under \u00a7 707(b). <em>Id. </em>at S5650. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2211 on May 8, 1986, 132 Cong. Rec. at S5643 (daily ed. May 8, 1986), and requested the bill be sent to a conference committee, <em>Id. </em>at S5654.</p>\n<p id=\"AvL\">Section 216 of H.R. 5316 would permit the U.S. Trustee to move for dismissal under \u00a7 707(b).

On August 15, 1986, after Senator Thurmond offered an amendment reconfirming the Senate\u2019s support for its version of H.R. 2211, the Senate passed H.R. 5316. 132 Cong.Rec. at SI 1906-07 (daily ed. August 15, 1986). The Senate requested H.R. 5316 be sent to a conference committee, <em>Id. </em>at S11907, and the House agreed on September 9, 1986. 132 Cong.Rec. at H4688 (daily ed. September 9, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-22\">. We note from the transcript that the district court inadvertently extended its ruling to include the U.S. Trustee. Since the U.S. Trustee was not a party to the appeal, this portion of the district court\u2019s ruling is a nullity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
