Reg. 28,385 (July 12, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">In this action, the American Bankers Association (ABA) seeks a declaratory judgment that Rule 3b-9 is invalid under the 1934 Act and an injunction prohibiting the SEC from enforcing the Rule against its member banks. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the defendant and dismissed the ABA\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed. Because Rule 3b-9 contravenes the intent of Congress, unambiguously expressed in the language of the 1934 Act, and confirmed in the Act\u2019s legislative history, we reverse the decision of the District Court and order it to declare Rule 3b-9 unlawful and to enjoin the Rule\u2019s operation against the member banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">I. Background of the SEC\u2019s Decision to Regulate Banks</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The current controversy arises over fifty years after Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act because of a change in the administrative interpretation of the Banking Act of 1933, commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act. Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act curtailed the corporate powers of national banks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In relevant part, \u00a7 16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">The business of dealing in securities and stock by the [national bank] shall be limited to purchasing and selling such securities and stock without recourse, solely upon the order, and for the account of, customers, and in no case for its own account, and the [national bank] shall not underwrite any issue of securities or stock: <em>Provided: </em>That the [national bank] may purchase for its own account investment securities under such limitations and restrictions as the Comptroller of the Currency may by regulation prescribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Seventh).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act delineated the general boundary between commercial and investment banking activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-13\">[I]t shall be unlawful ... for any person, firm, corporation, association, business trust, or similar organization, engaged in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation, stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities, to engage at the same time to any extent whatever in the business of receiving deposits subject to check or to repayment upon presentation of a passbook, certificate of deposit, or other evidence of debit, or upon request of the depositor: <em>Provided, </em>that the provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit national banks or State banks or trust companies (whether or not members of the Federal Reserve System) or other financial institutions or private bankers from dealing in, underwriting, purchasing and selling investment securities, or issuing securities, to the extent permitted to national banking associations by the provisions of section 24 of this title____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 378(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">The Comptroller of the Currency, charged with the duty of regulating the corporate powers of national banks, took the lead in interpreting these provisions of the Glass-S.teagall Act for enforcement purposes. In 1936, the Comptroller construed the Glass-Steagall Act to limit brokerage activities by national banks to purchase and sale transactions for \u201cactual customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>of the bank, which customer relationship exists independently and apart from the particular. transaction in which the bank buys or sells upon the order and for the account of such \u2018customer.\u2019 \u201d 1 Bulletin of the Comptroller of the Currency 136 (October 26, 1936). The Comptroller also ruled that a national bank \u201cis not authorized to retain any commission, rebate, or discount obtained from others in purchasing for a customer [securities or stock] unless it does not exceed the cost of handling the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>H 10. The Comptroller justified limiting the charge for brokering a customer\u2019s securities or stock on the grounds that the purpose of \u00a7 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act was \u201cto prevent national banks from engaging in the brokerage business for profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the Comptroller\u2019s original interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act, a national bank could engage in brokerage activities only as \u201can accommodation agent\u201d for the convenience of existing customers of the bank\u2019s traditional banking services. <em>Id. </em>1135. For example, a bank could purchase or sell securities for a trust account that it managed, but it could not make any money on its trades for that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">This original administrative construction of the Glass-Steagall Act has been dismantled piecemeal over the last fifty years. First, in 1957, the Comptroller repudiated the requirement that national banks receive no profit from the brokerage transactions that they perform for the convenience of their customers. <em>See </em>Digest of Opinions of the Comptroller of the Currency 11220A (August 1957 Edition) (quoted in [1973\u2014 1978 Transfer Binder] Fed. Banking L.Rep. (CCH) If 96,272 at 81,357). Nevertheless, at that time, the Comptroller retained the notion that banks could not perform \u201cfunctions [that] would amount to engaging in the brokerage ... business ... beyond the permissible scope of limited accommodation services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Comptroller in 1957 explicitly reiterated its earlier requirement that bank brokerage services \u201cmust be limited to actual customers of the bank \u2014 that is, the customer relationship must exist independently of the particular securities transaction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Then, in 1974, the Comptroller interpreted Glass-Steagall to allow banks to offer and advertise computer-assisted stock purchasing services. <em>See </em>Comptroller of the Currency Opinion Letter (June 10, 1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1973-1978 Transfer Binder] Fed. Banking L.Rep. (CCH) 1196,272 at 81,-353. Answering the argument that these services, and in particular, dissemination of advertising about them, controverted the concept of \u201climited accommodation services,\u201d the Comptroller noted that \u201cthe \u2018accommodation\u2019 concept is not contained in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81,360. Because, however, the automatic investment service was limited to customers of the bank\u2019s checking accounts, the Comptroller did not explicitly address whether bank could offer and advertise brokerage services for nonbanking customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Finally, in 1982, the Comptroller abandoned its interpretation that \u00a7 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act limited bank brokerage activities to customers of traditional banking services by allowing a national bank to establish a subsidiary to offer retail discount brokerage services, to banking and nonbanking customers alike, at branch offices of the bank. <em>See In re Security Pacific National Bank </em>(August 26, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>[1982-1983 Transfer Binder] Fed. Banking L.Rep. (CCH) 1199,284 at 86,-255.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Comptroller has subsequently made clear that its new interpretation of \u00a7 16 applies to the brokerage activities of a bank itself in addition to those of a bank subsidiary. <em>See, e.g., </em>Comptroller of the Currency Opinion Letter No. 363 (May 23, 1986); <em>see also </em>50 Fed.Reg. 31,605 (August 5, 1985) (withdrawing proposed rule which would require national banks engaging in discount brokerage services to do so through a nonbanking subsidiary). Both the Board of Governors of the Federal Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>serve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, acting pursuant to their respective authority to interpret the GlassSteagall Act, have also recently interpreted \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21 to allow banks to engage in brokerage services for nonbanking customers. <em>See </em>Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Statement Concerning Applicability of the GlassSteagall Act to the Commercial Paper Placement Activities of Bankers Trust Company (June 4, 1985);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FIDC General Counsel\u2019s Opinion No. 6, 48 Fed.Reg. 22,-989 (May 23, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The SEC never attempted to apply its broker-dealer regulations to banks that engaged in profitless accommodation transactions. Nor did the SEC attempt to regulate banks as broker-dealers after either the 1957 or the 1974 revisions in the Comptroller's interpretation. The dramatic surge of banks into the discount brokerage business, resulting from the post-1980 administrative reinterpretations of Glass-Steagall, however, prompted the SEC to subject banks engaging in brokerage business to the same broker-dealer regulation as non-bank brokers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Thus, in 1985, the SEC issued Rule 3b-9. The Rule regulates as a broker-dealer a bank that either \u201c[pjublicly solicits brokerage business for which it receives transaction-related compensation\u201d or \u201creceives transaction-related compensation for providing brokerage services for trust, managing agency or other accounts to which the bank provides advice.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.-3b-9(a)(l)(2) (1986). The Rule goes on to define \u201ctransaction-related compensation\u201d to \u201cmean monetary profit to the bank in excess of cost recovery for providing brokerage execution services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 240.3b-9(d). In other words, the SEC Rule does not reach banks which engage only in the profitless accommodation brokerage service permitted by the Comptroller\u2019s original 1936 ruling. But it does cover banks that seek profit from their brokerage business, whether that business was generated from public solicitation or from their existing banking customers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Rule 3b-9 proceeds on the premise that regulatory authority should be divided among government agencies according to the different financial functions performed by the regulated entity, and not according to the species of financial institution it is (as defined by its charter or even its <em>primary </em>function). While this regulatory philosophy enjoys favor in many circles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>has received the endorsement of a special task force established to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of federal financial regulation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is, unfortunately, not the approach taken by the 73rd Congress, which enacted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In that Act, as we shall see, Congress explicitly excluded banks from the rules governing brokers and dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The District Court recognized that the definitions of \u201cbroker,\u201d \u201cdealer,\u201d and \u201cbank\u201d contained in the 1934 Act, by themselves, unambiguously exclude ABA member banks from SEC broker-dealer regulation. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 93. Nevertheless, the District Court upheld the validity of Rule 3b-9 because it found two other sources of authority in the same Act for the SEC to redefine these terms to accommodate changing conditions in the banking field. For reasons to be discussed, we find these statutory sections on which the District Court relied inadequate to support the SEC\u2019s attempt to amend by regulation the explicit statutory provisions that govern the division of responsibility and jurisdiction between the SEC and banking regulatory agencies. Whatever regulatory coherence Rule 3b-9 would bring to the field of securities brokerage, we conclude the SEC has no authority to regulate banks as broker-dealers, and Rule 3b-9 is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">II. The 1934 Act Definitions of \u201cBroker,\u201d \u201cDealer,\u201d and \u201cBank\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">A. <em>The Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Section 3 of the 1934 Act excludes banks from the statutory definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer.\u201d The Act states that \u201c[t]he term \u2018broker\u2019 means any person engaging in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others, <em>but does not include a bank.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Similarly, the statute states that \u201c[t]he term \u2018dealer\u2019 means any person engaged in the business of buying or selling securities for his own account ... <em>but does not include a bank </em>----\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(5) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">In order to subject banks engaging in profit-seeking brokerage business to broker-dealer regulation, the SEC had to draft Rule 3b-9 to redefine the term \u201cbank.\u201d It did so by excluding banks engaging in brokerage business for profit from the meaning of \u201cbank\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 3(a)(4) and (5) of the 1934 Act, thus recapturing such banks into the statutory definition of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer.\u201d Thus Rule 3b-9 reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-13\">The term \u201cbank\u201d as used in the definition of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d in sections 3(a)(4) and (5) of the Act does not include a bank that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-14\">(1) Publicly solicits brokerage business for which it receives transaction-related compensation ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-15\">(2) Directly or indirectly receives transaction-related compensation for providing brokerage services for trust, managing agency, or other accounts to which the bank provides advice____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.3b-9(a)(lM2) (1986).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">A crucial problem with the SEC\u2019s new rule defining \u201cbank,\u201d however, is that the 1934 Act already contains a definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the term \u201cbank.\u201d Indeed, the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cbank\u201d immediately follows its definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-4\">The term \u201cbank\u201d means (A) a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States, (B) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, (C) any other banking institution, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any State or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under section ll(k) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, and which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of this chapter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(6). This definition notably does not contain any exception for a bank that \u201c[p]ublicly solicits brokerage business for which it receives transaction-related compensation\u201d or that \u201cdirectly or indirectly receives transaction-related compensation for providing brokerage service for ... accounts to which the bank provides advice.\u201d In sum, the statutory definition of bank contains no exception for banks engaging in brokerage activities for profit;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is no ambiguity or imprecision on this point.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As far as the statutory definition of bank is concerned, then, Rule 3b-9 directly conflicts with the language of the 1934 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">B. <em>Congressional Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKt\">The manner in which Congress defined \u201cbroker,\u201d \u201cdealer,\u201d and \u201cbank\u201d in the 1934 Act reflects a purposeful decision on its part that the SEC should not have oversight jurisdiction with respect to banks, because banks were already subject to a complex scheme of administrative regulation at the federal and state level. In the 1934 Act, Congress defined \u201cbank\u201d essentially as an institution subject to at least one of several existing banking regulators: the federal Comptroller of the Currency (for all nationally chartered banks), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (for all member banks), or any other \u201cState or Federal authority having supervision over banks.\u201d Thus, the exemption from SEC broker-dealer regulation is available only to banking institutions regulated by some other government authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">1. <em>Evidence of Congress </em>\u2019 <em>Intent Not to Impose Additional Government Supervision Upon Banks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Relevant legislative history confirms that Congress intended to preclude SEC regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>tion of institutions meeting the statutory definition of \u201cbank\u201d in order to avoid duplicative regulation. The Senate Committee Report accompanying S. 3420 stated that most of the definitions in the bill were \u201cself-explanatory.\u201d S.Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1934). Nevertheless, the Report did comment on the definitions of \u201cbroker,\u201d and \u201cdealer,\u201d definitions the Committee considered to be \u201cthe most important ... since many of the provisions of the act apply only to members of exchanges and brokers and dealers who do business through them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Expressly recognizing, then, that institutions excluded from the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d would not be subject to many of the Act\u2019s important regulatory provisions, the Report unambiguously stated that \u201cbanks are expressly exempted from the definitions of \u2018broker\u2019 and \u2018dealer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, in summarizing the definition of \u201cbank,\u201d the Report highlights its critical essence as including \u201cany ... bank performing normal banking functions, which is subject to supervision and examination by State and Federal authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The necessary implication of the Senate Report was that any bank already subject to administrative oversight need not be subjected to the new regulatory regime that the bill established for nonbank brokers and dealers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In 1934, nonbank stockbrokers and securities traders, unlike banks, were not subject to any nationwide, systematic regulation or oversight by federal or state government authorities. The purpose of the 1934 Act was to bring <em>these </em>previously unregulated participants in financial markets under a regime of government supervision and examination analogous to that which the Glass-Steagall Act had already mandated for banks.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, one purpose of the 1934 Act\u2019s regulation of securities exchanges and broker-dealers was to protect America\u2019s banking system.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Pre1929 overextended margin accounts and unwise extensions of credit to brokers by banks had contributed to bank failures: financially precarious banks often could not collect on the loans made to brokers for margin purchases by the brokers\u2019 customers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As a result, some of the 1934 Act\u2019s most significant provisions regulate margin lending by brokers and control the credit that brokers can receive from banks. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78g, 78h. Because these banking-related provisions implicated the stability of the banking system, the 1934 Act entrusted the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with their administration. Although Congress decided to delegate the supervision and examination of exchanges and broker-dealers to a new agency, there is no indication that in 1934 Congress wanted this new agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>created for a particular specialization, to regulate the banks.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">To the contrary, there is much evidence in the Act\u2019s legislative history that Congress decided to exempt banks from the broker-dealer jurisdiction of the SEC because they were already subject to systematic government oversight. The original House and Senate bills did not expressly exclude banks from the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer.\u201d At the hearings, a prominent New York banker, William Potter, Chairman of the Guaranty Trust Company, complained before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency that the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer,\u201d as they then stood, would cover some securities services already being performed by banks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">[Bjanks of this country do not confine their activities solely to banking____ A very large proportion of the people of this country turn to their bankers for advice with respect to their investments and the purchase and sale of securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">Furthermore, banks are called upon constantly to act as the agent of others in the care and custody of securities, the placing of orders for their purchase and sale and in the completion of such transactions, including the receipt or delivery of securities against payment or receipt of the purchase price, and in the safe transmittal of such securities. Many people are utterly unfamiliar with the manner in which such transactions should be carried on ... and turn to the bankers in recognition of their experience and expertise in such matters____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-9\"><em>Stock Exchange Practices: Hearings Before the Senate Comm, on Banking and Currency, Part 15, </em>73d Cong., 1st Sess. 7222 (1934) [hereinafter cited as \u201cSenate Hearings\u201d]. After describing how banks engaged in activities that fit the then definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer,\u201d Potter went on to advocate that banks should nevertheless not be subjected to the new regulation proposed for nonbank brokers and dealers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-12\">Permit me to indulge in a further general observation. It seems to me that the regulation of the banks, so far as the National Government is concerned, should be confined to the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and other agencies within the Federal Reserve System. I doubt the wisdom of divided responsibility with respect to such matters, and it seems to me obvious that the banks should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of two arms of the Government whose purposes and policies might at times conflict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-13\"><em>Id. </em>Potter then specifically recommended that the bill be amended to exclude banks from the definition of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d: \u201cI submit that these definitions should be changed, or that some specific statement should be made that banks are not included in such definition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">At this point Ferdinand P\u00e9cora, the counsel to the Senate Committee and a draftsman of the 1934 Act, interrupted to say that he agreed that the bill should not include banks within the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the bill was reported out of the Senate Committee, it contained the new clauses excluding banks from the \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d definitions, as well as a definition of \u201cbank.\u201d The House version, ultimately enacted into law, was similarly amended in Committee to exclude banks from the definition of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d and to add a definition of \u201cbank.\u201d While the House and Senate bills used somewhat different language in defining \u201cbank,\u201d both versions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>identical in defining banks in terms of the government agencies that regulated them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Since the 1934 Act, Congress has repeatedly exempted banks from the jurisdiction of the SEC, and defined banks in precisely the same way. In 1940, when Congress enacted the Investment Company and Investment Advisers Acts, Congress repeated the same bank exemption from the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer,\u201d and also from the crucial definitions of \u201cinvestment company\u201d and \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d in these Acts. See 54 Stat. 791, 792, 798, 848; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80a-2(a)(6), (11), -3(c)(3), 80b-2(a)(3), (7), (11). Moreover, in these Acts Congress again defined banks in terms of the government agencies that regulated them. See 54 Stat. 791, 848; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80a-2(a)(5), 80b-2(a)(2). Thus, the definitions in the 1934 Act are but one part of a consistent congressional policy of keeping oversight of the banking system separate from the SEC\u2019s oversight of the securities trading and investment industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">2. <em>The Special Problem Posed by the Changing Interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The SEC contends that when Congress exempted banks from SEC broker-dealer regulation in 1934, it was acting under the impression that the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 precluded banks from brokering securities for a profit or for nonbanking customers. As evidence of this congressional understanding, the SEC points to the testimony of Thomas Corcoran before both the House and Senate Committees that considered the legislation. Corcoran, at the time, was counsel to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and an active participant in the drafting of the 1934 Act. Corcoran, too, argued vigorously that the original bill should be amended to exempt banks from broker-dealer regulation. In making his point to the Senate Committee, Corcoran referred extensively to his reading of the Glass-Steagall Act as barring retail brokerage activities by banks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-23\">Of course under the Glass-Steagall bill a bank can no longer peddle securities at retail. It can do two things: it can buy securities for its own account, for its own investment; and it can act as agent to transmit to a broker an order to purchase or sell securities, given to it by one of the bank\u2019s customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-24\">Certainly we had no conception when we drafted the language of this bill that it would be said that if a bank bought securities for its bond account, or merely transmitted, for a service charge, an order from a customer to a broker (because very often customers of banks do not know whom to go to for brokerage service), that operations of that kind on the part of a bank constituted transacting a business in securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-25\">And I might say that if there is any difficulty with that language, or any conception that it does cover a bank, acting as banks may act under the Glass-Steagall Act, then the language should be changed so that banks so acting are not within the scope of the language____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-27\">Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 6470.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-28\">Similarly, in his testimony before the House Committee, Corcoran pleaded, \u201cthe bill needs to be clarified, so that a bank which just acts for you in passing on an order to a broker ... does not come within that sort of provision,\u201d referring specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ly to the bill\u2019s restrictions on borrowing by brokers. <em>Stock Exchange Regulation: Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8270 Before the House Comm, on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </em>73d Cong., 2d Sess. 86 (1934). When asked by Representative Edward Kenney why banks should be exempted from these control-of-credit provisions, Corcoran responded: \u201cBecause there are plenty of other limitations on the banks. A bank cannot normally go in the business, like a broker, of dealing in securities.\u201d When the Congressman interrupted to protest that banks do act like a broker, Corcoran answered, \u201cThey are not allowed to do those things any longer, under the GlassSteagall bill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pressing Corcoran again on exactly what business banks were excluded from, the Congressman was sidestepped: \u201cYou may be able to answer that better than I can,\u201d said Corcoran. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The SEC uses the Corcoran testimony to make the following argument: Congress, in enacting the 1934 Act, adopted Corcoran\u2019s understanding that the Glass-Steagall Act precluded banks from engaging in brokerage activities for nonbanking customers. If it turns out that the Glass-Steagall Act in fact does not preclude these activities, then it follows that the SEC must be allowed to advance congressional intent by regulating these new retail brokerage activities of banks. It is not an illogical argument, but it does raise basic issues about the role of courts in construing legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Initially, we emphasize that we do not and need not rule today whether, in fact, the Glass-Steagall Act permits a bank, as opposed to a nonbanking subsidiary of a bank or a bank holding company, to engage in discount brokerage services for members of the general public who do not use the bank\u2019s banking services.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> An argument certainly could be made that a bank can do just that under the reasoning of <em>Securities Industry Association v. Comptroller of the Currency, </em>577 F.Supp. 252 (D.D.C.1983) (upholding the Comptroller\u2019s 1982 decision).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In any event, the question whether a bank itself can broker securities for nonbanking customers is squarely presented in a different case before this court, <em>Securities Industry Association v. Board of Governors, </em>Nos. 86-5089 et al. (oral argument held April 4, 1986) and we do not predict or rely on any particular outcome in that case to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">We will assume that Corcoran was incorrect in telling the 1934 Congress that the Glass-Steagall Act precluded banks from acting like other brokers. It still does not necessarily follow that we should attribute Corcoran\u2019s erroneous belief to Congress. A court must assure itself of strong evidence of congressional misapprehension before it goes on to decide what Congress would have done, if Congress had known the \u201ctruth.\u201d Indeed, there is a legitimate question whether a court should ever engage in such surrogate behavior. Here, the conclusion that Congress misinterpreted its own statute, enacted only a year before, in a crucial jurisdictional matter, requires a stronger evidentiary base than the SEC has offered. The end of the exchange between Corcoran and Representative Kenney suggests that Corcoran himself may have been less than totally sure about the effect of Glass-Steagall, since even he ultimately deferred to the legislators\u2019 greater familiarity with Glass-Steagall\u2019s scope. Corcoran\u2019s testimony as a whole may also reasonably be read as an advocate\u2019s argument that however GlassSteagall limits banks, they should be exempted from the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer.\u201d This interpretation of Corcoran\u2019s testimony would line up with the earlier recounted dialogue between P\u00e9cora, the Senate Committee counsel, and Potter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the New York banker, <em>see supra, </em>as further evidence that Congress\u2019 primary reason for exempting banks from SEC broker-dealer regulation was that banks were already extensively regulated by other federal and state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The SEC, however, calls our attention to the fact that Corcoran\u2019s interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act as precluding profit brokerage echoed that of the then Comptroller of the Currency, an official enforcer of the Act. Actually the Comptroller\u2019s first official interpretation of the GlassSteagall Act did not occur until after Congress passed the 1934 Exchange Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But even if we credit the SEC\u2019s argument that it corroborates some common understanding among significant outside participants in the process that the Act limited banks to accommodation brokerage transactions, we are still hesitant to conclude without more direct evidence from congressional sources themselves, <em>i.e., </em>reports or member statements, that Congress itself not only misunderstood the thrust of its own Glass-Steagall offspring, but proceeded to enact further legislation based primarily on that misconception.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Finally, even if we did accept the SEC\u2019s assumption that Congress, when enacting the Securities Exchange Act in 1934, acted on an erroneous premise that Glass-Steagall precluded retail bank brokerage activities, SEC\u2019s Rule 3b-9 still could not stand. Yet another assumption is essential to its validity: that if Congress had only known how the Comptroller and the courts were going to interpret the Glass-Steagall Act, Congress would not have exempted banks from the SEC\u2019s broker-dealer regulation. There is absolutely no evidence in the legislative history supporting (or negating) this assumption. It is entirely possible\u2014 though admittedly speculative \u2014 that had Congress anticipated a more liberal interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act, it would still have decided to leave banks in the hands of bank regulators alone, so as not to subject banks to the double-whammy of additional federal oversight. The contrary prediction may be just as plausible\u2014 and just as speculative. It comes down to this: It is not the job of courts to play the game of \u201cwhat if\u201d in predicting congressional reactions to hypothetical circumstances. Absent an express delegation to the SEC to take account of future changes in banking practices and/or banking regulatory activities, we must give effect to the unambiguous language of the statute itself. <em>Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial Corporation, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 681, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986). Our review of the legislative history of the 1934 Act does reveal some ambiguities in it \u2014 but these ambiguities cannot serve to erode the unambiguous language of the Act. There is no clear congressional intent to direct otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">C. <em>The 1975 Amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">We find in post-1934 events yet another reason to honor the clear statutory language in this case. Whatever Congress\u2019 understanding of the Glass-Steagall Act during the passage of the Securities Exchange Act in 1934, forty years later Congress reaffirmed the basic regulatory structure set up in the 1934 Act: banks are to be supervised exclusively by banking regulators and not by the SEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">In 1975, a year after the then Comptroller of the Currency issued his opinion letter repudiating the accommodation concept, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Congress enacted a comprehensive set of amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The House-passed version contained a provision that directed the SEC \u201cto make a study of the securities activities conducted by persons who are not brokers or dealers ... to determine ... whether the exclusion from the definition of broker and dealer are necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors and to achieve the purposes of this title.\u201d H.R. 4111, \u00a7 20A(j)(l). The Report of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce accompanying H.R. 4111 showed an awareness that the interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act was changing, and that banks were becoming increasingly involved in brokerage business: \u201cSince 1934, banks have been excluded from the definition of \u2018broker\u2019 and \u2018dealer\u2019 under the Securities Exchange Act. It had been thought that the Glass-Steagall Act had effectively removed banks from the securities business. In recent time, however, banks have undertaken a host of securities related activities.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 123, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 93 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The Senate bill did not contain a similar study provision, but the Conference Committee picked up the House provision. The Conference Report, however, tempered the House Report\u2019s reference to the original understanding of the Glass-Steagall Act: \u201cThese provisions do not authorize the Commission to study or make recommendations with respect to whether these activities are or should remain permissible under the Banking Act of 1933. This matter is the subject of a planned investigation by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 229, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. Ill (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, pp. 179, 342. With that caution, and some slight modification in language, the House-originated study provision was enacted into law. Act of June 4, 1975, Pub.L. No. 94-29, 89 Stat. Ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Thus, both Houses of Congress were aware as late as 1975 that the administrative interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act was undergoing considerable revision and that new interpretations of the Glass-Steagall Act might well bring banks actively into the retail brokerage business. Congress, moreover, was sufficiently concerned about the implications of this development to direct the SEC study. Nevertheless, Congress did not see fit then or since to amend the 1934 Act\u2019s definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d to include banks. Furthermore, rather than authorize appropriate rulemaking if, in its expertise, the SEC concluded that banks should be subject to broker-dealer regulation, Congress directed the agency to report back to Congress \u201cwith <em>recommendations for legislation </em>as it deems advisable.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78k-l(e) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Thus, in a new statute passed forty years after the Exchange Act, Congress determined not to amend the definitions of \u201cbroker,\u201d \u201cdealer\u201d or \u201cbank\u201d to authorize the SEC to regulate banks as broker-dealers without further congressional consideration. Especially in light of such recent action (or purposeful inaction), this court cannot now find authority for the SEC to amend the 1934 statutory definitions by administrative regulation, much as we might sympathize with the SEC\u2019s motivation for and the public interest in such regulation. That is a move that Congress alone can make. So far it has not chosen to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">D. <em>Relevant Caselaw</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYe\">The SEC cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>SEC v. Variable Annuity Life In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>surance Co. of America (VALIC), </em>359 U.S. 65, 79 S.Ct. 618, 3 L.Ed.2d 640 (1959), for the proposition that courts need not always feel bound by the literal language of exceptions to definitions in statutes enforced by the SEC. In <em>VALIC </em>the issues were whether a variable annuity contract was a \u201csecurity\u201d within the definition of that term in the Securities Act of 1933 and whether a company offering these variable annuity contracts was an \u201cinvestment company\u201d within the definition of that term in the Investment Company Act of 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">As the Supreme Court stated, the 1933 Act explicitly exempted \u201cinsurance\u201d or \u201cannuity\u201d contracts from the definition of \u201csecurity,\u201d and the 1940 Act explicitly exempted an institution which met the definition of \u201can insurance company\u201d from the definition of \u201can investment company.\u201d Except for the exemptions, the variable annuity contract and the companies that offered them would fall within the 1933 Act definition of \u201csecurity\u201d and the 1940 Act definition of \u201cinvestment company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The Investment Company Act defined an exempted \u201cinsurance company\u201d as \u201ca company ... whose primary and predominant business activity is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies and which is subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner or a similar official or agency of a State....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-2(a)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The 1933 Securities Act did not actually contain a definition of \u201cinsurance\u201d or \u201cannuity contract.\u201d The statute merely stated that its provisions \u201cshall not apply to ... any insurance ... or annuity contract, issued by a corporation subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner, bank commissioner, or any agency or officer performing like functions, of any State____\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The SEC points out the similarity between the exemptions in <em>VALIC </em>and those in this case; like the 1934 Act exemption for banks, the exemptions for annuities and insurance companies in <em>VALIC </em>were structured in terms of existing supervision by other agencies. The Supreme Court in <em>VALIC, </em>however, held that variable annuity contracts and the companies that offered them were not exempt from the statutory definitions of \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201cinvestment company\u201d and hence were subject to SEC regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Despite surface similarity, we find crucial distinctions between <em>VALIC </em>and this case. The decision in <em>VALIC </em>turned on the fact that a variable annuity contract contained markedly distinct features from a traditional fixed-dollar annuity contract. A \u201crecent development\u201d in 1959, a variable annuity paid out in \u201cfluctuating amounts, measured ultimately by the company\u2019s success in investing the premium payments received from annuitants.\u201d 359 U.S. at 95, 79 S.Ct. at 634 (Harlan, Jr., J., dissenting). Accordingly, the holder of a variable annuity, as opposed to a fixed annuity, \u201cparticipates on an \u2018equity\u2019 basis in the investment experience of the enterprise,\u201d just like the owner of a share of company stock or a mutual fund does. 359 U.S. at 79, 79 S.Ct. at 626 (Brennan, J., concurring). Thus, although a variable annuity contract by name might fit a literal reading of \u201cany insurance ... or annuity contract,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded that Congress, in exempting insurance-type contracts from SEC regulation, did not intend to exempt what were essentially equity shares, however labelled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">[AJbsent some guarantee of fixed income, the variable annuity places all the investment risks on the annuitant, none on the company. The holder gets only a <em>pro rata </em>share of what the portfolio of equity interests reflects \u2014 which may be a lot, a little, or nothing. We realize that life insurance is an evolving institution____ But we conclude that the concept of \u201cinsurance\u201d involves some risk-taking on the part of the company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">359 U.S. at 71, 79 S.Ct. at 621 (footnote omitted). And, since variable annuity contracts were not \u201cinsurance\u201d for the purposes of SEC regulation, a company that was organized to offer only variable annuities was not a company \u201cwhose primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>and predominant business activity is the writing of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In contrast, here there is no issue about whether members of the American Bankers Association meet the statutory definition of \u201cbank\u201d in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(6). While it is true that some such institutions are actively brokering securities and stock, the fact remains that a \u201csubstantial\u201d portion of the business of these institutions consists cf. traditional banking services.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is not then the analogue to <em>VALIC </em>where an institution calls itself a bank, but the substantial portion of its business does not consist of traditional banking services.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In <em>VALIC </em>the Supreme Court found sufficient imprecision in the statutory term \u201cinsurance\u201d to permit it to decide that a variable annuity did not fit that term. The Supreme Court did not conclude that although variable annuities concededly fell within the insurance exemption, sound regulatory policy required SEC oversight of these contracts (and the companies that offered them). Here, on the other hand, there is no question that the 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(6) definition of \u201cbank\u201d encompasses ABA members. Therefore, a validation of Rule 3b-9 would require this court to override unambiguous statutory language and to determine, for policy reasons, that SEC should be allowed to impose additional government oversight upon banks that engage in nonaccommodation brokerage activities. If nothing else, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial, supra, </em>precludes such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\"><em>Dimension Financial </em>was a case involving institutions whose only \u201cbanking\u201d services were offering \u201cnegotiable order of withdrawal\u201d or NOW accounts. The Bank Holding Company Act defined \u201cbank\u201d for the purposes of its operative provisions as including any institution \u201cwhich ... accepts deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand.\u201d <em>See </em>106 S.Ct. at 683. Although NOW accounts did not give depositors the legal right to withdraw upon demand, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System considered NOW accounts as the functional equivalent of traditional checking accounts and attempted to regulate institutions which offered them as banks. Therefore, despite the unambiguous statutory language, the Board of Governors issued a regulation that defined \u201cbanks\u201d under the Bank Holding Company Act as including \u201cany institution that ... accepts deposits that \u2018as a matter of practice\u2019 are payable on demand.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In invalidating the Board\u2019s regulation, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">Without doubt there is much to be said for regulating financial institutions that are the functional equivalent of banks. NOW accounts have much in common with traditional payment-on-demand checking accounts; indeed we recognize that they generally serve the same purpose. Rather than defining \u201cbank\u201d as an institution that offers the functional equivalent of banking services, however, Congress defined with specificity certain transactions that constitute banking subject to regulation. The statute may be imperfect, but the Board has no power to correct flaws that it perceives in the statute it is empowered to administer. Its rulemaking power is limited to adopting regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 689 (footnote omitted). Here, as in <em>Dimension Financial, </em>the 1934 Act may be imperfect in not allowing SEC regulation of banks that engage in discount brokerage activities, but here, as in <em>Dimension Financial, </em>the statutory definition of \u201cbank\u201d precludes the agency from issuing a regulation fundamentally altering that imperfect definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Thus, <em>Dimension Financial </em>and not <em>VALIC </em>controls our statutory interpretation in this case. We note as well that, in contrast to the congressional decision in 1975 to leave the bank exclusion intact, in <em>VALIC </em>there was no legislative reaffirmation of the exemptions after Congress be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>came aware of the problem of variable annuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">III. The \u201cContext Clause\u201d and the SEC\u2019s Authority to Define the Act\u2019s \u201cTerms\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In upholding the validity of Rule 3b-9, the District Court relied on the clause \u201cunless the context otherwise requires,\u201d which precedes all forty definitions contained in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c. The District Court held that the existence of this \u201ccontext\u201d clause rendered the statutory definitions of \u201cbroker,\u201d \u201cdealer,\u201d and \u201cbank\u201d imprecise, thereby triggering judicial deference to a reasonable agency interpretation of these terms under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The Court found Rule 3b-9 to represent a reasonable interpretation of \u201cbank\u201d because \u201cthe services now promoted by the bank[s] are functionally indistinguishable from those offered by registered brokers,\u201d a change from the circumstances in which banks \u201cmerely provided] accommodation services to existing customers.\u201d J.A. at 97. For the same reasons, the District Court held that the SEC\u2019s redefinition of \u201cbank\u201d fell within the delegation that \u201c[t]he Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as to matters within their respective jurisdictions, shall have power by rules and regulations to define technical, trade, accounting, and other terms used in this chapter, consistently with the provisions and purposes of this chapter.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(b). The SEC now argues that we should affirm the judgment of the District Court on one or both of these bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">A. <em>The Context Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">First and foremost, we do not accept the major premise of the SEC\u2019s context clause argument: that the phrase \u201cunless the context otherwise requires\u201d refers to out-of-Act market or regulatory circumstances as well as in-Act textual contexts. We read the context clause as meaning only that if in the case of a frequently occurring statutory term, its immediate context suggests that a literal application of the statutory definition would produce absurd consequences or run counter to the obvious thrust of the section, the agency may appropriately modify the definition. <em>See SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. 453, 466, 89 S.Ct. 564, 571, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969) (\u201cCongress itself has cautioned that the same words may take on a different coloration in different sections of the securities laws.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">It is true that the Supreme Court in <em>Marine Bank v. Weaver, </em>455 U.S. 551, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982), suggests that the context clause may authorize an agency or court to take account of outside circumstances in construing a term defined in the 1934 Act. That observation was, however, both unnecessary to the Court\u2019s holding<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and proffered only in a passing reference with no explanation or discussion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We are convinced by the more elab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>orately reasoned, <em>post-Marine Bank </em>decision in <em>Ruefenacht v. O\u2019Halloran, </em>737 F.2d 320 (3d Cir.1984), <em>aff\u2019d sub. nom. Gould v. Ruefenacht, </em>471 U.S. 701, 105 S.Ct. 2308, 85 L.Ed.2d 708 (1985), that the context clause does not confer such a broad license upon courts and the SEC to change basic decisions made by Congress. We will not repeat here Judge Gibbons\u2019 persuasive opinion in <em>Ruefenacht, </em>but only briefly summarize its discussion of the context clause\u2019s legislative history to explain why we conclude that \u201ccontext\u201d refers only to in-Act textual context.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The context clause in the 1934 Act had its origin in an identical clause which preceded all the definitions in the 1933 Securities Act. The Senate and House versions of the 1933 Act contained different versions of this prefatory clause. The House version contained the clause \u201cunless the <em>context </em>otherwise required.\u201d The Senate version simply read \u201cunless the <em>text </em>otherwise indicates.\u201d Although the Conference Committee adopted the House version, the Conference Report makes no mention of any difference between these prefatory clauses. The Third Circuit inferred from the absence of any discussion that the distinction between \u201ctext\u201d and \u201ccontext\u201d had no particular significance. We reach the same conclusion that \u201cCongress did not intend the context clause as a font of authority\u201d for the SEC to alter definitions in the 1934 Act \u201cwhen the underlying facts may seem to warrant.\u201d 737 F.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Even if we agreed that the context clause permits more input than is found inside the four walls of the statute, there would remain a serious question about when factual \u201ccontext\u201d actually \u201crequires\u201d deviation from the statutory definition. Specifically, if Congress exempted banks from SEC broker-dealer regulation to avoid imposing on banks additional government oversight regardless of precisely what bank brokerage activities Glass-Steagall allowed, can it reasonably be said that the relevant \u201ccontext\u201d has changed simply because banking regulators have now liberalized their interpretations of Glass-Steagall strictures? It sounds farfetched. But it illustrates the point that giving such sail to the context clause would embroil courts in constant controversies as to whether the context that had changed was really relevant at all. According wide deference to agency judgment on the relevance of the context could of course minimize judicial review responsibilities, but it would also revolutionize current rules of statutory construction and doctrines of plain meaning and congressional intent. It is too big a step to take on the basis of a rote phrase embedded in a definitional section of a complex statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">In closing out this discussion, we stress that even if the context clause on some other occasion might justify interpreting a statutory definition in light of changing market conditions, it cannot carry the weight of Rule 3b-9. Here, the unambiguous language that Congress chose for the statutory definitions of \u201cbroker,\u201d \u201cdealer,\u201d and \u201cbank\u201d (formulations that Congress repeated in the 1940 Investment Company and Investment Advisers Acts) expresses a congressional delineation of the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and banking regulators. A universal clause preceding every definition in the statute, which states only \u201cunless the context otherwise requires,\u201d cannot provide the authority for one of the agencies whose jurisdictional boundaries are defined in the statute to alter by administrative regulation those very jurisdictional boundaries. To suggest otherwise is to sanction administrative autonomy beyond the control of either Congress or the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">B. <em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Section 78c(b), on which the District Court also relied, gives the SEC authority to define technical, trade, accounting, and other terms only with respect to \u201cmatters within [its] jurisdiction [].\u201d The whole point of the bank exclusion clauses in the definitions of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer\u201d is to place banks outside the broker-dealer juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>diction of the SEC and leave them to the jurisdiction of banking regulators alone. The SEC cannot use its definitional authority to expand its own jurisdiction and to invade the jurisdiction of other agencies, including the Board of Governors. Such use of \u00a7 78c(b) would not be \u201cconsistent [ ] with the provisions and purposes of this chapter.\u201d <em>Cf FAIC Securities, Inc. v. United States, </em>768 F.2d 352, 362 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (holding that a similar grant of definitional authority to the FDIC did not allow the agency to expand its jurisdiction by redefining terms already defined by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Indeed, the very language of \u00a7 78c(b) reminds us that Congress delegated to the Board of Governors, and not the SEC, the authority to enforce certain provisions of the 1934 Act and so to define terms fully within its enforcement authority. Thus, even if it could be shown that Congress intended to delegate the authority to redefine \u201cbank\u201d so as to bring banks back within the definition of \u201cbroker\u201d and \u201cdealer,\u201d we would have no statutory basis for deciding which agency Congress chose for this delegation. Contrary to the SEC\u2019s assumption that it would be the only logical choice, we think the fact that an institution meets the statutory definition of \u201cbank\u201d simply by being within the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve System suggests that the Board of Governors might be the more likely candidate. At base, however, we cannot read the 1934 Act as granting either agency the authority to redetermine jurisdictional boundaries laid down in the 1934 Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under the law as presently written, that is a task that Congress has reserved for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">In the end, all of the SEC\u2019s efforts to avoid the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the definitions of \u201cbroker,\u201d \u201cdealer\u201d and \u201cbank\u201d fail. We give effect to the statutory language not simply because its meaning is as \u201cplain\u201d as can be, but because it reflects a basic decision by Congress on how to allocate responsibility among different federal agencies for regulating financial institutions and markets. Rule 3b-9, whatever its beneficial purpose or the regulatory need for some such authority, still represents an attempt by one federal agency to reallocate, on its own initiative, the regulatory responsibilities Congress has purposefully divided among several different agencies. It is tantamount to one of the regulatory players unilaterally changing the rules of the game. The SEC by itself cannot extend its jurisdiction over institutions expressly entrusted to the oversight of the Comptroller, the Board of Governors, the FDIC, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Given the dramatic changes in the nature of financial institutions and market practices in the last fifty years, Congress might do well to undertake a comprehensive reexamination of the Glass-Steagall Act and the Securities Acts. Indeed, it might well determine from such a reexamination that banks should be allowed to engage in brokerage business like any other broker, but that banks should be regulated by the SEC like any other broker. Until that day, however, the SEC operates under the limited authority of the 1934 Act and must refrain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>from regulating banks as broker-dealers.

The only imprecise element in the statutory definition of bank is the word \u201csubstantial\u201d in the third of the three enumerated means by which an institution can qualify as a bank for the purposes of the Exchange Act, <em>i.e., </em>if it is \"a banking institution ... a <em>substantial </em>portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks ... and which is supervised by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks.\" But the content of \"substantial\u201d is not at issue in this case. An institution qualifies as a bank under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(6) simply because it has a national charter or because it is a member of the Federal Reserve System; for these institutions there is no inquiry as to whether a \"substantial portion of [their] business\u201d consists of exercising traditional banking functions. Additionally, no claim has been made even for those members of the ABA that must qualify under the third prong, that despite their increased brokerage business, \u201ca substantial portion of [their] business [does not] consist of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to national banks.\" Only if a state-chartered banking institution that was not a member of the Federal Reserve System were to become so engrossed with the business of brokering securities that receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers became an <em>insubstantial </em>portion of its business would it fail to qualify as a \u201cbank,\" and hence meet the statutory definition of \"broker\u201d or \u201cdealer,\" subjecting it to broker-dealer regulation under the 1934 Act. Rule 3b-9, of course, does not purport to turn on the meaning of \"substantial,\" but rather attempts to reach banks which clearly satisfy all three alternatives set forth in the statutory definition of bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b855-6\">. <em>See also </em>H.Rep.

The Senate Report states in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\">The evidence submitted to the committee by experts on the staff of the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that uncontrolled speculation on security markets was an important cause of the credit inflation which led to the collapse of 1929 and the subsequent depression. Banks diverted their credit from agriculture, commerce and industry to the stock market, where it contributed to the over-expansion of big enterprises, largely engaged in interstate commerce. Corporations took advantage of the abnormal demand for securities by raising new capital, which was not necessary for plant expansion, but which they loaned in the call-money market, thus encouraging further speculation. When the crash finally came, brokers\u2019 loans were called, causing greater depreciation in the value of securities, including those held in bank portfolios. This contributed largely to the widespread bank failures, which imperiled the national banking structure____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">S.Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\">. Congress considered two alternatives before it decided to create the SEC. One plan was to have all the provisions of the statute administered by the Board of Governors. 78 Cong. Rec. 8162 (1934). The other proposal was that the Board of Governors should administer only those provisions affecting banks and banking, and that the Federal Trade Commission should administer the exchanges and broker-dealers. <em>Id. </em>Congress rejected these alternatives because it did not want existing agencies directly involved with the oversight of exchanges and broker-dealers. Congress wanted a new commission to handle this specialty, but Congress also limited the new commission to this specialty; Congress did not intend the new commission to involve itself with the Federal Reserve System. <em>See id. </em>at 8161-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b857-11\">. The Senate and House bills both had identical exemptions for \"a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States\u201d and for \"a member bank of the Federal Reserve System.\u201d The Senate bill additionally included in its definition \"a banking institution ... the business of which includes banking and/or the administration of trusts and/or other functions normally performed by banks, which is supervised or examined by State or Federal banking authority, and which does not normally and customarily rehypothecate securities hypothecated with it.\u201d S. 3420, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 3(a)(6). Insofar as the House version, which did not contain the additional condition concerning hypothecation of securities, was adopted by Congress, the legislative history reinforces the conclusion that Congress did not intend the exemption for banks from the definitions of \"broker\" and \u201cdealer\u201d to depend in any way on the securities activities of banking institutions under banking regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b858-6\">. The Supreme Court has held that a nonbanking subsidiary of a bank holding company may operate a discount brokerage business. <em>Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors, </em>468 U.S. 207, 104 S.Ct. 3003, 82 L.Ed.2d 158 (1984). The Court, however, expressly left open the question whether a bank itself could engage in discount brokerage activities for nonbanking customers. <em>Id. </em>at 219 n. 20, 104 S.Ct. at 3011 n. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b858-16\">. <em>See supra </em>n. 4 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\">. Because Congress delayed for a year the operation of \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act, they did not even go into effect until June 16, 1934, ten days after the enactment of the Securities Exchange Act. Thus, the Comptroller had no occasion to officially apply these sections until after Congress passed the 1934 Act. Moreover, during that year, the meaning of \u00a7\u00a716 and 21 was anything but settled. The Comptroller believed that the language of \u00a7 16, as originally enacted, absolutely prohibited banks from brokering <em>stocks </em>even if \"without recourse\u201d and only \"upon the order, and for the account of, customers.\u201d <em>See, supra, </em>n. 2. Yet, because he did not believe that Congress intended to reach this result, the Comptroller was urging Congress to amend Glass-Steagall to explicitly allow these bank brokerage activities. <em>See </em>Kress, The Banking Act of 1935, 34 Mich.L. Rev. 155, 177-78 (1935) (citing 1933 Annual Report of the Comptroller of the Currency).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b860-5\">. In its response to Congress' directive, the SEC concluded that the exclusion of banks in the definitions of \"broker\u201d and \"dealer\" should not be eliminated, saying that the imposition of its broker-dealer regulation on banks would result in \"duplicative and burdensome regulation.\" <em>Reports on Bank Securities Activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission, S. Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, </em>95th Cong., 1st Sess. 305 (Comm.Print 1977). Instead, to the extent that bank brokerage activities needed additional regulation in order to \u201cassure adequate investor protection,\u201d the SEC recommended that Congress require federal banking regulators to promulgate such rules. <em>Id. </em>at 305-08.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\">. <em>See, supra, </em>n. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">. The issue in <em>Marine Bank </em>was whether a bank certificate of deposit was a \"security\" for the purposes of the 1933 Securities .Act. Although the Supreme Court acknowledged that the statutory definition of \"security\u201d was sufficiently broad to cover a bank certificate of deposit, the inherent nature and function of the instrument was such that it did not make sense to classify it as a \"security\u201d for purposes of the 1933 Act. <em>Marine Bank </em>holds only that in order to determine whether a particular financial instrument is a security, one must examine the underlying economic realities. A more recent Supreme Court decision, <em>Landreth Timber Company v. Landreth, </em>471 U.S. 681, 105 S.Ct. 2297,85 L.Ed.2d 692 (1985), also supports reading <em>Marine Bank </em>as a case stressing the need to consider the underlying economic realities in charting inherently imprecise contours of the term \u201csecurity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 2304 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4. Even without a context clause, the Court would have done the same thing and arrived at the same conclusion. Thus, because the 1933 Act definition of \"security,\u201d unlike the 1934 Act definition of \"bank\u201d often requires an independent examination of factual circumstances, it would go too far to infer from <em>Marine Bank </em>a general interpretation of the \"context\u201d clause allowing some kind of economic realities test for all forty definitions in the Securities Exchange Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b863-13\">. The opinion simply stated: \"The definition of \u2018security\u2019 in the 1934 Act provides that an instrument which seems to fall within the broad sweep of the Act is not to be considered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>security if the context otherwise requires.\u201d 455 ts. at 558-59, 102 S.Ct. 1224-25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b865-5\">. As part of the 1975 amendments to the 1934 Act, Congress added \"other\" terms to the list of generic definitions contained in \u00a7 78c(b). According to the Senate Report the purpose of this amendment was \"to broaden the authority of the Commission and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to make clear that they may define any term used in the Exchange Act, whether or not it is already defined in the title.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 94 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, 272. This language does not alter our determination that the SEC cannot redefine a statutory term if doing so would encroach on the jurisdiction of the Board of Governors. We note further that the amendment to the SEC\u2019s definitional authority appears in the same statute that directed the SEC to make recommendations for <em>legislation </em>concerning whether the Exchange Act should be amended to include banks within the definitions of broker and dealer. <em>See, supra, </em>Part II.C. It seems highly unlikely that in the same Act, the legislators would direct the SEC to make a <em>study </em>of the precise question here and recommend legislation on it, and also authorize the SEC to decide that very same question any way it chose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
