The City cross-appeals, asserting there was insufficient evidence to justify submission of this case to the jury on either count. We affirm the judgment entered on the jury verdicts, but remand the case with directions that the District Court consider the merits of Jones\u2019s motion for injunctive relief and that it exercise its discretion with regard to Jones\u2019s post-trial motion for costs and attorney and expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Jones brought suit against the City, alleging that failure of the City\u2019s waste disposal system caused a waste treatment lagoon to overflow into a lake located on Jones\u2019s property and was responsible for the eutrophication of the lake, for a fish-kill that depleted the fishing stock, and for damage to the Merimac River, into which water from Jones\u2019s lake eventually flows. Count I of the complaint alleged a violation of the Clean Water Act and sought injunctive relief, civil penalties, costs, and attorney fees, as authorized under the terms of the Act. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1365 (West 1986). Count II alleged a state law claim based on the theory of common law nuisance and sought damages, injunctive relief, and costs. At Jones\u2019s insistence, and without objection by the City, both counts were submitted to the jury. The jury found that the City was in violation of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the jury found for Jones on his common law nuisance claim and awarded him damages of $15,000. Following this verdict, Jones moved for injunctive relief under \u00a7 1365(a) of the Clean Water Act and under a common law nuisance theory, and for an award of costs and attorney and expert witness fees under \u00a7 1365(d) of the Clean Water Act. The District Court denied the motion, ruling that submission of the Clean Water Act claim to the jury barred Jones from recovering his costs or fees. Similarly, in denying injunctive relief, the Court ruled that the request for injunctive relief was barred because of Jones\u2019s insistence on submission of the entire case to the jury. Appendix (App.) at 100, 101.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">Turning first to the cross-appeal, the City contends that insufficient evidence was presented to allow this case to go to the jury. The City did not raise this issue during trial, either in a motion for directed verdict or in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Insufficiency of the evidence was first raised by the City in a motion for new trial following entry of the District Court\u2019s judgment. This Court has repeatedly held that when the moving party has not made a motion for directed verdict or a motion j.n.o.v., \u201c \u2018[w]e cannot test the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict beyond application of the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine in order to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shell v. Missouri Pacific R.R., </em>684 F.2d 537, 540 (8th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Karja</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>la v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>523 F.2d 155, 157 (8th Cir.1975)); <em>see also U.S. v. Bass, </em>618 F.2d 500, 503 (8th Cir.1980). In <em>Harris v. Zurich Insurance Co., </em>527 F.2d 528 (8th Cir.1975), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT0\">At trial, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not move for a directed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Under such circumstances, we are generally powerless to review the sufficiency of the evidence except for plain error. However, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did file a motion for a new trial on grounds of insufficiency of the evidence. The motion was denied and plaintiffs assigned this denial as error in their notice of appeal. This affords us an opportunity to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial on the grounds of insufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 529-30 (citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In a footnote, the Court explained its holding, stating, \u201cWe are not technically reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. Rather, we are reviewing whether the district judge has abused his judicial discretion in denying a new trial or whether as a matter of law the denial of a new trial was erroneous because there was an \u2018absolute absence of evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530 n. 1 (quoting <em>Urti v. Transport Commercial Corp., </em>479 F.2d 766, 769 (5th Cir.1973)). Applying this standard, we find no abuse of discretion in the submission of both counts to the jury or in the denial of the City\u2019s motion for a new trial. By introducing evidence that the City had failed to obtain National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits, which are required by the Clean Water Act as a prerequisite to legal discharge, Jones sufficiently raised a factual question as to whether the City had violated the Clean Water Act. Jones also made a submissible case on his nuisance claim. Dr. Eigner, Jones\u2019s primary expert witness, testified that the numerous bypasses from the City sewage lagoon into Jones\u2019s lake were sufficient \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty\u201d to \u201cdirectly contribute[ ] to the formation of the duckweed covering the lake,\u201d Transcript (Tr.) at 159, 162, and that in his opinion, \u201cthe pollution from the bypasses and from the lagoon [was] the major ... factor in the eutrophication, that is, the death of the lake \u2014 [of which] the fish kill was just one manifestation.\u201d Tr. at 162. Dr. Eigner also stated that repair of Jones\u2019s lake would require as a first step the \u201cstop [of] all future pollution from the City waste water system.\u201d Tr. at 164. Finding no abuse of discretion by the District Court, we affirm the denial of the City\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Jones\u2019s appeal raises the issue of whether submission of the Clean Water Act and nuisance claims to the jury precludes him, after he has obtained a jury verdict in his favor on both claims, from obtaining a ruling by the District Court on the merits of his request for injunctive relief. The City first argues that during a trial conference, Jones specifically waived his right to seek injunctive relief under the Clean Water Act and therefore is barred from seeking such relief. We find this argument meritless. The District Court did not purport to find a waiver, and after a careful review of the record, including those portions that the City particularly has called to our attention, we find nothing from which we could conclude that Jones waived his claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In a second attempt to bar Jones\u2019s request for injunctive relief under the Clean Water Act, the City cites <em>United States v. Ferro Corp., </em>627 F.Supp. 508, 23 E.R.C. 2052 (BNA M.D.La.1986), and suggests that because Jones\u2019s Clean Water Act claim was submitted to the jury even though only equitable relief was sought under that claim, Jones should be denied injunctive relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not rule on the propriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of submitting the Clean Water Act claim to the jury. The City did not object to the submission of that claim to the jury and the issue is therefore not properly before us. Moreover, even assuming that the submission was incorrect, we see no reason why this should bar consideration of Jones\u2019s request for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The narrow question that is before us is whether submission of Jones\u2019s case to the jury, without objection by the City, should result in the automatic denial of Jones\u2019s request for injunctive relief. We think it should not. All that the jury was asked to do with respect to Jones\u2019s Clean Water Act claim was to decide whether the City had violated the Act. The jury was not asked to decide the relief, if any, that Jones should have in the event a violation was found. Since the relief available under the Act is equitable in nature,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the injunctive relief sought under the common law nuisance claim also sounds in equity, the power to grant or deny that relief clearly resides in the trial judge. <em>See Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. 305, 311-12, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 1802-03, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982). It is settled law that when the same case involves both legal and equitable claims, the legal claims are tried to the jury and the equitable claims are tried to the court. <em>Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, </em>369 U.S. 469, 479, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 844 (1962); <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 508, 79 S.Ct. 948, 955, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959). The District Court\u2019s post-trial ruling that it would not consider Jones\u2019s motion for injunctive relief because to do so would require the court to reopen the case is not supported by anything that we can discern in the record. Moreover, that ruling is inconsistent with long-established law and practice and is, we believe, untenable. We therefore remand this case to the District Court and direct the court to give appropriate consideration to the merits of Jones\u2019s request for injunctive relief. In so doing, we express no opinion as to the merits of that request. We merely hold that Jones is entitled to have the District Court consider the merits of his request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Jones also appeals the summary denial by the District Court of his motion for costs and attorney and expert witness fees. The Clean Water Act leaves the awarding of costs and fees to the discretion of the court. Section 1365(d) of the Act states, \u201cThe court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\u201d The statute plainly vests the trial court with broad discretion. We believe, however, that upon a proper motion for costs and fees, the trial court has a duty to exercise that discretion. Moreover, the responsibility to decide this matter rests solely with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the trial judge. It cannot be shifted to the jury by submission to the jury of the basic question of whether the defendant has violated the Clean Water Act. We therefore remand this case to the District Court and direct the court to consider and exercise its discretion with regard to Jones\u2019s motion for costs and attorney and expert witness fees under \u00a7 1365(d). In so doing, we express no view as to whether the court should award costs and fees. We merely direct the court to exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">We affirm the judgment of the District Court entered upon the jury verdicts in favor of Jones. We remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion insofar as Jones\u2019s requests for injunctive relief, costs, and attorney and expert witness fees are concerned.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\">. The Order stated, \"Plaintiff in the instant case elected to submit the issue of liability under the Act to the jury, which rendered a judgment of liability without imposing penalties or costs. The Court will not reopen the judgment to award plaintiff the costs of obtaining $15,000 private damages for nuisance.\u201d App. at 101. With regard to the request for injunctive relief, the District Court made a similar determination, stating, \"The Court will not now reopen the judgment to entertain what is essentially a new cause of action for injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\">. In <em>Ferro, </em>the court held that \"there is no right to a trial by jury in an action brought by the United States pursuant to the Clean Water Act.\" 23 E.R.C. at 2054. The Fourth and Eleventh Circuits have held that suits for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act are equitable in nature and do not implicate the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>United States v. Tull, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>769 F.2d 182 (4th Cir.1985) <em>cert. granted in part, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2244 (1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>M.C.C. of Florida, Inc., Ill </em>F.2d. 1501, 90 L.Ed.2d 691 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a) states, in part, \"The district courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such an effluent standard or limitation, or such an order [issued by the Administrator or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation], or to order the Administrator to perform such act or duty, as the case may be, and to apply any appropriate civil penalties under section 1319(d) of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The Supreme Court has interpreted the Clean Water Act as leaving broad equitable discretion with the trial judge. <em>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. 305, 320, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 1807, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982); <em>see also U.S. v. Akers, </em>785 F.2d 814, 823 (9th Cir.1986). In <em>Weinberger, </em>the Court held that the statutory extension of equitable powers under the Clean Water Act does not limit the application by trial courts of other traditional equitable remedies consistent with the Act. The Court stated, \u201cThat the scheme as a whole contemplates the exercise of discretion and balancing of equities militates against the conclusion that Congress intended to deny courts their traditional equitable discretion in enforcing the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>456 U.S. at 316, 102 S.Ct. at 1805. The Court continued, \"We read the [Clean Water Act] as permitting the exercise of a court\u2019s equitable discretion, whether the source of pollution is a private party or a federal agency, to order relief that will achieve <em>compliance </em>with the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 102 S.Ct. at 1806.
