SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b776-18\">The August 27, 1985, judgment of the United States Court of International Trade,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> holding that certain merchandise imported by Pagoda Trading Corporation (Pagoda) was \u201cdeemed liquidated\u201d 1 year after entry into the United States, is affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-19\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-20\">The two issues are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-21\">1. Whether the Court of International Trade erred in holding that Pagoda\u2019s protest was sufficient to establish jurisdiction for the court to decide the \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d issue, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-22\">2. Whether the Court of International Trade erred in finding that there was no valid basis for suspension of liquidation, that no extension of liquidation was effected, and that Pagoda\u2019s entries were deemed liquidated at the rate of duty, value, and amount of duties asserted by Pagoda at the time of entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-24\">Pagoda is an importer of Korean footwear, including moon boots and snowmobile boots. This case involves the computation of the duty on Pagoda\u2019s imported merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-25\">The final computation of the duty on imported merchandise is known as \u201cliquidation.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, merchandise must be liquidated within 1 year after entry into the United States or else it \u201cshall be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>liquidated at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary of the Treasury may extend the 1-year period for liquidation by giving notice of \u201cextension\u201d to the importer for certain reasons including \u201csuspension\u201d of liquidation \u201cas required by statute or court order.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In the present case, the liquidation of Korean footwear was suspended from April 7, 1980, to March 18, 1981, pursuant to the order of the Department of Commerce (Commerce) (based on an earlier countervailing duty order). On five occasions between August 5, 1980, and September 9, 1980, Pagoda entered Korean footwear into the United States, and liquidation was suspended pursuant to the April 7, 1980, Commerce order.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">On March 17, 1981, the relevant countervailing duty order was revoked. On March 18, 1981, Commerce notified the United States Customs Service (Customs) to proceed with liquidation of Korean footwear. Notwithstanding the directive to proceed with liquidation, during July and August 1981 Customs sent Pagoda computer-generated notices that liquidation was suspended for at least four of the five entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The Court of International Trade held that there was no basis for the computer-generated notices and, thus, the notices were not valid to suspend liquidation. The court also held that the notices of \u201csuspension\u201d were not effective to serve as notices of \u201cextension\u201d of the period for liquidation under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1504 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Section 1504 allows only 1 year from the date of entry for liquidation to occur, subject to valid extensions of that period. If the merchandise is not liquidated within 1 year, it \u201cshall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty * * * asserted at the time of entry by the importer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the Court of International Trade held that the entries made by Pagoda from August 5, 1980, to September 9, 1980, were deemed liquidated by operation of law 1 year after the entries were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Without regard for the \u201cdeemed liquidation,\u201d on February 26, 1982, Customs stated that it was liquidating all five Pagoda entries using American Selling Price appraisement, resulting in a duty higher than that asserted at the time of entry by Pagoda. On May 24, 1982, Pagoda submitted a protest challenging the appraisement and classification of the merchandise. On June 18, 1982, Pagoda filed a supplement to the protest, asserting that the February 26, 1982, liquidation was invalid because of the earlier \u201cdeemed liquidation.\u201d On July 29, 1982, the protest was denied. Pagoda brought an action in the Court of International Trade contesting the denial of the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">The Court of International Trade asserted jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a) (1982). The court entered summary judgment in favor of Pagoda, holding that the \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d occurred by operation of law prior to the February 26,1982, liquidation asserted by Customs. The Government appeals. Jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(5) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">A. <em>Jurisdiction of the Court of Internar tional Trade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">The Court of International Trade has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a) (1982) over a civil action to contest the denial of a protest under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1514, 1515 (1982). Pagoda\u2019s May 24, 1982, protest was timely filed within 90 days of the February 26,1982, liquidation asserted by Customs. The May 24, 1982, protest was based on two grounds of objection under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-16\">(1) the appraised value of the merchandise; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>(2) the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">On June 18, 1982, Pagoda filed a supplement to the protest asserting that a \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d had occurred 1 year after each entry, and that Customs\u2019 classification and appraisement, as effected by the February 26, 1982, liquidation, were invalid. The trial court found that Pagoda filed the supplement shortly after the time for filing a protest had expired, but prior to disposition of the protest as required by section 1514.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In asserting the \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d issue, the supplement raised a \u201cnew ground\u201d of objection under the following category of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">(5) the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry, or any modification thereof[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In <em>Old Republic Insurance Co. v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the importer protested the duties resulting from a liquidation and later filed a supplement alleging that liquidation was improper because of Customs\u2019 failure to send a notice of extension of liquidation. The Court of International Trade held that the supplement was permissible because (1) the original protest was sufficient to advise Customs that the liquidation was being protested and (2) new grounds may be presented in support of objections raised by a protest at any time prior to the disposition of the protest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Here, the trial court found that Pagoda\u2019s supplement (raising the new ground of deemed liquidation) was timely because it related to the original protest of the classification and appraisement decisions and because the new ground was raised \u201cprior to the disposition of the protest.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Government has failed to show that the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous or that the court erred as a matter of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">The trial court also was correct in holding that the supplement filed by Pagoda challenged the same \u201cdecisions\u201d as those challenged in the original protest. Since the supplement did not challenge a different \u201cdecision,\u201d but merely raised a \u201cnew ground\u201d in support of the objections in the original protest, the supplement did not have to be filed within the 90-day period after the February 26, 1982, liquidation asserted by Customs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Computime, Inc. v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> involving entries of watches composed of a watch module and case attached to a watchband. Computime filed a timely protest on the classification of the watch modules only. <em>After </em>Customs rendered a favorable decision on the first protest, Computime then filed a second protest on the classification of the watchband. The Federal Circuit held that the second protest was impermissible because a decision already had been rendered on a protest involving a separate item in the same entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-19\">Here, Pagoda was permitted to file the supplement raising \u201c[n]ew grounds in support of objections raised by a valid protest * * * at any time <em>prior to the disposition </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>of the </em>protest.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) Pagoda\u2019s supplement related to the original protest in that it objected to the same classification and appraisement decisions effected by the February 26,1982, liquidation asserted by Customs. The trial court found that the supplement was timely filed with Customs prior to the disposition of the protest, and the Government has failed to show clear error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d issue was properly and timely raised before Customs during the section 1514 protest and the section 1515 review. Therefore, the Court of International Trade correctly exercised jurisdiction to decide the \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d issue in the ensuing civil action contesting the denial of the protest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">B. <em>Deemed Liquidation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Section 1504 of 19 U.S.C. sets a limit of 1 year for liquidation (final computation of duty) of imported merchandise. The 1-year period may be extended \u201cby giving notice of such extension to the importer\u201d for any of the following reasons:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">(1) information needed for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise is not available to the appropriate customs officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">(2) liquidation is suspended as required by statute or court order; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">(3) the importer, consignee, or his agent requests such extension and shows good cause therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Here, Customs sent computer-generated notices of \u201csuspension\u201d to Pagoda in July and August 1981. The Government concedes that it does not know why these notices were sent, stating only that the computer previously had been programmed to send the notices automatically. The trial court correctly held that there was no valid basis for suspension of liquidation \u201cas required by statute or court order,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> since the countervailing duty order had been revoked and Customs had been directed to <em>proceed </em>with liquidation several months before the notices of suspension were sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">The Government argues that the notices of \u201csuspension\u201d should be considered notices of \u201cextension,\u201d as authorized by the broader three categories of section 1504(b), and that the use of incorrect terminology was harmless error. The trial court, however, held that \u201c[n]o such notice of an extension was given to plaintiff in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court found that there was no evidence that any authorized official had granted an extension, and that there was no basis for extension such as a lack of information available to Customs or a request by the importer for an extension.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">Since there was no extension of the period for liquidation, the merchandise imported by Pagoda was \u201cdeemed liquidated\u201d 1 year after the respective entries, \u201cat the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d occurred by operation of law prior to the February 26, 1982, liquidation asserted by Customs.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-20\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-21\">The Government has failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous or that the court erred as a matter of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judgment of the Court of International Trade, holding that liquidation was deemed to have occurred by operation of law prior to the February 26, 1982, liquidation asserted by Customs, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\">. <em>Pagoda Trading Co. v.

Although there is certainly merit to the majority\u2019s view, I am not convinced of the soundness of its conclusory treatment of the term \u201cdecision\u201d in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514. The majority merely states, as if it is intuitively obvious, that \u201cdeemed liquidation\u201d is a \u201cnew ground\u201d under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(c)(1) and that \u201cliquidation\u201d is not a separate decision from the \u201cappraisement\u201d or \u201cclassification\u201d decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">Section 1514(a) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\"><em>[DJecisions </em>of the appropriate customs officer ..., as to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">(1) the appraised value of merchandise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">(2) the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">(5) the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">shall be final and conclusive upon all persons unless a protest is filed____ [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">Section 1514(c)(1) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">\u201cA protest of a <em>decision under subsection (a) </em>... shall be filed in writing ... setting forth distinctly and specifically <em>each decision </em>described in subsection (a) of this section as to which protest is made____ A protest may be amended, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to set forth objections as to a decision or decisions described in subsection (a) of this section which were not the subject of the original protest, in the form and manner prescribed for a protest, any time prior to the expiration of the time in which such protest could have been filed under this section. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-17\">It is my view that the supplement filed by Pagoda constitutes a challenge to the decision to \u201cliquidate,\u201d a \u00a7 1514(a)(5) decision, and is not merely a \u201cnew ground\u201d to challenge the \u201cappraisement,\u201d a \u00a7 1514(a)(1) decision, or the \u201cclassification,\u201d a \u00a7 1514(a)(2) decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-19\">It appears that the majority opinion holds that henceforth an importer may challenge any aspect of the Customs Officer\u2019s entry determination at any time before disposition of the protest because only \u201cone\u201d administrative decision is actually made rather than separate and distinct administrative decisions regarding appraisement, classification, liquidation, etc. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a)(l)-(7). Restated, the decision <em>to liquidate </em>(legality of the act) is subsumed within a decision on appraisement or classification (correctness of the act). While this holding may be pleasing to sound notions of equity, it does not square with the statute\u2019s delineation of \u201cseparate and distinct decisions\u201d that are made by the Customs Officers at time of possible entry. <em>See United States v. Deringer, </em>593 F.2d 1015, 1020 (CCPA 1979) (\u201cThe statute contemplates that both the legality and correctness of a liquidation be determined, at least initially, via the protest procedure. The wording of this statute makes it clear that any challenge to the propriety of a liquidation [not specifically excepted] must be through this statute.\u201d) <em>Cf. Computime, Inc. v. United States, </em>772 F.2d 874 (Fed. Cir.1985) (a protest must set forth distinctly and specifically the challenges to an entry).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
