EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">In this case, the appellant, New Radio Corporation (\u201cNew Radio\u201d), challenges a decision of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) granting Orange County Broadcasting Company (\u201cOrange County\u201d) authority to construct and operate a standard (AM) radio broadcast facility in Orange, California. The new AM service was designated to operate on the 830 kHz frequency. In a consolidated hearing in August of 1983, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) considered five mutually exclusive applications for this frequency, each specifying a different community of license in southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">In an initial decision released on March 28, 1984,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the AU recommended an award to Orange County. The AU first determined that he was unable to give a 307(b) preference to any of the competing applicants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under section 307(b) of the Federal Communications Act (the \u201cAct\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where two or more mutually exclusive applicants have specified different communities of license, the FCC must determine the relative need to each applicant\u2019s proposed service area for a new reception service and the relative need of each applicant\u2019s proposed community of license for a new transmission service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In considering this issue, the AU found that the applications for San Marcos (Western Radio Group), Orange (Orange County Broadcasting) and La Mirada (New Radio) indicated that these three communities were most in need of a first local outlet or transmission service; however, the AU concluded that \u201ca choice among them on 307(b) criteria is hardly scrutable in the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He therefore recommended an award to Orange County on traditional comparative grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-23\">On appeal, the Review Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) rejected the AU\u2019s determination that the evidence did not support a dispositive 307(b) preference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the Board accepted the AU\u2019s recommended grant to Orange County, finding that, under a 307(b) analysis, Orange had the greatest need for a first local transmission service.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission then denied New Radio\u2019s application for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-24\">Before this court, New Radio challenges the Commission\u2019s decision as inconsistent with agency and judicial precedent, and unsupported by substantial evidence. Because we find that the record clearly supports the Board\u2019s award of a 307(b) preference to Orange County, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">In 1980, the Commission announced that it expected the 830 kHz frequency to become available for use in the Los Angeles area as a result of rule revisions assigning AM unlimited-time Class II stations to Class I-A clear channels, and invited interested parties to apply for the station assignment. <em>International Notification of AM Station Assignments, </em>47 Rad. Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 896, 897-98 (May 29, 1980). After receiving nine mutually exclusive applications from qualified applicants, the Commission designated the applications for hearing in a consolidated proceeding. Noting that, \u201c[a]lthough most of the applications are for different communities, they would serve substantial areas in common,\u201d the Commission designated both a 307(b) issue and a contingent comparative issue for hearing. <em>Oceanside Radio, Inc.; Designating Applications for Consolidated Hearing on Stated Issues, </em>48 Fed.Reg. 13260, 13264 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Of the five applicants that participated in the hearing, the AU determined that only three had demonstrated that their respective communities of license were \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d communities for purposes of section 307(b). These were: Orange County, which specified the city of Orange, located approximately thirty-two miles from Los Angeles, with a 1980 population of 91,788; New Radio, which specified the city of La Mirada, approximately nineteen miles from Los Angeles, with a 1980 population of 40,986; and Western Radio Group, which specified the city of San Marcos, approximately one hundred miles from Los Angeles, with a 1980 population of 17,479.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In support of its claim that La Mirada possessed the \u201ctypical attributes\u201d of a separate and distinct community, New Radio submitted a detailed factual exhibit describing La Mirada\u2019s history, area and population, type of government and its public services, economic growth, business establishments, educational, transportation, cultural and recreational facilities and civic organizations. In its Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, New Radio sought a 307(b) preference for several reasons. First, it would provide a fourth reception service to the 120-square mile area surrounding La Mirada, and a fifth reception service to the surrounding 329-square mile area, thus providing additional reception services to a larger underserved area than any of the other applicants. Second, its daytime service would reach a larger area, in terms of population and geography, and its nightime service would reach a larger population, than would the corresponding service of any other applicant. Third, based on the community\u2019s \u201cdemographic, economic, governmental and other attributes,\u201d La Mirada had a greater need for local transmission service than the other communities at issue. Alternatively, New Radio argued that the wide-area coverage proposed by the applicants warranted eschewing a 307(b) analysis altogether in favor of a straight comparative analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The Review Board agreed with the AU that, although La Mirada should be considered a separate community under section 307(b), New Radio\u2019s proposed reception service advantages were too insignificant to warrant a 307(b) preference.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The AU had used a 307(b) analysis to determine that San Marcos, Orange and La Mirada were the communities most in <em>need </em>of first local transmission service. However, because he was unable to choose among them on 307(b) criteria, he relied on a straight comparative analysis in recommending the selection of Orange County. The AU never addressed New Radio\u2019s contention that the agency should assume wide-area service by all competing applicants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>eschew a section 307(b)-based decision in favor of a decision based solely on standard comparative factors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> New Radio did not revive its \u201cwide-area coverage\u201d contention in the exceptions it submitted to the Review Board. The Board therefore did not address this alternative argument. The Board agreed with the AU that none of the applicants\u2019 proposed new reception service was sufficient to warrant a 307(b) preference. However, the Board disagreed with the AU\u2019s finding that Orange County did not deserve a dispositive 307(b) preference on the basis of <em>transmission service. </em>On this latter point, the Board noted that the Commission presumes that the most populous community (Orange) has the greatest need for a first local service, provided it has commensurately greater civic, cultural, religious, social and commercial activities. Because the evidence showed Orange to be \u201csignificantly more developed\u201d than the other communities, the Board ruled that Orange merited a dispositive 307(b) preference.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">A. <em>Waiver of the </em>\u201cHuntington <em>Doctrine\" Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Despite the appellant\u2019s belated contentions to the contrary, this case is principally concerned with the application of section 307(b). Most of the evidence submitted to the AU supported the use of a traditional 307(b) analysis to determine which of the communities, if any, had the greatest need for a first local transmission service. Indeed, New Radio argued strenuously before the AU that it deserved a decisive preference under 307(b). In its exceptions to the AU\u2019s Initial Decision, New Radio agreed with the AU\u2019s finding that no party enjoyed a decisive advantage under section 307(b); nonetheless, the appellant again maintained that if a 307(b) preference was warranted, that preference should go to New Radio.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Most importantly, however, New Radio never suggested to the Board that the facts warranted a traditional comparative analysis based on the so-called <em>Huntington </em>doctrine. On the evidence before it, and in light of the exceptions presented by the parties, the Board found that four of the proposed cities of license were separate and distinct communities with their own needs for a first local transmission service, and that, of these, Orange had the greatest need, thus justifying a dispositive preference under section 307(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Following the Board\u2019s decision, New Radio filed an application for review with the FCC, in which it argued for the first time that the case was governed by the <em>Huntington </em>doctrine. <em>See Huntington Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>192 F.2d 33, 35 (D.C. Cir.1951). The <em>Huntington </em>doctrine recognizes that, for proposals involving high-power frequencies, where a suburban community is so closely integrated with a central city that it is a mere appendage of the urbanized area, it should not be considered a separate community for purposes of section 307(b). <em>Alessandro Broadcasting Co., </em>FCC 85-334, Order at 2 (released June 28, 1985), <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 74. As recently construed by this court, <em>see Beaufort County Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>787 F.2d 645, 649 (D.C.Cir.1986), <em>Huntington\u2019s </em>premise is that, \u201cwhere integrally related communities constitute a single metropolitan transmission service area, individual communities\u2019 needs should be presumed satisfied by the aggregate of stations in that area.\u201d In any case in which that presumption is warranted, a choice under section 307(b) cannot be made, and the choice becomes not \u201cwhich of two communities show[s] the greater need for a new station, but ... which of two applicants would better serve the one large community which both desire[] to cover.\u201d <em>Huntington Broadcasting, </em>192 F.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\"><em>Huntington </em>is the exception, and 307(b) the rule. <em>WHW Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>753 F.2d 1132, 1135-36 (D.C.Cir.1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Once the agency has before it evidence that the applicants' proposed communities of license are separate communities for 307(b) purposes, as the Review Board clearly did here, any applicant may seek to invoke the alternative analysis of <em>Huntington. </em>While it may be assumed that the Commission can consider the <em>Huntington </em>exception on its own motion in an appropriate case, it is generally recognized that the burden of invoking an exception will fall on the party seeking to apply it. In other words, section 307(b) will apply according to its terms unless a party makes a timely request for the consideration of an exception such as the <em>Huntington </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The record before us reveals that the appellant did not raise the <em>Huntington </em>issue until it had submitted its application for review by the full Commission. We reject New Radio\u2019s contention that its alternative argument before the <em>AU </em>\u2014 i.e., that the Commission should eschew the 307(b) analysis because of the wide-area coverage proposed \u2014 was somehow the equivalent of an argument that the competing communities were integral parts of Los Angeles and that the <em>Huntington </em>exception therefore applied. Not only are these arguments distinctly different, but the first requires the Commission to redefine \u201ccommunity\u201d in the AM radio context in a manner that it has expressly limited to the television context. <em>See Metro Broadcasting, Inc., </em>99 F.C.C.2d 688, 697-98 (Rev. Bd. 1984); <em>Cleveland Television Corp., </em>91 F.C.C.2d 1129, 1137 (Rev. Bd. 1982); <em>see also The Suburban Community Policy, the Berwick Doctrine and the De Facto Reallocation Policy, </em>93 F.C.C.2d 436, 457 (1983) <em>(\u201cSuburban Community Policy\u201d) </em>(finding no basis in the rulemaking record for applying such a redefinition in the radio context).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">As noted above, New Radio presented its case to the AU and Review Board almost entirely on 307(b) grounds. New Radio not only failed to suggest that the applicants\u2019 communities were integrally related to Los Angeles, but affirmatively and exhaustively demonstrated the separateness and independence of its own community of license, La Mirada, which was in fact the <em>nearest </em>of all the communities to the Los Angeles central city. Having thus chosen to present its entire <em>legitimate </em>case on 307(b) grounds, the appellant now seeks to escape the Board\u2019s unfavorable decision, rendered on those very grounds, by asserting that they were not the proper grounds to begin with. To permit such gamesmanship here would amount to giving New Radio two bites at the proverbial apple. Whatever claim might have been presented with respect to the <em>Huntington </em>doctrine was effectively waived by appellant\u2019s failure to raise the issue before the AU or the Board.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">B. <em>Applicability of the </em>Huntington <em>Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Even if we were satisfied that the appellant invoked <em>Huntington </em>in a timely manner, there would still be no basis upon which to overturn the judgment of the Commission in this case. New Radio failed to make any showing whatsoever on the relationship between the competing applicants\u2019 communities and the central city of Los Angeles, thus providing the AU and the Board with no evidentiary basis for applying the <em>Huntington </em>exception. In other words, appellant could not merely rely on the fact that the applicants\u2019 proposed communities of license were relatively near Los Angeles to presume the applicability of the <em>Huntington </em>exception. Indeed, with respect to AM service in particular (as distinguished from the television context), the Commission has thus far expressly declined to abandon its definition of \u201ccommunity\u201d as \u201cthe community specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>on the application\u201d in favor of a definition that encompasses \u201cthe community actually receiving service.\u201d <em>Suburban Community Policy, </em>93 F.C.C.2d at 457. Thus, it is clear that at the time these proceedings took place, the appellant had ample notice that the Commission did not have a policy of presuming that all communities in metropolitan areas are merely undifferentiated components of the larger metropolitan community.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In the absence of such a metropolitan-area presumption, the case law makes it clear that, in order to invoke the <em>Huntington </em>exception, the applicant must carry the burden of establishing the interdependence of the communities at issue. <em>See, e.g., WHW Enterprises, </em>753 F.2d at 1134. A Review Board recently made this burden explicit. In <em>Debra D. Carrigan, </em>100 F.C. C.2d 721, 729 (Rev. Bd. 1985), the Board explained that the factors it deems relevant in identifying cases to which <em>Huntington </em>applies are those cited by this court in <em>Miners Broadcasting Serv. v. FCC, </em>349 F.2d 199, 201 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1965): (1) power and class of station; (2) independence or interdependence of specified \u201ccommunity\u201d to central city of \u201curbanized area\u201d; (3) size and proximity of specified \u201ccommunity\u201d to central city of \u201curbanized area\u201d; and (4) signal population coverage and relevant advertising market. In its brief and in oral argument to this court, New Radio appeared to suggest that the evidentiary requirements of <em>Carrigan </em>and related cases may be circumvented by resort to certain presumptions. This view is plainly misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">First, there is no presumption that merely because two communities are closely situated, they will satisfy one another\u2019s radio transmission needs. In <em>Beaufort County Broadcasting, </em>we recognized, in the context of competing applications for high-power regional FM service specifying contiguous communities of license, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFC\">[W]hen a license applicant has designated as its proposed community of license a <em>suburban community integrally a part of a larger metropolitan area, </em>and that applicant has sought a license authorizing enough power to cover the wider area, <em>Huntington </em>has required the FCC to disregard \u201cthe corporate limits of the ... city named in the applications\u201d and to treat the proposed community as encompassing the entire metropolitan area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">787 F.2d at 652 (emphasis added). Although the FCC has relied on \u201cthe integral geographical, socio-political, and economic relationship typically enjoyed by a suburb with the surrounding urbanized area as a substitute for an affirmative- showing that the stations in other, nearby communities provided adequately for the programming needs of the otherwise unserved suburb,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 653, nothing in <em>Beaufort County Broadcasting </em>suggests that the mere proximity of two communities to one another or to a central city will substitute for a showing of their integral relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Second, there is no \u201cLos Angeles presumption.\u201d We find no reason to conclude that every community located in the vast Los Angeles metropolitan area is so integrally related to the central city that it can never warrant a local radio broadcast facility. In <em>Pasadena Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>555 F.2d 1046 (D.C.Cir.1977), this court appeared critical of the FCC\u2019s treatment of the Los Angeles metropolitan area communities of Fullerton, Whittier and Pasadena as \u201ca homogeneous part of Los Angeles,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1049 n. 19, and in a recent decision the FCC expressly noted our reservations. <em>See Carrigan, </em>100 F.C.C.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">New Radio\u2019s reliance on a 1961 <em>Huntington </em>case as announcing a \u201cLos Angeles presumption\u201d is misplaced. The relevant passage in that case reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-11\">The Los Angeles Standard Metropolitan Area (SMA) includes the city of Los Angeles, the rest of Los Angeles County, and all of Orange County. Thus, by Census Bureau definition, the two counties are \u201cessentially metropolitan in character and economically integrated with the Central City\u201d of Los Angeles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>Armin H. Wittenberg, </em>30 F.C.C. 417, 418 (1961) (quoting U.S. Bureau of Census, 1950 Bulletin P-B5, at v-vi). In light of the case law and agency rulemaking since <em>Wittenberg, </em>the language from that case cannot be reasonably construed to support a presumption that the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area is but a single community for 307(b) purposes. The FCC\u2019s approach to the license allocation problem has evolved too far since 1961 for this dictum to be controlling. <em>See Beaufort County Broadcasting, </em>787 F.2d at 652-53; <em>WHW Enterprises, </em>753 F.2d at 1136-37. In particular, we note this court\u2019s strong skepticism in <em>Pasadena Broadcasting </em>as to the propriety of applying such a presumption to Los Angeles area communities. We also note that although the FCC has initiated a rulemaking on the question whether to accept Census Bureau characterizations in defining \u201ccommunities,\u201d <em>see The Commission\u2019s Policy, Pursuant to Section 307(b) of the Communications Act, of Granting Comparative Preferences Within Metropolitan Areas, </em>48 Fed.Reg. 19428, 19430-31 (proposed April 29, 1983) <em>(\u2018Metropolitan Areas Rulemaking\u201d), </em>it has expressly declined to adopt those concepts pending the outcome of that rulemaking. <em>See Faye &amp; Richard Tuck, Inc., </em>103 F.C.C.2d 936, 941 (Rev. Bd. 1986); <em>Carrigan, </em>100 F.C.C.2d at 730-31, 731 n. 19. For these reasons, license applicants may not rely on <em>Wittenberg </em>for the proposition that the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area is but a single community for 307(b) purposes. Likewise, if the FCC intends to entertain such a presumption in the future, it must say so and state its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">As noted earlier in this opinion, the record before us demonstrates clearly that this was a 307(b) case from the start; and the record also reveals more than substantial evidence to justify the award to Orange County. There is absolutely no basis upon which to second-guess the judgment of the Commission in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Had the appellant raised the <em>Huntington </em>issue earlier and adduced supporting evidence, we might have found this a more difficult case, because the FCC\u2019s policy on assigning licenses to communities in metropolitan areas once again appears to be in a state of confusion. For example, in denying New Radio\u2019s application for review, the Commission observed that, even if the appellant had raised the <em>Huntington </em>issue in a timely manner, the exception would not have been applicable because \u201cOrange is a separate community with its own need for a first transmission service.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This terse dismissal is difficult to reconcile with the Commission\u2019s recognition in other cases that a given area can be \u201ca cognizable community with local needs and interests\u201d and yet be so integrally related to neighboring communities as to be part of a single larger community for 307(b) purposes. <em>Hispanic Owners, Inc., </em>FCC 86-316 (released July 14, 1986); <em>see also Faye &amp; Richard Tuck, Inc., </em>103 F.C.C.2d at 941; <em>Carrigan, </em>100 F.C.C.2d at 735; <em>Seven Locks Broadcasting Co., </em>37 F.C.C. 82, 84-85 (1964) (separate communities in Washington, D.C. metropolitan area found to be integrally related to central city).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Another area of confusion concerns the weight that the FCC places on the regional nature of the proposed service and on the Census Bureau concepts of an \u201cUrbanized Area\u201d and a \u201cStandard Metropolitan Statistical Area\u201d (\u201cSMSA\u201d). Since inviting comment in 1983 on the propriety of adopting such enlarged definitions of \u201ccommunity\u201d for 307(b) purposes, <em>see Metropolitan Areas Rulemaking, supra, </em>the Commission has expressly stated that it will continue to adhere to the <em>Miners/Carrigan </em>criteria pending formal adoption of a new standard. <em>See Carrigan, </em>100 F.C.C.2d at 730-31. Now, more than three years after the notice of proposed rulemaking appeared, we are informed that the rulemaking is not under active consideration. Yet, in the same interval, the Review Board has on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>several occasions used the SMSA concept to support its 307(b) determinations. <em>See, e.g., Faye &amp; Richard Tuck, Inc., </em>103 F.C. C.2d at 940-41; <em>Voce Intersectario Verdad America, Inc., </em>100 F.C.C.2d 1607, 1609 (Rev. Bd. 1985). To the extent that the Commission intends to use the Census Bureau concepts at all, it must clarify their significance and apply them in a consistent fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Although we recognize that the present state of the law surrounding the <em>Huntington </em>exception sometimes appear to be a muddle, the appellant was in no sense disadvantaged in this case. The appellant never raised the <em>Huntington </em>issue until the third stage of agency review, before the Commission. And, equally importantly, the appellant adduced no meaningful evidence in the record to satisfy the <em>Carrigan </em>test as a requisite to an application of <em>Huntington. </em>Instead, appellant made a belated attempt to rely on presumptions to overcome the obvious evidentiary deficiencies in the record. For the reasons already noted, this belated switch in litigation tactics cannot save the day for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">On the record before us, we find that the dispositive preference awarded to Orange County under 307(b) was consistent with agency and judicial precedent and supported by substantial evidence. We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-13\">. <em>Alessandro Broadcasting Co., </em>99 F.C.C.2d 12 (1984) <em>(\"Initial Decision\").</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-15\"><em>.

We reach the merits of the <em>Huntington </em>argument only because the Commission did so, albeit briefly, in a footnote explaining its reasons for denying New Radio's application for review. We find it puzzling that the Commission even gave passing acknowledgment to the substance of New Radio\u2019s <em>Huntington </em>argument, since the Commission\u2019s alternative ground for rejecting an application of the <em>Huntington exception </em>\u2014 i.e., New Radio\u2019s failure to raise the <em>Huntington </em>argument in a timely manner \u2014 made a decision on the merits unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">.
