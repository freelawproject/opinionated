(Clark &amp; Reid), a member of HGCB, petition for review of an Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) decision ordering the cancellation of tariff schedules proposed by HGCB. The ICC determined that the proposed rate changes violated statutory prohibitions on collective rate making. Because we conclude that Clark &amp; Reid does not have standing to appeal the ICC\u2019s decision, and that HGCB does not have venue in this circuit, we do not consider the merits of the ICC\u2019s decision. Instead, we transfer the proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where HGCB has venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">On March 1, 1985, HGCB filed a tariff supplement proposing changes in the rates and charges for accessorial services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> performed by its membership of household goods motor carriers. On April 3, 1985, the Department of Justice filed a petition opposing HGCB\u2019s proposal. Although common carriers are granted a special exemption from the antitrust laws for collective rate making, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706 (1982), the exemption does not apply to a \u201csingle-line rate\u201d unless certain very limited exceptions apply. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(b)(3). A single-line rate is defined in the statute as \u201ca rate, charge, or allowance proposed by a single motor common carrier that is applicable only over its line and for which the transportation can be provided by that carrier.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(b)(1). The Department of Justice objected to HGCB\u2019s proposal on the ground that it was for single-line rates not within any exceptions to the antitrust laws. HGCB argues that accessorial rates and charges are not single-line, and even if they were, they would fall under two of the exceptions to the single-line rate prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\">On April 23,1985, the ICC suspended the proposed tariff supplement and ordered an investigation into its lawfulness. The ICC conducted the proceedings under a modified procedure, which dispensed with oral testimony. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. 1112.1 (1985). Respondents were required to file opening statements of facts and arguments by June 10. In its order, the ICC said that \u201c[cjarriers parties to Household Goods Carriers\u2019 Bureau, Agent, tariff ICC HGB 400-C [the proposal] are made respondent to this pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ceeding.\u201d Two opening statements were filed in support of the proposal. The Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association, Inc., Middle Atlantic Conference, National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc., and the Regular Common Carrier Conference, Inc., filed one as intervenors. Counsel to HGCB submitted the other opening statement in support of the proposal on behalf of \u201cRespondents.\u201d Although the \u201cRespondents\u2019 \u201d opening statement requested relief for \u201cHGCB and its member carriers,\u201d it did not contain any mention of particular HGCB members responding in the proceeding. Verified statements by six member carriers were attached, but petitioner Clark &amp; Reid was not included in this group. Statements in opposition to the proposal were filed by the National Small Shipments Traffic Conference, Inc., and the Drug and Toilet Preparation Traffic Conference, Inc., jointly, and the Department of Justice. The same two parties that submitted opening statements in support of the proposal filed replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On November 22, 1985, the ICC decided that the proposed changes in accessorial rates and charges were for single-line rates not within the statutory exceptions. The proposed tariff supplement was ordered cancelled. HGCB and Clark &amp; Reid petition this court for a review of the ICC\u2019s decision. The substantive issue on which they seek review is the applicability of the single-line rate definition and statutory antitrust exceptions to HGCB\u2019s proposed tariff supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">II. STANDING TO APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Appellate review of ICC orders is governed by the Hobbs Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2341-2351 (1982). Section 2344 of the Hobbs Act provides that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the final order may, within 60 days after its entry, file a petition to review the order in the court of appeals wherein venue lies.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344. Venue lies \u201cin the judicial circuit in which the petitioner resides or has its principal office, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2343. The residence of a corporate plaintiff is in its place of incorporation. <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir.1985). Petitioner Clark &amp; Reid\u2019s residence is in this circuit; it has venue here and in the District of Columbia Circuit. Venue for an association is \u201cdetermined by looking to the residence of the association itself rather than that of its individual members.\u201d <em>Denver &amp; Rio Grande W R.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen, </em>387 U.S. 556, 559-60, 87 S.Ct. 1746, 1748, 18 L.Ed.2d 954 (1967); <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d at 26. Petitioner HGCB\u2019s residence is in the Fourth Circuit; it has venue there and in the District of Columbia Circuit. Therefore, for this matter to be reviewable here, Clark &amp; Reid must have standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Clark &amp; Reid must be a \u201cparty aggrieved by the final order\u201d to have standing to appeal under the Hobbs Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344. We have held that this language means that a petitioner must have been a party to the agency proceedings. <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d at 26. Other courts of appeals have interpreted the statute similarly. <em>See Simmons v. ICC, </em>716 F.2d 40, 42 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. ICC, </em>673 F.2d 82, 84 (5th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1022,103 S.Ct. 1272, 75 L.Ed.2d 493 (1983); <em>see also Blackstone Valley Nat\u2019l Bank v. Board of Governors, </em>537 F.2d 1146,1147-48 (1st Cir. 1976) (interpreting identical language in the statute governing appeals of Federal Reserve Board decisions, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1848 (1982)); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of St. Charles v. Board of Governors, </em>509 F.2d 1004, 1006-08 (8th Cir.1975) (same). The word \u201cparty\u201d has been defined narrowly for the purposes of the statute; it applies only to those who directly and actually participated in the administrative proceedings. <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d at 26; <em>see also American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. ICC, </em>673 F.2d at 84. Clark &amp; Reid did not directly and actually participate in the ICC proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Clark &amp; Reid\u2019s claim to party status is based on the statement in the ICC\u2019s order initiating an investigation that \u201c[c]arriers parties to Household Goods Carriers\u2019 Bureau, Agent, tariff ICC HGB 400-C are made respondent to this proceeding.\u201d Clark &amp; Reid interprets this language as making all HGB carriers respondents, and claims to have attained party status because the applicable regulations define a \u201cparty\u201d as, among other things, a \u201crespondent.\u201d <em>See </em>49 C.P.R. 1101.2(d) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The import of the ICC order, however, is not so clear. The order could be read as naming only HGCB as respondent; it does not say that all member carriers are made <em>respondents, </em>but rather that \u201c[c]arriers parties to ... tariff ICC HGB 400-C are made <em>respondent </em>to this proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the singular suggests that only one party \u2014 HGCB, as the agent for its members \u2014 was being identified as a respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Even if we agreed with Clark &amp; Reid\u2019s interpretation of the effect of the ICC\u2019s order, we do not equate the regulatory definition of a \u201cparty\u201d in an ICC proceeding with the participatory party status required for judicial review under the Hobbs Act. In an ICC proceeding, a \u201crespondent\u201d is a procedural term used to designate a person or entity as eligible to participate in an investigation. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. 1100.5(c) (1981). By naming all of HGCB\u2019s members as respondents, the ICC would be inviting individual carriers to submit their views on the proposal\u2019s lawfulness. But the only statements claimed to have been submitted by Clark &amp; Reid were submitted by counsel to HGCB requesting relief for \u201cHGCB and its member carriers.\u201d This does not constitute an election by all 1,700 HGCB members to become active participants. HGCB continued to be the only voice of its membership in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">There is no doubt that an organization can have standing to represent its members in a proceeding for judicial review. <em>See Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 739, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1368, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <em>National Motor Freight Traffic Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 246, 247, 83 S.Ct. 688, 689, 9 L.Ed.2d 709 (1963). HGCB, a forum organization by which 1,700 motor carriers arrive at rate agreements, was Clark &amp; Reid\u2019s designated representative in the agency proceedings. Clark &amp; Reid offered no differing or dissenting views on the proposal to the ICC; it does not suggest that its interests will not continue to be represented adequately by HGCB. <em>Cf. American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d at 26 (dismissing members from appeal in part because they were adequately represented by their organization). The actual proponent and advocate of the tariff supplement throughout the administrative process should continue the representation of its members in seeking judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Furthermore, granting Clark &amp; Reid standing to appeal in this case would not be in the interest of sound judicial administration. Congress\u2019 use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved, as opposed to the term \u201cperson\u201d aggrieved in the general judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1982), \u201cdemonstrates an intent to limit the number of persons entitled to petition for review.\u201d <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d at 25-26, (citing <em>Simmons v. ICC, </em>716 F.2d at 42-43). Allowing an appeal to be brought by an organization\u2019s member that did not participate actively in the agency proceedings would allow a membership organization to search for and select a forum in which it is most likely to obtain a favorable result. It need only select as petitioner a member who has venue in the desired circuit. Congress could not have intended to give disappointed participants in the administrative process such a wide selection of forums for judicial review. As we said when we interpreted the Hobbs Act before, \u201cthere is simply no basis to conclude that Congress intended to endow membership corporations with a choice of venue unavailable to other petitioners. To so hold would, moreover, sanction unlimited forum-shopping by membership corporations, a practice we are loathe to encourage.\u201d <em>American Civil </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Liberties Union v. FCC, </em>774 F.2d at 26. We, therefore, hold that Clark &amp; Reid lacks standing to prosecute this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">As a court of appeals, we have \u201can inherent discretionary power to transfer the proceeding to another circuit in the interest of justice and sound judicial administration.\u201d <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. CAB, </em>354 F.2d 507, 510 (D.C.Cir.1965); <em>see also Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>465 F.2d 492, 495-96 (1st Cir.1972) (courts of appeals may transfer petitions for review of agency decisions); <em>Pearce v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>603 F.2d 763, 771 n. 3 (9th Cir.1979) (listing cases in eight circuits holding that courts of appeals have inherent power to transfer cases); <em>cf. Dantes v. Western Found. Corp., </em>614 F.2d 299, 301, 301 n. 1 (1st Cir.1980) (court does not have power to transfer if it does not have subject matter jurisdiction). Dismissal of the petition would foreclose review of the ICC\u2019s decision; the sixty-day time limitation for filing for review has long since passed. The substantive issues raised by the petitioners are sufficiently important to warrant a transfer to a circuit with venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Although HGCB has venue in the Fourth Circuit and in the District of Columbia Circuit, the District of Columbia Circuit is the more appropriate forum. It recently has interpreted the statute in issue, <em>see Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc. v. United States, </em>780 F.2d 109 (D.C.Cir.1986), and has great familiarity with regulatory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\n<em>It is ordered that this case be transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\">. Accessorial services include packing and unpacking, extra and storage-in-transit pickup and delivery, regular and overtime labor, overtime and light and bulky loading and unloading, storage-in-transit and warehousing, appliance servicing, and elevator, stairs, and excessive distance carries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
