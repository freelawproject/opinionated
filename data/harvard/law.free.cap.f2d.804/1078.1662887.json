A jury had acquitted Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) \u2014 bank robbery \u2014 and convicted him of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(c) \u2014 knowing possession of stolen bank property. In granting the motion, the district court found insufficient evidence that Johnson knew the money he possessed was stolen. It reasoned that, as a matter of law, the theory upon which the \u00a7 2113(c) conviction was based could not be that Johnson participated in the robbery and found that there was insufficient evidence to support any other theory of how Johnson knew the money was stolen. The district court also determined that the jury \u201crejected\u201d eyewitness testimony concerning Johnson\u2019s alleged participation in the bank robbery when it acquitted Johnson on the \u00a7 2113(a) charge and that, without this testimony, there was insufficient evidence that Johnson knew the money was stolen. In addition, Johnson argues that the theory that he \u201cwas not the bank robber, but was in knowing possession of bank loot is being presented for the first time on appeal\u201d and that \u201creliance on a theory not presented at trial would violate due process.\u201d We disagree with the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2113(c) and its implicit contention that apparently inconsistent verdicts can serve as a basis for setting aside a jury\u2019s verdict. We also find no merit in Johnson\u2019s due process argument. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of the motion for acquittal and remand for sentencing and a ruling on Johnson\u2019s motion that, because the indictment did not charge that Johnson possessed more than $100 in stolen bank property, the charge under \u00a7 2113(c) is a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">On August 5, 1985, two men entered the United States National Bank in Tigard, Oregon, and approached two adjoining teller windows. One man, wearing a blue wig, demanded and received money from the first teller. The first teller testified that he also demanded money from a second teller sitting behind the adjoining window, that the second teller passed the money to her and she gave it to the man in the blue wig, and that the second man did nothing but \u201cstand there.\u201d She could not positively identify the second man as Johnson. The second teller testified that the second man had his hand inside a bag, apparently holding a weapon, and that he stated: \u201cDon\u2019t any of you move. I want to see your hands.\u201d He then demanded money from her. She did not recall whether she passed the money to the first teller or handed it to the second man. At trial, she identified the second man as Johnson, even though soon after the robbery she was unable to identify Johnson from a photograph as one of the participants in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">Other eyewitnesses saw the man wearing the blue wig and another man, whom they identified as Johnson, leave the bank in a car. One of the witnesses further testified that the man identified as Johnson had nothing in his hands when he left the bank. One of the witnesses recorded the license plate number of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">On the afternoon of the day of the robbery, FBI agents traced the car to its owner\u2019s residence and followed the owner in a second car to a building on Insley Street. When the owner tried to leave the building agents stopped the car and searched it and its occupants, including Johnson. On Johnson\u2019s side of the car, they found a hat and shirt that matched a description of clothing worn by one of the two men seen in the bank. Johnson also had in his possession a large amount of cash, which included bait bills from the bank. At trial, Johnson claimed that he had received the money from a drug sale at the building on Insley Street and from his winnings at the race track and that he was given the clothing as he left the. Insley Street building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">The jury acquitted Johnson of violating 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) \u2014 bank robbery \u2014 and convicted him of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(c) \u2014 knowing possession of money stolen from a bank. Johnson moved for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court reasoned that Congress did not intend \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(c) to be a \u201cdouble-pronged attack\u201d on suspected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>bank robbers and that therefore a conviction under \u00a7 2113(c) must be based on a theory other than that Johnson was one of the two men who committed the robbery. It set aside the jury\u2019s verdict and acquitted Johnson on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support Johnson\u2019s conviction based on any other theory. It also determined that the jury \u201crejected\u201d the eyewitness testimony concerning Johnson\u2019s participation in the robbery when it acquitted Johnson on the \u00a7 2113(a) charge. We disagree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">I. <em>The Interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">Interpretation of a statute presents a question of law reviewable de novo. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>720 F.2d 608, 609 n. 2 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1034, 104 S.Ct. 1304, 79 L.Ed.2d 703 (1984); <em>United States v. Moreno-Pulido, </em>695 F.2d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">One is guilty under \u00a7 2113(a) if one, \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (1982). One is guilty under \u00a7 2113(c) if one \u201creceives, possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of, any property or money or other thing of value which has been taken or stolen from a bank, credit union, or savings and loan association in violation of subsection (b), knowing the same to be property which has been stolen.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(c) (Supp. Ill 1985). A conviction under \u00a7 2113(c) can thus be based on the following elements: (1) that the money was stolen from a federally insured bank, (2) that the defendant received or possessed the money, and (3) that he received or possessed it knowing it was stolen. <em>See United States v. Scruggs, </em>549 F.2d 1097, 1103 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 824, 98 S.Ct. 70, 54 L.Ed.2d 81 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">It is well established that one cannot be convicted under both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(c). <em>United States v. Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. 544, 547, 96 S.Ct. 1023, 1026, 47 L.Ed.2d 222 (1976); <em>Heflin v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 415, 419, 79 S.Ct. 451, 453-54, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959) (\u201cWe find no purpose of Congress to pyramid penalties for lesser offenses following the robbery.\u201d). One, however, can be charged with both offenses. <em>Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. at 550, 96 S.Ct. 1027 (stating that \u201cthere can be no impropriety ... for a prosecutor to file an information containing counts charging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d), as well as of \u00a7 2113(c)\u201d). When dual charges are made, the district court must instruct the members of the jury that they \u201cmust first consider the charges under \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d), and should consider the charge under \u00a7 2113(c) only if they find <em>insufficient proof </em>that the defendant himself was a participant in the robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">The district court relied on language from <em>Heflin, </em>358 U.S. at 420, 79 S.Ct. at 454 (stating that \u201cwe think Congress was trying to reach a new group of wrongdoers [under \u00a7 2113(c)], not to multiply the offense of the bank robbers themselves\u201d), and <em>Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. at 548, 96 S.Ct. at 1026 (stating that \u201c\u00a7 2113(c) reaches a different \u2018group of wrongdoers,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>\u2018those who receive the loot from the robber\u2019 \u201d), in deciding that a theory that Johnson participated in the robbery could not support a conviction under \u00a7 2113(c). We disagree with this interpretation of \u00a7 2113 and hold that \u00a7 2113(c) does not require evidence to be disregarded by the trier of fact simply because, under \u00a7 2113(a), it shows that Johnson participated in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>The language of <em>Heflin </em>and <em>Gaddis </em>relied on by the district court does not support its interpretation of \u00a7 2113. At issue in <em>Heflin </em>and <em>Gaddis </em>was the propriety of <em>dual </em>convictions under \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d) and \u00a7 2113(c). The Supreme Court concluded that dual convictions were improper because Congress sought to reach two groups of wrongdoers: \u201cbank robbers\u201d or \u201cactual participants]\u201d in bank robberies, as defined by the elements of \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d); and those who receive loot from the robber, who are subject to conviction under \u00a7 2113(c). <em>See, e.g., Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. at 547-48, 550 n. 13, 96 S.Ct. at 1025-26, 1027 n. 13; <em>Heflin, </em>358 U.S. at 419, 79 S.Ct. at 453 (stating that \u201csubsection (c) was not designed to increase the punishment for him who robs a bank but only to provide punishment for those who receive the loot from the robber\u201d). The Court did not say that evidence that might have supported a finding that the defendant participated in the robbery under \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d) could not be used to support a conviction under \u00a7 2113(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">We hold that \u00a7 2113(c) reaches a person who, though not a \u201cbank robber\u201d because of an acquittal under \u00a7 2113(a), nonetheless received or possessed stolen bank property and knew it was stolen because he \u201cparticipated\u201d in the robbery in some way. Evidence concerning a defendant\u2019s participation in a robbery might not convince a jury of the existence of all of the substantive elements of \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d) \u2014 such as the element of force and violence, or intimidation, under \u00a7 2113(a). Yet other parts of that evidence \u2014 such as the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the robbery, outside of the bank, or in the getaway car \u2014 can provide strong indications that the defendant knew the money was stolen. We find no meaningful distinction between the paradigm \u00a7 2113(c) offender \u2014 the \u201creceiver of loot\u201d who is removed in time and place from the scene of the robbery \u2014 and the person who is acquitted of the bank robbery charge but has knowledge that the money was stolen because of his presence at or near the scene of the robbery. The \u201creceiver of loot\u201d might be at home, across the street from the bank, in the getaway car, or even in the bank and be convicted under \u00a7 2113(c), as long as he is not also found to have met all of the elements of \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">This result is consistent with the reasoning in <em>Gaddis </em>and <em>Heflin. </em>When considering the propriety of dual charges under \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d) and \u00a7 2113(c), the <em>Gad-dis </em>Court described a situation virtually identical to the present case. The Court stated that dual charges are proper when there is \u201cclear evidence that the proceeds of a bank robbery were found in a certain person\u2019s possession, and less certain eyewitness or circumstantial evidence that that person was an actual participant in the robbery.\u201d <em>Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. at 550 n. 13, 96 S.Ct. at 1027 n. 13. The Court did not establish a requirement for \u00a7 2113(c) that there must be evidence other than that of participation to establish the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the money was stolen. The prosecution need not show that the defendant did not participate in the robbery to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 2113(c), because <em>\u201cHeflin </em>did not purport to, and did not, <em>add to or alter </em>the statutory elements of the offense under \u00a7 2113(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550 n. 15, 96 S.Ct. at 1027 n. 15 (emphasis added); <em>cf. id. </em>(\u201cIf ... the indictment or information charges only a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>\u00a7 2113(c), it is incumbent upon the prosecution at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt only the elements of that offense, and the identity of the participant or participants in the robbery or theft is irrelevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d). Moreover, the core of the <em>Gaddis </em>and <em>Heflin </em>decisions is that \u00a7 2113(c) cannot be used to \u201cpyramid penalties\u201d on those convicted under \u00a7 2113(a), (b), or (d). <em>See id.; Heflin, </em>358 U.S. at 419, 79 S.Ct. at 453-54. No such pyramiding-of-penalties concerns are presented in the instant case. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 2113(c) and improperly excluded the eyewitness testimony concerning Johnson\u2019s participation in the robbery when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence for the \u00a7 2113(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">II. <em>The Alleged Inconsistency of the Jury\u2019s Verdicts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">The district court also set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on the ground that Johnson\u2019s conviction for violating \u00a7 2113(c) is inconsistent with his acquittal for violating \u00a7 2113(a). It stated that \u201cthe jury rejected [the eyewitness testimony] in finding that the defendant was not one of the bank robbers.\u201d Because \u201c[tjhere was no other additional evidence that Johnson knowingly possessed the stolen funds,\u201d it decided that \u201cthe jury necessarily relied upon speculation in concluding that [Johnson] knew the funds were those which came from the bank robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">We disagree with this analysis. As noted above, the fact that the jury found Johnson not guilty under \u00a7 2113(a) does not mean that it rejected all of the eyewitness testimony concerning Johnson\u2019s participation in the robbery. The jury acquitted Johnson because it failed to find one or more of the substantive elements of \u00a7 2113(a) beyond a reasonable doubt, not necessarily because it rejected the eyewitness testimony in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">Even if the verdicts were logically inconsistent, however, consistency in jury verdicts is not required. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 63, 105 S.Ct. 471, 476, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984); <em>id. </em>at 67, 105 S.Ct. at 478 (stating that sufficiency of the evidence review \u201cshould be independent of the jury\u2019s determination that evidence on another count was insufficient\u201d); <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 101, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2899, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). The fact that a jury verdict of guilty on one count of an indictment is logically incompatible with a verdict of not guilty on another count does not warrant reversal of the conviction. <em>United States v. Stozek, </em>783 F.2d 891, 894 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 284, 93 L.Ed.2d 259 (1986). \u201cA defendant can be convicted upon one or some of the counts but acquitted on another or others and the conviction will be sustained even though rationally incompatible with the acquittal.\u201d <em>United States v. Horowitz, </em>756 F.2d 1400, 1406 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 74, 88 L.Ed.2d 60 (1985). Therefore, the eyewitness testimony should not have been excluded from the assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Johnson\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 2113(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-13\">III. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-14\">On a motion for judgment of acquittal, a court should set aside the jury\u2019s verdict only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any rational trier of fact could not have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Mara-belles, </em>724 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir.1984). The government is entitled to all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the evidence. <em>Glosser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Beecroft, </em>608 F.2d 753, 756 (9th Cir.1979). The test applied by the trial court and the test applied by the appellate court when reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision are, as a practical matter, identical. <em>United States v. Leal, </em>509 F.2d 122, 125 (9th Cir.1975). Although the district court did not review the suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>ciency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict based on the correct interpretation of \u00a7 2113(c) discussed above, we will review the conviction under the proper legal standard because we stand in the same position as the district court for purposes of this review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">In the present case, Johnson\u2019s conviction is supported by sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of \u00a7 2113(c) beyond a reasonable doubt. There is clear evidence that Johnson received or possessed money stolen from a federally insured bank. The evidence \u2014 and the inferences that can be fairly drawn from it \u2014 also amply support a finding that Johnson knew that the money was stolen. The prosecution introduced evidence that Johnson was at or near the bank during the robbery; that he was in the car used to leave the scene of the robbery; that he possessed a hat and shirt that matched clothing worn in the robbery; that the bait bills in his possession were stacked, paper-clipped, and peculiarly organized so that the presidents\u2019 heads all faced in the same direction; and that within hours of the robbery he was found in possession of the bait bills in the presence of the owner of the car used in the robbery. Therefore, we find that the evidence was sufficient to support the \u00a7 2113(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">IV. <em>The Alleged Violation of Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">Johnson also argues that he is entitled to acquittal because the theory that he \u201cwas not the bank robber, but was in knowing possession of bank loot is being presented for the first time on appeal\u201d and because \u201creliance on a theory not presented at trial would violate due process.\u201d He cites <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 106-07, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 2194-95, 60 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979), and <em>Cola v. Reardon, </em>787 F.2d 681 (1st Cir.1986), as support for this argument. Both because a theory that Johnson participated in the robbery can support a conviction under \u00a7 2113(c) and because the indictment and the jury instructions sufficiently stated the charge under \u00a7 2113(c), we find no merit in Johnson\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\"><em>Dunn </em>and <em>Cola </em>both involved a failure to charge the defendant in the indictment for the specific acts for which he was convicted. In <em>Dunn, </em>the indictment charged that the defendant made false statements at a hearing held on a particular date but failed to charge him for the acts for which he was convicted \u2014 making false statements at a hearing on a different date. <em>Dunn, </em>442 U.S. at 103-07, 99 S.Ct. at 2192-95. In <em>Cola, </em>the indictment charged the defendant for unlawful representation because he negotiated certain loans and paid the debts of another but failed to charge him for the offense for which he was convicted \u2014 that he illegally represented another at a bankruptcy hearing. <em>Cola, </em>787 F.2d at 691-93. In contrast, Johnson was charged in the indictment for the specific acts for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">Furthermore, the charge was sufficiently stated in the indictment to meet the requirements of due process. An indictment is sufficient if it states \u201cthe elements of the offense charged with sufficient clarity to apprise a defendant of the charge against him, primarily so that he can defend himself against the charge and plead double jeopardy in appropriate cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Normandeau, </em>800 F.2d 953, 958 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 7(c)(1). \u201cIt is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself, as long as \u2018those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence <em>[sic </em>] intended to be punished.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamling, </em>418 U.S. at 117, 94 S.Ct. at 2907 (quoting <em>United States v. Carll, </em>105 U.S. (15 Otto) 611, 612, 26 L.Ed. 1135 (1882)). Because Johnson\u2019s indictment states the elements of \u00a7 2113(c), the approximate date on which Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>received and possessed the stolen money, the approximate location of his receipt of the money, and the location of the bank from which it was stolen,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it gave Johnson adequate notice to defend himself against the \u00a7 2113(c) charge. The indictment therefore meets the requirements of due process. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tavelman, </em>650 F.2d 1133,1137-38 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 939, 102 S.Ct. 1429, 71 L.Ed.2d 649 (1982); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>532 F.2d 1218, 1222-23 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 839, 97 S.Ct. Ill, 50 L.Ed.2d 107 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">Finally, Johnson does not dispute that the jury was properly instructed on the \u00a7 2113(c) charge. That the prosecution might have emphasized the \u00a7 2113(a) charge at trial and given less attention to the \u00a7 2113(c) charge does not raise due process concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">For the reasons given above, the district court\u2019s grant of the motion for acquittal is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for hearings on sentencing and Johnson\u2019s motion that his conviction under \u00a7 2113(c) is a misdemeanor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">. Subsection (b) provides in part that \u201d[w]hoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin, any property or money or any other thing of value exceeding $100 belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">. The facts of this case do not require us to reach the question whether a \u00a7 2113(c) conviction can be sustained where the prosecution alleges violations of \u00a7 2113(a) and (c), the evidence shows that the defendant was the <em>sole </em>participant in the robbery and knew the money was stolen because of that participation, and the defendant is acquitted of the \u00a7 2113(a) charge. Language in <em>Gaddis </em>and <em>Heflin </em>might indicate that the \"receiver of loot\u201d must be someone other than the actual robber, <em>see, e.g., Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. at 547, 96 S.Ct. at 1025-26, (stating that \u00a7 2113(c) was designed \"\u2018to provide punishment for those who receive the loot from the robber\u201d\u2019) quoting <em>Heflin, </em>358 U.S. at 419, 79 S.Ct. at 453), even if the <em>identity </em>of the actual robber (but not his existence) is irrelevant, <em>see id. </em>at 550 n. 15, 79 S.Ct. at 1027 n. 15. In the present case, the jury could have concluded that Johnson received the loot from the robber \u2014 the unidentified man in the blue wig.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">. Count II of the indictment charged that Johnson \"on or about August 5, 1985, at Tigard, Washington County, Oregon, in the District of Oregon, ... did knowingly receive, possess, conceal and store a sum of money, which money had been taken and carried away with intent to steal and purloin from ... the U.S. National Bank of Oregon, Tigard Drive-Up Branch, 11543 S.W. Pacific Highway, Tigard, Oregon, whose deposits were then and there insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and [he] well knew said money to have been taken and carried away from a bank; in violation of Section 2113(c), Title 18, United States Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
