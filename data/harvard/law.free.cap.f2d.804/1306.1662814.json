Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>752 F.2d 694 (1985), this court held that \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applies to all commercial airlines, regardless of whether they receive direct federal subsidies. The court accordingly vacated the Civil Aeronautics Board\u2019s (CAB\u2019s) decision to apply its final rule implementing \u00a7 504 only to air carriers that receive subsidies under \u00a7 406(b) or \u00a7 419 of the Federal Aviation Act. In addition, this court remanded the rule to CAB\u2019s successor agency, the Department of Transportation (DOT), with orders to redraft the rule to the extent necessary to apply it to all commercial air carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-23\">In <em>United States Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans ofAmer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number><em>tea, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2705, 91 L.Ed.2d 494 (1986), the Supreme Court reversed this court\u2019s judgment, holding that \u00a7 504 applies only to those commercial airlines receiving direct federal subsidies under \u00a7 406(b) or \u00a7 419 of the Federal Aviation Act. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, this court now dismisses the petitioners\u2019 challenge to the agency\u2019s rule. Any reservations this court previously expressed about the substance of the rule arose from this court\u2019s belief that the rule properly applied to all commercial airlines. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision concerning the application of the rule, the basis for these reservations has disappeared. Accordingly, the agency rule implementing \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is enforceable and the petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
