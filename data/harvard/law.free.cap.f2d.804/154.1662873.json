(\u201cSmith Barney\u201d) and Henry Fishburne pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 9(b). The complaint alleges that appellees failed to disclose the unsuitability of investments in Melnick\u2019s brokerage account, thereby violating section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10(b)-5 (Count I); Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2) (Count III); and their common law fiduciary duty (Count IV). We affirm the dismissal on the basis of appellant\u2019s failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">1. The district court properly dismissed the breach of fiduciary duty claim in Count IV because a simple stockbroker-customer relationship does not constitute a fiduciary relationship in Massachusetts. <em>Brine v. Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 100, 103 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Plumer v. Luce, </em>310 Mass. 789, 795-96, 39 N.E.2d 961, 964-65 (1942). Appellant claims that the relationship between Mel-nick and Fishburne, his account executive, cannot be properly characterized as a \u201csimple stockbroker-customer relationship\u201d because the parties enjoyed a longstanding personal friendship and because Melnick, who allegedly lacked business acumen, always followed Fishburne\u2019s guidance in complicated matters. Appellant cites <em>Broomfield v. Kosow, </em>349 Mass. 749, 755-56, 212 N.E.2d 556, 560 (1965), to support his contention that these facts compel a finding of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We are persuaded, however, that this case is controlled by <em>Vogelaar v. H.L. Robbins &amp; Co., </em>348 Mass. 787, 204 N.E.2d 461 (1965) (rescript opinion), a case not cited by appellant. In <em>Vogelaar, </em>the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that allegations of a decedent\u2019s minimal knowledge of investments and blind reliance upon his broker are not sufficient for a proper pleading of fiduciary duty. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 204 N.E.2d at 462. The facts of the case before us are surprisingly similar to the facts of <em>Vogelaar. </em>Both cases involved actions brought by the representative of an estate seeking to establish a breach of fiduciary duty by a stockbroker. Furthermore, there were allegations of a conservative investment objective in each case. Although the facts of <em>Vogelaar </em>appear to be even more compelling because of the broker\u2019s awareness that the deceased had been under intermittent psychiatric care, the court sustained the demurrer for failure to establish a fiduciary relationship in the pleadings. We find nothing in appellant\u2019s complaint to distinguish this case from the situation in <em>Vogelaar </em>and therefore hold that the relationship between Melnick and Fishburne was not fiduciary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">2. The district court also properly dismissed Count I of the complaint because appellant\u2019s Rule 10b-5 claim insufficiently pleads the elements of an unsuitability claim. To prevail in a Rule 10b-5 action, a plaintiff must first show that the defendant is responsible for some misrepresentation or material omission. <em>Holmes v. Bateson, </em>583 F.2d 542, 551 (1st Cir.1978). Appellant claims that appellees\u2019 failure to disclose the unsuitability of the investments in Melnick\u2019s account constitutes a material omission. S<em>ee Troyer v. Karcagi, </em>476 F.Supp. 1142, 1152 (S.D.N.Y.1979). Appellant must demonstrate, therefore, that the quality of the securities purchased for Melnick\u2019s account was inappropriate in light of Melnick\u2019s investment objectives, <em>fieman v. Blyth, Eastman, Dillon &amp; Co., </em>719 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1983). Based upon three clusters of factual allegations and upon \u201cinformation and belief,\u201d appellant has averred that Melnick\u2019s investment objective was to purchase strictly \u201clow risk\u201d securities; These allegations, however, whether considered individually or collectively, are insufficient to support appellant\u2019s unsuitability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">First, appellant alleges that it is common practice in the brokerage industry to require that new customers complete an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>vestor intake form listing the type of investments the customer prefers. Because Smith Barney has been unable to produce such a form for Melnick, appellant argues that it is reasonable for us to conclude that appellees were not concerned with Mel-nick\u2019s objectives or that appellees failed to produce the completed form because it indicated Melnick\u2019s \u201clow risk\u201d objective. We disagree. The only inference we can reasonably draw from the pleadings and appellees\u2019 failure to locate an intake form is that such a form was never completed, or alternatively, that the completed form was lost, misplaced, or destroyed. We cannot reasonably infer anything about the <em>contents </em>of an investor intake form from the appellees\u2019 inability to produce one.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Second, appellant alleges that Melnick drew up five different wills during the waning years of his life, each providing for different beneficiaries. Appellant argues from this fact that Melnick must have wanted only \u201clow risk\u201d investments to preserve the estate for his heirs. Again, we cannot reasonably infer this conclusion from the alleged facts. Melnick\u2019s repeated redrafting of his will merely reflects frer quent changes of heart regarding how to divide his estate; these actions do not indicate the type of investment strategy that Melnick wished to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Third, appellant argues that Melnick\u2019s limited education, advanced age, precarious financial status, and lack of investment experience require us to find that he desired strictly \u201clow risk\u201d investments. These factual allegations, however, do not compel an inference of the sort suggested by appellant. It would be just as reasonable for us to conclude that a person in Melnick\u2019s position would desire a portfolio containing a mix of securities with varying levels of risk. Furthermore, we do not believe that a \u201cprudent broker/dealer\u201d would necessarily have concluded from these circumstances that Melnick wanted only \u201clow risk\u201d investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In short, even accepting all of appellant\u2019s factual allegations as true and drawing all <em>reasonable </em>inferences in appellant\u2019s favor, we find that the factual allegations contained in appellant\u2019s complaint do not support his claim that Melnick sought to invest exclusively at low levels of risk. This leaves only appellant\u2019s conclusory allegation that \u201cupon information and belief, Mel-nick did not intend to invest at high levels of risk.\u201d Complaint H 14. Appellant admits that he has attempted to conform to the pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) by pleading all of the facts supporting his \u201cinformation and belief\u201d averment. <em>See Wayne Investment, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>739 F.2d 11, 13-14 (1st Cir.1984). Significantly, appellant\u2019s factual allegations, which are insufficient to establish Melnick\u2019s investment objective, provide the <em>only </em>foundation for appellant\u2019s belief concerning that objective. We therefore hold that appellant\u2019s conclusory averment based solely upon \u201cinformation and belief\u201d does not sufficiently allege an essential element of his unsuitability claim. Dismissal is proper because the complaint fails to allege a required element necessary to obtain relief. <em>Fisher v. Flynn, </em>598 F.2d 663, 665-66 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">3. The district court properly dismissed Count III of the complaint because appellant\u2019s claim pursuant to \u00a7 410(a) of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act also fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Section 410(a)(2) imposes liability when \u201c[a] person offers or sells a security by means of an untrue statement of material fact or by an omission to state a material fact____\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2). Appellant\u2019s claim under this section, therefore, must also be founded upon a showing that the securities purchased for Melnick\u2019s account were unsuitable. As described above, however, appellant has failed properly to plead an essential element of a claim for unsuitability. Accordingly, his \u00a7 410(a) claim also fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">4. Even if we assume that the district court erred by considering factual matters outside the pleading in reaching its decision, such error would be harmless be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>cause the dismissal can be justified without reference to the extrinsic material. <em>Medina v. Rudman, </em>545 F.2d 244, 247 (1st Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 891, 98 S.Ct. 266, 54 L.Ed.2d 177 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">5. Because we hold that appellant\u2019s complaint does not state a claim upon which relief may be granted, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we need not address whether the allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint satisfy the paticularity requirement of Fed.R. Civ.P. 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
