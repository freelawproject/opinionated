Notwithstanding assurances that the Secretary adheres to this rule as his national policy, <em>see Stieberger v. Bowen, </em>801 F.2d 29, 36 (2d Cir.1986), <em>Schisler v. Heckler, 787 </em>F.2d 76, 83 (2d Cir.1986), the record in the instant case discloses no awareness of that rule among the relevant Social Security Administration adjudicators. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Dan Havas injured his back on January 17, 1983, while operating a snow blower in the course of his employment as supervisor of a work crew for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. He was then 57 years old. Havas sought treatment for back pain from Dr. Edwin G. Mulbury, his general physician, who referred him to Dr. Brian O\u2019M. Quinn, an orthopedist. Dr. Quinn determined that Havas was suffering from acute \u201cL4-5 disc disease on the left side\u201d as well as from chronic \u201cdegenerative disc and joint disease in the low back.\u201d At a subsequent visit, Dr. Quinn found that Havas\u2019 pain had been reduced significantly after a month of bed rest. The orthopedist noted that Havas could attempt to return to work but cautioned that \u201c[i]t remains to be seen whether he can manage this on a regular basis.\u201d Havas was then referred back to Dr. Mulbury for follow-up care.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Havas resumed work in August 1983. He was no longer required to do any lifting or other heavy labor. He was, however, required to spend much of his workday making deliveries in a state pick-up truck. He retired in June 1984, claiming that his back pain had been exacerbated by the extensive driving now demanded by his job. He thereupon sought Social Security disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433 (1982 &amp; Supp. Ill 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Havas\u2019 application for disability benefits on the ground that, while \u201c[t]he medical evidence establishes that [Havas] has degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine,\u201d this impairment \u201cdoes not prevent him from performing his past relevant work as a supervisor of a State park crew.\u201d Decision of ALJ at 4. The Appeals Council denied review, and Havas appealed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). On April 3, 1986, Judge McCum adopted a magistrate\u2019s recommended ruling affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision and dismissing Havas\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The record contains reports by Dr. Mulbury and Dr. Quinn. The most significant of these reports for present purposes is the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Board Progress Report\u201d submitted by Dr. Mulbury on or about May 12, 1984, approximately one month after Havas\u2019 retirement. The report concluded that Havas would \u201c[n]ever\u201d be able to resume his regular work.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">The record also includes reports from two consulting physicians, Dr. Janina Foltyn and Dr. Joseph J. Fay, both of whom agreed with Dr. Quinn\u2019s diagnosis of degenerative disease of the lumbosacral spine. The consulting physicians, who not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ed that Havas had already retired at the time of their examinations, expressed no opinion as to whether Havas would ever be able to return to his former employment. However, Dr. Fay did opine that Havas had sustained \u201ca mild to moderate partial permanent disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In addition, the record contains statements by Havas at his hearing before the AU complaining of \u201cconstant[], continuous\u201d pain in his lower back that became more intense whenever he was required to sit, stand, or drive for a prolonged period. Havas had given similar descriptions of his pain to the two consulting physicians. There is nothing in the doctors\u2019 reports to suggest that they did not fully credit Havas\u2019 allegations of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">A claimant is entitled to Social Security disability benefits if unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (1982). Briefly stated, the administrative inquiry first determines whether a claimant is able to perform his or her regular employment. If the claimant can, the inquiry is at an end, and benefits are denied. If the claimant cannot perform his or her regular employment, a determination of whether the claimant can perform other gainful work is made. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920 (1986). Because the AU determined that Havas could continue in his former employment, the second determination was never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">A determination by the Secretary that an individual is not disabled is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982); <em>Bluvband v. Heckler, </em>730 F.2d 886, 891 (2d Cir.1984). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d has been defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). In reviewing district court decisions in disability cases, we undertake our own plenary review of the administrative record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>See Valente v. Secretary ofHHS, </em>733 F.2d 1037,1041 (2d Cir.1984). Accordingly, \u201cour focus is not so much on the district court\u2019s ruling as it is on the administrative ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Some time ago, we adopted the so-called \u201ctreating physician\u201d rule whereby the medical opinion of the doctor who treated the claimant is given greater weight relative to other medical evidence before the Secretary. According to this rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARX\">a treating physician\u2019s opinion on the subject of medical disability, i.e., diagnosis and nature and degree of impairment, is: (i) binding on the fact-finder unless contradicted by substantial evidence; and (ii) entitled to some extra weight because the treating physician is usually more familiar with a claimant\u2019s medical condition than are other physicians, although resolution of genuine conflicts between the opinion of the treating physician, with its extra weight, and any substantial evidence to the contrary remains the responsibility of the fact-finder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-11\"><em>Schisler v. Heckler, </em>787 F.2d at 81 (citing <em>Bluvband, </em>730 F.2d at 892-93; <em>Aponte v. Secretary of HHS, </em>728 F.2d 588, 591 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Mongeur v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1033,1039 n. 2 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Gold v. Secretary of HEW, </em>463 F.2d 38, 42 (2d Cir. 1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">The merits of the treating physician rule are not at issue in the present case. This panel is bound by our prior decisions. While the Secretary understandably might disagree with the rule, he has made no attempt to take the issue to the Supreme Court. He also denies that he is following a policy of nonacquiescence, <em>Stieberger, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>801 F.2d at 36, and vigorously professes to follow the rule in adjudicating all disability claims. <em>See Schisler, </em>787 F.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Notwithstanding this seemingly broad area of agreement, the AU\u2019s decision made no express, implied, or even oblique reference to the treating physician rule. That he discounted Dr. Mulbury\u2019s opinion (while misstating Dr. Quinn\u2019s) is evidenced only by his conclusion that Havas could return to work, not by any discussion of the weight of Dr. Mulbury\u2019s opinion vis-avis other evidence in the record. The Appeals Council summarily denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that there is no substantial evidence to refute Dr. Mulbury\u2019s conclusion that Havas cannot return to his job. Had the treating physician rule been applied, therefore, the Secretary would have been bound by that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Dr. Quinn, who last saw Havas on May 24, 1983, concluded that Havas was suffering from a disease that was both \u201cchronic\u201d and \u201cdegenerative.\u201d That diagnosis suggests that Havas might well have been more impaired in 1984 than he was when Dr. Quinn treated him in 1983. Indeed, Dr. Quinn merely noted that Havas was returning to work on a trial basis and referred him back to Dr. Mulbury for followup care. Dr. Quinn thus did not offer an opinion as to whether Havas was disabled one year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Moreover, Dr. Fay and Dr. Foltyn concurred in the diagnosis that Havas was suffering from degenerative disease of the lumbosacral spine, and expressed no opinion as to whether Havas could have remained at his regular job after April 1984. The AU made no mention of Dr. Fay\u2019s conclusion that Havas suffered from \u201ca mild to moderate partial permanent disability of the lower spine,\u201d a finding more consistent with Dr. Mulbury\u2019s conclusion that Havas could not return to his former job than with the AU\u2019s conclusion that Havas had no disabling impairment. In addition, while the AU made findings that Havas could walk, move his spine, and raise his legs, he discounted Dr. Foltyn\u2019s observations that Havas \u201climp[ed] on the left because of pain,\u201d that he could touch his hands to his knees only \u201cwith pain in the left lumbosacral area,\u201d and that he could raise his left leg only \u201cwith pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The mere fact that the consulting physicians did not expressly state that Havas should refrain from extensive driving, whereas one of them stated that he should not engage in \u201cheavy lifting\u201d or \u201cbending activities,\u201d hardly constitutes substantial evidence that Havas could perform the activities required by his former job. Indeed, because these doctors knew that Havas was already retired at the time of their examinations and was no longer driving for prolonged periods, there was no reason to include such a restriction in their reports.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The record also contains the reports of two other physicians, Dr. Ralph S. Brown and Dr. Judith Bodnar, neither of whom examined Havas or specializes in orthopedic medicine. They opined that Havas was capable of returning to work. However, the opinions of nonexamining medical personnel cannot in themselves constitute substantial evidence overriding the opinions of examining physicians. <em>See Martin v. Secretary of HEW, </em>492 F.2d 905, 907-08 (4th Cir.1974); <em>Landess v. Weinberger, </em>490 F.2d 1187, 1190 (8th Cir.1974); <em>Mefford v. Gardner, </em>383 F.2d 748, 759 (6th Cir.1967); <em>Ehrenreich v. Weinberger, </em>397 F.Supp. 693, 697 (W.D.N.Y.1975). Furthermore, the AU did not refer to those reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>In sum, there is no substantial evidence in the record creating a \u201cgenuine conflict[],\u201d <em>Schisler, </em>787 F.2d at 81, with Dr. Mulbury\u2019s opinion that Havas can no longer perform his past work. We therefore remand to the Secretary for a determination as to whether Havas \u201ccannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (1982 &amp; Supp. Ill 1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">This case underlines the need for our recent order in <em>Schisler </em>requiring the Secretary to \u201cstate in relevant publications ... that adjudicators at all levels, state and federal, are to apply the treating physician rule.\u201d 787 F.2d at 84. The ALJ in the instant case was oblivious of his obligation to apply the treating physician rule as the policy adopted by the Secretary. His ignorance of the Secretary\u2019s policy on this issue has, as in other cases, resulted in \u201cunnecessary delay to [a] claimant^] and unnecessary review by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Havas, who is now 60 years old, has pursued disability benefits for more than two years, and the end is not in sight. Furthermore, the administrative failure to apply the proper legal standard has needlessly taxed the resources of the courts, which may be required to review Havas\u2019 claim yet again before it is finally resolved. If the many cases remanded in <em>Schisler </em>pursuant to the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-460, 98 Stat. 1794 (1984), <em>see </em>787 F.2d at 82-85, are adjudicated without regard to the agreed upon legal standard concerning the opinions of treating physicians, we will be faced with countless numbers of cases similar to the present one.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Reversed and remanded to the district court with directions that the matter be remanded to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-8\">. It appears that the State of New York decided to award Havas disability and workers\u2019 compensation benefits after evaluating the reports of the treating and consulting physicians. As we have previously held, \"[w]hile the determination of another governmental agency that a social security disability benefits claimant is disabled is not binding on the Secretary, it is entitled to some weight and should be considered.\" <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir.1975); <em>see also Hankerson v. Harris, </em>636 F.2d 893, 896-97 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-6\">. Havas urges us to find, on the basis of his advanced age, limited education and lack of transferrable job skills, that he is incapable of engaging in any substantial gainful employment. However, because the record is incomplete as to what skills, if any, Havas could transfer to another job, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
