Atkinson argues that the court erred in finding the United States immune from liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act for malpractice incident to pre-natal care she received from military personnel. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b671-25\">In March 1982, Joyce Atkinson was serving as a Specialist (4th Class) with the United States Army in Hawaii. On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>26, during the second trimester of her pregnancy, she reported to Tripler Army Medical Center (\u201cTripler\u201d), complaining of blurred vision, hypertension and edema. The staff at Tripler did not treat her, and told her to go home. Three days later, Atkinson returned to Tripler, complaining of dizziness, nausea and hypertension. Again, the Tripler staff merely told her to go home. Two weeks later, Atkinson returned to Tripler complaining of severe abdominal pain and hypertension. Finally, she was hospitalized for pre-eclampsia, a condition occurring in pregnancy which is life-threatening to both mother and fetus because of associated kidney failure, high blood pressure, stroke and premature birth. She claims that as a result of this negligent medical treatment, she delivered a stillborn child and suffered physical and emotional injuries of her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Atkinson filed a malpractice suit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (1982), alleging that she \u201csuffered great pain of body and mind and sustained serious and permanent bodily injuries as a result of the negligence of defendant\u2019s agents, employees and/or representatives in failing to properly diagnose her condition and hospitalize, treat, monitor and care for her.\u201d The United States filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, for judgment on the pleadings, and for summary judgment. The district court, finding that Atkinson was injured in the course of activity incident to service, held that the United States was immune from malpractice liability. Thus, the district judge granted the motion for summary judgment in a judgment filed April 23, 1985, from which Atkinson filed this timely appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A6M\">Determination of the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Redding Ford v. California State Board of Equalization, </em>722 F.2d 496, 497 (9th Cir.1983), 469 U.S. 817, <em>cert. denied, </em>105 S.Ct. 84, 83 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The FTCA, passed by Congress in 1946, represents the culmination of a long effort to mitigate the unjust consequences of the common law sovereign immunity doctrine which protected the United States from tort liability. <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 139, 71 S.Ct. 153, 156, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). Reacting against the notion that the sovereign could do no wrong, Congress provided in the FTCA that the United States is liable in tort \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (1982). Congress did not exclude military personnel from FTCA coverage. The statute \u201cprovide[s] for District Court jurisdiction over <em>any </em>claim founded on negligence brought against the United States____ \u2018[A]ny claim\u2019 [does not] mean[] \u2018any claim but that of servicemen.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. United States, </em>337 U.S. 49, 51, 69 S.Ct. 918, 919, 93 L.Ed. 1200 (1949) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Despite this \u201csweeping\u201d legislatively-established waiver of immunity, <em>United States v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>340 U.S. 543, 547, 71 S.Ct. 399, 402, 95 L.Ed. 523 (1951), in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 146, 71 S.Ct. 153, 159, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), the Supreme Court created a judicial exception to Congress\u2019s general rule of governmental liability. As originally formulated, this exception, informally known as the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, immunized the Government from liability under the FTCA \u201cfor injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159. The three concerns later identified as the foundation for this doctrine were: (1) the distinctively federal nature of the relationship between the Government and members of its armed forces; (2) the availability of alternative compensation systems; and (3) the fear of damaging the military disciplinary structure. <em>See Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 666, 671-72, 97 S.Ct. 2054, 2057-58, 52 L.Ed.2d 665 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It now is clear, however, that the third concern of the three listed above is determinative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201c[T]he protection of military discipline ... serves largely if not exclusively as the predicate for the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. Although the [Supreme] Court has woven a tangled web in its discussion of the \u2018distinctly federal\u2019 notion and of the alternative compensation system, it has not wavered on the importance of maintaining discipline within the armed forces. The Court has found it unseemly to have military personnel, injured incident to their service, asserting claims that question the propriety of decisions or conduct by fellow members of the military. Only this factor can truly explain the <em>Feres </em>doctrine and the crucial line it draws____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\"><em>Monaco v. United States, </em>661 F.2d 129,132 (9th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Hunt v. United States, </em>636 F.2d 580, 599 (D.C.Cir.1980)), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 2269, 73 L.Ed.2d 1284 (1982). <em>See also Johnson v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 1431, 1436 (9th Cir.1983) (safeguarding military discipline is fundamental rationale for immunity). Indeed, in its latest word on the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, the Supreme Court confirmed that the overriding concerns of the doctrine are with the effect of a tort suit in the second-guessing of military decisions or in the impairment of military discipline. <em>Shearer v. United States, </em>473 U.S. 52, -, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 3043, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985). The Court specifically stated that the other factors enumerated in <em>Feres </em>no longer are controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 105 S.Ct. at 3043 n. 4. Thus, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine bars suit only where a civilian court would be called upon to second-guess military decisions or where the plaintiffs admitted activities are of the sort that would directly implicate the need to safeguard military discipline. <em>See Johnson, </em>704 F.2d at 1436.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">In <em>Shearer, </em>the Supreme Court also confirmed that courts should take a case-by-case, rather than <em>per se, </em>approach to claims of immunity. \u201cThe <em>Feres </em>doctrine cannot be reduced to a few bright-line rules; each case must be examined in light of the statute as it has been construed in <em>Feres </em>and subsequent cases.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3043. Because <em>Shearer </em>makes clear that the paramount concern is with military decisions or discipline, in each case, we must determine the effect of a particular suit on military decisions or discipline. <em>See Johnson, </em>704 F.2d at 1436 (in each case we must determine whether interests protected by <em>Feres </em>doctrine are implicated). \u201c[W]here there is no relevant relationship between the service member\u2019s behavior and the military interests that might be jeopardized by civil suits, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine cannot bar recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1440. <em>See also Stanley v. United States, </em>786 F.2d 1490, 1499 (11th Cir.1986) <em>(Shearer </em>requires case-by-case analysis of whether barring claim serves purposes of <em>Feres </em>doctrine); <em>Bozeman v. United States, </em>780 F.2d 198, 201 (2d Cir. 1985) <em>(Shearer </em>rejects bright-line tests and requires that each case be analyzed for applicability of <em>Feres </em>doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s unequivocal instruction to look at each case independently, we reject prior decisions to the extent they establish a <em>per se </em>rule prohibiting the medical malpractice claims of military personnel. In <em>Henninger v. United States, </em>473 F.2d 814, 815 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 819, 94 S.Ct. 43, 38 L.Ed.2d 51 (1973), we held that <em>Feres </em>barred a military plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim, which was based upon the negligent performance of an elective procedure, because it would be too difficult to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\u201cthe effect that a particular type of suit would have upon military discipline----\u201d We reasoned that \u201c[t]his is a classic situation where the drawing of a clear line is more important than being able to justify in every conceivable case, the exact point at which it is drawn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816. Similarly, in <em>Veillette v. United States, </em>615 F.2d 505, 507 (9th Cir.1980), we refused to determine the effect of a particular malpractice suit on military discipline and morale, relying instead on the conclusory statement that \u201callegations of medical malpractice ... have consistently been held to fall within the bounds of the <em>[Feres'] </em>doctrine when the plaintiff was a serviceman on active duty at the time of the alleged malpractice.\u201d In light of <em>Shearer\u2019s </em>command to the contrary, the <em>per se </em>approach exhibited in <em>Henninger </em>and <em>Veilette </em>is improper. Thus, we are not bound by those cases, or any others applying a <em>per se </em>rule, to hold that <em>Feres </em>bars Atkinson\u2019s suit for negligent care received incident to her pregnancy-</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">13] Given <em>Shearer\u2019s </em>command that in each case we determine the effect of a suit on military decisions or discipline, we cannot rely on any particular factor or factors as a \u201csubstitute for analysis\u201d of whether the suit would threaten military discipline.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Troglia v. United States, </em>602 F.2d 1334, 1338 (9th Cir.1979). Thus, that Atkinson would not have been entitled to care but for her military status is not sufficient to bar her suit. To hold otherwise \u201cwould overlook the foundation of <em>Feres, </em>that the Government\u2019s liability turns not on the reasons for the treatment from which the claim arises, but on the effect of a suit for damages on the military system.\u201d <em>Bankston v. United States, </em>480 F.2d 495, 497-98 (5th Cir.1973). <em>See also Parker v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cThe test is not a purely causal one: one cannot merely state that but for the individual's military service, the injury would not occur.\u201d). Nor is it dispositive that the government\u2019s alleged negligence took place on-base; even where the negligence takes place on-base, we must \u201cexplore the nature of the \u2018function the soldier was performing at the time of the injury in order to ascertain the totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>704 F.2d at 1437 (quoting <em>Parker, </em>611 F.2d at 1014). Similarly, that Atkinson was on active duty status when negligently treated is significant only if she was \u201cengaging in an activity that [was] related in some relevant way to [her] military duties.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>704 F.2d at 1438. Thus, while these factors may aid our inquiry, they are by no means dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 1436 (cannot blindly apply rigid rules). Instead, we must ask whether \u201c[t]he facts of this case, viewed in light of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine\u2019s underlying disciplinary rationale, lead us to conclude that the FTCA does permit [Atkinson\u2019s] cause of action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Making this inquiry, we find that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine does not bar Atkinson\u2019s claim. We first note that pregnant servicewomen did not serve on active duty in 1950 when <em>Feres </em>was decided. Thus, the Supreme Court, in barring the two malpractice claims involved in <em>Feres, </em>could not have had in mind the unique facts involved in Atkinson\u2019s claim. Confronting this novel situation, we fail to see how Atkinson\u2019s suit for negligent care administered in a non-field military hospital incident to her pregnancy can possibly undermine \u201cthe need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted personnel____\u201d <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 304,103 S.Ct. 2362, 2367, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983). At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the time Atkinson sought treatment, she was \u201cnot subject in any real way to the compulsion of military orders or performing any sort of military mission.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>704 F.2d at 1439. No command relationship exists between Atkinson and her attending physician. No military considerations govern the treatment in a non-field hospital of a woman who seeks to have a healthy baby. No military discipline applies to the care a conscientious physician will provide in this situation. Thus, in seeking treatment for complications of her pregnancy, Atkinson \u201cwas subject to military discipline only in the very remotest sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1440. <em>Cf. United States v. Lee, </em>400 F.2d 558, 564 (9th Cir.1968) (\u201cThe necessity of maintaining discipline while a soldier is ... on an operating table is far less clear than the necessity for maintaining discipline among soldiers being transported for military service in military aircraft under control of military authorities.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1053, 89 S.Ct. 691, 21 L.Ed.2d 695 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Moreover, the circumstances of this case simply \u201cdo not involve the sort of close military judgment calls that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine was designed to insulate from judicial review.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>704 F.2d at 1440. We are not dealing with a case \u201cwhere the government\u2019s negligence occurred because of a decision requiring military expertise or judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a court hearing Atkinson\u2019s claim will not have to inquire into \u201ccomplex, subtle, and professional decisions as to composition, training, equipping and control of a military force.\u201d <em>Gilligan v. Morgan, </em>413 U.S. 1, 10, 93 S.Ct. 2440, 2446, 37 L.Ed.2d 407 (1973). The care provided a pregnant woman hardly can be considered to be distinctively military in character. In short, Atkinson\u2019s injuries have nothing to do with her army career \u201cexcept in the sense that all human events depend upon what has already transpired.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>337 U.S. at 52, 69 S.Ct. at 920. There is simply no connection between Atkinson\u2019s medical treatment and the decisional or disciplinary interest protected by the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Because Atkinson\u2019s claim is not the type that \u201cwould involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness,\u201d <em>Shearer, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3044, we hold that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-5\">. The district judge\u2019s order was incorrect procedurally. When a court determines that the United States is immune from liability under the FTCA, the proper disposition is a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, not a grant of summary judgment. <em>Broudy v. United States, </em>661 F.2d 125, 128 n. 5 (9th Cir.1981). In light of our holding, however, this error is of no consequence. Since properly viewed, this case involves an appeal from an order dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction, we accept as true, for purposes of appeal, the factual allegations contained in Atkinson\u2019s complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 126 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. We have noted previously the anomalous results obtained through reliance on these factors. <em>See Troglia v. United States, </em>602 F.2d 1334, 1337-38 (9th Cir.1979). For example, military personnel may sue in tort where military aircraft fall on their houses located off-base. <em>Sapp v. United States, </em>153 F.Supp. 496 (W.D.La.1957). Military personnel may not sue, however, where the aircraft fall on homes located on-base. <em>Preferred Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>222 F.2d 942 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 837, 76 S.Ct. 94, 100 L.Ed. 747 (1955). <em>See also Veillette v. United States, </em>615 F.2d 505, 507 (9th Cir.1980) (that civilians, as well as military personnel, are admitted to military hospital draws attention to \"the anomalies created by the court-made exception to the Tort Claims Act).\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
