United States Dept, of Treasury, IRS, </em>794 F.2d 1041 (5th Cir. 1986), we held that the government was liable to the plaintiff Don Huckaby for an unlawful disclosure of his tax return information under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431. The case was remanded for determination of costs and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. <em>Id. </em>at 1050-51. The government petitions for rehearing on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, arguing that Huckaby is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, either under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430, or under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. In the alternative, the government requests that the issue of Huckaby\u2019s entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees be remanded to the district court. Because we conclude that Huckaby is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430, the government\u2019s petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430, governs the awarding of costs and fees to litigants in tax cases. Section 7430(a) specifies when litigation costs may be recovered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">(a) In general. \u2014 In the case of any civil proceeding which is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">(1) brought by or against the United States in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, interest, or penalty under this title, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">(2) brought in a court of the United States (including the Tax Court and the United States Claims Court),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">the prevailing party may be awarded a judgment for reasonable litigation costs incurred in such proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">Section 7430(c)(l)(A)(iv) specifies that litigation costs include: \u201creasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of attorneys in connection with civil proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">We conclude that section 7430 applies to Huckaby\u2019s suit brought under section 7431 because Huckaby\u2019s underlying claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cwas in connection with the determination, collection or refund of any tax, interest, or panalty\u201d; Huckaby\u2019s claim arose because the IRS was in possession of Huckaby\u2019s records for the purpose of determining his tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">A more difficult question is whether Huckaby qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Section 7430(c) provides the following definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-19\">(A) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The term \u201cprevailing party\u201d means any party to any proceeding described in subsection (a) (other than the United States or any creditor of the taxpayer involved) which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-20\">(i) establishes that the position of the United States in the civil proceeding was unreasonable, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-21\">(ii) <em>(I) </em>has substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-22\"><em>(II) </em>has substantially prevailed with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-23\">(B) <em>Determination as to prevailing party. </em>\u2014 Any determination under sub-paragraph (A) as to whether a party is a prevailing party shall be made\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-24\">(1) by the court, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-25\">(ii) by agreement of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-26\">The government argues that Huckaby is not a prevailing party because he has not shown that the government\u2019s position was unreasonable, nor has he substantially prevailed as to the most significant issues presented. We disagree and hold that Huckaby does qualify as a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The question whether Huekaby has established that the position of the government was unreasonable is not a simple one. There is a lack of helpful case law in this area, although the government correctly points out that the fact that it lost the case cannot be dispositive of reasonableness, otherwise the \u201cunreasonable position\u201d limitation would be meaningless. The government also finds support in the language from the House Report which suggests that a government position cannot be unreasonable if a district court rules in its favor. (H.R.Rep. No. 404, 97th Cong., 1st Sess at 15). But this factor, obviously an important consideration, cannot be dispositive of the question of reasonableness since it would automatically require appeal courts to assume that every district court acts on a soundly reasoned basis in every tax case. Because this will not always be true, we must make a distinction between cases in which there exist two plausible interpretations and cases in which the district court simply misconstrues the statute and underlying regulations. We held in our earlier opinion that the present case is of the latter class. Another factor potentially in the government\u2019s favor is that this case is one of first impression involving novel issues. Although the government\u2019s position has been found unreasonable when it has been contrary to established prior decisions, <em>Columbus Fruit &amp; Vegetable Coop. Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>8 Cl.Ct. 525 (1985), where the issue is one of first impression, at least one court has held the government\u2019s position to be reasonable even where the Commissioner on appeal conceded all issues which gave rise to deficiencies. <em>Baker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, </em>83 T.C. 822 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">On balance, however, we conclude that the government\u2019s position was unreasonable because the actual arguments advanced by the government either rang hollow or were specious or defied its own regulations. We rejected the government\u2019s argument that collateral estoppel- precluded Huckaby\u2019s claim because there was no identity of issues with the prior proceeding and thus it was clear that the government\u2019s argument failed. <em>Huckaby v. United States Dept. of Treasury, IRS, </em>794 F.2d at 1046. We also rejected the interpretation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the government urged successfully upon the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1047. That interpretation held that oral consents by the taxpayer were sufficient to authorize this disclosure. We rejected the position as being contrary to clear statutory intent, and further noted that it would lead to absurd results. <em>Id. </em>at 1047. And while we accepted the government\u2019s contention that an objective standard applied to the good-faith exception to section 7431, we held that it was self-evident that Agent Martin was not acting in good faith because a reasonable IRS agent would know the relevant statutory provisions by consulting IRS manuals, which Martin did not do. <em>Id. </em>at 1048-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The government argues that Huckaby has not met the second prong of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement of section 7430(c)(2)(A)(ii) since he collected only $1,000 out of a possible $8,000 statutory award, and failed to collect punitive damages (which could have added another $20,-000 to the award). Furthermore, Huckaby has prevailed on only one of his allegations of unlawful conduct (Agent Martin\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>viding Huckaby\u2019s records to state agent Dolezal). Huckaby, however, has prevailed on the primary issue: whether the government was liable for tax return disclosures that were given without <em>written consent </em>Section 7430(c)(2)(A)(ii)(II) is phrased in terms of issues not claims. We therefore hold that Huckaby has met the second prong of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We are aware of the fact that the issues posed by the government\u2019s request for a rehearing are novel ones on which there is a scarcity of authority. Nevertheless, for the reasons we have stated, we are convinced that our prior decision to award Huckaby attorney\u2019s fees was indeed correct. We therefore deny the government\u2019s petition for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">PETITION FOR REHEARING DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-14\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431 provides relief to persons whose tax returns have been unlawfully disclosed by government employees.
