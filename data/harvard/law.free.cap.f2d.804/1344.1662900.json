The question is whether, under Louisiana law, the grant of an overriding mineral royalty by a mineral lessee imposes an implied obligation on the lessee to protect the royalty owner from drainage caused by the lessee\u2019s operations on adjacent lands.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>We answer neither affirmatively nor negatively. Instead, we answer the question with another question: is the diminution of the royalty owners\u2019 payments the result of a breach of the lessee's implied obligation to act in good faith with respect to the interest of the royalty owner? Because the district court did not address this second question, we remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">\n<em>1. The Facts and Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">This case arises from an agreement in 1951 between Gulf Oil Corporation (\u201cGulf\u201d) and the predecessors of Tidelands Royalty \u201cB\u201d Corporation (\u201cTidelands\u201d). The object of the agreement was the sale to Gulf of confidential geophysical data covering 2,700,000 acres of offshore lands off the Louisiana coast. The consideration for this data was $2,000,000 and the promise to grant overriding royalties in any leases obtained over certain tracts designated in the agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gulf was successful in obtaining leases from the federal government for Blocks 332 and 333 in the West Cameron Area off the coast of Louisiana. Block 333 is not within the area subject to the agreement, but 4,062 acres of Block 332 are covered by the agreement. Fulfilling its obligation under the agreement, Gulf assigned an overriding royalty interest to Tidelands covering the 4,062 acres and incorporating the terms of the 1951 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-10\">Gulf began operations on its leases. After drilling a dry well in Block 332, a successful gas well was completed in Block 333. From a drilling platform later erected on Block 333, five more wells were directionally drilled. Gulf completed two wells in Block 332 and three wells in Block 333. At least two of the wells in Block 333 are draining gas from reservoirs that underlie both blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">Tidelands brought this suit contending that Gulf breached an implied covenant to protect Tidelands from drainage caused by Gulf\u2019s operations in Block 333. Gulf admitted the fact of drainage, but argued that the 1951 agreement precludes the implication of an obligation to protect against drainage. On Tidelands\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, the trial court held that \u201cthere is an implied covenant under the 1951 Agreement which requires Gulf to protect Tidelands\u2019 interests from drainage <em>by Gulfs own operations.\u201d </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gulf appeals from this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">\n<em>II. The Nature of the Relationship Between Gulf and Tidelands</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">The agreement between Gulf and Tidelands does not expressly create an obligation to protect against drainage. Implied obligations, however, are common in mineral leases. For example, there is no doubt that a lessee has an implied obligation to protect his lessor from drainage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This obligation derives from the basic obligation of the lessee to act as \u201ca reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>prudent operator\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The existence of drainage does not necessarily indicate a breach of any implied obligation. Rather, a breach is shown only upon proof that the lessee neglected to take the same economically feasible steps that a reasonably prudent operator would have taken to protect against the drainage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\">The district court of course noted that the agreement between Gulf and Tidelands is not a mineral lease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court concluded, however, that the implied obligations attending a mineral lease also attend overriding royalty interests.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This finding serves as the premise for the district court\u2019s holding. We do not accept it as dispositive of this case, because it does not take into consideration the different relationships from which overriding royalties are created.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">The district court relied on the Louisiana case of <em>Wier v. </em>Grubb<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and two Texas cases, <em>Bolton v. Coats</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. </em>Taylor<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in concluding that the implied obligations in mineral leases apply to overriding royalties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In each of these cases, the overriding royalty was created in the context of a sublease agreement; the original lessee assigned his interest to another and retained an overriding royalty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under Louisiana law, the assignment of a lease with the retention of an overriding royalty creates a sublease, regardless of how the parties style their agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the cases cited by the district court support only the proposition that a sublessor is entitled to the protection of the same implied obligations that protect the original lessor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because Tidelands is not Gulf\u2019s sublessor, these cases are not dispositive in defining Gulf\u2019s implied obligations to Tidelands.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-18\">As in this case, royalty interests may be created outside of the lessor-lessee relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>ship. A landowner may convey a royalty interest in his land before leasing or may convey a portion of his reserved royalty in an existing lease.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The creation of a royalty interest by these means establishes an executive-nonexecutive relationship. The landowner holds an executive interest \u2014 the exclusive right to grant leases on the subject tract.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The royalty owner holds a nonexecutive interest \u2014 an interest that does not include the right to grant leases.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The distinguishing characteristic of a non-executive royalty interest is its \u201cpassive\u201d nature.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The royalty owner has no right to explore, develop, or lease the subject tract.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the landowner has no obligation to develop or lease the premises for the benefit of the royalty owner.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the nonexecutive royalty owner may be dependent solely on the executive\u2019s will to realize the potential value of his royalty, the realization that the landowner also has an interest in leasing and development justifies the gamble of purchasing the royalty.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">We find that the rules governing the executive-nonexecutive relationship apply to the relationship between Gulf and Tidelands. Tidelands has only a passive interest in the tracts subject to its overriding royalty. It has no right to produce or explore for minerals in the tracts, nor is it obligated to share the costs of production. The agreement specifically negates any duty of Gulf to acquire leases on the tracts or develop any leases that may be acquired.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In these respects, the relationship between Gulf and Tidelands is consistent with the description of an executivenonexecutive relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-14\">In contrast, the relationship of the parties here is inconsistent with a lessor-lessee relationship. A lessee undertakes an affirmative, implied obligation to develop the leased premises.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The parties specifically agreed that Gulf did not have this duty. Moreover, the lessor surrenders his exclusive right to explore for and produce minerals in exchange for the lessee\u2019s obligation to develop and protect from drainage.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Unlike a lessor or sublessor, Tidelands had <em>no </em>interest in the tracts when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>sold the geophysical data in exchange for cash and possible overriding royalties. Finally, the lessor does not dispose of his interest, he only leases it. Thus, the lessee must reasonably develop the property or lose his lease; otherwise, the lessee could permanently deprive the lessor of his reversionary interest in the minerals underlying the leased land.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Tidelands, on the other hand, has no reversionary mineral interest in the tracts being drained. Its only \u201cinterest\u201d in the tracts was its compilation of geophysical data concerning those tracts, which it disposed of in exchange for $2,000,000 and possible overriding royalties.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, Gulf\u2019s obligation to Tidelands to protect against drainage should not be determined under the \u201creasonably prudent operator\u201d standard imposed on a mineral lessee. Instead, Gulf\u2019s obligations should be determined under the standard of care owed to a nonexecutive royalty owner by his grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">\n<em>III. The Nature of the Duty Owed to the Nonexecutive Royalty Owner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">Before 1975, Louisiana courts declined to recognize any implied duties arising from the executive-nonexecutive relationship. In <em>Uzee v. </em>Bollinger;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Louisiana First Circuit upheld the right of the executive to execute a lease with terms that favored the executive at the expense of the nonexecutive royalty owner.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The <em>Uzee </em>court held that the executive did not act as a fiduciary,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> nor was he under a duty \u201cto deal fairly and in good faith\u201d.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In a similar situation, the Louisiana Supreme Court approved the holding of <em>Uzee </em>in <em>Gardner v. </em>Boagni.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> These decisions followed earlier ones that had recognized the executive\u2019s right to refrain from leasing so that the royalty interest burdening his right would expire by prescription.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Louisiana jurisprudence contrasted with that of most states, which recognize an implied duty in the executive-nonexecutive relationship ranging from that of \u201cgood faith and fair dealing\u201d to that of a fiduciary.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>The duties of the executive were addressed by the legislature in 1975 with the enactment of the Mineral Code. Article 109 of the Mineral Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-4\">The owner of the executive interest is not obligated to grant a mineral lease, but in doing so, he must act in good faith and in the same manner as a reasonably prudent landowner or mineral servitude owner whose interest is not burdened by a nonexecutive interest.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZtp\">The purpose of this article is to overrule the decisions in <em>Uzee </em>and <em>Gardner </em>\u201cinsofar as they hold that the executive owes no duty whatsoever to the nonexecutive.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To this extent, the official comment to article 109 indicates that the standard imposed on the executive is that suggested by Williams and M\u00e9yers in their treatise, <em>Oil and Gas </em>Law.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">Williams and Meyers articulate the standard of an \u201cordinary, prudent landowner, not burdened by an outstanding non-executive interest\u201d to govern all aspects of the executive\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Under this standard, the executive may not refuse to lease simply to allow the royalty owner\u2019s interest to expire.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> An affirmative duty to protect against drainage may also be derived from this standard.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Article 109 negates, however, any affirmative duty of the executive to act to protect the nonexecutive\u2019s interest. Specifically, it does not require the executive to lease the land burdened by the royalty. The only express duty created by article 109 is to act in good faith in granting a lease. Enactment of the Mineral Code, therefore, did not completely overrule past jurisprudence in favor of the principles followed in other jurisdictions and summarized by Williams and Meyers. Indeed, the express provisions of article 109 do not squarely apply to this case. Nevertheless, the article does reflect an alteration in the principles governing the executive-nonexecutive relationship, which, we have decided, do govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-12\">The Mineral Code preserves the rule of the earlier jurisprudence that the nonexecutive royalty interest is passive and is not generally protected by any implied affirmative duties of the grantor of that right absent a lessor-lessee relationship. The royalty owner\u2019s interest is speculative: a hope that the grantor\u2019s own interest in securing production will, in fact, result in production from the tract burdened by the royalty. If this hope fails to materialize because of the grantor\u2019s inaction, the royalty owner has no complaint.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-13\">On the other hand, once the grantor of a royalty interest does exercise his development rights, he must act with good faith towards the interests of the royalty owner.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The grantor need not act contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>the conduct of a reasonable landowner nor his own economic interests to fulfill his duty of good faith.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Good faith requires only that the grantor avoid structuring his conduct to gain an advantage that is derived solely by avoiding the burden of the royalty.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> If the conduct of the grantor is supported by reasons other than merely the advantage of avoiding the royalty burden, the standard of good faith may be fulfilled even though the royalty owner is harmed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> These considerations are embodied in the standard articulated by article 109 as \u201ca reasonable prudent landowner or mineral servitude owner whose interest is not burdened by a nonexecutive interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">\n<em>IV. Application of the Standard of Good Faith to Gulfs Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">The trial court concluded that Gulf assumed an implied duty to protect Tidelands from drainage caused by Gulfs operations on Block 333 by taking \u201csuch steps as a reasonably prudent operator would have taken\u201d.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> This standard of conduct, that of a lessee to his lessor, imposes an affirmative duty on Gulf to take economically feasible steps to protect Tidelands from drainage.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We have concluded, however, that the obligation of good faith implicit in the relationship between Gulf and Tidelands does not create an affirmative duty on Gulf to protect Tidelands\u2019 interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">The trial court found that the circumstance that Gulf\u2019s own operations is causing the drainage supported imposition of a more stringent duty on Gulf. In <em>Breaux v. Pan American Petroleum </em>Corp.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> the Louisiana Third Circuit held that the lessee is bound by the same standard of conduct regardless of whether drainage is caused by his own operations or by those of another.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We followed the rule of <em>Breaux </em>in our opinions in <em>Williams v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. </em><footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Gulf\u2019s conduct should be governed by the same standard even though it is responsible for the drainage from Block 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-16\">In its argument on appeal, Gulf maintains that the terms of the 1951 agreement preclude the implication of any duty that would serve to protect Tidelands from drainage. The agreement does provide language that expressly precludes an obligation on Gulf to drill or develop the tracts.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This language could be read as specifically precluding an obligation to drill offset wells to protect against drainage. Whether the language should be given this interpretation is of no immediate concern because we have decided that, more broadly, it negates the existence of a lessor-les<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>see type of relationship that would give rise to an implied, affirmative obligation to protect against drainage. The language cannot be read, however, to negate the minimal duty of good faith! Provisions in derogation of the implied obligations in a mineral contract are strictly construed.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> \u201cClear and unequivocal\u201d language is necessary to indicate that the parties intended to reduce the standard of conduct owed under the contract.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Even if the contract purported to eliminate all implied duties, public policy probably requires no less than a standard of good faith.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Having undertaken development of the offshore tracts, Gulf is obligated to act in good faith with respect to Tidelands\u2019 interests. To prevail on its claims, Tidelands must show that a reasonable operator in Gulf\u2019s position would have conducted its development differently had there been no royalty interest burdening the tract within Block 332. Merely showing that there are economically feasible steps that Gulf could undertake to protect Tidelands from drainage is insufficient to meet this burden. Gulf need not act to its economic detriment by drilling two wells\u2014 one on Block 333 and one on Block 332 \u2014 to drain the same reservoir that could be more efficiently drained by one well, even though both wells would be profitable.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Nor is Gulf obligated to undertake any other affirmative steps to protect Tidelands if such steps have no economic benefit to Gulf.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">If, however, Tidelands can show that Gulf would have drilled on Block 332, instead of Block 333, to drain a common reservoir <em>but for </em>the advantage of avoiding royalty payments, then Tidelands would show a breach of good faith. Gulf may decide what location or locations are most efficient to drain a reservoir. In doing so, however, Gulf must make its decision as if Tidelands\u2019 royalty interest did not exist. It may not locate a well outside of the tract subject to Tidelands\u2019 royalty when the available evidence indicates that the most efficient location is inside the tract. Drilling outside of the tract burdened by Tidelands\u2019 royalty in such a situation would create an advantage that derived solely from the avoidance of Tidelands\u2019 royalty and would constitute a breach of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">The district court decided only that an obligation to protect against drainage existed in favor of Tidelands. It did not decide whether that obligation had been breached, because that question involved disputed issues not yet resolved. Similarly, we cannot decide whether Gulf has breached its obligation of good faith because this question requires consideration of facts not resolved on the record. Indeed, Tidelands\u2019 complaint does not make allegations sufficient to create a material dispute concerning the good faith of Gulf\u2019s conduct. We find that the interests of justice require, however, that on remand Tidelands be allowed to amend its complaint to allege a breach of Gulf\u2019s obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>gation of good faith under the standards that we have set forth. Finally, we note that if Tidelands is unable to raise a material dispute over whether Gulf has breached its obligation of good faith conduct, summary disposition of this case would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">The implied obligation to protect against drainage is well recognized and understood in the lessor-lessee relationship, the typical situation giving rise to a royalty interest. That obligation is fundamentally different from the implied obligation of good faith arising from the executive-nonexecutive relationship, the other common situation giving rise to a royalty interest. This case involves, however, an atypical oil and gas agreement. The relationship between the parties is neither that of a lessor and lessee nor that of an executive and nonexecutive. Nevertheless, an examination of the nature of the agreement in this case leads to the conclusion that Gulfs implied duty towards Tidelands is only one of good faith \u2014 the standard of conduct implicit in an executive-nonexecutive relationship. Whether Gulf is liable to Tidelands for the drainage caused by Gulfs operations on Block 333 depends on whether Gulf has breached its obligation of good faith in conducting its development of the gas sands underlying the tract burdened by Tidelands royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">The opinion of the district court is REVERSED and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">. The district court found that it had jurisdiction of this action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349(b)(1) (1982), and that \u00a7 1333(a)(2), (4) of the Act required application of the law of the state adjacent to the contested mineral operations, which, in this case, is Louisiana. These findings are correct and are not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">Although this appeal is from an interlocutory order, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The trial court certified the question to this court and we granted permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>present this appeal by our order of August 13, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">.

The parties do not contest this holding. Furthermore, because of our analysis of the issue, separation of the issue into the obligation to protect from drainage caused by one's own operations and drainage caused by another\u2019s operations is unnecessary. <em>See </em>text accompanying notes 49-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1456-15\">. <em>Williams v.

The district court found <em>Cook </em>particularly instructive because of its similar facts: the overriding royalty owner suffered drainage caused by the lessee\u2019s operations on an adjacent tract and the federal government was the lessor of both the drained and draining tracts. The situation in <em>Cook </em>is different from our situation, however, because the royalty owner in <em>Cook </em>was the original lessee and acquired her royalty by reservation under a sublease. <em>See Cook, </em>560 F.2d at 980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1457-20\">. The district court did note that the cases on which it relied concerned overriding royalties created by reservation in a sublease rather than those created by grant. 611 F.Supp. at 802 n. 16. It found, nonetheless, that \"there is no basis for a legal distinction between overriding royalties created by grant, and those created by reservation.\" <em>Id. </em>(citing 2 Williams &amp; Meyers, <em>Oil and Gas Law </em>\u00a7 418 (1985); M. Merrill, <em>Covenants Implied in Oil and Gas Leases </em>\u00a7 191 (1940)). This finding may be appropriate if this case were not governed by Louisiana law. In most other jurisdictions, the royalty owner is protected by the same or similar implied obligations regardless of the source of that royalty. <em>See Part III </em>of this opinion. In Louisiana, however, the nature of the rights that attend a royalty interest depend on nature of the contractual relationship from which the royalty was created. H.

Moreover, the grant of royalty interest outside of the lease context usually creates a much lower degree of duty to the royalty owner. <em>See Part III </em>of this opinion.

The royalty owner purchased a <em>\u00bc </em>royalty interest in all royalties paid under future leases. The landowner-executive negotiated a lease that provided for a total royalty of <em>\u00bc </em>of production. This royalty was divided, however, into a \"base\u201d royalty of <em>\u215b </em>and \"overriding\u201d royalties of <em>\u2018A. </em>Under the law then in effect, the royalty owner\u2019s share was computed from the \u201cbase\u201d royalty. The overriding royalty was considered \u201cbonus\u201d, however, and belonged solely to the landowner. Therefore, the royalty owner\u2019s share of production was <em>\u00bc </em>of <em>\u215b, </em>or <em>1/32. </em>Had the landowner negotiated for a single base royalty of <em>\u00bc, </em>the royalty owner\u2019s share would have been <em>\u00bc </em>of <em>\u00bc, </em>or 1/16.

The situation in <em>Spiner v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>94 F.Supp. 273 (W.D.La.1950) provides an example of this principle and is somewhat analogous to the case before us. The plaintiff acquired a royalty interest on a certain tract from the landowners, who later executed a lease on that tract. The lessee completed a well on a neighboring tract but failed to develop the tract on which the plaintiff held his royalty. The plaintiff sued his grantors and their lessee alleging damages from drainage and nondevelopment. The court dismissed the claims and held that the grantors of the royalty and their lessee were under no duty to drill or unitize the tract for the benefit of the royalty owner. <em>Id. </em>at 275-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1460-16\">.

This example illustrates the practical difference between the implied duty owed a lessor and that owed a nonexecutive royalty owner. In a common drainage situation, the lessee owes his lessor an obligation to drill an offset well or to unitize the adjoining tracts even if contrary to his economic interests unless such action will leave him without any profit. <em>See Williams, </em>432 F.2d at 173-74.

Under our analysis of Gulfs duty, Gulf is not obligated to affirmatively seek unitization of Blocks 332 and 333 for Tidelands\u2019 benefit. If Gulf does undertake pooling arrangements concerning Block 332, however, it must act in good faith with respect to Tidelands\u2019 interest. Gulf may not exclude Tidelands from any pooling arrangement or act inconsistently in its pooling of production from Block 332 solely to avoid payment of additional royalties to Tidelands.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
