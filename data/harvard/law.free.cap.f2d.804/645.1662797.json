Rush, d/b/a Rush Engineers (Rush), and denying Rush\u2019s motion to set aside that judgment, 9 Cl.Ct. 316 (1986). We <em>affirm,.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">Because Rush\u2019s April 11, 1985 motion to dismiss the contingent cross-claim contained nothing whatever to indicate any objection to the alleged insufficiency of service in this case, the Claims Court correctly determined that Rush had waived any objection he may have had concerning that defense. 9 Cl.Ct. at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-22\">Under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(b) (1982), the Claims Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the Government\u2019s claims against third parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(1) where the Government\u2019s claim is for the recovery of money which it has already paid out to the third party in respect of the transaction or matter which constitutes the subject matter of the suit, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">(2) where the third party appears and asserts a claim or an interest in a claim against the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>Bowser, Inc. v. United States, </em>420 F.2d 1057, 1062, 190 Ct.Cl. 441 (1970); <em>see, e.g., Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, </em>141 F.Supp. 900,135 Ct.Cl. 428 (1956); <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. United States, </em>144 Ct.Cl. 686, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 1001, 79 S.Ct. 1140, 3 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1959); <em>Amdal v. F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>84 F.Supp. 657 (D.C.Iowa 1949). Therefore, that Rush had never asserted a claim against the Government is of no moment, the government\u2019s cross-claim being for the recovery of money it had paid out to Rush in respect of the transaction or matter which constituted the subject matter of the principal action by Transamerica. <em>See Transamerica Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>6 Cl.Ct. 367 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Rush\u2019s arguments that \u00a7 114(b) is unconstitutional because it: (1) allows the Claims Court, an Article I court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 171(a), to exercise the judicial power of the United States; and (2) denies his right to a jury trial, have been held without merit by one of our predecessor courts. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>144 Ct.Cl. at 688; <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>141 F.Supp. at 905-06; <em>accord Myrtle Beach Pipeline Co. v. United States, </em>6 Cl.Ct. 363, 366 (1984). Bound by the decisions of our predecessor courts in <em>Seaboard Surety </em>and <em>Maryland Casualty, </em>this three-judge panel is without power to declare \u00a7 114(b) unconstitutional on its own, <em>South Corp. v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed.Cir.1982), and has been shown no basis for seeking <em>in banc </em>consideration of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Rush\u2019s reliance on <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982), is unpersuasive. There, the Supreme Court recognized three exceptions to the constitutional command that the judicial power of the United States be vested in Article III courts: cases in territorial courts, courts-martial, and cases involving \u201cpublic rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-67, 102 S.Ct. at 2867-69. This case involves public rights, i.e., a matter arising between the government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive and legislative branches and which historically could have been determined exclusively by those branches. <em>Id. </em>at 67-69, 102 S.Ct. at 2869-70. <em>Northern Pipeline </em>was a suit in bankruptcy court involving private rights, \u201cthe liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.\u201d <em>Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 51, 52 S.Ct. 285, 292, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\">This opinion was issued on September 11, 1986 in \"unpublished\u201d form.
