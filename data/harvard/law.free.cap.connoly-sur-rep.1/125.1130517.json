St. \u00a74 :, \u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation; \u201d and subdivision 7 : \u201c The personal estate of every incorporated company, not made liable on its capital in the fourth title of this chapter.\u201d Title 4, \u00a7 1, is as follows : \u201c All moneyed or stock corporations deriving an income or profit from their capital, or otherwise, shall be liable to taxation on their capital, in the manner hereinafter described.\u201d Section 2: \u201c The president.....or other proper officer of every such incorporated company shall.....make and deliver to the assessors a written statement specifying : (1) The real estate owned by such company; (2) the capital stock actually paid in, and secured to be paid in, excepting therefrom the sums paid for real estate, and the amount of such capital stock held by the state, and by any incorporated literary or charitable institutions.....\u201d The Bank Clerks\u2019 Mutual Benefit Association was incorporated March 24, 1869, under the general \u201c Act for the incorporation of benevolent, charitable, scientific, and missionary societies,\u201d enacted in 1848, but there is no provision in its charter exempting it from taxation. It is only by implication and analogy that it can be claimed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>any right to be exempted. In article 2 of its constitution, which treats of membership, it is expressly stated in section 1 that \u201c no applicant shall be admitted to membership after attaining the age of 50 years.\u201d Section 2 provides that <em>u </em>all applications for membership must be accompanied by a certificate of health from one of the examining physicians of the association, and be referred to the committee on the admission of members. The applicant for membership, if accepted, shall pay the fee of the medical examiner.\u201d Article 12 provides that \u201c any member failing to pay his assessments for three consecutive months shall forfeit his membership, and all the benefits resulting therefrom, and shall not be readmitted to membership in the association under any circumstances.\u201d These provisions seem to establish the fact that the association is nothing more than a mutual benefit insurance association, like the Knights of Honor, the Royal Arcanum, and numerous other and kindred associations. It is restricted to a certain class, and to a certain community; but the objects are the same,\u2014for the aid of the sick and disabled members, and some provision for the families of deceased members; the burden falling as lightly as possible upon the association by limiting their assessment to one dollar for each death, and arranging for the reduction of even that amount in the discretion of the officers of the association. There seems to be no definite amount set apart to be paid in case of sickness or death; it is apparently left to the exigencies of the case or the discretion of the officers. In that respect it differs from the purely benefit insurance companies, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>a definite amount is fixed upon as the insurance, and where, in the case of sickness, it is generally a set sum. In Catlin v. Trinity College, 22 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>28 ; 49 <em>Hun </em>278, it was held \u201c that since a church is exempt only as to its buildings, lots, and furniture \u201d under 2 Rev. St. (7th ed.) 982, \u00a7 4 (8th ed. 1083), and both the church and the missionary society fall outside of the exemptions of subdivision 6, of \u201call stock owned by the state or by literary or charitable institutions,\u201d and subdivision 7, \u201c of the personal estate of every incorporated company not made liable to taxation on its capital, they are neither exempt from taxation, and are subject to the tax on their bequests.....\u201d There seems to be no ground, therefore, for sustaining the contention of the Bank Clerks\u2019 Mutual Benefit Association that the legacy of $10,000, which passes to it under the will of 'this decedent, is exempt from the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The appraiser\u2019s report is confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
