Here, Millicent Sumpter (\u201cMother\u201d) challenges the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\u2019s application of its \u201cPolicy Regarding Distribution of Court Ordered Evaluative Reports\u201d (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) and its subsequent award of sole legal and physical custody of her children to Sean Sumpter (\u201cFather\u201d). The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court. We granted Mother\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in refusing to vacate and remand the case to the circuit court when the parties and the best interest attorney were not provided a copy of the custody investigation report in violation of constitutional due process?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">In our initial consideration of this appeal <em>(\u201cSumpter I </em>\u201d), we declined to reach the merits of Mother\u2019s petition and remanded the case \u201cfor supplementation of the record as to the full contours of [the Policy].\u201d <em>Sumpter v. Sumpter, </em>427 Md. 668, 670, 50 A.3d 1098, 1099 (2012). With the written expression of the Policy in hand, we now reach the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Father filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for absolute divorce from Mother on March 24, 2010. Father also sought sole physical and legal custody of the couple\u2019s two children. Before the merits hearing on Father\u2019s petition for divorce, the court ordered that the Adoption and Custody Unit (\u201cACU\u201d) for the Circuit Court complete a custody investigation report (\u201cthe Report\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Report summarizes interviews that ACU staff conducted with the parties, the parties\u2019 relatives and partners, and the children. The Report also describes the parties\u2019 personal, criminal, health, education, housing, child protective services, and employment histories. This information is presented as findings in the Report\u2019s first 17 pages. The findings are supplemented with 17 attachments. These attachments span 147 pages and consist of various records upon which the ACU based its findings, including: Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services records for Mother, Father, and Father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; school records for the children; mental health records for the children and Mother; peace orders awarded to Father\u2019s mother and Father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e against Mother; peace orders awarded to Mother against Father and Father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; a guilty plea by Mother in a matter in the Superior Court of Liberty County, Georgia; a Jacksonville, Florida police report about the death of Mother\u2019s cousin; and an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City returning one of Mother\u2019s other children to her custody after the child had been in the \u201cChild in Need of Assistance\u201d program. The Report does not make a recommendation concerning custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The Report was due on November 1, 2010,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in time for a scheduled pre-trial conference, but the ACU did not file the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Report with the court until December 3, 2010. That day, the ACU sent counsel for both parties a letter indicating that the Report was complete and could be reviewed at the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office. Counsel for Mother received this notification on December 6, 2010, and visited the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office at 2:30 p.m. that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We digress a little at this point. According to the record, the Policy was promulgated on June 25, 2004, as evidenced by a Memorandum from the Judge In Charge of the Family Division to other judges, masters, and \u201cAll Members of the Family Law Bar.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s access to the Report in the present case was limited by the Policy, which states the following concerning litigants\u2019 access to the Report:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Review of Reports</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u2022 Attorneys will be allowed to view all of the sections of a report in the office of the Clerk of the Court (room 109). They will not be allowed to carry the report out of the Clerk\u2019s office and will not be allowed to copy the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u2022 Pro Se litigants will be allowed to view the Recommendation section and the section of the report evaluating them in the office of the Clerk of the Court (room 109). They will not be allowed to carry the report out of the Clerk\u2019s office and will not be able to copy the report. They will not be allowed access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>sections of the report that evaluate the other party or any minor children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u2022 Counsel for children will be allowed to view all sections of a report in the Office of the Clerk of the Court (room 109). They will not be allowed to carry the report out of the Clerk\u2019s office and will not be able to copy the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u2022 Attorneys may obtain copies of a report with an Order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u2022 Pro Se litigants may be allowed to view all sections of a report with an Order of the Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Mother\u2019s counsel studied the 161-page Report and took notes for ninety minutes until the Family Division\u2019s Clerk\u2019s office closed to the public for the day.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mother\u2019s counsel were not able to return to the clerk\u2019s office before the merits hearing, and did not see the Report again until that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The two-day merits hearing began on December 13, 2010. Mother\u2019s counsel moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the Report from evidence, or, in the alternative, to receive a copy of the Report. The trial court denied these motions, erroneously stating that the Policy \u201cprevented] copies from being out even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>in the control of counsel[.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court did allow counsel access to the Report during breaks and for the purpose of examining witnesses. To accomplish this, the court\u2019s copy of the Report had to be shared amongst counsel, the mechanics of which brought some measure of absurdity to the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The trial court granted Father\u2019s petition for divorce and awarded him sole legal and physical custody of the children. Mother appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Policy violated her due process rights. Specifically, Mother asserted that the Policy prevented her and her counsel from receiving a copy of the Report, and provided them insufficient time to review its contents. Mother claims that this inhibited her ability to prepare for trial, frustrated her ability to retain an expert, and ultimately, prevented her from challenging the Report as she would any other piece of evidence. In short, Mother argued that the Policy afforded her inadequate procedural protection, given her fundamental liberty interest in the care and custody of her children that was at stake in the trial. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Mother then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. Neither Father nor the children\u2019s best-interest attorney opposed the petition, filed briefs or appeared at oral argument. <em>Sumpter I, </em>427 Md. 668, 672, 50 A.3d 1098, 1100 (2012). In an opinion filed August 21, 2012, we declined to reach the merits of Mother\u2019s appeal for two reasons. <em>Id. </em>First, the record did not contain the Policy or sufficient evidence to \u201celucidate the full contours of the policy or rule and how it is applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, Mother\u2019s appeal had been unopposed, and as a result, one-sided. <em>Id. </em>We remanded the case for supplementation of the record and invited the Office of the Attorney General to participate, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>light of the absence of Respondent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Sumpter I, </em>427 Md. at 672, 50 A.3d at 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Discretionary trial court matters are \u201cmuch better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts, and the decisions of such judges should only be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u201d <em>Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Samuel R. Rosoff, Ltd., </em>195 Md. 421, 436, 73 A.2d 461, 467 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Even when we find an abuse of discretion, this Court follows the maxim that \u201cappellate courts of this State will not reverse a lower court judgment for harmless error: the complaining party must show <em>prejudice </em>as well as <em>error.\u201d See Harris v. David S. Harris, P.A., </em>310 Md. 310, 319, 529 A.2d 356, 360 (1987) (italics in original). Prejudice means an \u201cerror that influenced the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Before considering the trial court\u2019s actions in this case, we must put those actions in context. When Mother\u2019s counsel reviewed the Report to prepare for trial, this review was circumscribed by the Policy, as enforced by the Clerk\u2019s office for the Family Division. When Mother\u2019s request for a copy of the Report at trial was denied, the trial court followed suit. Indeed, the entire trial was informed by a judicial fiat issued long before Father\u2019s divorce petition was filed. Thus, in some sense, we cannot review the actions at the trial court without also considering the Policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Undoubtedly, our court system vests trial judges with a great deal of discretion and responsibility. In <em>City of Bowie v. MIE Props., Inc., </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">As a general proposition, trial judges have the widest discretion in the conduct of trials, and the exercise of that discretion should not be disturbed on appeal in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of clear abuse. Thus, a trial judge maintains considerable latitude in controlling the conduct of a trial subject only to an abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">398 Md. 657, 684, 922 A.2d 509, 525 (2007) (quotations omitted). Recognizing the unique position of a trial judge, we have declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201c[w]e placet ] the responsibility on the trial judge to weigh and balance the rights, interests, and reasons of the parties ...\u201d and \u201cthe trial judge, on the scene, will have a perception and understanding of the legal environment in which the case is temporarily mired [,]\u201d and \u201c[tjherefore, [the trial judge] [i]s vested with the discretion to be exercised consistent with the spirit of the law while subserving the ends of justice and fairness to the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\"><em>St. Joseph Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Turnbull, </em>432 Md. 259, 275, 68 A.3d 823, 832-33 (2013) (quoting <em>Langrall, Muir &amp; Noppinger v. Gladding, </em>282 Md. 397, 400-01, 384 A.2d 737, 739 (1978)) (alterations in original). We further observed that \u201conce assigned to preside over a trial, it is generally within the province of a trial judge to make discretionary decisions that affect the rights and interests of the litigants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The Policy, through its enforcement by the clerk\u2019s office and misapplication by the trial court, frustrated Mother\u2019s full ability to examine the Report and challenge its content. A child custody investigation report\u2019s main content is a series of individual investigations of the parents and relatives, and interviews with both children. These reports typically contain substantial hearsay and hearsay-within-hearsay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These reports also include the investigators\u2019 subjective impressions on matters like the parties\u2019 homes, their relationship with the children, and the parties\u2019 relationship with each other. The Report\u2019s attachments include items like Mother\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>health records, the children\u2019s school records, and various court documents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Likely, this is fertile ground for content that is biased, subjective, and contestable.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Under the Policy, Mother\u2019s counsel had limited time to examine the Report and investigate its findings \u2014 a process that requires interviewing witnesses and evaluating documents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without a reference copy of the Report, Mother\u2019s counsel was not able to present the Report to an expert.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, without a copy of the Report, Mother may not have been able to retain an expert at all.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, Mother was unable to prepare a vigorous rebuttal of the Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>By disabling Mother from fully challenging the Report, the trial judge deprived the court of one of the core benefits of the adversarial system: the progression towards truth through the presentation of counter-evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And, by so gravely impairing Mother\u2019s interest in a fair trial, application of the Policy surpassed, in this instance, mere court administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">This Court has defined abuse of discretion in numerous ways, but has always enunciated a high threshold. <em>Wilsom-X v. Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, </em>403 Md. 667, 677, 944 A.2d 509, 515 (2008); <em>see also Wilson v. John Crane, Inc., </em>385 Md. 185, 199, 867 A.2d 1077, 1084 (2005) (\u201can abuse of discretion should only be found in the extraordinary, exceptional, or most egregious case.\u201d). In <em>North v. North, </em>then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, Judge Wilner, characterized the abuse of discretion landscape as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d is one of those very general, amorphous terms that appellate courts use and apply with great frequency but which they have defined in many different ways. It has been said to occur \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">102 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031-32 (1994) (alterations in original) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>In <em>Gunning v. State, </em>this Court considered a trial judge who applied a policy denying requested eyewitness identification instructions based on his personal opinion that such instructions were inappropriate. 347 Md. 332, 351, 701 A.2d 374, 383 (1997). This Court held that the trial court abused its discretion by applying a hard and fast rule to a decision that required the court to exercise its discretion. <em>Id. </em>We emphasized that the requested instructions \u201cshould have at least been given careful consideration in the instant cases, and arbitrarily rejecting them as always inappropriate was an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Gunning, </em>347 Md. at 353-54, 701 A.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">A judge presiding over a particular case may not blindly apply an administrative policy (or through misapprehension of what the policy required or allowed, misapply it) without considering the particular circumstances at hand. As we said in a recent case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">Despite being vested with this discretion, the hearing judge failed to appreciate or exercise her discretion, in favor of an \u201cunyielding adherence to [a] predetermined position,\u201d and an improper deference to her understanding of the Administrative Judge\u2019s views. In this case, the record is clear that the hearing judge commenced the hearing with no intention of entertaining seriously the parties\u2019 arguments (no matter what they were), but rather indicated that she had decided prior to the hearing to defer to the Administrative Judge\u2019s opinion.... When a circuit court is vested with discretion, such predispositions are inappropriate and constitute an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>101 Geneva LLC v. Wynn, </em>435 Md. 233, 77 A.3d 1064, 1070 (2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">That is what happened here. The trial court misapplied a policy issued by the Judge in Charge of the Family Division for the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Although we do not know the exact scope of this role, we assume that the Judge in Charge has authority to make certain administrative decisions. But the Policy does much more than impact the administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>of the courts. By any standard, the Policy surpasses mere court administration and affects the rights of individual litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Mother\u2019s access and ability to receive a copy of the Report is properly a matter of judicial discretion, as the Policy recognizes. <em>See Goodman v. Commercial Credit Corp., </em>364 Md. 483, 491, 773 A.2d 526, 531 (2001) (\u201cwhen there is no hard and fast rule governing the situation, in arriving at a decision, the trial judge must exercise his or her judicial discretion\u201d); <em>see also </em>48A C.J.S. Judges \u00a7 151 (\u201cJudicial discretion is the right or power to choose between the doing and not doing of a thing which cannot be demanded as an absolute right of the party asking that it be done.\u201d). The trial court abused its discretion by invoking what it incorrectly thought the Policy required, to govern its ruling. When the court denied Mother\u2019s motion based on this misapprehension, it applied a misconceived, hard and fast rule to a matter that required the exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We now address the question of prejudice. As indicated, prejudice occurs when an error affects the outcome of a case. <em>See Harris, </em>310 Md. at 319, 529 A.2d at 360. The harmless error test does not have precise standards, but is instead based on the facts of each case. <em>See Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716, 720 (2007); <em>see also State Deposit Ins. Fund Corp. v. Billman, </em>321 Md. 3, 17, 580 A.2d 1044, 1051 (1990) (\u201cIn determining whether [the error] ... prejudicially affected the outcome of a civil case, the appellate court balances \u2018the probability of prejudice from the face of the extraneous matter in relation to the circumstances of the particular ease[.]\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). To determine whether prejudice occurred, courts look \u201cto the degree to which the conduct of the trial has violated basic concepts of fair play.\u201d <em>Barksdale v. Wilkowsky, </em>419 Md. 649, 658, 20 A.3d 765, 770 (2011) (citations omitted). Generally, the complaining party must show that prejudice was probable, not just possible. <em>Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 662, 20 A.3d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The test for what constitutes prejudice varies based on the \u201ccontext of the case \u2014 civil or criminal \u2014 and by the type of error alleged.\u201d <em>Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 658, 20 A.3d at 770. For particularly acute errors, this Court will employ a presumption of prejudice. <em>Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 659, 20 A.3d at 771 (\u201cIn civil cases, Maryland courts have varied the tests based on the relative gravity of the error. For the more egregious civil errors, Maryland employs a presumption of prejudice.\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In cases involving egregious civil errors, the presumption of prejudice enables this Court to meet \u201cthe need to provide for hearty review of trial errors.\u201d <em>See Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 660, 20 A.3d at 771 (citing <em>Harris, </em>310 Md. 310, 319-20, 529 A.2d 356, 360-361 (1987)). In <em>Harris, </em>the lower court erroneously disqualified one of the party\u2019s attorneys. <em>Harris, </em>310 Md. at 319, 529 A.2d at 361. We \u201crelied on a presumption of prejudice due to the practical impossibility of proving prejudice.\u201d <em>See Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 660, 20 A.3d at 771 (citing <em>Harris, </em>310 Md. at 320, 529 A.2d at 361). Had this Court not presumed prejudice, the disqualification would not be \u201csubject to effective postjudgment review.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>310 Md. at 320, 529 A.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Like the court in <em>Harris, </em>we are faced with the practical impossibility of determining whether Mother was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s error. Here, the trial court\u2019s error so hamstrung the defense that every aspect of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>was affected.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This error so infected the trial proceedings<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that it can only be characterized as egregious. Indeed, we cannot know how that infection might have contaminated the outcome of the case. Because determining prejudice is practically impossible, we will presume it in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The State argues that Mother disclaimed prejudice by declining to move for a continuance. We are unpersuaded. Given the court\u2019s misapprehension of the Policy, a continuance would not have resulted in Mother receiving a copy of the Report. Without a copy of the Report, Mother\u2019s counsel would be limited to investigating its contents from the information captured in their personal notes. This would pose a practical hindrance to the investigation of the Report\u2019s findings. Moreover, Mother would still have difficulty retaining an expert. In this case, a continuance would not have been a cure-all. That is why Mother\u2019s counsel declined to move for a continuance, stating, \u201cI do not need a continuance, Your Honor. I need an actual copy of the report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Even if Mother had sought a continuance upon first discovering the belated filing of the Report, obstacles remained. First, a continuance is not easily obtained. Under the \u201cPostponement Policy for the Circuit Court for Baltimore City,\u201d a request for modification of a pretrial conference date or trial date \u201cshall be made through a written motion for modification filed within 15 days of the initial order setting a date for pretrial conference and/or trial.\u201d Thereafter, motions for continuance are subject to the following policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Thereafter, except for exigent circumstances, the schedule may be modified only upon filing with the clerk a <em>written </em>Motion for Modification setting forth a showing of good cause for why the schedule cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">Modification requests in cases on the domestic docket made for <em>exigent circumstances </em>* will be heard daily at 4:00 p.m. in Room 108, Courthouse East, on a walk in basis. Any party seeking a postponement must arrive in Room 108 no later than 3:45 P.M. and must ensure that all other parties and/or attorneys involved in the case are present for the postponement proceeding. The Court WILL NOT entertain a postponement request unless ALL involv\u00e9d parties are present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">* <em>\u201cExigent circumstances </em>\u201d means an unforeseen development occurring <em>within 30 days </em>of the scheduled date which prevents compliance with the schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Circuit Court for Baltimore City, <em>Family Docket-Postponement Policy, </em>available at http: //www.baltocts.state.md.us/ family/postponement.htm, (last accessed October 4, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">As we read this policy, in any case where counsel need a continuance based on the Report, counsel will need to coordinate the schedules of all parties to schedule a hearing. Otherwise, such a postponement must, presumably, wait until the merits hearing. This coordination may be difficult, particularly in cases where the parties are confrontational, or there is a short time frame between the Report\u2019s issuance and the merits hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Moreover, the State\u2019s argument demonstrates some misapprehension of the delicate nature of custody proceedings. When custody is disputed, children face instability. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD in Circuit Court for Baltimore City, </em>116 Md.App. 443, 460-61, 696 A.2d 1102, 1110 (1997) (\u201cWe are mindful of the concerns of many children\u2019s advocates who are understandably critical of inordinate delays in resolution of these painful cases. Surely, these cases warrant swift and careful attention, because when a child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>status remains in \u2018limbo,\u2019 the child often suffers.\u201d) (footnote omitted). When custody is disputed, children face instability and risk, becoming objects in a custodial tug-of-war. <em>See Brown v. Brown, </em>463 N.E.2d 310, 313 (Ind.Ct.App.1984) (\u201cA prompt hearing is especially essential in a custody case where the parties are dueling for a child\u2019s affections and the longer a delay, the more chance one party has to influence the child.\u201d). In recognition of the maladies of delay in child access cases, Maryland issued Rule 8-207(a), providing expedited appeal for adoption, guardianship, child access, and child in need of assistance cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To accept a postponement may delay a trial for months. Such a delay is not desirable, and a litigant\u2019s reluctance to pursue this result is understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Mother has strenuously argued that the trial court\u2019s erroneous application of the Policy violated her due process rights. Mother\u2019s interest in the care and custody of her children \u201cis perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [law].\u201d <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). In other circumstances, we might inquire as to whether the Policy as stated affords parents constitutionally adequate procedural protections, given the interest at stake. <em>See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (setting forth a three-factor balancing test to determine the constitutional adequacy of procedural protections in cases infringing on individuals\u2019 fundamental liberty interest to parent). But this Court has long embraced the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. <em>See, e.g., State v. Raithel, </em>285 Md. 478, 484, 404 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>264, 267 (1979) (\u201c[Njothing is better settled than the principle that courts should not decide constitutional issues unnecessarily.\u201d). In practice, this doctrine means that when a non-constitutional ground for deciding a case presents itself, we decide the case on that ground rather than the constitutional grounds. <em>See Allgood v. State, </em>309 Md. 58, 82, 522 A.2d 917, 929 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Here, a non-constitutional ground presents itself, as the trial court erroneously applied its mistaken understanding of a rigid policy to a matter that required the sound exercise of its discretion. For this reason, we will not opine on the constitutional aspect of Mother\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In conclusion, the trial court abused its discretion by applying the Policy to procedural matters that required the court to exercise its discretion. Because of the egregious error of not allowing Mother\u2019s counsel a copy of the Report and the practical impossibility of evaluating prejudice, we presume that the trial court\u2019s error prejudiced Mother. For these reasons, we reverse. As we do not wish to leave the matter of custody in a vacuum (and to avoid the temptation for either party to engage in self-help) until this issue can be brought before the Circuit Court on remand, we modify the custody order granting custody to Father, with visitation to Mother, to an interim <em>pendente lite </em>order, subject to further order of the Circuit Court on remand and after a new hearing on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>matter. <em>See Koffley v.

The Policy was promulgated in writing before the trial judge here was appointed to the Circuit Court.

The Policy itself does not explicitly prohibit making verbatim notes of the Report. The Policy states that counsel may take notes from the Report, but may not copy it.

Although we refrain from commenting on the constitutionality of any matter until we are compelled to do so, we nevertheless recognize that the Policy raises the potential for constitutional concern. We can envision a policy that better balances the concern for safeguarding the confidentiality of information held by courts, and the interest in fundamentally fair trial procedure held by litigants. For instance, courts could use protective orders and their contempt powers to control parties, counsel, and experts by issuing appropriate sanctions. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 15-201 <em>et seq. </em>Alternatively, courts could require that parties, counsel, and experts sign a confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure covenant as a condition of receiving the Report. <em>See Sumpter I, </em>427 Md. 668, 684-86, 50 A.3d 1098, 1108-1109 (recounting the practices of some other counties in Maryland). Great care should be taken in striking the appropriate balance. Thus, we refer this issue to the Rules Committee for its consideration and recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AY-\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AV2\">which WATTS, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">I agree with much, though not all, of the Majority opinion. In particular, I share the Majority\u2019s concerns regarding the written policy of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City on access to court-ordered custody investigation reports. It is possible that application of that policy could, in some instances, result in prejudice to a party. But I would not apply a \u201cpresumption of prejudice\u201d in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Mother\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> counsel should be commended for shining a light on this important issue. As the Court of Special Appeals indicated 30 years ago,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a litigant in a custody case has a right to have access to the circuit court\u2019s custody investigation report. But there is apparently some confusion in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City concerning its policy on access to such reports, and there appear to be disparate practices in other jurisdictions. As Mother\u2019s counsel eloquently argued before us, this confusion may at times especially disadvantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>self-represented litigants. These efforts of counsel, who represent Mother <em>pro bono, </em>exemplify the best of the legal profession and hopefully will improve the quality of justice in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">What to do about it in this case is another question. Our appreciation for counsel\u2019s service to the legal system does not mean that the decision of the Circuit Court concerning custody and visitation is unjust. The record before the Circuit Court provided an ample basis for the Circuit Court\u2019s decision concerning custody and visitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The relevant facts are summarized in the unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals and in this Court\u2019s prior decision. <em>See Sumpter v. Sumpter, </em>427 Md. 668, 673-75, 50 A.3d 1098 (2012). These facts included, among other things, sexual abuse of the children while in Mother\u2019s custody, her enlistment (while she had custody of the children) of a convicted murderer to locate and assault a former boyfriend, and her contemporaneous convictions for assault and theft. After moving out of state and sending the children back to Maryland to live with her husband, Mother attempted to regain physical custody through deception and abduction. Unsurprisingly, the Circuit Court concluded that she had demonstrated \u201cextremely poor judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It is not at all clear that Mother suffered any prejudice from the Circuit Court\u2019s apparent misunderstanding of the access policy. Both of Mother\u2019s counsel were given advance access to the custody investigation report, which did not make a custody recommendation, for an hour and a half. Most of the material in the report consisted of records already available to Mother. Counsel were able to use the report at the hearing to cross-examine the author of the report. In the Circuit Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Mother\u2019s counsel described the report as \u201centirely cumulative\u201d of the testimony of the report\u2019s author. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, Mother\u2019s counsel has not argued that any of the attachments to the report contain anything that is \u201cuntrue, or misleading, or that ... needed to be rebutted or supplemented.\u201d In the recent argument before us, Mother\u2019s counsel focused more on the disadvantage a self-represented litigant might experience under the Circuit Court\u2019s policy, rather than argue any specific prejudice to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As the Majority opinion notes, before this Court reverses a decision, a complaining party must normally show prejudice\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>an \u201cerror that influenced the outcome of the case.\u201d Majority op. at 82-88, 86-87, 80 A.3d at 1050, 1052-53. And the effect on the outcome must be \u201cprobable, not just possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87-88, 80 A.3d at 1053. The Majority opinion overcomes this standard by employing a \u201cpresumption of prejudice.\u201d Majority op. at 88-89, 80 A.3d at 1053-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">As I understand it, the Majority would not apply a presumption of prejudice to every case governed by the Circuit Court\u2019s policy, but only to cases in which the particular judge misunderstood the option under the policy to provide a copy to counsel by court order. The \u201cpresumption of prejudice\u201d that the Majority derives from the <em>Harris </em>case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is a burden-shifting presumption, not a conclusive presumption. Application of this presumption should not result in the automatic reversal of a custody and visitation decision. Thus, application of such a presumption does not require a different result or, in my view, eliminate the possibility that any error was harmless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Mother requested that we reverse the Court of Special Appeals with direction to vacate the custody and visitation provisions of the Circuit Court\u2019s Judgment of Absolute Divorce. The Majority opinion reverses the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remands for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, but maintains the current custody and visitation order pending further proceedings in the Circuit Court. Since the presumption underlying the reversal is not conclusive, it would seem that the Circuit Court has discretion to decide what, if any, further action to take in this case based on the entire record before it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the Majority opinion should not be taken as a direction as to the award of custody in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Finally, I agree with the Majority that this issue should be referred to the Rules Committee to consider the views of various interested parties and to craft a rule that provides a uniform system \u2014 or at least minimum standards \u2014 for making custody investigation reports available to litigants in these cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Majority op. at 91-93 &amp; n. 19, 80 A.3d at 1055-56 &amp; n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Judge WATTS joins this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">.

It received little attention in the recent briefing before us, perhaps because no attorney appeared on behalf of Father to defend that decision.

It appears that, under the Majority\u2019s view, <em>Denningham </em>itself was wrongly decided. In that case, the intermediate appellate court held that, although the father had been denied <em>any </em>access to the report, its content was \"basically cumulative\u201d of other information available to the father and the failure to provide access was harmless error that did not affect the circuit court\u2019s decision to award custody to the mother. <em>Denningham, 49 </em>Md.App. at 338, 431 A.2d 755.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. If the custody decision is reopened, it seems likely that a new report would be necessary as it is now more than three years since the report in question was created.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">. It is certainly difficult for us to fashion such guidelines in the narrow confines of a particular case. For example, while it is important, as Mother\u2019s counsel has argued, that self-represented litigants have access in some fashion to a custody investigation report, it may be necessary to establish some limitations or safeguards on such access. Emotions run high in these cases, which sometimes necessitates protective orders; the disciplinary tools available to the court to control misuse of information may be less effective in controlling the conduct of a lay person than of an attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
