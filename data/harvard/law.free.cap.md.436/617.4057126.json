In that petition, it alleged that the respondent violated Rules 1.15, Safekeeping Property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.1, Bar Admissions and Disciplinary Matters,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>8.4, Misconduct,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812; Maryland Rules 16-606.1, Attorney trust account record-keeping; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 16-609, Prohibited transactions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Code (1989, 2010 Repl, Vol.) \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cBP\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We ordered, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), that the matter be transmitted \u201cto the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, to be heard and determined by Judge Mickey J. Norman, of the Third Judicial Circuit, in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Although personally served with the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Interrogatories and Request for Admissions of fact and Genuineness of Documents, the respondent made no timely response, neither filing an answer to the petition nor otherwise responding to any of the petitioner\u2019s pleadings. Nevertheless, when the matter came on for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>hearing on the merits, he was permitted to participate: the respondent was allowed to, and did, cross-examine witnesses and he was offered the opportunity to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. He chose not to testify in his defense and he failed to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law for the court\u2019s consideration, however. Following the hearing, the hearing judge made findings of fact, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The respondent, who was admitted to the Maryland Bar on January 3, 2002 and, at all times relevant to this case, maintained an office for the practice of law in Baltimore County, in February 2004, joined with Richard K. Scott, who described the respondent as his best friend, to establish a law partnership, Scott &amp; Kahl, L.L.C. Under their agreement, they were the only attorneys in the firm, \u201c100% of the legal fees generated by them would be shared 50/50 ... everything was 50/50, bills and profits.\u201d The parties received \u201cdraws\u201d or salary twice a month, on the 15th and the 30th, to be taken from the firm\u2019s operating account, one of its two bank accounts, the other being an IOLTA, or trust, account. As explained, without contradiction, by Scott, who was familiar with the procedure for depositing and withdrawing funds from these accounts and whom the hearing judge determined \u201cdiligently maintained both bank accounts,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201c... fees owed to the Firm for professional services were not paid directly from the trust account. Rather, monies in the trust account that the parties earned were then transferred into the operating account. Any fee disbursements owed to the partners were distributed from the operating account.... [A] Firm\u2019s computer kept the account records on spreadsheets, accessible by either partner----In addition to the bi-weekly salary of $ 1,500, if either partner needed additional funds, \u2018the other would take the exact same amount.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In December, 2009, Scott discovered several wire transactions, made in November and December, transferring funds from the firm\u2019s trust account to the respondent\u2019s personal account. Not having been advised of those transactions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>being unable to find evidence that the respondent was owed fees other than his draw, Scott confronted the respondent, who \u201c \u2018told Scott that he had purchased stock options and needed the money right away to pay margin calls.\u2019 \u201d Accepting the respondent\u2019s expression of remorse, Scott did not further pursue the matter, giving the respondent a second chance. He did institute additional safeguards against misappropriation: he placed the firm\u2019s checkbook in the office safe, took the respondent\u2019s key to the safe, and reviewed the bank accounts more frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Nevertheless, on May 19 and 28, 2010, the respondent transferred $1300 and $2000, respectively, from the firm\u2019s trust account to his personal checking account. As before, Scott was not informed of either transfer, before, or after, it was made. A deposit was also made, by the respondent, \u201c[u]sing a handwritten checking/saving deposit slip,\u201d into the firm\u2019s trust account. The source of that $1300 deposit is not known and the respondent did not advise Scott of the deposit, either before or after it was made. After confronting the respondent, who neither denied taking the monies nor offered any explanation, Scott terminated the partnership and, thereafter, filed a complaint with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">During the investigation of the Scott complaint, the respondent admitted making both withdrawals from the firm\u2019s trust account. With respect to the $1300 withdrawal, he claimed it was a mistake, that he intended to withdraw it from the operating account, and that when he realized the mistake, he redeposited the funds into the trust account. The $2000, he explained, were donations to help defray the funeral expenses of his late brother in law, which were deposited in the trust account on the advice of \u201c \u2018a husband and wife team [attorneys],\u2019 \u201d that was handling his brother in law\u2019s estate. According to the respondent, he gave the $2000 to Scott, in a white envelope, for deposit in the trust account. Scott denied ever receiving such an envelope from the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The petitioner requested the respondent\u2019s financial records, that is, his personal account at Bank of America. Although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>was reminded to provide the requested records, he never did so. The records were subpoenaed, prompting the respondent to advise the petitioner, contrary to an earlier representation, that the records had already been sent, that \u201che had just requested copies of the records from the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The respondent, on occasion, accepted representation and fees, but did not report either in accordance with firm policy, thus mishandling funds entrusted to the firm or fees owed to the firm. One such example was that involving Keith Hoyle, whom the respondent agreed to represent in a speeding case. Although the respondent was paid $200 for the representation, \u201cthere was no record of the Respondent receiving or recording the fee in the Firm\u2019s books.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Another example involved fees owed the firm by the Public Defender for representation in conflict cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cScott discovered that, on October 20, 2009, a deposit of $ 1, 292.00 was made to the Firm\u2019s trust account. That same day, $ 1, 292.00 was transferred from the trust account to the Respondent\u2019s personal account at Bank of America. The Firm did not have a record of the receipt or disbursement of these funds. Scott researched the matter and determined that a check in the amount of $ 1, 292.00 was received from the State of Maryland, payable to the Firm. Scott\u2019s investigation of those funds revealed that the check was for services provided to the Office of the Public Defender by the Firm. Based on his years of practice with the Respondent, Scott is familiar with Respondent\u2019s handwriting. He observed that the Respondent endorsed the deposited check, and the Respondent wrote the deposit slip for the transaction.... The check for $ 1, 292.00 was fee income, and should not have been deposited into the trust account. Even if the Respondent had mistakenly deposited those funds into the trust account, he failed to follow established Firm procedure and policy to transfer those funds to the operating account before dispersing those funds as fee income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Two other examples are the $1000 paid to the respondent by a Mr. German, for which there was no \u201cpaper transaction,\u201d indicating a deposit and the $600 Mr. Pedro Corona paid to the respondent for representation. When the claims of the other people, who contacted Scott, informing him that they paid the respondent for legal services, is taken into account, Scott\u2019s \u201cuncontradicted testimony is that the Respondent may have misappropriated between $40,000-$50,000 in fees owed to the Firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Finally, the respondent, without Scott\u2019s knowledge or consent, intercepted a credit/debit card issued on the firm\u2019s operating account, and used it to withdraw $200 from an ATM in Maryland, on July 19, 2009. Citing an unspecified emergency in New Jersey, the respondent admitted to the withdrawal. His explanation for the withdrawal in Maryland-that it was to repay a loan from his aunts and uncles-was determined by the court to lack credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">From the foregoing, Judge Norman drew conclusions of law, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that during the period 2009 through 2010, the Respondent converted, for his personal use, fees owed to the Firm. On occasion, during the period 2009 through May 2010, the Respondent transferred funds from the Firm\u2019s attorney trust account to his personal bank account. During the period 2009 through June 2010, the Respondent used trust funds maintained in the Firm\u2019s attorney trust account for unauthorized purposes.... The Respondent did not inform Scott of the subject-matter transfers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201cThe Respondent failed to maintain and complete records of the transfers he made from the Firm\u2019s attorney trust account to his personal bank account....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cDuring the period 2009 through June 3, 2010, Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, and/or misrepresentation in his dealings with Scott....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent knowingly made a false statement of material fact to Bar Counsel, when he testified on December 6, 2010, that he gave $2, 000 in cash to Scott to be deposited to the Firm\u2019s trust account. The Respondent represented that he discussed the funds, i.e. the purported donations to defray the cost of his brother-in-law\u2019s funeral, with two lawyers who advised him to put the funds in the Firm\u2019s trust account.... Scott testified that the Firm\u2019s records did not show the transaction. This Court finds Scott\u2019s testimony, that he neither had knowledge of these funds, nor had he received $2, 000 in cash from the Respondent, to be credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s representation that two attorneys instructed him to deposit the $2,000 in the trust account was not corroborated. Both lawyers denied speaking with the Respondent about such funds, and indicated that they would not have advised him to put the funds in the Firm\u2019s operating account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cThe source of the $2,000 was certainly material to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of the transfers of the trust funds to the Respondent\u2019s personal account. Clear and convincing evidence exists that the Respondent\u2019s statement concerning the $2,000 was a material misrepresentation and that he thereby violated MRPC 8.1(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s explanation for the $1,300 transfer on May 19, 2010, was also shown to be a material misrepresentation. In his December 6, 2010 statement, the Respondent said that on May 19, 2010, he wanted to take a $1,300 advance on his regular draw from the operating account, but mistakenly wrote the trust account number on the withdrawal slip. According to the Respondent, the funds were needed to pay taxes owed on his mother\u2019s property, and that he gave the funds to his brother to pay the taxes. The Respondent testified that the mistake was discovered when Scott questioned him about the transaction, and that he returned the funds to the trust account that same day, May 25, 2010____ However, the Respondent could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>learned from Scott about, and corrected, the error on May 25th, because Scott did [not] know of the $1,300 transaction until after the May 28th transfer of the $2,000. After May 28th, he confronted the Respondent about the $1,300 transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cThe bank records for the Respondent\u2019s personal account demonstrated that the $1,300 transferred to the personal account on May 19, 2010, was disbursed for what appears to be the Respondent\u2019s living expenses, (i.e. car payments and debit card purchases from grocery stores). None of the disbursements between May 19th and May 25th were in the amount of $1,300, and none were to the Respondent\u2019s mother or brother.... Additionally, Ramsey [the petitioner\u2019s investigator] interviewed the Respondent\u2019s brother, who did not corroborate the Respondent\u2019s representations that the funds were used to pay their mother\u2019s property taxes. This Court find by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent made material misrepresentations to Bar Counsel concerning the $1,300 transaction, in violation of MRPC 8.1(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cThis Court finds the Respondent also violated [MRPC] 8.1(b) when he knowingly failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s demands for bank records for his personal account. It was not disputed that on or about December 6.2010, Assistant Bar Counsel requested the Respondent to provide financial records. On or about February 25, 2011, Ramsey reminded the Respondent that Assistant Bar Counsel requested his financial records. On or about March 31, 2011, the Respondent was again reminded that Assistant Bar Counsel requested that he provide financial records. The Respondent failed to provide the financial records requested by Bar Counsel. The Respondent\u2019s failure to produce the requested records constituted a violation of MRPC 8.1(b). This Rule is interpreted to require an attorney to respond to letters or telephone calls from a disciplinary authority without the use of a subpoena. <em>Attorney Grievance Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>sion v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 248-249, 760 A.2d 1108, 1115-1116 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated BOP \u00a7 10-306 when he intentionally used trust funds for unauthorized purposes. Scott testified that the Firm\u2019s trust account was used to hold prepaid fees, and when fees were earned they were deposited to the Firm\u2019s operating account. The Respondent and Scott then received draws from the operating account on the 15th and 30th of the month. Scott testified that funds were not disbursed from the trust account directly to either him and/or Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that on two occasions in November 2009, on one occasion in December 2009, and twice in May 2010, the Respondent transferred funds from the trust account directly to his personal account____ Scott testified that the Respondent was not owed funds from the trust account at the time of the transfers. The Respondent admitted that the funds disbursed to his personal account in November and December 2009 were not owed to the Firm.... The fact that the Respondent paid back the $1,300 disbursement made on May 19, 2010, and Scott replaced the other funds in the trust account when he became aware of the transaction, provides further evidence that neither Respondent, nor the Firm, were entitled or authorized to [] take funds in the trust account at the time of the disbursements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\u201cIn addition, the Respondent offered no evidence that the disbursements were authorized by the clients or earned by the Firm.... The Respondent\u2019s explanation to Scott for the November and December transactions was that he needed the funds to pay debts owed for the purchase of stock options. The uncontroverted testimony is that the Respondent apologized to Scott for transferring the money. The Respondent clearly understood his actions constituted wrongful conduct. The Respondent offered Scott no explanation for the May 2010 disbursements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cThis Court does not find the Respondent\u2019s explanations to Bar Counsel for the 2010 transfers credible. The Respondent represented that the $1,300 transfer was mistakenly disbursed from the trust account instead of the Firm\u2019s operating account.... Scott\u2019s testimony, the bank records, or the Respondent\u2019s brother\u2019s interview does not support the Respondent\u2019s explanation. The Respondent\u2019s explanation for the $2,000 transfer was that he believed those funds represented $2,000 cash collected for his late brother-in-law\u2019s funeral, which he gave to Scott to deposit to the trust account.... The Respondent\u2019s representation that he discussed the $2,000 with two other lawyers was not confirmed. Scott denied any knowledge of the $2,000 in cash, and the Respondent offered no evidence to the contrary. This Court finds as a fact that Respondent lied when he told Ramsey that he gave $2,000 to Scott in a white envelope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer in other respects. A violation of MRPC 8.4(b) does not require that the lawyer be prosecuted for, or convicted of, the criminal offense. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 810 A.2d 996 (2002). As indicated above, the Respondent willfully misappropriated trust funds for his own use, in violation of BOP \u00a7 10-306. The intentional unauthorized use of trust funds is a criminal misdemeanor pursuant to BOP \u00a7 10-606(b)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201cIn addition, the Respondent misappropriated the Firm\u2019s funds. The October 20, 2009 transaction involving the $1,292.50 check made payable to \u2018Scott &amp; Kahl, L.L.C.\u2019, and the other incidents described by Scott, provide clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent intentionally misappropriated fees intended for the Firm.... The Respondent also used the Firm\u2019s credit/debit card for an unauthorized purpose.... These transactions provide further clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent engaged in criminal conduct involving theft; and that this conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>adversely reflected on his honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s use of trust funds for unauthorized purposes; his theft of client and Firm funds; and his failure to disclose these transactions to his partner are dishonest and deceitful. This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation by intentionally making misrepresentations to Bar Counsel in order to hide his misappropriations of funds in violation of MRPC 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of [MRPC] 8.4(d). Conduct that reflects negatively on the legal profession and sets a bad example for the public at large is prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 22, 922 A.2d 554, 566 (2007). Criminal conduct involving misappropriation of trust funds, and conduct involving dishonesty and deceit reflects negatively on the legal profession. The Respondent has, therefore, violated MRPC 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cThe foregoing findings of violations of the MRPC provide clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cSubject to the informed consent of the client, prepaid fees must be deposited to, and held in a trust account until earned. MRPC 1.15(c). This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent failed to hold client-funds deposited in his Firm\u2019s attorney trust account, separate from his own property. When the Respondent made the transfers in November and December 2009, and again in May 2010, he violated MRPC 1.15(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201cThe Respondent also violated MRPC 1.15(a) when he deposited the check from the Office of the Public Defender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>to the Firm\u2019s trust account, thereby commingling the Firm\u2019s earned fees with trust funds....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s admissions and Scott\u2019s testimony that the Firm\u2019s records did not include the disbursements made by the Respondent from the trust account on November 2, 20, 2009; December 7, 2009; and May 19, 25, and 28, 2010, provide clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent did not properly record the transaction or see that the transactions were recorded by Scott. Therefore this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated MRPC 16-606.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201cThe same evidence, which supported the finding that Respondent violated BOP \u00a7 10-306, provides clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent used trust funds for unauthorized purpose in violation of Md. Rule 16-609.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Neither the petitioner nor the respondent filed exceptions to Judge Norman\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Accordingly, we shall \u201ctreat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(2)(A). On the other hand, as Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(1) mandates that we do, we \u201cshall review de novo the Circuit Court judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d That non-deferential review convinces us that the conclusions of law drawn by Judge Norman are supported by the facts found and, so, we shall accept, and adopt, them as established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">This leaves for determination only the appropriate sanction. On January 18, 2013, the date set for oral argument, we issued a Per Curiam Order immediately disbarring the respondent \u201cfor reasons to be stated in an opinion later to be filed.\u201d We now state those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In its Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation for Sanctions, the petitioner offered the following rationale for its recommendation that the respondent be disbarred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>\u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct constituted a betrayal of the trust placed in him by his law partner and clients. Respondent engaged in further dishonest and deceitful conduct in his representations to Bar Counsel in order to cover up his misconduct. Judge Norman found no mitigating factors. Absent compelling extenuating circumstances, intentional misappropriation of another\u2019s funds is deceitful and dishonest conduct which justifies disbarment. <em>See e.g. Attorney Grievance Commission v. Carithers, </em>421 Md. 28, <em>58-59, 25 </em>A.3d 181, 199 (2011), citing <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Vlahos, </em>369 Md. 183, 186, 798 A.2d <em>555, 556 </em>(2002) (holding that disbarment was proper, where the attorney misappropriated payments from clients of his firm for his own use and took steps to conceal his conduct from his firm) and <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 572, 810 A.2d 487, 494 (2002) (holding that disbarment was the appropriate sanction where an attorney misappropriated funds from his real estate partners).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Although not making a sanction recommendation, Judge Norman cited the holdings of <em>Carithers </em>and <em>Vlahos </em>in support of his conclusion that the respondent\u2019s conduct \u201cadversely reflected on [the respondent\u2019s] honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d We agree with this rationale, and emphasize that it is one that is well settled in attorney discipline cases. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
