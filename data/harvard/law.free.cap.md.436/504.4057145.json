Safety (2003, 2011 Repl. Vol., 2013 Supp.) (\u201cPS\u201d) \u00a7 5-144.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reno pled not guilty pursuant to an agreed statement of facts, which stated that Reno had given a handgun to Cortney Stevens (\u201cStevens\u201d), who could not legally possess a regulated firearm. Reno was found guilty, received probation before judgment, and reported herself to the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">On March 19, 2013, in this Court, the Commission, through Bar Counsel, filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Reno, charging her with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 8.4 (Mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>conduct). On March 22, 2013, we referred the attorney discipline proceeding to the Honorable Jane Cairns Murray (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Cecil County. On September 4, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On October 25, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact, and conclusions of law indicating that Reno did not violate MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), 8.4(d) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), or 8.4(a) (Violating MLRPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">On November 8, 2013, in this Court, the Commission filed a \u201cNotice of Dismissal,\u201d requesting that this Court dismiss the attorney discipline proceeding. On December 10, 2013, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we: decline to dismiss the attorney discipline proceeding; conclude that Reno violated MLRPC 8.4(d) and 8.4(a); and give the parties an opportunity to recommend sanctions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In her opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">On December 19,1991, this Court admitted Reno to the Bar of Maryland. In 2002, Reno began practicing criminal law at the Law Offices of Jim Baldwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">On or about February 18, 2004, Cortney Stevens was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance other than marijuana. In 2005, Reno met Stevens and later served as his lawyer. In 2008, while represented by someone other than Reno, Stevens was convicted of making a false prescrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion. Sometime before 2010, Stevens informed Reno \u201cthat he had a prior drug charge for which he received probation before judgment.\u201d \u201cStevens also informed [Reno] of a prescription forgery charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">On or about September 14, 2010, Stevens visited Chesapeake Guns, a firearms store in Stevensville. At Chesapeake Guns, Stevens completed an application to buy a .45 caliber 1911 handgun. In a letter dated September 22, 2010, the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police informed Stevens that his application had been disapproved. The letter did not include the reasons for Stevens\u2019s application\u2019s disapproval. Reno learned of the letter and testified that she thought that the reason for Stevens\u2019s application\u2019s disapproval was \u201ca minor issue such as a failure [by] Stevens to have paid a fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">On November 6, 2010, Reno visited On Target, a firearms store in Severn. At On Target, Reno obtained a .45 caliber 1911 handgun (\u201cthe handgun\u201d). Reno immediately transported the handgun to Stevens\u2019s place of employment, where she gave the handgun to Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">On November 16, 2010, at her home, Reno was visited by Corporal Marcus Jackson and Senior Trooper First Class Ryan List (\u201cthe troopers\u201d) of the Gun Enforcement Unit of the Maryland State Police. The troopers told Reno that they were conducting a handgun investigation. Reno \u201cescorted the troopers to [ ] Stevens\u2019[s home] and retrieved the\u201d handgun, which the troopers confiscated.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Sometime between November 4, 2011, and November 16, 2011, Reno learned that the State had charged her with violating the statute that is currently codified at PS \u00a7 5-144. On February 28, 2012, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Reno pled not guilty and joined the agreed statement of facts. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted Reno probation before judgment. Sometime before October 21, 2013, the records of Reno\u2019s criminal case were expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Testimony and Findings as to Reno\u2019s Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">At the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding, as a witness for the Commission, Reno testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">[A]t the time that I asked [ ] Stevens to hold the gun for me, I was not aware that he was a prohibited person[, <em>i.e., </em>a person who cannot legally possess a regulated firearm]. I took that plea anyway because I felt like I should have known better. The statute that I pled not guilty to and agreed statement of facts said that I knowingly participated in the receipt of a regulated firearm by a prohibited person. The truth is I did not know he was a prohibited person, but I felt that it was appropriate to accept responsibility because I should have known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In her opinion, the hearing judge stated: \u201cThe evidence ... merely shows a set of circumstances that [Reno] should have known [that] Stevens was a prohibited person, but it was not established by clear and convincing evidence that [Reno] in fact knew [that Stevens] was a prohibited person.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16 \u2014 759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>435 Md. 84, 104, 76 A.3d 1198, 1210 (2013) (\u201c[A] hearing court\u2019s findings of fact will not be overruled unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citation omitted)); Md. R. 16-759(b)(1) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the circuit court judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Neither party excepts to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. We, therefore, \u201ctreat the findings of fact as established[.]\u201d Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Neither party excepts to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. \u201cOrdinarily, we will not look for additional violations where [the Commission] file[s] no exceptions.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dore, </em>433 Md. 685, 707, 73 A.3d 161, 174 (2013). Nonetheless, here, clear and convincing evidence persuades us to reverse the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Reno did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d), which states: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d \u201cIn general, an attorney violates M[L]RPC 8.4(d) when his or her conduct impacts negatively the public\u2019s perception or efficacy of the courts or legal profession.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rand, </em>411 Md. 83, 96, 981 A.2d 1234, 1242 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Reno negatively impacted the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession through committing an illegal act. As the hearing judge found, it is undisputed that Reno gave the handgun (ie., a regulated firearm)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Stevens, who had been convicted of disqualifying crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not address the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Reno did not know that Stevens had been convicted of a disqualifying crime; thus, we do not conclude that Reno violated PS \u00a7 5-144(a)(l), which states: \u201c[A] ... person may not[ ] knowingly participate in the illegal . .. transfer ... of a regulated firearm in violation of this subtitle[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>That finding of fact \u2014 that Reno did not knowingly participate in transferring the handgun \u2014 does not preclude us from determining that Reno violated PS \u00a7 5 \u2014 134(b)(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a regulatory provision, which states that: \u201cA ... person may not ... transfer a regulated firearm to a ... transferee who the ... person knows or has reasonable cause to believe ... has been convicted of a disqualifying crime[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Although the hearing judge did not address whether Reno had reasonable cause to believe that Stevens had been convicted of a disqualifying crime, we need not remand for the hearing judge to make additional findings of fact. As a conclusion of law \u2014 applying the facts found by the hearing judge to PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2)\u2019s legal standard of \u201creasonable cause\u201d \u2014 we conclude that clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that Reno violated PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2). For two reasons, the record clearly and convincingly establishes that Reno had reasonable cause to believe that Stevens had been convicted of a disqualifying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">First, in Reno\u2019s criminal case, based on the agreed statement of facts that Reno joined, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Reno had violated PS \u00a7 5-144(a)(l) by knowingly participating in the illegal transfer of a regulated firearm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County found that Reno violated PS \u00a7 5-144(a)(l) by knowingly participating in the illegal transfer of a regulated firearm, then Reno necessarily had reasonable cause to believe that Stevens had been convicted of a disquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>fying crime and violated PS \u00a7 5 \u2014 134(b)(2) by transferring the handgun to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Second, independent of the findings of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Stevens\u2019s statements to Reno, credited in the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, provided reasonable cause to believe that Stevens had been convicted of a disqualifying crime. The hearing judge found that: (1) Stevens informed Reno \u201cthat he had a prior drug charge for which he received probation before judgment\u201d; and (2) \u201cStevens also informed [Reno] of a prescription forgery charge.\u201d Even if Stevens did not tell Reno that he had been convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance other than marijuana and making a false prescription, it was incumbent upon Reno to ask Stevens whether one or both charges resulted in convictions before giving the handgun to Stevens. Indeed \u2014 as Reno explicitly conceded, and as the hearing judge explicitly found \u2014 Reno \u201cshould have known\u201d that Stevens had been convicted of a disqualifying crime. (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the above reasons, we are satisfied that clear and convincing evidence establishes that Reno committed an illegal act in violation of PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">It is abundantly clear that Reno violated MLRPC 8.4(d), which provides: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d We have described \u201c[a]n act prejudicial to the administration of justice [as] one that \u2018tends to bring the legal profession into disrepute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goodman, </em>426 Md. 115, 128, 43 A.3d 988, 995 (2012) (citation omitted). As the hearing judge found, Reno knew that: (1) Stevens had applied to buy a .45 caliber 1911 handgun; and (2) the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police disapproved Stevens\u2019s application. Nonetheless, Reno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>gave Stevens a handgun of the exact type for which he had applied. Even if (as the hearing judge found) Reno thought that the reason for Stevens\u2019s application\u2019s disapproval was \u201ca minor issue such as a failure [by] Stevens to have paid a fine[,]\u201d Reno nonetheless circumvented the law by giving the handgun to Stevens. As such, Reno, a criminal defense attorney, provided a gun to a person, a former client, whom she had reason to know was prohibited from possessing a firearm. Reno circumvented the law \u2014 and, indeed, violated the law \u2014 as to a prohibited person\u2019s possession of a firearm. Thus, Reno engaged in behavior prejudicial to the administration of justice as well as conduct \u201cimpacting] negatively the public\u2019s perception ... of the ... legal profession.\u201d <em>Rand, 411 </em>Md. at 96, 981 A.2d at 1242 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We also conclude that Reno violated MLRPC 8.4(a), which states: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... violate ... the\u201d MLRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">From the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we ascertain no basis to conclude, however, that Reno violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects) or 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). Although Reno committed an illegal act by violating PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2), a violation of PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2) alone does not appear to be a criminal act as Title 5 (\u201cFirearms\u201d) of the Public Safety Article does not set a penalty for violation of PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Because the Commission moved to dismiss, neither party recommended a sanction for Reno\u2019s misconduct. Instead of determining an appropriate sanction on our own initiative, we give Reno and the Commission the opportunity to recommend a sanction for Reno\u2019s violation of MLRPC 8.4(d) and 8.4(a). The parties shall file recommendations within thirty days of the date on which this opinion is filed. \u2018Within 15 days after service of ... recommendations, the adverse party may file a response.\u201d Md. R. 16-758(c). After receiving recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tions and responses (if any), we will schedule oral argument regarding the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-13\">. The State charged Reno with violating the statute that, at the time, was codified as Md.Code Ann., Pub. Safety (2003, 2011 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-143. To avoid confusion, we refer to the current version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">.
