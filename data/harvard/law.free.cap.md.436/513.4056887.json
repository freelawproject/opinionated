Ms. Bustamante filed a complaint against Gray with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">On October 23, 2012, in this Court, Bar Counsel filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Gray, charging her with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>fessional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 3.2 (Expediting Litigation), and 8.1(b) (Failing to Respond to Lawful Demand for Information from Disciplinary Authority). On October 24, 2012, we referred this attorney discipline proceeding to the Honorable Susan Souder (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d). On May 6, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On June 20, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Gray violated MLRPC 1.1,1.3, 3.2, and 8.1(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">On January 14, 2014, we heard oral argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the below reasons, we indefinitely suspend Gray from the practice of law in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">I.

On January 20, 2011, on behalf of Ms. Bustamante, Gray filed in the circuit court a Complaint for Limited Divorce against Mr. Bustamante.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In a scheduling order issued in the divorce case, the circuit court ordered that discovery be completed by July 25, 2011. In March 2011, Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel sent Interrogatories and a Request for Production of Documents to Gray. Gray failed to respond to the Interrogatories or Request for Production of Documents. On June 30, 2011, Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel filed a Motion to Compel Discovery. Gray failed to respond to the motion or to otherwise prepare written responses to the Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents. On December 9, 2011, over four months after the deadline for completion of discovery, Gray sent discovery requests to Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel. And, despite Ms. Bustamante\u2019s claims that Mr. Bustamante had been misusing and concealing assets, Gray failed to obtain Mr. Bustamante\u2019s testimony under oath in response to interrogatories before the scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On February 6, 2012, the parties reached a settlement, which was placed on the record in the circuit court, and the circuit court ordered the parties to submit a proposed Judgment of Absolute Divorce within ten days. Gray agreed to prepare the proposed judgment. Although Gray testified before the hearing judge in the present case that she sent a proposed judgment to Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel via e-mail, Gray failed to corroborate that claim by producing a copy of that e-mail or other documentation indicating that she complied with the circuit court\u2019s order that a proposed judgment be submitted within ten days. In a letter dated February 22, 2012, the law clerk for the circuit court judge assigned to the divorce action reminded Gray that the proposed judgment was due. On April 11, 2012, no response having been received, the circuit court ordered counsel for both parties to appear in chambers on April 30, 2012, with a proposed judgment. On May 4, 2012, a Judgment of Absolute Divorce was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>In a letter dated April 4, 2012, the Commission notified Gray of Ms. Bustamante\u2019s complaint and requested a written response to the allegations in the complaint within ten days.

It requires applying the knowledge to the client\u2019s problem.... \u2018Evidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of [MLRPC] 1.1.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Shakir, </em>427 Md. 197, 205, 46 A.3d 1162, 1167 (2012) (citation omitted). For example, where an attorney \u201cfail[s] to pursue [a] claim after filing [a] complaint,\u201d the attorney \u201cdemonstrates] incompetence and insufficient diligence in the matter, in violation of M[L]RPC 1.1 and 1.3 respectively.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 737, 28 A.3d 1196, 1213 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Gray violated MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3. After filing the complaint for limited divorce on behalf of Ms. Bustamante, Gray not only failed to take appropriate and timely action to pursue her client\u2019s claim, but she also failed to act diligently in representing Ms. Bustamante. Despite Ms. Bustamante\u2019s allegations that Mr. Bustamante was misusing and concealing assets, Gray failed to inquire into or to obtain Mr. Bustamante\u2019s testimony under oath on the matter, either in a deposition or in response to properly propounded interrogatories. Indeed, Gray failed to timely propound any discovery requests at all on behalf of Ms. Bustamante, sending her first set of discovery requests to Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel over four months after the deadline for completion of discovery had passed. Moreover, Gray failed to respond to discovery requests propounded by Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel, including Interrogatories and a Request for Production, and failed to respond when Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel filed a Motion to Compel responses to the discovery requests. In short, Gray failed to respond whatsoever to any discovery request served by Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">MLRPC 3.2 (Expediting Litigation)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.\u201d MLRPC 3.2. \u201cAn attorney violates [MLRPC 3.2] by delaying to take fundamental litigation steps in pursuit of the client\u2019s interest.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Garrett, </em>427 Md. at 226, 46 A.3d at 1179 (citations omitted).

As discussed above, Gray utterly failed to comply with discovery requests and to respond to a motion to compel responses to the discovery requests. Gray also delayed in taking necessary and required steps on behalf of Ms. Bustamante, vividly demonstrated by her failure to timely submit a proposed Judgment of Absolute Divorce. Although Gray agreed to prepare the proposed judgment by February 16, 2012, as ordered by the circuit court, and even though the circuit court judge\u2019s law clerk had sent Gray a reminder letter dated February 22, 2012, as of April 11, 2012, the circuit court had not received the proposed judgment, and was required to order counsel for both parties to appear in chambers. As a result of Gray\u2019s failure to timely prepare the proposed judgment as ordered, a Judgment of Absolute Divorce was not entered in the divorce case until May 4, 2012, almost three months after the parties had agreed upon a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">MLRPC 8.1(b) (Failing to Respond to Lawful Demand for Information from Disciplinary Authority)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u201c[A] lawyer ... in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not ... knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from [a] disciplinary authority!)]\u201d MLRPC 8.1(b).

It is undisputed that Gray failed to respond to two letters from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Commission, dated April 4, 2012, and April 30, 2012, regarding Ms. Bustamante\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">B. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Bar Counsel recommends that this Court indefinitely suspend Gray from the practice of law in Maryland. Gray has not filed a recommendation for sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dore, </em>433 Md. 685, 717, 73 A.3d 161, 180 (2013), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">When we impose sanctions, our goal is not to punish the [lawyer], but rather to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession [and] to deter other lawyers from violating the [MLRPC]. To achieve this goal, the sanction should be commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the misconduct and the intent with which it was committed. In determining an appropriate sanction, we often refer to the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>which focus on the nature of the ethical duty violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct, and any aggravating or mitigating [factor]s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">(Second alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Here, as to the nature of the ethical duty violated, Gray violated MLRPC 1.1,1.3, and 3.2 by failing to competently and diligently represent Ms. Bustamante, and by failing to take timely and appropriate actions to expedite litigation. Gray also violated MLRPC 8.1(b) by ignoring requests from the Commission to furnish information relevant to Ms. Bustamante\u2019s complaint and, indeed, by failing to respond at all. As to Gray\u2019s state of mind, Gray knowingly disregarded requests from the Commission, and either knowingly or negligently mishandled Ms. Bustamante\u2019s case by failing to respond to or propound discovery requests and by failing to submit a proposed judgment within the timeframe ordered by the circuit court. As to the actual or potential injury that Gray\u2019s miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>duct caused, Gray\u2019s misconduct negatively impacted the efficient operation of the courts by delaying resolution of the divorce case and causing Mr. Bustamante\u2019s counsel to file a motion to compel discovery responses, and her misconduct also negatively impacted both Ms. Bustamante\u2019s and the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession. Gray\u2019s refusal to comply with the requests of the Commission evidenced a disregard of the MLRPC and the attorney discipline process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 708-11, 80 A.3d 322, 342-43 (2013), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">Aggravating factors include: (a) prior disciplinary offenses; (b) dishonest or selfish motive; (c) pattern of misconduct; (d) multiple offenses; (e) bad faith obstruction of the [attorney] disciplinary proceeding[ ] by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the [Commission]; (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the [attorney disciplinary proceeding]; (g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct; (h) vulnerability of the victim; (i) substantial experience in the practice of law; [and] (j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">(Some alterations in original) (citation and paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Here, we note at least three aggravating factors. First, Gray has two prior disciplinary offenses. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gray (\u201cGray </em>I\u201d), 421 Md. 92, 25 A.3d 219 (2011), this Court reprimanded Gray for violating MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(b). And, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gray (\u201cGray II\u201d), </em>433 Md. 516, 521-23, 524-25, 533, 72 A.3d 174, 177-78, 179-80, 184 (2013), this Court suspended Gray from the practice of law for sixty days for violating MLRPC 1.3,1.4, 1.15, and 8.1(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, Gray has engaged in a pattern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>misconduct, violating MLRPC 1.3 and 8.1(b) on two prior occasions in addition to the instant case. Third, Gray has obviously committed multiple offenses. As discussed above, in her representation of Ms. Bustamante, Gray violated MLRPC 1.1,1.3, 3.2, and 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The following constitute mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) personal or emotional problems; (d) timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; (e) full and free disclosure to [the Commission] or cooperative attitude toward [the attorney discipline] proceeding[ ]; (f) inexperience in the practice of law; (g) character or reputation; (h) physical disability; (i) mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse when: (1) there is medical evidence that the [lawyer] is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability; (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct; (3) the [lawyer\u2019s recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that misconduct is unlikely; (]') delay in [the attorney] disciplinary proceedingf ]; (k) imposition of other penalties or sanctions; <em>(l) </em>remorse; [and] (m) remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"><em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 713, 80 A.3d at 344 (some alterations in original) (citation and paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Here, Gray did not testify at the hearing as to any mitigating factors, nor did the hearing judge find any mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 254-56, 760 A.2d 1108, 1119-20 (2000), where an attorney violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, 3.2, and 8.1(b), and where his \u201crepeated refusal to comply with the requests of Bar Counsel demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>strated a complete \u2018disregard of the spirit and intent of the [MLRPC,]\u2019 \u201d we suspended the attorney for sixty days. We stated that the attorney\u2019s \u201cviolations of the [MLRPC] regarding diligence, communication, expediting litigation, and responding to lawful demands of Bar Counsel [were] serious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 760 A.2d at 1120. We imposed the sixty-day suspension rather than a greater sanction, however, because the attorney had been a member of the Bar of Maryland for over twenty years and had no prior disciplinary offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 760 A.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nichols, </em>405 Md. 207, 212, 216, 218, 950 A.2d 778, 782, 784, 785 (2008), where an attorney violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.5(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(d) and (e), 1.16(d), and 8.1(b) in his representation of a client in a bankruptcy matter, we indefinitely suspended the attorney. In so ordering, we stated: \u201c[The attorney]\u2019s misconduct was due neither to dishonesty nor to criminal conduct, but rather due to lack of diligence as well as incompetence in bankruptcy matters. Indeed, this is [the attorneyjs first disciplinary proceeding in over thirteen years of practicing law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 950 A.2d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In this case, in light of existing caselaw and taking into account the aggravating factors present, including Gray\u2019s prior disciplinary offenses and violations of multiple MLRPC, and the sanctions ordered by this Court in those prior disciplinary offenses <em>(i e., </em>a reprimand and sixty-day suspension)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 which, we note, arose out of violations of two of the same MLRPC violated here, MLRPC 1.3 and 8.1(b) \u2014 we conclude that the appropriate sanction for Gray\u2019s violations of the MLRPC is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in Maryland.
