On July 19, 2011, the Montgomery County Council passed Bill 18-11<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to amend Section 33-80(a)(7) of the Montgomery County Code. Section 33-80(a), which prescribes the scope of County collective bargaining with its police department union, provided, before its amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\n<em>\u201cCollective bargaining.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Duty to bargain; matters subject to bargaining. </em>A certified employee organization and the employer must bargain collectively on the following subjects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201c(1) Salary and wages, provided, however, that salaries and wages shall be uniform for all employees in the same classification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">\u201c(2) Pension and retirement benefits for active employees only;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">\u201c(3) Employee benefits such as, but not limited to, insurance, leave, holidays and vacation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">\u201c(4) Hours and working conditions, including the availability and use of personal patrol vehicles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">\u201c(5) Provisions for the orderly processing and settlement of grievances concerning the interpretation and implementation of the collective bargaining agreement, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>may include binding third party arbitration and provisions for exclusivity of forum;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">\u201c(6) Matters affecting the health and safety of employees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">\u201c(7) The effect on employees of the employer\u2019s exercise of rights listed in subsection (b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Montgomery, Md., Code \u00a7 33-80(a) (2007). Section 33-80(b), on the other hand, delineates certain \u201crights\u201d of the Executive that cannot be impaired through police collective bargaining. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\n<em>\u201cEmployer rights.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">\u201cThis article and any agreement pursuant hereto shall not impair the right and responsibility of the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201c(1) To determine the overall budget and mission of the employer and any agency of county government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">\u201c(2) To maintain and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\">\u201c(3) To determine the services to be rendered and the operations to be performed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-12\">\u201c(4) To determine the overall organizational structure, methods, processes, means, job classifications or personnel by which operations are to be conducted and the location of facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-13\">\u201c(5) To direct or supervise employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-14\">\u201c(6) To hire, select and establish the standards governing promotion of employees and to classify positions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-15\">\u201c(7) To relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or funds, or under conditions when the employer determines continued work would be inefficient or nonproductive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-16\">\u201c(8) To make and enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this law or a collective bargaining agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-17\">\u201c(9) To take actions to carry out the mission of government in situations of emergency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201c(10) To transfer, assign and schedule employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq\">Montgomery, Md., Code \u00a7 33-80(b) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Prior to the enactment of Bill 18-11, Section 33-80(a)(7), which required \u201ceffects collective bargaining,\u201d <em>ie., </em>that the Executive bargain with a certified employee group over the \u201ceffect on employees of the employer\u2019s exercise of rights listed in [Section 33-80](b),\u201d restricted the free and unfettered exercise of the Executive\u2019s rights. Thus, for example, \u00a7 33-80(b)(4) may have granted the Executive the right to \u201cdetermine the overall ... methods, processes, means ... by which operations are to be conducted,\u201d but prior to the enactment of Bill 18-11, if the Executive wanted to install video cameras in police cruisers, or distribute new public safety equipment, Section 33-80(a)(7) required him to bargain with the police union over how and when the initiative would be implemented, giving the police union, in effect, a veto-like restriction over the exercise of the Executive\u2019s powers under Section 33-80(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Bill 18-11 was enacted to prevent police unions from using effects bargaining to hinder the implementation of Executive initiatives made pursuant to Section 33-80(b). Upon its enactment, effects bargaining was limited to situations where an Executive initiative enacted under Section 33-80(b) results in the loss of police jobs. Section 33-80(a)(7) provided after its passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201c(a) Duty to bargain; matters subject to bargaining. A certified employee organization and the employer must bargain collectively on the following subjects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201c(7) <em>Amelioration of the effect on employees when the employer\u2019s exercise of rights listed in subsection (b) causes a loss of existing jobs in the unit.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Montgomery, Md., Code \u00a7 33-80(a) (2011) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 35 (\u201cFOP 35\u201d), in response to the passage of Bill 18-11, initiated a petition drive (\u201cthe Petition\u201d) to place the bill on the November 4, 2012 ballot for voter referendum. To do so, pursuant to Montgomery County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Charter \u00a7 114<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and consistent with Article 11-F, Section 7 of the Maryland Constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> FOP 35 was required to obtain approximately 30,000 signatures. FOP 35 engaged the services of a California and Michigan based company, which specialized in gathering signatures for petition drives, to assist in gathering the required signatures. Through the company\u2019s efforts, FOP 35 collected 48,935 signatures in Montgomery County. Those signatures were timely submitted to the Montgomery County Board of Elections (\u201cMCBE\u201d) for verification and validation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Each petition page submitted to the Board, as required by Maryland Code (2003, 2010 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 6-201(c) of the Election Law Article (\u201cEL\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contained, among other things, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>copy of Council Bill 18-11, spaces for signatures, printed names, and signer addresses and, at the foot, the affidavit of the circulator. The circulator\u2019s affidavit was in the form of, and contained the statements required by, EL \u00a7 6-204,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CO-MAR 33.06.03.07,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and COMAR 33.06.03.08.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>\u201cCirculator\u2019s Affidavit: </em>Under the penalties of perjury, I swear (or affirm) that: (a) I was at least 18 years old when each signature was obtained; (b) the information given to identify me is true and correct; (c) I personally observed each signer as he or she signed this page; and (d) to the best of my knowledge and belief: (i) all signatures on this page are genuine; and (ii) all signers are registered voters of Montgomery County, Maryland. I made available to each signer a copy of the entire bill on the reverse of this page.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Pursuant to COMAR 33.06.03.07, following the affidavit was also a space for the circulator\u2019s name, signature, telephone number, and address, including city, state, and zip code.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Two circulators, Christopher Head (\u201cHead\u201d) and Jesse Rowe (\u201cRowe\u201d), misstated the zip codes for their addresses by one or two digits on each page that they signed. Head provided as his address: 1229 Richland Avenue, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49008. Although \u201c49008\u201d was a valid Michigan zip code, the actual zip code for that area of Kalamazoo was 49006. Rowe provided as his address: 1405 Upland Drive, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49004. Again, although a valid Michigan zip code, the actual zip code for his address was 49048. Head submitted 1,019 pages with his error, pages that contained 3,392 signatures. Rowe submitted 942 pages with his error, pages that contained 2,744 signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Despite the incorrect zip codes in the circulator affidavits, the MCBE checked each signature and certified that 34,828 of the 48,935 signatures were those of registered voters of Montgomery County, approximately 4,600 signatures more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>required by law. In November 2011, the Board announced by letter that Bill 18-11 was certified for placement on the ballot of the November 2012 General Election.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Seeking to prevent the referendum on Bill 18-11, Montgomery County, Maryland, and Steven Farber, the staff director of the County Council and a registered voter of Montgomery County, (collectively \u201cthe respondents\u201d), filed, on November 28, 2011, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a complaint<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> against the MCBE, seeking judicial review and declaratory relief pursuant to EL \u00a7 6-209(a) and (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The complaint challenged the MCBE\u2019s certification of the Petition, alleging violation of the requirements for petitions prescribed by EL \u00a7 6-203.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>FOP 35, as proponents of the petition to referendum, having been granted leave to intervene, moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the respondents\u2019 failed to exhaust available administrative remedies, as well as failed to file timely the administrative record before the MCBE in compliance with Maryland Rule 7-206.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Circuit Court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>motions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Having abandoned its challenge to the referendum petition under EL \u00a7 6-203, the respondents amended their complaint to add another action for declaratory judgment, this one pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (\u201cMUDJA\u201d), Md.Code (2006) \u00a7 3-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, and continued to prosecute their action on the new theory that the MCBE had unlawfully counted the voters\u2019 signatures on the circulation petition pages, in which the zip code provided by a circulator was erroneous. This, they maintained, was a violation of EL \u00a7 6-204. On this ground, the respondents filed a motion for summary judgment, in which they argued that thousands of signatures were improperly certified by the MCBE, because affidavits signed by circulators in support of the Petition were incorrect, incomplete, or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The petitioners responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment on the ground that the County did not have standing, pursuant to EL \u00a7 6-209, to appeal the MCBE\u2019s certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Circuit Court granted the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In its opinion, the Circuit Court, relying on <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>229 Md. 397, 184 A.2d 101 (1962), agreed with the respondents that the petition pages containing circulators\u2019 incorrectly recorded zip codes should be rejected. It reasoned that all statutory requirements for both petition signatures and circulator affidavits must be met, noting and emphasizing what we said in Tyler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the requirement of the affidavit is to give a prima facie presumption of validity to the petition to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>it is attached. If it is shown that the affidavit is fraudulent as to all or part of the petition it supports, the prima facie presumption of the validity of the petition must fail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><em>Tyler, </em>229 Md. at 404, 184 A.2d at 104-05 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, the Circuit Court ruled that the petition pages containing incorrect information regarding zip codes and addresses were necessarily invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The Circuit Court also granted the petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Montgomery County, Maryland, lacked standing to bring its appeal under both EL \u00a7 6-209 and the MUDJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">On July 17, 2012, the petitioners timely filed, in this Court, its petition for writ of certiorari, arguing that the Circuit Court erred in invalidating the certified petition for referendum, and the respondents timely filed a cross-petition for writ of certiorari, seeking review of the Circuit Court ruling that the County lacked standing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We granted both petitions. <em>Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 35 v. Montgomery County, Maryland, </em>427 Md. 381, 47 A.3d 1017 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>On August 17, 2012, after oral argument, and consideration of the issues, we issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">\u201cFor reasons to be stated in an opinion later to be filed, it is this 17th day of August, 2012,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201cORDERED, by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, a majority of the Court concurring, that the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County be, and it is hereby, reversed. Costs to be paid by the Appellees. Mandate to issue forthwith[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 35 v. Montgomery County, Maryland, </em>427 Md. 522, 50 A.3d 8, 9 (2012). We now provide the reasons for that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The issue before us involves the requirements, as prescribed by EL \u00a7 6-204, for a circulator affidavit attached to signature pages, signed in support of a ballot referendum initiative. Section 6-204 imposes three requirements on petition circulators with respect to circulation petition affidavits. First, \u201c[e]ach signature page shall contain an affidavit made and executed by the individual in whose presence all of the signatures on that page were affixed and who observed each of those signatures being affixed.\u201d Section 6-204(a). Second, the affidavit is to \u201ccontain the statements, required by regulation, designed to assure the validity of the signatures and fairness of the petition process.\u201d Section 6-204(b). Lastly, \u201c[a] circulator must be at least 18 years old at the time any of the signatures covered by the affidavit are affixed.\u201d Section 6-204(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Section 6-204(b) provides the State Board of Elections with the authority to promulgate regulations relating to circulators. Those regulations, found in COMAR 33.06.03.07. and 33.06.03.08, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cCOMAR 33.06.03.07.B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cThe identification of the circulator shall include that individual\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\u201c(1) ... name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201c(2) Residence address, including ... ZIP code; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201c(3) Telephone number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u201cCOMAR 33.06.03.08.B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cThe affidavit shall state that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201c(1) All of the information given by the circulator under Regulation .07 of this chapter is true and correct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">\u201c(2) The circulator was 18 years old or older ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201c(3) The circulator personally observed each signer as the page was signed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201c(4) To the best of the circulator\u2019s knowledge and belief, all:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATx\">\u201c(a) Signatures on the petition are genuine, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am3\">\u201c(b) Signers are registered voters in the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">The petitioners contend that the MCBE acted correctly in accepting petition pages submitted by both Head and Rowe, considering the signatures on those pages as valid and counting them. They note that circulators Head and Rowe, by signing the affidavit, providing their names, telephone numbers, and addresses, all of which were found by the MCBE to be valid, submitted petition pages that complied with EL \u00a7 6-204(b). Although Head and Rowe both erred in reporting their zip code, the petitioners argue that this is \u201can unintentional mistake of no consequence,\u201d that the misstatements were not fraudulent and both circulators were identifiable to the MCBE. The petitioners further contend that there is no authority for the proposition that a minor, unintentional and immaterial mistake in an affidavit <em>requires </em>the Court to disregard the entire petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">Additionally, the petitioners challenge the Circuit Court\u2019s application of EL \u00a7 6-203 as imposing an undue burden on the voters\u2019 right to be counted on a petition, in violation of Article I of the Maryland Constitution, Articles 7 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The petitioners characterize the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling as demanding \u201cperfection\u201d by a petition circulator. They cite <em>Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 182, 204-05, 119 S.Ct. 636, 648, 142 L.Ed.2d 599, 617-18 (1999), for the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the Circuit Court erred by placing restrictions on the petitioning process that are not narrowly tailored to address the legitimate concern of identifying the circulator of a petition page.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The respondents respond that a circulator\u2019s affidavit containing an incorrect zip code does not satisfy COMAR 33.06.08.07, and by extension EL \u00a7 6-204; in the absence of rebuttal evidence, the circulators\u2019 failure to accurately complete the affidavit constitutes constructive fraud rendering the signatures invalid. The respondents rest their argument entirely upon <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>229 Md. 397, 184 A.2d 101 (1962). They assert that our decision in <em>Tyler </em>requires that all signatures conjoined to the inaccurate affidavits must be invalidated because they are a product of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In <em>Tyler, </em>a registered voter opposed a referendum on a bill involving the establishment of new school bus routes, contending, among other things, that at least one of the signers of the referendum petition was not a registered voter of the State and County. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 184 A.2d at 102. The opponent further contended that the statement in the accompanying affidavit of the circulator, attesting to the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge of the signer\u2019s eligibility, was therefore, false and fraudulent and ineligible for certification. <em>Id. </em>We framed the issue as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cThe question raised by this appeal is the effect upon a referendum petition of the falsity, in part, of the statement in the accompanying affidavit of the circulator ... that the signers of the petition were registered voters of the State and County, as set opposite their names----Whether such falsity amounts to fraud or gives rise to a presumption of fraud depends, we think, upon a determination of the intent behind the language employed in setting out the requirements of the affidavit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 184 A.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">We concluded that an inaccurate circulator affidavit created the presumption of fraud (actual or constructive) because the circulator falsely attested to a fact of which he had a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>know. <em>Id. </em>at 405, 184 A.2d at 105. In reaching our conclusion, we observed that Maryland at that time was one of the only states that imposed a duty on the affiant to certify, not merely his belief that the attached signatures were valid, but to his personal knowledge in every particular fact or allegation, which is original and does not depend on information or hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 184 A.2d at 105 (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(3rd ed. 1933)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We concluded that, wherever the affiant failed in this duty, that affiant\u2019s submission would be presumed fraudulent, and, in the absence of rebuttal evidence, the petition signatures would be invalidated. <em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 184 A.2d at 105-06. We noted that the reason for this was that, while provisions pertaining to ballot referendums are to be liberally construed, a referendum valid on its face carried the drastic effect of suspending legislation designed to correct a particular evil. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 184 A.2d at 103-04. As such, the \u201ccrux of the matter ... [is] the falsity of the statement that, of the affiant\u2019s own personal knowledge, such persons were registered voters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>229 Md. at 404, 184 A.2d at 105. We therefore concluded, in <em>Tyler, </em>that each circulator had the duty to execute an affidavit attesting \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d that every signatory to the petition was in fact eligible to sign. <em>Id. </em>at 405, 184 A.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The respondents take from <em>Tyler </em>that the affiants\u2019 incorrect zip code information created a presumption of fraud, and that the petitioners have failed to produce evidence to rebut that presumption. The respondents, therefore, conclude that the signatures attached to the affidavits are necessarily invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We disagree. The respondents\u2019 analysis fails to consider that Maryland Election Law has changed significantly since <em>Tyler </em>was decided. Maryland has since joined the majority of states that do not require that affiants attest to personal knowledge as to the signer\u2019s actual voting status. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>current Maryland election law places the burden <em>of verifying </em>signatures and counting validated signatures contained in the petition upon the \u201cstaff of the election authority,\u201d in this case the Montgomery County Board of Elections, not upon the petition circulators. EL \u00a7 6-207(a). Rather than attest personal knowledge of the signatory\u2019s eligibility to vote, Maryland law now only requires that the petition circulators attest to the best of their knowledge and to their belief that the signatures given are genuine and that the signers are registered voters. The legal analysis underlying <em>Tyler\u2019s </em>holding is, therefore, inapplicable to the present case, and for this reason, <em>Tyler </em>provides no support for the respondents\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We disagree with the respondents for another reason: we recognize that the purpose of our election law regarding ballot referenda \u2014 to allow registered voters to have direct input in their state\u2019s democratic processes \u2014 is not served by invalidating the already certified signatures of registered voters. The right to sign and to be counted on a petition is found in Article XI-A, \u00a7 5 of the Maryland Constitution. In <em>Maryland Green Party v. Maryland Bd. of Elections, 377 </em>Md. 127, 151, 832 A.2d 214, 228 (2003), we held that \u201cthe right to have one\u2019s signature counted on a nominating petition is integral to that political party member\u2019s right of suffrage.\u201d In <em>Munsell v. Hennegan, </em>182 Md. 15, 22, 31 A.2d 640, 644 (1943), we recognized that voters should be given every opportunity to have their votes counted, and, in that way, their voices heard, and common sense should be employed with regard to such matters. In <em>Ficker v. Denny, </em>326 Md. 626, 633, 606 A.2d 1060, 1063 (1992), we held that \u201c[t]he right [to sign or not to sign a petition] is an individual one which can only be exercised by the signer.\u201d In that case, we concluded that a voter had the right to expect and demand that the proponents of a referendum petition file the petition once sufficient signatures were collected. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 606 A.2d at 1064. In other words, a petition that contains the requisite number of valid signatures must proceed, and a proponent cannot unilaterally refrain from filing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Several of our sister jurisdictions have similarly recognized that the voters\u2019 right to have their signatures counted on a petition outweighs objections related to immaterial irregularities. For example, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld the validity of petition signatures whose accompanying affidavit was signed using an incorrect last name. <em>In re Blair Tp., Blair Cty., Retail Malt and Brewed Beverage Referendum, </em>382 Pa. 295, 114 A.2d 148, 149 (1955). Noting that the identity of the circulator, who incorrectly signed her name, was never questioned, the court determined that the objection to the petition should \u201cbe ignored and not permitted to prevent a full and free expression of the electorate\u2019s will.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">The Supreme Court of Missouri also emphasized the importance of preserving the voters\u2019 right to be counted in an initiative and referendum when it found that minor errors in circulator affidavits are insufficient to invalidate a petition if the underlying petition signatures were shown to be valid and genuine. <em>United Labor Comm. of Missouri v. Kirkpatrick, 572 </em>S.W.2d 449, 453-54 (Mo.1978). The court explained that \u201cprocedures designed to effectuate these democratic concepts should be liberally construed to avail the voters with every opportunity to exercise these rights. The ability of the voters to get before their fellow voters issues they deem significant should not be thwarted in preference for technical formalities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454. The court noted that the purpose of the state constitution\u2019s provision to the people of the power of initiative and referendum is to allow an issue to be put to a vote before the people if a sufficient number of registered voters deem the issue important. <em>Id. </em>at 453. In light of this purpose, the court refused to find fatal an irregularity not specified as fatal by statute, because \u201c[s]uch provisions should be construed so as to make effective the reservation of power by the people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Voss v. Davis, </em>418 S.W.2d 163, 167 (1967), in turn quoting 28 Am.Jur., Initiative, Referendum and Recall, Sec. 6, p. 439).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>There is simply no call among the controlling authorities for invalidating otherwise valid petition signatures in the absence of fraud because a petition circulator failed to dot an \u201ci\u201d or cross a \u201ct\u201d. <em>See Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County Bd. of Elections, </em>418 Md. 463, 470-71, 15 A.3d 798, 802 (2011). Our laws make it clear that the purpose of attaching the circulator\u2019s affidavit to petition signatures is so that the circulator of the petition can be identified, located, and if necessary, served a subpoena. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 15 A.3d at 804. Having one or two digits of a circulator\u2019s zip code misstated does not defeat that purpose. The circulators still could be identified, as the addresses provided were more than adequate for their intended purposes (location and identification of the circulators), and the correct zip code was easily discoverable and available. We therefore hold that minor errors in the circulator affidavit will not invalidate petition signatures that are already certified by the appropriate administrative body. Upon reviewing, de novo, the lower court\u2019s conclusion of law, <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Brown, </em>177 Md.App. 440, 462, 935 A.2d 1128, 1141 (2007) <em>aff'd, </em>406 Md. 466, 959 A.2d 807 (2008) (citing <em>Miller v. Comptroller of Maryland, </em>398 Md. 272, 282, 920 A.2d 467, 473 (2007)), we reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling and uphold the MCBE\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">As noted above, the petitioners\u2019 argue that the Circuit Court placed unconstitutional burdens on the voter\u2019s right to be counted on a petition. This Court has stated that \u201cnothing is better settled than the principle that courts should not decide constitutional issues unnecessarily.\u201d <em>Comptroller of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Treasury v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., </em>52 Md.App. 581, 597, 451 A.2d 347, 355 (1982) (quoting <em>State v. Raithel, </em>285 Md. 478, 484, 404 A.2d 264, 267 (1979)). Therefore, \u201c[e]ven if a constitutional issue is properly raised and decided at the trial level, this Court will not reach the constitutional issue if it is unnecessary to do so.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 217, 946 A.2d 456, 461 (2008) (citing <em>Burch v. United Cable Television of Baltimore Ltd. Partnership, </em>391 Md. 687, 695, 895 A.2d 980, 984-85 (2006)).

The petitioners argue that this was an error. The petitioners cite <em>Montgomery County v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 654 A.2d 877 (1995), for the proposition that \"[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence\u201d in the administrative record as a whole \"to support the agency's findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 654 A.2d at 882 (quoting <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). Emphasizing that the MCBE found valid the minimum number of signatures required to certify Bill 18-11 to appear on the November 2012 ballot, and the Circuit Court based its invalidation of the MCBE\u2019s certification upon consideration of evidence outside of the MCBE\u2019s findings of fact, the petitioners ask that this Court reinstate the MCBE\u2019s administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The respondents, in turn, request that this Court affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to conduct de novo review of the validity of the Petition signatures. The respondents cite <em>City of Takoma Park v. Citizens for Decent Government </em>to assert that once a decision by a board of elections is challenged in the form of declaratory judgment, a trial court no longer needs to defer to the agency. 301 Md. 439, 483 A.2d 348 (1984). The respondents note that EL \u00a7 6-209(b) authorizes declaratory relief, and therefore contend that the Circuit Court was not limited to review only the MCBE's record.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">FOP 35 also moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to adhere to the rules for judicial review of an agency decision, arguing that the Circuit Court was limited to determining if there was substantial evidence in the record to either support the MCBE\u2019s decision or to find the decision was an erroneous conclusion of law. The Circuit Court, however, rejected that argument, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">\"In the instant case, there is no administrative record to review because the decision being appealed is the Board\u2019s certification of a petition.... Therefore, since the court does not have a record to examine, the court \u2018must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it\u2019 and give respect to the expertise of the agency in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>its own field. <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance </em>[v. <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. 59], 67-69 [729 A.2d 376, 380-81 (1999)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The respondents\u2019 challenge to the MCBE\u2019s decision, however, is premised upon an incorrect conclusion of law, for reasons explained below. Errors, such as an incorrect zip code, in the affidavit signed by a petition circulator have an insufficient nexus to the validity of the voters\u2019 signatures on the Petition to properly form the basis of a challenge to the MCBE\u2019s certification of the Petition. Therefore, we do not address the issue of whether the Circuit Court erred in granting the right to conduct discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">.
