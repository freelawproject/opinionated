Petitioner presents two issues on appeal. First, Petitioner asks whether the trial court complied with Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article (hereinafter \u00a7 3-104(a)) when it allowed Petitioner to withdraw his request for a competency evaluation and after-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>wards did not make a competency determination on the record. We conclude that Petitioner\u2019s withdrawal of his request for a competency evaluation, in conjunction with the minimal evidence on the record to support a finding of incompetency, supported the Circuit Court for Cecil County\u2019s acknowledgment that the issue of competency was moot and, therefore, the presumption of Petitioner\u2019s competency was not rebutted. Petitioner attempts to have it both ways, first refusing a competency evaluation because he believed he was competent to stand trial and then, upon a finding of guilt, reversing his position and maintaining that the trial judge should have made a competency determination on the record. Second, Petitioner asks whether his request for a jury instruction on the defense of provocation was properly denied. We conclude that the evidence presented did not generate such a defense, and the denial was proper. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On September 22, 2010, Petitioner was indicted in the stabbing death of Daniel Curran (\u201cCurran\u201d or \u201cvictim\u201d). At a pretrial hearing on January 21, 2011, Petitioner\u2019s counsel indicated that he was considering whether to file a request for a psychological evaluation following a conversation with Petitioner\u2019s mother and requested to reschedule the pretrial hearing so he could explore the option \u201cmore in depth.\u201d The hearing was rescheduled for the following week and, at that time, Petitioner\u2019s counsel submitted a request for an evaluation of competence, which the court subsequently granted. The Court ordered the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) to conduct an in-custody competency evaluation and for DHMH to submit a copy of the report to counsel and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">At a later motions hearing on May 10, 2011, the parties and the trial judge discussed the request for a competency evaluation. Defense counsel explained that he \u201chad some questions about [Petitioner\u2019s] competency based on a history of prior admissions to psychiatric facilities and also after talking with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>his mother and her familiarity with her son.\u201d He further explained, however, that the doctor at DHMH went to see Petitioner to complete the evaluation, and Petitioner refused to speak with him because the evaluation would \u201ccast[ ] doubts about [his] sanity.\u201d Defense counsel then emphasized that he \u201cstill ha[s] those concerns [about Petitioner\u2019s competency], and ... even his current course of action in not talking to the doctor exacerbates those concerns, doesn\u2019t allay them.\u201d When the State commented that Petitioner\u2019s failure to submit to a competency evaluation might be grounds for appeal once he is convicted, the trial judge responded that \u201cthe only thing I can say is we ordered the examination, made it available to him.\u201d The prosecutor then made clear that \u201cif there is something presented during this motions hearing [or if there is any indication that\u2019s observable] that the defendant is not of sound mind, I\u2019m going to be making a request for an emergency evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On May 26, 2011 at another pretrial hearing, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[Petitioner\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, we are here for an issue of competency to stand trial. And after further discussions with Mr. Wood, both substantively and about this particular issue, I have come to the conclusion that I should withdraw my request. And that is with Mr. Wood\u2019s concurrence. Is that correct, Mr. Wood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">[Wood]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">[Trial Judge]: Okay. And you understand the consequences of withdrawing that motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">[Wood]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">[Petitioner\u2019s counsel]: And the consequences are there will be no such evaluation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">[Wood]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">[Petitioner\u2019s counsel]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">[Trial Judge]: Because it\u2019s my understanding [DHMH] attempted to perform an evaluation and they wrote back that at that time you refused to participate, so that\u2019s why we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>were going to send you for further evaluation at Clifton T. Perkins. But you are withdrawing the motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">[Wood]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">[Trial Judge]: And that\u2019s all moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Petitioner\u2019s trial lasted from June 13 to June 16, 2011. The following evidence, relevant to this appeal, was presented at the trial. The victim\u2019s body was discovered by Mr. Michael Martin, a friend who occasionally \u201ccheck[ed] in on\u201d the victim, on February 17, 2010. Mr. Martin testified that the home was \u201ctrashed,\u201d and the dresser drawer where Curran stored his medication was overturned. Martin drove to the local grocery store and notified police. The owner of the local grocery store, Mrs. Wright, who had frequent contact with the victim, testified that when Curran \u201cwas sober, he was awesome. If he wasn\u2019t sober, we didn\u2019t let him into the store.\u201d Mrs. Wright further testified that on February 12, 2010, Petitioner came to the grocery store with a note signed by Curran authorizing the purchase of beer, which was a regular practice between Wright and Curran.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Another witness for the State, Matthew Morris, testified that at one time prior to Curran\u2019s death, Petitioner talked to Morris about \u201crobbing the guy up the street\u201d to \u201csteal his pills,\u201d and that the \u201cguy up the street\u201d could only mean Curran. A friend of Petitioner\u2019s, Michael McDonald, testified that during a visit to the area in March 2010, he visited Petitioner, and that Petitioner told him that he and the victim had been drinking when they got into an argument over pills, during which Petitioner \u201csnapped\u201d and stabbed Curran \u201cin the temple and in the neck[.]\u201d Petitioner\u2019s mother also testified for the State. She admitted that on February 12, 2010, a \u201cdrunk\u201d and \u201clethargic\u201d Petitioner came home and told her he \u201churt\u201d Curran. When the prosecutor refreshed her recollection, Petitioner\u2019s mother acknowledged that during her interview with police on September 9, 2010, she twice told the detectives that Petitioner told her that he thought he killed Curran. She insisted at trial, however, that Petitioner only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>said he \u201churt\u201d Curran, and that he did so because Curran \u201chad said something inappropriate about [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">It was determined that at the time of his death, the victim was in poor physical health; he was dying of cancer and had been \u201cbeaten very badly\u201d by someone a few days prior to his murder. While he was being treated for this earlier beating, the victim told medical personnel that he had a \u201chistory of aggressive behavior\u201d and had threatened others \u201cphysically or verbally\u201d when \u201cdrunk or high.\u201d He also stated that he would \u201clike to kill the person who beat [him] up[.]\u201d A toxicology report showed that the victim tested positive for ethanol and other substances at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to the first-degree murder charge and Petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment with all but 80 years suspended. Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court in a reported opinion. <em>Wood v. State, </em>209 Md.App. 246, 58 A.3d 556 (2012). We granted <em>certiorari </em>on April 22, 2013, <em>Wood v. State, </em>431 Md. 219, 64 A.3d 496 (2013), to answer the following questions:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(1) Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that the trial court complied with Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article when the trial judge allowed Petitioner to withdraw his request for a competency evaluation, and afterwards did not make a competency determination on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">(2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it determined that the Circuit Court properly denied Wood\u2019s request for an instruction on legally adequate provocation because that defense was not generated by the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The present case does not involve a substantive challenge to Petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial. Rather, Petitioner claims that the trial court committed a procedural error by failing to make a competency determination following defense counsel\u2019s request for, and subsequent withdrawal of, a competency evaluation. With that in mind, we turn to the requirements of Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Preliminarily, we note that a person accused of committing a crime is presumed competent to stand trial. <em>Peaks v. State, </em>419 Md. 239, 251, 18 A.3d 917, 924 (2011); <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 703, 759 A.2d 764, 792 (2000). \u201cIt has long been accepted[, however,] that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 903, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). The relevant standard was codified in \u00a7 3-104(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case or a violation of probation proceeding appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f) of the Criminal Procedure Article defines \u201cincompetent to stand trial\u201d as someone who is unable \u201c(1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) to assist in one\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>See also Peaks, </em>419 Md. at 251, 18 A.3d at 924. This Court has explained that the General Assembly enacted these statutes in order to \u201cmandate the precise actions to be taken by a trial court when an accused\u2019s competency to stand trial was questioned.\u201d <em>Roberts v. State, </em>361 Md. 346, 363, 761 A.2d 885, 894 (2000) (citing <em>Sangster v. State, </em>312 Md. 560, 541 A.2d 637 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The interpretation and application of \u00a7 3-104(a) has been visited by this Court many times since the statute\u2019s enactment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Peaks, </em>419 Md. 239, 18 A.3d 917; <em>Gregg v. State, </em>377 Md. 515, 833 A.2d 1040 (2003); <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. 346, 761 A.2d 885; <em>Sangster, </em>312 Md. 560, 541 A.2d 637. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">The language of [\u00a7 3-104](a) mandates actions to be undertaken by a trial court, if an accused\u2019s competency is properly called into question. These actions can be broken down into three distinct and simple steps: (1) First, a determination of competency may be made at any time before or during a trial; (2) Second, such a determination must be made if the defendant in a criminal case appears to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial; and (3) Finally, the court must make its determination on the evidence presented on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKH\"><em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 364, 761 A.2d at 895. The first step is self-explanatory and merely \u201cspecifies the time frame within which the question of the accused\u2019s competency must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner has clearly satisfied this step because his counsel filed the request for a competency evaluation prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The second step requires the issue of competency to be properly before the court. \u201cAs the statute makes plain, a trial court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of the accused is triggered in one of three ways: (1) upon motion of the accused; (2) upon motion of the defense counsel; or (3) upon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 85, 622 A.2d 727, 730 (1993) <em>(Thanos I). </em>Because the issue of Petitioner\u2019s competency was raised by motion, it was properly before the trial court and the second step under \u00a7 3-104(a) was likewise satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The crux of this appeal is whether the third step of \u00a7 3-104(a) was satisfied, or if it even needed to be satisfied in this situation. This Court has undertaken the task of interpreting this requirement, that \u201cthe court must make its determination on the evidence presented on the record,\u201d at length. Such a determination by a trial judge should not \u201cbe made lightly but upon testimony and evidence on the record.\u201d <em>Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 682, 547 A.2d 1054, 1063 (1988). We have held that \u201c[w]e view the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of such language [\u2018on evidence presented on the record,\u2019] as a clear indication that it intended the determination of competency to be essential in preserving an accused\u2019s due process rights and that such rights could only be preserved if the determination was made on evidence presented on the record.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 366, 761 A.2d at 896. The determination of a person\u2019s competency to stand trial is held to a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The issue presented on appeal involves a two-step inquiry: (1) whether Petitioner was legally permitted to withdraw the request for a competency evaluation; and (2) if so, whether Petitioner\u2019s withdrawal renders the competency issue moot. The first issue can be disposed of quickly. In short, the answer is yes, Petitioner may legally withdraw a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>for a competency evaluation. As the Court of Special Appeals correctly pointed out, there is nothing in Maryland case law, rules, or statutes that prohibits the withdrawal of a request for a competency evaluation. <em>Wood, </em>209 Md.App. at 296, 58 A.3d at 585. Section 3-105 of the Maryland Criminal Procedure Article also sheds light on this issue. That section provides the guidelines for the performance of competency evaluations conducted by the Health Department<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with respect to criminal cases. In pertinent part, it provides that \u201c[t]he court shall set and may change the conditions under which the examination is to be made.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-105(a)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article. Because this section allows the court to change the conditions of a competency evaluation, it follows that the court is free to accept the withdrawal of a request for such an evaluation. Additionally, we note that a trial court in another case has allowed the withdrawal of a request for a competency hearing and this Court did not question that decision. <em>See Peaks, </em>419 Md. at 247, 18 A.3d at 922 (citing the transcript of the lower court stating that the defense withdrew the right to contest the competency issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"> The second inquiry, whether Petitioner\u2019s withdrawal renders the issue of competency moot, is not so quickly answered. We shall hold that the issue of competency is moot so long as the trial judge did not have a bona fide doubt that Petitioner was competent based on evidence presented on the record. More specifically, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the Circuit Court\u2019s determination that the issue of competency was moot was in compliance with \u00a7 3-104(a), and that there was no bona fide doubt created by evidence on the record that Petitioner was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In the present case, the record demonstrates that Petitioner was afforded an opportunity to be heard, and there was sufficient evidence on the record for the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>discern Petitioner\u2019s competence. In <em>Roberts, </em>we held that under this third requirement, while a defendant need not be afforded a formal hearing, \u201can accused must be afforded an opportunity to present evidence upon which a valid determination can be made.\u201d 361 Md. at 356, 761 A.2d at 891. \u201cA judge with no jury present is not required to use any magic words to designate as a separate hearing the presentation to him of testimony and evidence for his determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial.\u201d <em>Peaks, </em>419 Md. at 252, 18 A.3d at 925. This opportunity was indeed afforded to Petitioner in the present case. The trial judge, upon defense counsel\u2019s motion, granted Wood\u2019s request for a competency evaluation and scheduled a hearing on the matter. As the trial judge explained, the court did all it could do in the present situation by \u201cma[king the evaluation] available to [Petitioner].\u201d It was Petitioner\u2019s explicit choice not to participate in the competency evaluation. Moreover, the trial judge scheduled a pretrial hearing on Petitioner\u2019s competency, thereby acting to ensure Petitioner had an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Additionally, the issue of Petitioner\u2019s competency was discussed at multiple pretrial hearings, which developed an adequate record on the issue. Although the legal analysis in the <em>Roberts </em>case informs this Court\u2019s judgment, the divergent facts shed light on why the cases\u2019 outcomes are different. In <em>Roberts, </em>the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a competency evaluation without a hearing on the matter and therefore never gave the accused an opportunity to be heard in order to develop evidence, on the record, of his competency. 361 Md. at 354-56, 761 A.2d at 890. Here, the trial court immediately granted the request and held several pretrial hearings in which Petitioner\u2019s competency was discussed. The trial judge in this case afforded Petitioner every opportunity to participate in an evaluation and to present additional evidence at one of the pretrial hearings. The State added, on the record, that, apart from any renewed request from Petitioner, it would raise the issue of competency if Petitioner acted abnormally at any of the later proceedings. At no time during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the proceedings did the State ask for a further evaluation of Petitioner\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Moreover, it is a reasonable inference that the trial judge gave credence to the fact that Petitioner\u2019s counsel ultimately withdrew his request for a competency evaluation. The United States Supreme Court has stated that defense counsel is often the person with the \u201cbest-informed view\u201d of his client\u2019s ability to participate in his own defense. <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 450, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 2580, 120 L.Ed.2d 353, 366 (1992); <em>see also Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 576, 586, 625 A.2d 932, 936 (1993) <em>(Thanos II) </em>(\u201cA lawyer who has been acquainted with a client for months will be much more familiar with the client\u2019s mental state than a judge who has just met the defendant at trial.\u201d). Because \u201cjudges must depend to some extent on counsel to bring issues into focus[,]\u201d <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 176-77, 95 S.Ct. at 906, 43 L.Ed.2d at 116, it is reasonable to conclude that the trial judge credited defense counsel\u2019s judgment to revoke his request for a competency evaluation as evidence in favor of a continued presumption of Petitioner\u2019s competence. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial judge complied with \u00a7 3-104(a). The withdrawal of Petitioner\u2019s request for an evaluation, under the circumstances, rendered the issue of competency moot and did not affect the presumption that Petitioner was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Second, there is no evidence that the trial judge had a bona fide doubt as to the question of Petitioner\u2019s competency. We hold that because there was compliance with \u00a7 3-104(a), the issue of competency was moot unless the trial judge or another party later had a basis to question Petitioner\u2019s competence to stand trial. The Supreme Court of the United States has held, and Maryland has adopted the rule, that where the evidence raises a \u201cbona fide doubt\u201d as to a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, the trial judge must <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue and make a competency determination based on evidence presented on the record. <em>Gregg, </em>377 Md. at 528, 833 A.2d at 1048 (citing <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>L.Ed.2d 815 (1966)); <em>see also Wolcott v. United States, </em>407 F.2d 1149, 1151 (10th Cir.1969) (\u201cIt is there said that if any information coming to the attention of the court raises a \u2018bona fide doubt\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s competency to waive his constitutional rights and plead or to stand trial, it then becomes the inescapable duty of the court to conduct a due process hearing to determine mental competency and to make appropriate findings thereon.\u201d). To be sure, a trial judge is \u201cpresumed to know the law and to apply it properly.\u201d <em>State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 179, 825 A.2d 452, 458 (2003). This presumption extends to the need for a competency determination in the instant case. In essence, even though the issue of competency was rendered moot by Petitioner\u2019s withdrawal of his request, the trial judge still had a duty to <em>sua sponte </em>evaluate Petitioner\u2019s competency if there was a bona fide doubt created by evidence on the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evidence relevant in determining whether there exists a bona fide doubt as to an accused\u2019s competence, includes \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial[.]\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>377 Md. at 528, 833 A.2d at 1048 (quoting <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. at 908, 43 L.Ed.2d at 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In the present case, the trial judge, presumably, was aware of his duty to raise the issue of Petitioner\u2019s competence <em>sua sponte </em>if evidence created a bona fide doubt. At oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ment, Petitioner\u2019s counsel asserted that the following evidence speaking to Petitioner\u2019s competence was present on the record: that Petitioner\u2019s counsel alleged his incompetence, Petitioner\u2019s history of psychiatric admissions, and his refusal to cooperate in the competency evaluation because \u201cpeople should not doubt his sanity.\u201d We do not believe that this information, without more, is sufficient to create a bona fide doubt in a trial judge\u2019s mind that Petitioner was competent to stand trial. We therefore affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court that the Circuit Court was not required to make a determination of competency in the present case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and further that the trial judge did not err in finding the issue moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We next visit the issue of whether the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that the Circuit Court properly denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a jury instruction on the defense of provocation. Because the evidence presented was not sufficient to establish adequate provocation to mitigate murder to manslaughter, we affirm the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment that the jury instruction request was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We review the decision for an abuse of discretion when considering a trial judge\u2019s denial of a proposed jury instruction. <em>Sidbury v. State, </em>414 Md. 180, 186, 994 A.2d 948, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>951 (2010). When deciding when a particular jury instruction is appropriate, a trial judge exercises discretion by assessing the evidence on the record and deciding whether it supports a particular legal principle or theory of a party. \u201cTherefore, the onus is on the trial judge to discern and ensure that the jury instructions encompass the substantive law applicable to the case. While we defer to the trial judge\u2019s ruling, an improper exercise of discretion may cause prejudice to a party and result in reversible error.\u201d <em>Collins v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>417 Md. 217, 228-29, 9 A.3d 56, 63 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Maryland Rule 4-325 codifies the requirements for instructions to the jury. Section (c) explains how they are given: \u201cThe court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d Md. Rule 4-325(c). This Court has interpreted Rule 4-325 as containing three components that must be met in order to include a proposed jury instruction in the ultimate charge to the jury: \u201c(1) the instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Dickey v. State, </em>404 Md. 187, 197-98, 946 A.2d 444, 450 (2008). The issue here involves the second component.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">When a defendant requests a particular jury instruction, this Court has held that a party need only produce \u201csome evidence\u201d to support such an instruction. <em>Bazzle v. State, </em>426 Md. 541, 551, 45 A.3d 166, 171 (2012). <em>\u201cSome evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says \u2014 \u2018some,\u2019 as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 or \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 or \u2018preponderance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251, 1257 (1990) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The next relevant inquiry is the proper standard for determining when the defense of provocation applies. This Court has delineated a four-part test: \u201c(1) There must have been adequate provocation; (2) The killing must have been in the heat of passion; (3) It must have been a sudden heat of passion \u2014 that is, the killing must have followed the provocation before there had been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool; (4) There must have been a causal connection between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act.\u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 582, 3 A.3d 1210, 1219 (2010) (quoting <em>Girouard v. State, </em>321 Md. 532, 539, 583 A.2d 718, 721 (1991)). A situation involving \u201cmutual combat\u201d is one instance in which this defense may be raised.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have explained this principle in the past:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">The rule of provocation will apply when persons enter into angry and unlawful combat with a mutual intent to fight and, as a result of the effect of the combat, the passion of one of the participants is suddenly elevated to the point where he resorts to the use of deadly force to kill the other solely because of an impulsive response to the passion and without time to consider the consequences of his actions.... Insulting words or gestures, no matter how opprobrious, do not amount to an affray, and standing alone, do not constitute adequate provocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 552, 573 A.2d 1317, 1322-23 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Although words alone can not amount to provocation, there is an exception to this general principle. Adequate provocation can be elicited from words \u201cif they are accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability on the part of the victim to cause the [defendant] bodily harm.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 567, 572 n. 3, 505 A.2d 545, 548 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>3 (1986). This is the language Petitioner relies upon to assert that \u201csome evidence\u201d existed to support a jury instruction on provocation. Respondent contends, however, that there is a complete lack of evidence to establish either a mutual affray or words and conduct sufficient to establish the defense. We agree with Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In his brief to this Court, Petitioner asserts that the following evidence supported such a jury instruction. Following a prior assault that did not involve Petitioner, the victim told medical personnel that he had a \u201chistory of aggressive behavior\u201d and had threatened others \u201cphysically or verbally\u201d when \u201chigh or drunk.\u201d A local grocer testified that the victim was not allowed in the store if he was intoxicated. A toxicology report showed that the victim tested positive for ethanol and other drugs. A friend testified that Petitioner told him that Petitioner and the victim had been drinking when they got into an argument over pills, during which Petitioner \u201csnapped\u201d and stabbed the victim. Petitioner allegedly told his mother that during his encounter with the victim, the victim made a derogatory comment about Petitioner\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">None of this amounts to \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting a defense of provocation. Very little is known about the events that transpired immediately preceding the death of the victim. Without evidence presented to develop what occurred between the victim and Petitioner, it is impossible for a jury to find that Petitioner was adequately provoked to kill the victim. There were only two witnesses to the altercation and the events leading up to it; one witness is deceased as a result of the attack, and the other witness is the Petitioner himself, who did not testify. What is known is that the victim was in poor physical health after having been \u201cvery badly beaten,\u201d and was presumably incapable of participating in a physical affray with Petitioner. Apparently, there was an argument between the two over pills and a derogatory comment was made by the victim about Petitioner\u2019s mother, but there is no evidence that either occurrence involved any physical act until the stabbing itself. Indeed, \u201c[ijnsulting words or gestures, no matter how opprobrious, do not amount to an affray, and standing alone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>do not constitute adequate provocation.\u201d <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 552, 573 A.2d at 1322-23. Even if the words were not isolated and there was a \u201cpresent intention and ability on the part of the victim to cause [Petitioner] bodily harm,\u201d there is no evidence on the record to support that notion. Additionally, as the intermediate appellate court pointed out, demonstrating that the victim had a history of becoming physical or abusive when drunk is not evidence that such conduct occurred in this particular instance. Quite simply, there is no evidence that Petitioner was adequately provoked by a sudden heat of passion that caused the death of the victim. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">HARRELL, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. We modify the questions presented for brevity and clarify. The original Petition for Writ of Certiorari presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">(1) Where Petitioner\u2019s counsel filed a written suggestion of incompetency to stand trial and requested a competency evaluation but subsequently withdrew the request for competency evaluation, with Petitioner\u2019s \"concurrence,\u201d was the trial court required to determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether Petitioner was competent to stand trial pursuant to Md.Code (2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article and/or as a matter of due process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(2) If the answer to the first question is affirmative, was the trial court required to explicitly state on the record its determination regarding Petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial or does an implicit determination suffice for purposes of compliance with Md.Code, Crim. Proc. Art. \u00a7 3-104(a) (2008 Repl. Vol.) and/or the requirements of due process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">(3) Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that an implicit determination suffices, did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the trial court \"implicitly determined\u201d that Petitioner was competent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">(4) Where there was some evidence that the victim had a history of being physically and verbally aggressive when \"drunk or high,\u201d that the victim was \"drunk or high\u201d when he was allegedly killed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Petitioner, that the victim and Petitioner got into an argument when he was killed, and that Petitioner \"snapped\u201d and then allegedly killed the victim, did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that an instruction on legally adequate provocation was not generated?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">. This statute was formerly Md.Code (1982, 1987 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 12-103 of the Health-General Article, and some of these cases interpret that prior codification. No substantive changes were made when the statute was recodified as \u00a7 3-104(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">.

The intermediate appellate court explained the difference between criminal responsibility and competency, and the important role of the judge in the latter determination: \u201d[I]t is important to keep in the front of the mind that competence to stand trial (or to waive counsel) is a very different thing than criminal responsibility. It is far more a matter of raw intelligence than it is of balanced psychiatric judgment or legal sanity or of mental health generally. Because of the very nature of the subject, it is one in which a defendant's conversation with a judge may be far more revealing than a defendant\u2019s conversation with a psychiatrist or psychologist. The judge both speaks the language and understands the language of courtroom behavior and courtroom problems, which may sometimes be largely a foreign tongue to the most educated of psychiatrists. The two disciplines are very different, and the professor who is, in effect, marking the defendant\u2019s paper needs to be a master of the appropriate discipline.\u201d <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 188, 259, 934 A.2d 1059, 1100-01 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. While we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, we do not submit to its reasoning. That court held that the trial judge implicitly determined that Petitioner was competent by accepting his withdrawal of the issue of competency, but we emphasize that the trial judge was not required to make that determination absent a bona fide doubt as to Petitioner's competency to stand trial. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no constitutional requirement that a defendant\u2019s competency be explicitly determined on the record, we submit that it may be practicable for the trial judge to have a brief colloquy with the defendant to eliminate any ambiguities in the competency determination. We request the Rules Committee to consider this matter and determine whether providing a brief list of questions for a trial judge to pose to a defendant whose competency has been questioned would prove useful and would close the door on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">. This Court has recognized certain situations in which this defense may be raised: \"mutual affray, assault and battery, discovering one's spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another, resisting an illegal arrest, witnessing, or being aware of, an act causing injury to a relative or third party, and anything the natural tendency of which is to produce passion in ordinary men and women.\u201d <em>Christian v. State, </em>405 Md. 306, 323, 951 A.2d 832, 842 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b326-7\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Akt\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">I dissent, with respect and some reluctance. In the ordinary case, when a litigant withdraws a motion generally, before it is acted upon finally, the objective of the motion is mooted and any appellate review and disposition is easypeasey. In our body of capital punishment jurisprudence, it is said sometimes that \u201cdeath is ... different\u201d <em>(see, e.g., Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 315, 768 A.2d 656, 665 (2001)), as a means to explain why the Court treats analytically an argument or situation differently than were it to arise in other legal contexts. I have come to believe that the same sentiment should apply to mental competency questions in our criminal justice scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In the present case, the trial judge was persuaded initially by the defense that the presumption of Wood\u2019s competency had been overcome necessarily when the judge ordered an in-custody competency evaluation of Wood by DHMH. Maj. op. at 281-82, 81 A.3d at 430. The predicate for that action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tendered by the defense to overcome the presumption was thin by any account, i.e., unparticularized prior admissions to psychiatric facilities and talking to Wood\u2019s mother about her son. <em>Id. </em>Learning thereafter, however, that Wood refused to cooperate in being evaluated by DHMH did not dissuade immediately defense counsel or the trial judge that the question of Wood\u2019s competency was behind them. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, as of the commencement of the hearing on 26 May 2011, during which the trial judge declared the matter moot based on nothing more than the naked request of defense counsel (and Wood) to withdraw the request for evaluation, there had been no: (1) further discussions with Wood\u2019s mother (which earlier conversations had formed some part of the basis for overcoming the presumption of competency); (2) consideration of at least trying to produce and examine (whether by the trial judge, DHMH, or someone at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital) any records of the prior admissions of Wood to psychiatric facilities; or (3) persevering to have Wood seen by the doctors at Clifton T. Perkins (which the judge indicated he intended to do, at the State\u2019s urging for an \u201cemergency evaluation\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 281-83, 81 A.3d at 430-31. I think that the Majority opinion lets the trial judge off too easily from the path that had been trodden partially in this case, in the context of mental competency considerations in criminal justice matters. Release from those duties imposed on the Bench by our prior cases (discussed in the Majority opinion) should not be granted merely because defense counsel succumbed to the perhaps misguided wishes of his client (a client of whom he had reason apparently to doubt his competency). Moreover, this state of affairs does not restore the presumption of competency on this record. Someone must be accountable to command potential available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>and relevant information to be adduced because the matter did not become moot merely because effectively Wood declared himself competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">I am troubled particularly with the Majority opinion\u2019s justification for excusing the judge from inquiring further (even in the face of the withdrawal of the motion) because there was no evidence before him from which he could have harbored a bona fide doubt as to Wood\u2019s competency. Maj. op. at 290-92, 81 A.3d at 435-36. The same \u201cevidence\u201d that persuaded the judge to order an evaluation in the first place (which necessarily meant the presumption of competency had been overcome in the judge\u2019s view) persisted. As noted, there seemed potentially fruitful areas of inquiry for other information (cataloged above) that went unexplored by the judge. Moreover, the judge did not articulate that or why he did not harbor a bona fide doubt. Rather, he moved on to a trial on the merits merely because defense counsel buckled in the face of his client\u2019s perhaps misguided wishes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Competency to aid in the defense of one\u2019s own criminal trial is too important to be tossed aside so lightly based on formulaic procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and order remand to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. I do agree, however, with the Majority opinion\u2019s analysis and holding on the jury instruction question. Maj. op. at 292-96, 81 A.3d at 436-39.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-5\">. Even an \"armchair psychiatrist,\u201d and in the absence of a readily available copy of the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), should appreciate that an individual\u2019s protestations of competency and decimation to be examined further on that score are not necessarily reliable indicators that he or she does not have a \u201cproblem\" in fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">.
