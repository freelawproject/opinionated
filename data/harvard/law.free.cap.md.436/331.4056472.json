HABC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">On January 10, 1989, Ellis was born. She first resided with her mother at 1004 North Washington Street. In 1989, Ellis and her mother moved to 2708 Giles Road. On September 10, 1990, Ellis and her mother moved to 26 South Exeter Street. All three properties were owned and operated by HABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On April 3, 1992, the University of Maryland Pediatric Ambulatory Center (\u201cthe University\u201d) tested Ellis\u2019s blood-lead level and reported 14 micrograms per deciliter (g,g/dL). In a letter to Ellis\u2019s mother dated June 9, 1992, the University stated: \u201cYour child recently was tested for lead. His/her lead level is <em>not </em>dangerously high. However, the results show that he/she may be at risk for high lead in the future. He/she should have her lead retested every 3-4 months.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On June 19, 1992, the University tested Ellis\u2019s blood-lead level and reported 12 pcg/dL. A University form signed by Dr. J. Rubin states that Ellis was seen on June 19, 1992, \u201cfor repeat lead testing (blood lead test was <em>lb </em>on 4/3/92)[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original). An HABC form entitled \u201cSummary of Interviews\u201d pertaining to Ellis\u2019s mother states that on June 24, 1992, HABC received a \u201cform letter from [the University], from Dr. Rubin ... regarding [Ellis]\u2019s test result. Dr. Rubin stated [Ellis]\u2019s level of 14 was an indication there was some exposure to lead, however, the level was not cause for treatment, only frequent testing.\u201d On April 27, 1993, Ellis and her mother moved to 725 George Street, which HABC owned and operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">On January 7, 2010 (approximately eighteen years after Ellis\u2019s first blood-lead level test occurred), in the circuit court, Ellis sued HABC<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for negligence and violations of the Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>land Consumer Protection Act arising out of Ellis\u2019s alleged exposure to lead paint at 1004 North Washington Street, 2708 Giles Road, 26 South Exeter Street, and 725 George Street.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">During discovery, HABC produced a \u201ctenant folder\u201d pertaining to Ellis\u2019s mother\u2019s tenancy at 26 South Exeter Street and 725 George Street, containing the form entitled \u201cSummary of Interviews.\u201d Nothing in the \u201ctenant folder,\u201d however, indicates that Ellis\u2019s mother complained of or expressed concern about the presence of lead paint in any of the premises occupied by Ellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On March 13, 2012, HABC moved for summary judgment, contending that Ellis failed to strictly or substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. HABC also argued that Ellis did not show good cause for her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. In an affidavit that was attached to the motion for summary judgment, William M. Peach III, Director of the Housing Management Administration at HABC, averred that he was \u201cnot aware of any written complaints, letters, notices or related documentation received from [ ] Ellis or anyone in her family prior to January 20, 2010 regarding her intention to bring a claim against [ ] HABC for alleged exposure to lead-based paint at the subject properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On April 23, 2012, the circuit court conducted a hearing and granted the motion for summary judgment, concluding that Ellis did not: (1) substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement; or (2) show good cause for her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. Ellis noted a timely appeal. On February 22, 2013, while the appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court granted <em>certiorari </em>on its initiative. <em>See Ellis v. Hous. Auth. of Balt. City, </em>430 Md. 344, 61 A.3d 18 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>B. <em>Johnson v. HABC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">On July 1, 1990, Johnson was born. Johnson first resided with her mother at 1620 Booker Court, which HABC owned and operated. In an affidavit dated March 13, 2012, Johnson\u2019s mother averred that, \u201cfrom 1990 through 1996[,]\u201d \u201cevery day for several hours at a time[,]\u201d Johnson visited her grandmother at 601 North Brice Street, which HABC owned and operated. In her affidavit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Johnson\u2019s mother averred that, when Johnson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">was approximately three[-]years[-]old[, Johnson\u2019s mother] noticed chipping paint at 1620 Booker Court.... [Johnson\u2019s mother] saw [Johnson] put paint in [her] mouth[]. [Johnson\u2019s mother] immediately complained to a housing manager of [HABC] about the chipping paint.... [Johnson\u2019s mother] told the [h]ousing [m]anager that [she] was concerned that the chipping paint ... contained lead and that [Johnson] had been exposed to lead when [she] put the paint in [her] mouth[]. [Johnson\u2019s mother] asked the [h]ousing [m]anager to come fix the deteriorated paint---[Johnson\u2019s mother] threatened to sue [HABC] if [HABC] did not fix the violations causing injuries to [Johnson].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">No one from any health clinic informed [Johnson\u2019s mother] that [ ] Johnson had any lead in her blood until she was seen at the Kennedy Krieger Institute ... in 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">In 2000[,] Kennedy Krieger Institute informed [Johnson\u2019s mother] that [ ] Johnson had suffered from elevated blood[-]lead levelsf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">On June 24, 2011, in the circuit court, Johnson sued HABC for negligence and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act arising out of Johnson\u2019s alleged exposure to lead paint at 1620 Booker Court and 601 North Brice Street.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>On March 1, 2012, HABC moved for summary judgment, contending that Johnson failed to substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. HABC also argued that Johnson did not show good cause for her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On April 23, 2012, the circuit court conducted a hearing and granted the motion for summary judgment, concluding that Johnson did not: (1) substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement; or (2) show good cause for her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. Johnson noted a timely appeal. On March 5, 2013, while the appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court granted <em>certiorari </em>on its own initiative. <em>See Johnson v. Hous. Auth. of Balt. City, </em>430 Md. 644, 62 A.3d 730 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in concluding that they did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. Specifically, Appellants argue that HABC had timely and presumed notice of their injuries because HABC was: (1) legally required to inspect properties for deteriorated lead paint; and (2) generally aware of the frequency of lead paint actions. Ellis asserts that HABC had actual notice of her claim because HABC received the results of her first blood-lead level test via Dr. Rubin\u2019s letter. Johnson maintains that HABC had notice of her claim because her mother orally complained timely to an HABC housing manager about chipping paint and threatened to sue HABC if it did not fix the chipping paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">HABC responds that the circuit court properly concluded that Appellants did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. Specifically, HABC contends that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>lacked notice of Ellis\u2019s claim because the results of Ellis\u2019s first blood-lead level test did not notify HABC of her intent to sue. HABC argues that it lacked notice of Johnson\u2019s claim because Johnson\u2019s mother\u2019s alleged complaint was oral.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Where there is no genuine dispute of material fact, an appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Koste v. Town of Oxford, </em>431 Md. 14, 25, 63 A.3d 582, 589 (2013) (\u201cIf no genuine dispute of material fact exists ... [t]he standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment on the law is <em>de novo[.]\u201d </em>(First alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a plaintiff substantially complied with the LGTCA notice requirement. <em>See generally Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 308, 808 A.2d 1262, 1278 (2002) (Applying a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, this Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and held that a plaintiff substantially complied with the LGTCA notice requirement.).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Under the LGTCA, \u201can action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government ... unless the notice of the claim ... is given within 180 days after the injury.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-304(b)(l). \u201cThe notice shall be in writing and shall state the time, place, and cause of the injury.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-304(b)(2). \u201c[T]he notice shall be given to the corporate authorities of the defendant local government.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-304(c)(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Even if a plaintiff does not strictly comply with the LGTCA notice requirement, a plaintiff substantially complies with the LGTCA notice requirement where: (1) the plaintiff makes \u201csome effort to provide the requisite notice\u201d; (2) the plaintiff does \u201cin fact\u201d give some kind of notice; (3) the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cprovides ... requisite and timely notice of facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim\u201d; and (4) the notice fulfills the LGTCA notice requirement\u2019s purpose, which is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">to apprise [the] local government of its possible liability at a time when [the local government] could conduct its own investigation, <em>i.e., </em>while the evidence was still fresh and the recollection of the witnesses was undiminished by time, sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and [the local government\u2019s] responsibility in connection with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 298-99, 808 A.2d at 1272-73 (ellipsis in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">For example, in <em>Faulk, id. </em>at 307-08, 808 A.2d at 1277, this Court held that the plaintiff substantially complied with the LGTCA notice requirement where, in a letter to a local government\u2019s insurer dated twelve days after his injury, the plaintiff provided \u201capparently sufficient information about [his injury] to enable a timely investigation to occur and notify[the insurer] that [the plaintiff] expected some type of compensation from [the local government] for his\u201d injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">By contrast, in <em>Halloran v. Montgomery Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Works, </em>185 Md.App. 171, 187-88, 968 A.2d 1104, 1114, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 Md. 48, 972 A.2d 861 (2009), the Court of Special Appeals held that a plaintiff did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement where the plaintiff mailed a letter to the \u201cHighway Maintenance\u201d division of a county\u2019s department of public works. In the letter, the plaintiff stated that she had been injured on a road, and demanded that the road be fixed. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 968 A.2d at 1114. In the letter, however, the plaintiff did not \u201cstate that she had a \u2018claim\u2019 against the [c]ounty[,]\u201d or \u201cthat the [c]ounty was responsible for damages resulting from\u201d her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 968 A.2d at 1114. Additionally, the plaintiff did not mail the letter to any \u201cother entity, particularly the county council, county law office, or \u2018corporate authority[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 968 A.2d at 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Here, we conclude that the circuit court properly concluded that Appellants did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A. <em>Ellis v. HABC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Ellis did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. HABC has no record of any complaint by Ellis or any of her family members regarding chipping, flaking or peeling lead paint. In fact, the record does not indicate that, before Ellis sued HABC, she or her mother ever contacted HABC about deteriorated paint conditions in any property, or that Ellis or her mother ever alleged that property owned or operated by HABC was the cause or source of Ellis\u2019s injury <em>(i.e., </em>Ellis\u2019s elevated blood-lead level).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A plaintiff does not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement where the plaintiff does not \u201cin fact\u201d give some kind of notice. <em>Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 299, 808 A.2d at 1272 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Our conclusion is unchanged by the circumstance that HABC received the results of Ellis\u2019s first blood-lead level test. Neither the test results themselves, nor the manner in which HABC received the test results, indicated that Ellis intended to sue HABC. A plaintiff does not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement where purported notice does not \u201capprise [the] local government of its possible liability[.]\u201d <em>Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 298, 808 A.2d at 1272 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The record does not reveal how HABC received the results of Ellis\u2019s first blood-lead level test. An HABC form entitled \u201cSummary of Interviews\u201d pertaining to Ellis\u2019s mother simply states: \u201cRec\u2019d form letter from [the University], from Dr. Rubin ... regarding [Ellis]\u2019s test result.\u201d Nowhere in the record is any indication that any member of Ellis\u2019s family sent or delivered the results of Ellis\u2019s first blood-lead level test to HABC. We do not decide whether Ellis would have substantially complied with the LGTCA notice requirement had the record clearly indicated that a member of Ellis\u2019s family sent or delivered the results of Ellis\u2019s first blood-lead level test\u2014 and/or any additional information \u2014 to HABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">B. <em>Johnson v. HABC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Johnson did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. It is true that, before Johnson sued HABC, Johnson\u2019s mother allegedly orally complained to an HABC housing manager about chipping paint and threatened to sue HABC if it did not fix the chipping paint. For two reasons, however, Johnson\u2019s mother\u2019s alleged oral complaint did not apprise HABC of its possible liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">First, Johnson\u2019s mother threatened to sue HABC if it did not fix the chipping paint; thus, Johnson\u2019s mother essentially advised that the threatened action against HABC would be a landlord-tenant action (in which Johnson\u2019s mother sought that HABC fix the chipping paint), not a lead paint action (in which Johnson sought damages for her alleged injury resulting from exposure to lead paint). Simply put, through her alleged oral complaint, Johnson\u2019s mother neither explicitly nor implicitly indicated that she intended to sue HABC regarding any injury. A plaintiff does not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement where the plaintiff demands that a local government fix a defect, but neither explicitly nor implicitly indicates that the plaintiff intends to sue the local government regarding an injury resulting from the defect<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Halloran, </em>185 Md.App. at 187, 968 A.2d at 1114 (The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Special Appeals held that a plaintiff did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement where the plaintiff demanded that a county\u2019s department of public works fix a road\u2019s defect, but did not explicitly or implicitly indicate that the plaintiff intended to sue the county for her injury resulting from the road\u2019s defect.).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Second, Johnson\u2019s mother did not learn of Johnson\u2019s injury <em>(i.e., </em>Johnson\u2019s elevated blood-lead level) until approximately six or seven years after her oral complaint; thus \u2014 in addition to Johnson\u2019s mother\u2019s failure to give notice of an intent to initiate a lead paint action \u2014 at the time of Johnson\u2019s mother\u2019s oral complaint, it was not possible for Johnson\u2019s mother to give notice of an injury allegedly caused by HABC.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>C. <em>Ellis v. HABC &amp; Johnson v. HABC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">We reject Appellants\u2019 contention that HABC had notice of their injuries because HABC was legally required to inspect properties for deteriorated lead paint and generally aware of the frequency of lead paint actions involving older rental dwellings in Baltimore City. A plaintiff does not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement where the plaintiff does not \u201cin fact\u201d give some kind of notice. <em>Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 299, 808 A.2d at 1272 (citation omitted). Thus, commonsensieally, a plaintiff does not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement simply by virtue of the circumstance that: (1) a local government is legally required to inspect for a potential source of injury; and/or (2) the local government is generally aware of the frequency of the type of action that the plaintiff plans to initiate. Essentially, Appellants ask us to except lead paint actions from the LGTCA notice requirement; however, the right to decide to except lead paint actions from the LGTCA notice requirement belongs to the General Assembly, not the Judiciary. <em>See Rios v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>386 Md. 104, 137, 872 A.2d 1, 20 (2005) (\u201c[C]raft[ing] an addendum to the LGTCA ... is the prerogative of the General Assembly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">For the above reasons, we hold that the circuit court properly concluded that Appellants did not substantially comply with the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Appellants contend that the circuit court abused its discretion in concluding that Appellants did not show good cause for their failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. Specifically, Appellants argue that they showed good cause for their failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement because they were minors at the time of their injuries, and because HABC was: (1) legally required to inspect properties for deteriorated lead paint; and (2) generally aware of the frequency of lead paint actions. Ellis asserts that she showed good cause for her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>requirement because HABC received the results of her first blood-lead level test. Johnson maintains that she showed good cause for her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement because her mother orally complained to an HABC housing manager about chipping paint and threatened to sue HABC if it did not fix the chipping paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">HABC responds that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Appellants failed to show good cause for their failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. Specifically, HABC contends that Appellants did not show good cause for their failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement because Appellants\u2019 mothers did not diligently prosecute their claims while Appellants were minors. HABC argues that minority does not <em>per se </em>constitute good cause for failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">An appellate court reviews for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a plaintiff showed good cause for the plaintiffs failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. <em>See generally Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v.

In both cases, the plaintiffs communicated with a government contractor that provided \u201cclaims administration services\u201d to the local government. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 807 A.2d at 635.

As early as 1992, Ellis\u2019s mother knew that Ellis\u2019s blood-lead level was 14 |xg/dL. However, the record does not indicate that Ellis or her mother took any action regarding Ellis\u2019s potential claim until 2010, when Ellis sued HABC.

As the circuit court noted, Johnson\u2019s mother did not \u201cbecome aware of [Johnson\u2019s] elevated blood[-lead] level until 2000.\u201d The record does not indicate that Johnson or her mother took any action regarding Johnson\u2019s potential claim between 2000 and 2011, when Johnson sued HABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Our conclusion is unchanged by the circumstance that, in either 1993 or 1994, Johnson\u2019s mother allegedly orally com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>plained to an HABC housing manager about chipping paint and threatened to sue HABC if it did not fix the chipping paint. Until 2000 (when Johnson\u2019s mother learned of Johnson\u2019s elevated blood-lead level), Johnson\u2019s mother did not know that Johnson had an injury that had been caused by exposure to lead paint, and thus had a potential claim against HABC; at the time of Johnson\u2019s mother\u2019s oral complaint, it was not possible for Johnson\u2019s mother to prosecute a lead paint claim on Johnson\u2019s behalf at all. Upon learning of Johnson\u2019s elevated blood-lead level in 2000, Johnson\u2019s mother failed to give notice to HABC pursuant to the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">C. <em>Ellis v.

A plaintiff does not <em>per se </em>show good cause for his or her failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement because the plaintiff is a minor at the time of the injury. <em>See Rios, </em>386 Md. at 144, 872 A.2d at 24 (\u201c[Mjinority does not constitute good cause <em>per </em>se[.]\u201d).

Specifically, Appellants argue that HABC\u2019s operation of public housing is a proprietary \u2014 as opposed to governmental \u2014 activity because HABC acts like a private landlord. Appellants assert that the LGTCA notice requirement\u2019s restriction upon a minor\u2019s access to the courts is unreasonable because the minor is dependent on a parent or guardian to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">HABC responds that, as applied to a minor plaintiff in a lead paint action against HABC, the LGTCA notice requirement does not violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Specifically, HABC contends that HABC\u2019s operation of public housing is a governmental \u2014 as opposed to proprietary \u2014 activity because, by statute, HABC\u2019s purpose is to promote the welfare of the whole public. Alternatively, HABC argues that, even if its operation of public housing is a proprietary activity, the LGTCA notice requirement\u2019s restriction upon a minor\u2019s access to the courts is reasonable because the LGTCA notice requirement is not unduly burdensome.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a law is constitutional. <em>See Neustadter v.

Before the General Assembly enacted the LGTCA, local governments were immune from liability for torts that arose out of governmental \u2014 as opposed to proprietary \u2014 activities; however, through the LGTCA, the General Assembly waived such local governmental immunity. <em>See id. </em>at 125, 872 A.2d at 13 (\u201c[P]rior to the enactment of the LGTCA, local governments enjoyed immunity from tort liability only with respect to ... activity classified as governmental....

(2006) (\u201cHCD\u201d) \u00a7 15-104(1) (emphasis added). Second, HABC\u2019s operation of public housing is sanctioned by legislative authority. <em>See </em>HCD \u00a7 12-502(b)(6) (\u201cA[housing] authority may ... carry out the purposes of the [housing] authority.\u201d); HCD \u00a7\u00a7 15-103(5), 15-103(1) (HABC\u2019s purpose is \u201cto remedy\u201d the \u201cshortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing\u201d in Baltimore City.). Third, HABC\u2019s operation of public housing tends to benefit the public health and promote the welfare of the whole public. <em>See </em>HCD \u00a7\u00a7 15-103(2), 15-103(3) (\u201c[0]vercrowded and congested housing [and tenants\u2019] payfing] too much of their income for shelter\u201d \u201crequire too much public money to be spent for public health and safety, fire and accident protection, crime prevention and punishment, and other public services and facilities[.]\u201d). Fourth, HABC\u2019s operation of public housing does not cause profit or emolument to inure to HABC. <em>See </em>HCD \u00a7 12-401(a)(2) (\u201c[A housing] authority ... may not operate for profit or as a source of revenue to the political subdivision.\u201d).

In <em>Reed, id. </em>at 118, 188 A. at 16, this Court held that a local government engaged in a proprietary activity where it operated a market because the local government \u201cderiv[ed] revenue\u201d from the market by renting the market\u2019s stalls. <em>Reed, id. </em>at 118, 188 A. at 16, does not apply where (as here) a local government cannot profit from an activity. <em>See </em>HCD \u00a7 12-401(a)(2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We reject Appellants\u2019 contention, made at oral argument, that a lead paint action arises out of a proprietary activity\u2014 namely, HABC\u2019s compliance with its legal requirement to inspect properties for deteriorated lead paint. HABC\u2019s compliance with its legal requirement to inspect properties for deteriorated lead paint is part and parcel of HABC\u2019s operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>of public housing. As discussed above, HABC\u2019s operation of public housing is a governmental activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We are unpersuaded by the cases from other jurisdictions on which Appellants rely. For example, in <em>Hous. Auth. of City of Providence v. Oropeza, 713 </em>A.2d 1262, 1264, 1268 (R.I.1998), the Supreme Court of Rhode Island held that providing security in public housing is a proprietary activity because \u201cthe activity [at issue] was one that a private person or corporation would be likely to carry out.\u201d (Alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast to housing authorities in Rhode Island, HABC does what private enterprise has failed to do. <em>See </em>HCD \u00a7 15-103(4) (\u201c[T]he shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing cannot be wholly relieved through private enterprise^]\u201d). Similarly, in <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Hampton Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., </em>217 Va. 30, 225 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1976), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that operation of public housing is a proprietary activity because: (1) \u201cthe [housing authority assumes the role ordinarily occupied by a private landlord\u201d; (2) \u201cthe [housing authority ... performs functions which could as well be performed by private enterprise\u201d; (3) operation of public housing \u201cin[ ]ures to the benefit of a few rather than to \u2018the common good of all\u2019 \u201d; and (4) \u201cthe necessity for the service bears only incidental relation to the protection of the life, health, property, and peace of the citizens of the whole municipality where the service is performed.\u201d (Citations omitted). In contrast to housing authorities in Virginia, HABC: (1) does not occupy a private landlord\u2019s role, as HABC \u201cmay not operate for profit or as a source of revenue[,]\u201d HCD \u00a7 12-401(a)(2); (2) does what private enterprise has failed to do, <em>see </em>HCD \u00a7 15-103(4) (\u201c[T]he shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing cannot be wholly relieved through private enterprise[.]\u201d); and (3) benefits the common good of all and protects the life, health, property, and peace of the citizens throughout the whole of the municipality by reducing the amount of \u201cpublic money ... spent for public health and safety, fire and accident protection, crime prevention and punishment, and other public services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>and facilities[.]\u201d HCD \u00a7 15-103(3).

Housing Authority of Baltimore City </em>that Brittany Ellis (Brittany) failed to prove substantial compliance with the notice requirements of the Local Government Tort Claims Acts (LGTCA) and also failed to prove good cause for not complying with the notice requirements, but I write separately to state that <em>if </em>reliance had been proven on a notice provided by the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (the Notice), which was attached as an exhibit to Brittany\u2019s Opposition to the Housing Authority of Baltimore City\u2019s (HABC) motion for summary judgment, I may have come to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The Notice was what Brittany\u2019s Opposition referenced as \u201cHABC[\u2019s] form warning of dangers of lead\u201d signed by Carrie Ellis (Ms. Ellis), Brittany\u2019s mother, on April 27, 1993,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>directs a parent to inform the Housing Authority in the event of chipping, flaking, or peeling paint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">You should notify the Housing Authority and/or the landlord immediately if the unit in which you live has flaking, chipping or peeling paint, water leaks from faulty plumbing or defective roofs. You should cooperate with the Housing Authority and/or landlord\u2019s efforts to repair any deficiencies and keep your unit in good shape. Don\u2019t attempt any abatement work yourself. Scraping or sanding can create dust which could result in a greater risk of exposure. The use of heat or paint removers could create a vapor or fume which may cause poisoning if inhaled over a long period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">Whenever possible, the removal of lead-based paint should take place when there are no children and pregnant women on the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">Since your child can acquire lead paint from sources other than your home, you should continue to watch out for symptoms of lead poisoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\n<em>YOUR ATTENTION TO POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN MINIMIZE EXPOSURE RISK</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoU\">Remember that you as a parent play a major role in the prevention of lead poisoning. Your actions and awareness about the lead problem can make a big difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">(emphasis in original). In the Circuit Court or this Court, Brittany did not allege that Ms. Ellis detrimentally relied on the Notice by only informing, through Brittany\u2019s doctor, the HABC of a potential lead issue, rather than complying with the notice requirements of the LGTCA, and therefore, I agree with the majority\u2019s assessment that Brittany did not substantially comply with the notice requirements of Section 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In raising this issue, I am concerned that the Housing Authority provided direction to tenants to respond in a specific manner to chipping, flaking, and peeling paint, omitting any reference to the requirements of the LGTCA. While our jurisprudence has not previously addressed the issue of whether a claimant can substantially comply with the notice requirements of the LGTCA when the local government provides written direction to the claimant to act in a manner different from those requirements, many of our sister courts have opined that the local government is estopped from asserting improper notice of claim as a defense under their respective Tort Claims Acts under similar circumstances. <em>Cf., e.g., City of Montgomery v. Weldon, </em>280 Ala. 463, 195 So.2d 110, 111 (1967) (opining that the city of Montgomery was estopped from asserting improper notice of claim as a defense pursuant to former Title 37, Section 504, Alabama Code 1940<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when a city official assured the plaintiff that he had \u201cdone all necessary to perfect and complete the claim\u201d and the claimant relied on the official\u2019s statement in not further pursuing the claim); <em>Dambro v. Union County Park Comm\u2019n, </em>130 N.J.Super. 450, 327 A.2d 466, 471 (1974) (concluding that a municipal corporation, Watchung, was estopped from asserting improper notice of claim as a defense under the notice provisions of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, Section 59:8 of the New Jersey Statutes Annotated [1972],<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when the plaintiff relied on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>statement by Watchung\u2019s tax assessor that improperly informed the plaintiff which entity was to be served).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Good cause to waive the notice requirements also may have existed. To determine good cause, we consider \u201cwhether the claimant prosecuted his claim with that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Rios v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>386 Md. 104, 141, 872 A.2d 1, 22 (2005) (citation and quotations omitted). We have previously opined that good cause exists when a government agent makes representations that a claimant reasonably relies on in not complying with the notice requirements and the local government is otherwise appraised with \u201csufficient information to permit it to make an investigation in due time sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it.\u201d <em>See Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 179-80, 807 A.2d 632, 647 (2002), quoting <em>Grubbs v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>267 Md. 318, 321, 297 A.2d 754, 756 (1972) (opining that good cause existed to excuse two claimants\u2019 failure to comply with the notice requirements when the claimants notified the county\u2019s independent contractor of their claims, which held itself out as the \u201cclaims administrator\u201d and communicated with the parties regarding their claims). Similar to <em>Moore, </em>an ordinarily prudent person, relying on the representation made in the Notice provided by the HABC that a tenant should \u201cinform the Housing Authority\u201d of lead paint issues could reasonably determine that the only measure necessary to protect her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>rights after observing a potential lead hazard in her home is to so inform the HABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The absence of proof of reliance, however, leads me to concur in the opinion in Brittany\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Judge ADKINS has authorized me to state that she joins this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">.
