Brian Kavanagh and Jeffrey Weber (collectively \u201cRespondents\u201d) were employed by American as co-branch managers operating an office located at 9500 Harford Road, Baltimore, as well as originating residential mortgage loans. Respondents executed similar \u201cCo-Branch Manager Employment Agreement^]\u201d with American, which, in relevant part, provided that American was to establish a \u201closs reserve\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> account \u201cfunded with funds earned by the Employee.\u201d The amount to be deposited into this account was one-tenth of one percent \u201con all loan transactions\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and would \u201cbe used by [American] to pay any losses incurred by [American] with respect to the Branch Office\u201d managed by Respondents. The agreements further provided that six months after termination of the agreements, Respondents were to be paid, \u201cas a bonus,\u201d twenty-five percent of what remained in the loss reserve and on the one-year anniversary of the termination, fifty-percent of what remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Respondents\u2019 employment agreements each contained an arbitration clause, which, in relevant part, provided: \u201cAny controversy or claim, other than petitions for equitable relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach hereof (including arbitrability of any controversy or claim), shall be settled by arbitration, in Bethesda, Maryland and in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Respondents terminated their employment agreements with American, but American allegedly failed to pay Respondents the funds due them from the loss reserve in accordance with the terms of their employment agreements. Respondents filed a \u201cComplaint for Accounting\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against American, after allegedly having \u201cmade numerous proper requests for statements and supporting documentation for the expenses, losses and/or any other monetary transaction that has contributed to the Loss Reserve Account for the period of [Respondents\u2019] employment\u201d, believing that the amount due them was approximately $250,000. Respondents, accordingly, demanded that \u201cAmerican be ordered by a decree of this Court to fully and completely account for all sums due [Respondents] in accordance with each [Respondent\u2019s] Co-Branch Manager Agreement, specifically the Loss Reserve Account\u201d and requested such \u201cfurther relief as this Court finds just and equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">American filed an Answer to Respondents\u2019 Complaint, generally denying many of Respondents\u2019 averments, specifically denying others, and asserting the affirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction and payment, as well as the \u201cPreliminary Defense\u201d that \u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case because [Respondents\u2019] claims are subject to mandatory arbitration agreements set forth in the ... Employment Agreements.\u201d The circuit court set deadlines that included one in which to file motions to dismiss within two weeks; it was within that deadline that American filed a \u201cPetition to Compel Arbitration and Stay All Proceedings and Request for Hearing,\u201d asserting that, because Respondents\u2019 claims arose out of their employment agreements, the court was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to compel arbitration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondents, in response, filed an Answer to American\u2019s \u201cPetition to Compel Arbitration and Stay All Proceedings and Request for Hearing,\u201d arguing that their request for accounting was \u201ca matter reserved for equity jurisdiction\u201d and, therefore, their claim was not subject to arbitration under the terms of the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Judge John Turnbull, II denied American\u2019s \u201cPetition to Compel Arbitration and Stay All Proceedings and Request for Hearing,\u201d without a hearing, by Order that, in its entirety, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">Upon consideration of Plaintiffs Answer to Defendant\u2019s Petition to Compel Arbitration and Stay All Proceedings and Request for Hearing in the above referenced matter, it is on this 27th day of May, 2011, hereby:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s Petition to Compel Arbitration and Stay All Proceedings and Request for Hearing is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">American, then, filed a Notice of Appeal, which stated that \u201cAmerican Bank Holdings, Inc. hereby notes an appeal ... to the Court of Special Appeals including but not limited to an appeal of the Court\u2019s May 27,2011 Order denying Defendant\u2019s Petition to Compel Arbitration and Stay All Proceedings ... in the action.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The intermediate appellate court dismissed American\u2019s appeal, in an unreported opinion, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he denial of appellant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration is not final for the purposes of \u00a7 12 \u2014 301[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] [of the Courts and Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.) ].... In fact, the order was meant to keep the parties <em>in </em>court, not put them out of court.\u201d (emphasis in original). We granted American\u2019s Petition for Certiorari, <em>American Bank Holdings v. Kavanagh, </em>430 Md. 644, 62 A.3d 730 (2013), to consider whether, \u201cthe denial of a motion to compel arbitration constitutes a final judgment under \u00a7 12-301 if a substantively equivalent petition could have been filed as a separate and independent action under \u00a7 3-207[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] [of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.) ]?\u201d To explore this question we turn to the principles of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil case by a circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Except as provided in \u00a7 12-302[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law. In a criminal case, the defendant may appeal even though imposition or execution of sentence has been suspended. In a civil case, a plaintiff who has accepted a remittitur may cross-appeal from the final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">A \u201cfinal judgment\u201d is defined as \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal, application for leave to appeal, or petition for certiorari may be taken.\u201d Section 12-101(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We have taken on the task to further refine just what constitutes a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d <em>See Brewster v. Woodhaven Bldg. &amp; Dev., Inc., </em>360 Md. 602, 609-10 n. 1, 759 A.2d 738, 742 n. 1 (2000); <em>Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams Football Co., </em>284 Md. 86, 91, 394 A.2d 801, 804 (1978). In so doing, we have determined that a ruling of the circuit court, to constitute a final judgment, must be an \u201cunqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy,\u201d <em>Gruber v. Gruber, </em>369 Md. 540, 546, 801 A.2d 1013, 1016 (2002) (quotation omitted), which decides and concludes the rights of the parties involved or denies a party the means of further prosecuting or defending rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding. <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli </em>389 Md. 315, 324, 884 A.2d 1215, 1219-20 (2005). An order that has the effect of putting a party out of court is a final judgment, while an order that does not prevent a party from further prosecuting or defending rights is not a final judgment. <em>Brewster, </em>360 Md. at 611-13, 759 A.2d at 742-43; <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach v. Pessoa Constr. Co., Inc., </em>330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Md. 744, 750-51, 625 A.2d 1014, 1017 (1993); <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 401-02, 620 A.2d 305, 310 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The requirement that an order, to be a final judgment, must put a party out of court or otherwise terminate the proceedings has deep historical roots in Maryland, as Judge Irma Raker explained in <em>Brewster:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Our cases pertaining to this question show that an order is final if it terminates the litigation in a particular court. The cases stating the general rule that a judgment terminating litigation is a final judgment date from an early period. As early as 1835, we were already referring to the \u201cwell established rule\u201d that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">no appeal can be prosecuted in this Court, until a decision has been had in the Court below, which is so far final, as to settle, and conclude the rights of the party involved in the action, or denying to the party the means of further prosecuting or defending the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\"><em>Boteler &amp; Belt v. State ex rel. Chew &amp; Co., </em>7 G. &amp; J. 109, 112-13 (Md.1835). Thus, it is well settled that an order denying a party the ability to pursue claims anywhere is an immediately appealable final order. We have often reiterated this point, applying it over an extraordinarily long historical period and an impressively wide range of subject mat<em>ter____Peat &amp; Co. v.

Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019shp, </em>346 Md. 122, 126 n. 5, 695 A.2d 153, 155 n. 5 (1997), citing <em>Litton Bionetics, Inc. v. Glen Constr. Co., </em>292 Md. 34, 437 A.2d 208 (1981). In the present case, however, the appealability of an order denying a petition to compel arbitration filed in a case that is extant is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The denial of petitions to compel arbitration filed in existing actions has been the subject of two of our recent opinions, <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 983 A.2d 138 (2009) and <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Services, LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 989 A.2d 210 (2010), which Respondents argue are dispositive of the instant action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In <em>Addison, </em>FutureCare-Lochearn, Inc., a nursing home, sued Beulah Addison for breach of contract, alleging that she was delinquent in paying for nursing home care and services. Ms. Addison counterclaimed, alleging she was unable to pay because a FutureCare employee embroiled her in a real estate scam, depriving her of equity in her former home and, thus, prevented her from paying the bill. FutureCare responded by filing an Answer generally denying liability, as well as a \u201cMotion to Compel Arbitration of Counterclaims, Motion to Stay, and Request for Attorney\u2019s Fees,\u201d asserting that Ms. Addison had signed a \u201cResident and Facility Arbitration Agreement,\u201d requiring the submission of her counterclaims to arbitration. <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 258, 983 A.2d at 142. FutureCare\u2019s motion was denied after a hearing and the circuit court refused to certify the order denying FutureCare\u2019s motion as final under Rule 2-602(b); FutureCare appealed, nevertheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Ms. Addison, in response, filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss the Interlocutory Appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 983 A.2d at 143. The Chief Judge of the intermediate appellate court denied Ms. Addison\u2019s motion to dismiss and after oral argument a panel of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>intermediate appellate court, upon FutureCare\u2019s request, certified the denial of the motion to compel arbitration as a final judgment under Rule 8-602(e) and reversed the decision of the circuit court denying that motion. Ms. Addison petitioned for certiorari and initially presented the question of whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in compelling arbitration of her counterclaims<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; after oral argument, \u201cwe requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs and to argue an additional issue,\u201d which was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">Assuming that the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and to stay the judicial proceedings in the present case is not appealable as a final judgment, does Section 12-303(3)(ix) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article permit an appeal as an appealable interlocutory order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 261, 983 A.2d at 144 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We initially determined that the Court of Special Appeals erred in certifying the circuit court\u2019s decision as a final judgment under Rule 8-602, when the trial court was asked to certify that same order as final pursuant to Rule 2-602, but declined to do so. We turned, then, to whether the order denying FutureCare\u2019s motion to compel arbitration filed in an existing action was appealable under Section 12-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article or under the collateral order doctrine, answering both questions in the negative. <em>Addison, </em>however, is not dispositive of the issue presented in the instant case because we operated under the assumption that the order denying FutureCare\u2019s motion to compel arbitration was not a final judgment under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which now is directly presented in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Shortly after deciding <em>Addison, </em>in <em>Case </em>Handyman,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we addressed the question of whether an appellate court could certify as a final judgment, pursuant to Rule 8-602, an order denying a motion to compel arbitration filed in an existing action when the trial court was not petitioned to certify that order as final under Rule 2-602. In the case, the Schueles entered into a home improvement contract with a franchisee of Case Handyman and, after months passed without work commencing, eventually filed a class action suit against Case Handyman alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of contract and fraud. Case Handyman, in response, filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings,\u201d which was initially granted, but the order granting the motion was later stricken. <em>Case Handyman, </em>412 Md. at 562, 989 A.2d at 214. Case Handyman noted an immediate appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the circuit court\u2019s denial of Case Handyman\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. The Schueles petitioned for a writ of certiorari presenting three questions relating to the merits of the case,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but because we had issued our decision in <em>Addison, </em>after oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>argument in the case, \u201c[w]e requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs to the Court to address whether <em>Addison </em>was dispositive of the jurisdictional issue....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 n. 5, 989 A.2d at 215 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We concluded, after supplemental briefing, that although Case Handyman had not requested that the circuit court certify its order denying its motion to compel arbitration filed in an existing action as final under Rule 2-602, as had the moving party in <em>Addison, </em>we could not so certify that order as final, under Rule 8-602, because, in order to do so, the order must be \u201cfinal in the traditional sense,\u201d which we opined is not the case with an order denying a motion to compel arbitration filed in an existing action, because the case remained in court as a result. <em>Id. </em>at 570-72, 989 A.2d at 215-16. Although the <em>Case Handyman </em>analysis is suggestive of the result in the present case, it is not dispositive, because the certification issue was evocative of the holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In the present case we are squarely presented with whether a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion or petition to compel arbitration filed in an existing action is a final judgment and, therefore, immediately appealable, without regard to certification by a trial or appellate court. American argues that an order denying its petition to compel arbitration is an appeal-able final judgment regardless of whether it was filed as an independent action or filed in an existing action.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In order to address this issue, we turn to the provisions of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d), enacted in 1965. Enactment of MUAA was intended to eviscerate the \u201cwell-established\u201d common law rule that \u201cunless an agreement to arbitrate has been consummated by an award, it will not bar a suit at law or in equity with respect to the question agreed to be arbitrated.\u201d <em>Tomlinson v. Dille, </em>147 Md. 161, 167, 127 A. 746, 748 (1925) (citation omitted). MUAA\u2019s purpose was \u201cto provide for enforcement of written agreements to submit existing and future controversies to arbitration, to provide for court proceedings to compel or stay arbitration pursuant to written agreements,\u201d and \u201cto provide procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>by which arbitration may be had\u201d in Maryland. 1965 Maryland Laws, Chapter 281. MUAA was codified as Sections 1 through 23 of Article 7, Maryland Code (1957,1968 Repl. Vol.). The only provisions with which we are concerned in Section 18 are (a)(1) and (b), which permitted an appeal to be taken from an order denying an application to compel arbitration only \u201cin the manner and to the same extent\u201d as other final judgments in civil actions. Section 18 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">(a) An appeal may be taken from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">(1) An order denying an application to compel arbitration made under \u00a7 2[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>(2) An order granting an application to stay arbitration made under \u00a7 2(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">(4) An order modifying or correcting an award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">(5) An order vacating an award without directing a rehearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">(6) A judgment or decree entered pursuant to the provisions of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">(b) The appeal shall be taken in the manner and to the same extent as from orders or judgments in a civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl.

No substantive changes were intended during the recodification process, with respect to MUAA, as was elucidated in one of the reports issued by the Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code of Maryland analyzing the recodification of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">[S]ubtitle [2 of Title 3 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] contains provisions of the Uniform Arbitration Act which was approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the American Bar Association in 1955.

American\u2019s argument misses the mark, however, because under former Section 18(b) of Article 7, Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl. Vol.), an appeal from an order denying an application to compel arbitration could be taken only \u201cin the manner and to the same extent as from orders or judgments in a civil action\u201d, which anticipated, then, only final judgments, i.e., those that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>terminated judicial proceedings. <em>See generally Brewster, </em>360 Md. at 611, 759 A.2d at 742 (explaining that the final judgment rule was \u201cwell established\u201d as early as 1835). The denial of American\u2019s petition to compel arbitration filed in an existing action, thus, is not immediately appealable as a final judgment, because that denial did not put the parties out of court by terminating the proceedings. The parties, here, remained in court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Our analysis is in accord with the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Joseph F. Trionfo &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Ernest B. LaRosa &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>38 Md.App. 598, 381 A.2d 727 (1978). In that case, decided before the merger of courts of law and equity, Trionfo &amp; Sons, a general contractor, and LaRosa <em>&amp; </em>Sons, a subcontractor, entered into a contract which, allegedly, contained a provision requiring the arbitration of any dispute between the parties by an architect. <em>Trionfo &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>38 Md.App. at 600-02, 601 n. 2, 381 A.2d at 729-30, 729 n. 2. LaRosa &amp; Sons, after a dispute arose regarding payment under the terms of the contract, filed an action at law in the circuit court alleging breach of contract. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03, 381 A.2d at 730. Trionfo &amp; Sons responded by filing a \u201cMotion Raising Preliminary Objection or in the Alternative to Order Arbitration and Stay These Proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 381 A.2d at 730. The circuit court denied Trionfo &amp; Sons\u2019s motion concluding \u201cessentially that\u201d: \u201cthe main contract provision in question was not an arbitration clause\u201d; \u201c[a]n architect was not a private, impartial third-party, and could not properly be designated an arbitrator\u201d; and \u201c[t]he decision of the architect was not deemed to be \u2018final,\u2019 and could not be considered a binding arbitration award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 381 A.2d at 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The case proceeded to trial, with \u201cno further steps being taken\u201d by Trionfo <em>&amp; </em>Sons \u201cto compel arbitration of the dispute,\u201d and a verdict was returned in favor of LaRosa <em>&amp; </em>Sons. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 381 A.2d at 731. Trionfo <em>&amp; </em>Sons appealed, presenting the question of whether the circuit court erred \u201cin failing to grant [Appellant\u2019s] Motion Raising Preliminary Objection, and order arbitration in these proceedings?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 381 A.2d at 731 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">After disposing of Trionfo &amp; Sons\u2019s argument on the merits, the Court of Special Appeals turned to the issue of whether Trionfo &amp; Sons \u201cwaived, or should be estopped from asserting, a right to arbitration, because its motion raising a preliminary objection did not comport with the prescribed statutory procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 381 A.2d at 733. The Court of Special Appeals explained that \u201c[t]he proper procedure would have been to file a petition on the equity side of the court to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>arbitration\u201d in a separate and independent proceeding, <em>see id. </em>at 604 n. 6, 381 A.2d at 731 n. 6, citing Section 3-207 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974), and had Trionfo <em>&amp; </em>Sons followed the proper procedure, the order denying its petition would have been appealable as a final judgment under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974). <em>See id. </em>at 609, 609 n. 9, 381 A.2d at 733-34, 734 n. 9. The failure to file its request to compel arbitration in a separate and independent proceeding, however, precluded Trionfo &amp; Sons from immediately appealing the denial of its request to compel arbitration: \u201cIn resorting to a motion raising preliminary objection, appellant precluded itself from obtaining a pretrial appellate determination as to the existence of the arbitration agreement, since the court\u2019s denial of the motion was interlocutory in nature, and not a final order under Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-301 (1974).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609-10, 381 A.2d at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><em>Trionfo </em>is distinguished by American as unreliable, because the case was decided before the merger of actions in law and equity in 1984. In so doing, American fails to cite another of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinions, that of <em>Regina Construction Corp. v. Envirmech Contracting Corp., </em>80 Md.App. 662, 565 A.2d 693 (1989), which has not been cited in any forum for the proposition that an order denying a petition to compel arbitration filed in an existing action is immediately appealable as a final judgment. In <em>Regina, </em>Envirmech sued Regina Construction and Regina moved to dismiss, because Envirmech had \u201c \u2018failed to take any step to resolve this case by Arbitration, as provided in the contract between the parties\u2019 and that the court therefore \u2018does not have any jurisdiction over this case----\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663-64, 565 A.2d at 694. Envirmech, however, argued, \u201cthat a motion to dismiss was not the appropriate vehicle to raise that defense \u2014 that if Regina desired to invoke the arbitration clause, it should have filed a petition to compel arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 565 A.2d at 694. The circuit court ruled in favor in Envirmech, \u201cthat the dispute was not covered by the arbitration clause\u201d and Regina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Construction immediately appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 565 A.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The Court of Special Appeals prefaced its analysis of the appealability of the denial of Regina Construction\u2019s motion by explaining that a motion to dismiss is not \u201cthe proper way in which to invoke an arbitration agreement\u201d, and \u201chad the court denied the motion solely on that ground with leave to file a proper motion to compel arbitration, we would have regarded the order as interlocutory and non-appealable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 565 A.2d at 698. The <em>Regina </em>court, however, concluded that the order denying Regina\u2019s motion to dismiss was immediately appealable as a denial of a motion to compel arbitration, because \u201cthe sole basis of the denial of the motion was the court\u2019s conclusion that the dispute was not arbitrable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so doing, the court determined <em>Trionfo </em>was not dispositive, concluding, without analysis, that, \u201c[w]ith the adoption of the revised Maryland Rules in 1984, the distinctions between law and equity procedure were abolished. There is now but one form of action in the circuit courts. The distinction found important in <em>Trionfo, </em>therefore, no longer exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 565 A.2d at 698 (citation omitted). The distinction drawn in <em>Regina, </em>however, does not square with <em>Trionfo\u2019s </em>reliance on final judgment jurisprudence and has not curried favor in this Court. The merger of law and equity was merely contextual of the central premise of <em>Trionfo, </em>which recognized that an order denying a motion to dismiss and compel arbitration filed in an existing action is not an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">As we have reiterated, an appealable \u201cfinal judgment\u201d under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article decides and concludes the rights of the parties involved or denies a party the means of further prosecuting or defending rights in the subject matter of the proceeding. <em>Nnoli, </em>389 Md. at 323-24, 884 A.2d at 1219-20; <em>Brewster, </em>360 Md. at 611, 759 A.2d at 742; <em>Peat, Marwick, Mitchell, &amp; Co., </em>284 Md. at 91, 394 A.2d at 804. An order denying a request to compel arbitration, styled as a motion or petition, filed in an existing action does neither and cannot be viewed as a final judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>unlike that situation when a Petition to Compel Arbitration filed on its own is denied, which terminates the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 983 A.2d 138 (2009), the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is not a final judgment....\u201d <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>190 Md.App. 179, 190 n. 5, 988 A.2d 68, 74 n. 5 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We have oft-noted that \"[t]he General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court's interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 337-38, 765 A.2d 127, 131 (2001), quoting <em>Williams v. State, 292 </em>Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301, 1305 (1981); <em>see also Montgomery Cnty. v. Robinson, </em>435 Md. 62, 78, 76 A.3d 1159, 1168 (2013); <em>Hoile </em>v. <em>State, </em>404 Md. 591, 628, 948 A.2d 30, 52 (2008). Under our jurisprudence, legislative inaction can be equated to acquiescence. <em>In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 197, 634 A.2d 53, 59 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Further, if the dissent is correct, any order that would adversely impact on arbitrability would run contrary to the legislative purpose of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act and would be immediately appealable, pursuant to the 1965 Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act. Why, then, in 1973 did the Legislature carve out as an interlocutory appeal-able order the grant of a motion to stay arbitration, pursuant to what is now Section 12-303(3)(ix) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article? The grant of a motion to stay was appealable previously as a final judgment in the Uniform Act, as it was in Section 18 of Article 7, Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl. Vol.); in the comprehensive overhaul it was reenacted as an interlocutory order from which an appeal could lie, which would not have been necessary had all adverse actions relating to arbitration been deemed final judgments. Therefore, the major premise of the dissent that the Legislature did not deviate from the Uniform Act, also is erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-6\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAo\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We granted a writ of certiorari in this case to decide whether a party to a contract that provides for arbitration may pursue an immediate appeal when a circuit court denies its motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The Respondents argue that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d In their brief and at oral argument before this Court, that answer rested in large part on two propositions: (1) that a code revision bill covertly effected a substantive change in a key legislative policy underlying the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act; and (2) that, in any event, this Court has already decided the question in their favor in two recent cases\u2014<em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 983 A.2d 138 (2009) and <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman and Remodeling Services, LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 989 A.2d 210 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The Majority opinion rejects both of those propositions\u2014 correctly, in my view. However, the Majority opinion then outlines an alternative theory \u2014 quite at odds with the argument of Respondents \u2014 to reach the same result. For the reasons explained below, that alternative theory is inconsistent with the General Assembly\u2019s intent when it enacted and later recodified the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act. Accordingly, the answer the Majority opinion reaches is a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">To understand, a little history is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">\n<em>1956 Uniform Arbitration Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">The Uniform Arbitration Act was a model law developed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (\u201cUniform Law Commissioners\u201d). The 1956 version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 the version ultimately adopted by the Maryland General Assembly \u2014 was drafted by a special committee of the Uniform Law Commissioners. The general policy of the Act was to favor the referral of disputes to arbitration, particularly when the disputing parties had previously agreed to do so. <em>See </em>7-IA Uniform Laws Annotated <em>(2009) </em>at 100 (Prefatory Note).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">To further this policy favoring alternative dispute resolution via arbitration, the Act provided for an immediate appeal if a trial court refused to compel a party to participate in arbitration. Section 19 of the Uniform Act provided, in pertinent part-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoc\">\u00eda) An appeal may be taken from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">(1) An order denying an application to compel arbitration made under Section 2;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(b) The appeal shall be taken in the manner and to the same extent as from orders or judgments in a civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Uniform Arbitration Act (1956), \u00a7 19. The reference to \u201cSection <em>2\u201d </em>in (a)(1) makes clear that the Act contemplated immediate appeals of orders in pending court proceedings, as Section 2 required that applications to compel arbitration be filed in a related court proceeding when such a proceeding existed and the court had jurisdiction to consider applications to compel arbitration. <em>See </em>Uniform Arbitration Act (1956), \u00a7 2(c). Thus, under the Act, if a party in a pending court proceeding moved to compel arbitration pursuant to an alleged pre-dispute arbitration agreement and the court denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>motion, that party had a right to immediately appeal that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">This understanding of the Uniform Arbitration Act is also reflected in other contemporary writings of the drafters of the Act. Shortly after the Act was adopted by the Uniform Law Commissioners, the Chairman of the Commissioners wrote a law review article about how it worked. M. Pirsig, <em>The New Uniform Arbitration Act, </em>11 Bus. Law. 44 (1955-56). In that article, he described the appeal provision of the Uniform Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuB\">Appeals likewise are commonly neglected in arbitration statutes. <em>Under the new act, the applicable orders are specifically designated and are confined to those final in nature, such as orders denying motions to compel arbitration </em>or granting motions to stay arbitration. Orders directing, or refusing to stay, arbitration are not appealable, but the point at issue can be raised on appeal from an order confirming the award should one be rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 51 (emphasis added) (internal footnote omitted). Other commentators likewise noted that a denial of a motion to compel arbitration would be immediately appealable under the model law \u2014 a drafting decision that was part of the Act\u2019s policy favoring arbitration when an agreement between the parties provided for arbitration. <em>See, e.g., </em>S. Gotshal, <em>Arbitration and the Lawyer\u2019s Place in the Business Community, </em>11 Bus. Law. 52, 54 (1955-56).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">As is evident from the material quoted above, the authors of the Uniform Act considered the immediate appealability of a denial of a motion to compel arbitration to be perfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>consistent with a final judgment rule. Indeed, the Prefatory Note to the 1956 Uniform Act explained that \u201c[t]he section on Appeals is intended to remove doubts as to what orders are appealable and to limit appeals prior to judgment to those instances where the element of finality is present.\u201d 7-IA Uniform Laws Annotated (2009) at 100 (Prefatory Note).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The logic of the Uniform Act\u2019s provision on appeals is straightforward. If the public policy expressed in the Uniform Act favors arbitration of disputes, that policy is likely to be frustrated unless an immediate appeal from a lower court decision denying arbitration is available. By definition, arbitration is an alternative to dispute resolution through litigation in the courts; if a party to an arbitration agreement must fully litigate the dispute judicially before that party can obtain appellate review of a decision denying an obligation to arbitrate, the benefits of resort to alternative dispute resolution are moot. <em>See 21 </em>Williston on Contracts \u00a7 57:61 (4th ed. 2013) (noting that an appeal of an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is immediately appealable under both the Uniform Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The Uniform Arbitration Act, or substantially similar legislation, has been adopted in 49 jurisdictions. <em>See </em>7-IA Uniform Laws Annotated 2 (2009 &amp; 2013 Cum. Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>1965 Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The Maryland General Assembly adopted the text of the Uniform Arbitration Act (1956) virtually verbatim in 1965. Chapter 231, Laws of Maryland 1965. In particular, the Legislature adopted the provision of the Uniform Act concerning appeals that allowed for immediate appeals of orders denying motions to compel arbitration. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Article 7, \u00a7 18 (1968 Repl. Vol.). As indicated above, the Respondents in this case concede that the original enactment of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act provided for an immediate appeal of such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>1973 Code Revision </em>\u2014 the <em>new Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In 1973, the General Assembly, in one of the first episodes of the code revision saga in Maryland, created the Courts <em>&amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d) and incorporated the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act as part of that article. Chapter 2, First Special Session, Laws of Maryland 1973. As is the general rule in modern code revision, the purpose of the revision was to make changes in the form and style, not the substance, of the statutory law. <em>See </em>A. Wilner, <em>Blame it on Nero: Code Creation and Revision in Maryland </em>(February 14, 1994), available through the Archives of Maryland Online at &lt;http://www.aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/ html/history.html&gt;. In a contemporary law review article describing the creation of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, the director of the code revision effort confirmed that its purpose was to \u201cclarify[] the logical relationship among code provisions related to the judicial system, while avoiding any substantive change in these provisions____\u201d <em>See </em>W.H. Adkins, II, <em>Code Revision in Maryland: the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, </em>34 Md. L. Rev. 7, 9 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In the code revision process, most of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act became Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the new article. But the appeal provision of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act \u2014 former Article 7, \u00a7 18 \u2014 was subsumed into Title 12 of the new article, which consolidated provisions concerning appeals. In reports and notes appended to the bill, the revisors made clear that the elimination of former Article 7, \u00a7 18 was not intended to effect a substantive restriction on the appealability of orders relating to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">For example, in their report explaining the incorporation of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, the revisors stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akz\">The provisions of Art. 7, \u00a7 18 dealing with appeals are proposed for repeal because they are covered by Title 12 of the Courts Article. <em>This subtitle contains no substantive changes. </em>All provisions are reorganized to conform to the style of the Courts and other correlating articles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Report No. 3F of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code (July 16, 1973) at 27 (emphasis added). In another report concerning Title 12 of the new article, the revisors reiterated that former Article 7, \u00a7 18 was one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>several statutes now subsumed into the new Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 12-301 \u2014 the final judgment rule. <em>See </em>Report No. 3B of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code (September 21, 1972) at 4. The revisors explained that the purpose of eliminating a number of special statutory appeal provisions was not to limit appeal rights under those statutes but to eliminate a \u201ctrap for ... unwary\u201d drafters of future legislation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the Revisor\u2019s Note to Title 12 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, the revisors indicated that the elimination of former Article 7, \u00a7 18, as well as special appeal provisions in other statutes, was not intended to restrict existing appeal rights, but rather to incorporate them through \u201cbroad general language ... unless the legislature <em>expressly </em>decides to deny them.\u201d Chapter 2, First Special Session, Laws of Maryland 1973 at 355 (emphasis added). The revisors specifically identified only one provision of former Article 7, \u00a7 18 that might authorize an appeal from an interlocutory judgment and included that provision in new C J \u00a7 12-303 concerning permissible interlocutory appeals; the revision clearly treated the remaining appeal provisions\u2014 including that pertaining to orders denying motions to compel arbitration \u2014 as final judgments. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Nothing in the revisors\u2019 notes, reports, or other contemporary legislative materials suggested that the code revision bill would limit appeal rights previously granted or, in particular, eliminate an existing appeal right under the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act. Indeed, in certain respects, the catchall language of CJ \u00a7 12-301 expanded appeal rights with respect to some matters related to arbitration. <em>See Litton Bionetics, Inc. v. Glen Construc. Co., </em>292 Md. 34, 39-42, 437 A.2d 208 (1981) (order concerning consolidation of two arbitration proceedings appealable as a final judgment under CJ \u00a7 12-301).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The Respondents ignore the contemporary legislative history and argue that the code revision bill silently reversed the legislative policy expressed in the original enactment of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act favoring such appeals. The Majority opinion correctly rejects the argument that the code revision committee was effecting a covert change in the right to appeal a denial of a motion to compel arbitration. <em>See </em>Majority op. at pp. 473-75, 82 A.3d at 876-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>The Regina Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In 1989, the Court of Special Appeals had occasion to review the legislative history of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act and, unsurprisingly, concluded that a denial of a motion to compel arbitration would be immediately appealable as a final order under CJ \u00a7 12-301. <em>Regina Construc. Corp. v. Envirmech Contracting Corp., </em>80 Md.App. 662, 565 A.2d 693 (1989) (Wilner, J.). In that case, a subcontractor in a construction project sued the general contractor to enforce an alleged commitment of the general contractor to provide financial assistance to the subcontractor in connection with the project. The general contractor sought to have the action dismissed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>stayed on the ground that the parties\u2019 contract provided for the referral of disputes to arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">On behalf of the intermediate appellate court, Judge Wilner reviewed the original enactment of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, including its provision for an immediate appeal, and the subsequent code revision. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">In enacting the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the General Assembly seemed to accept the notion that an order denying a petition or application to compel arbitration was immediately appealable, and indeed appeared to believe that it was appealable as a final judgment ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">80 Md.App. at 670, 565 A.2d 693. Accordingly, the court held that the matter was properly before it as a final judgment under CJ \u00a7 12-301,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and went on to address the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Judge Wilner\u2019s analysis in <em>Regina </em>is true to the purpose of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, true to the function of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>code revision, and straightforward in its logic. It provides a clear answer to the question on which we granted certiorari in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">But it is sometimes the case that one loses sight of a cogent answer to one question when a related question demands a more complex analysis. Over the years, a parallel body of case law has developed, largely in the Court of Special Appeals, that analyzes the appealability of decisions concerning arbitration clauses, including motions to compel arbitration, from a different perspective. In my view, the intermediate appellate court arrived at the correct answer in those cases, although by a more convoluted route than the court in <em>Regina. Subsequent case law takes an alternative tack</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>Town of Chesapeake Beach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The case that spawned much of the later case law was <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach v. Pessoa Construc. Co., </em>330 Md. 744, 625 A.2d 1014 (1993). Unlike the instant case or <em>Regina, Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>did <em>not </em>involve a denial of a motion to compel arbitration. Rather, it concerned a denial of a petition to <em>stay </em>arbitration \u2014 a less favored order under the Uniform Arbitration Act. This Court concluded that an appeal of such an order in that case was viable because a circuit court could have designated it as a final judgment under Rule 2-602, and therefore an appellate court could properly enter a final judgment pursuant to Rule 8-602(e)(l)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; alternatively, the appeal would be proper under the collateral order doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The Court did not cite or discuss <em>Regina, </em>perhaps because <em>Regina </em>did not concern denial of a motion to <em>stay </em>arbitration, although nothing in the <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>decision is inconsistent with <em>Regina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Even though <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>did not involve an order denying a motion to compel arbitration, it is an important decision for our purposes. Subsequent appellate decisions have relied on its holding and rationale to conclude that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration may be certified as final under Rule 2-602 and Rule 8-602(e), seemingly on the assumption that such an order is not a final judgment under CJ \u00a7 12-301. But, until the instant case, Maryland courts have not revisited that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\n<em>Application of Town of Chesapeake Beach to orders denying motions to compel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In 2002, the Court of Special Appeals applied the reasoning of <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>in a case involving an appeal of a denial of a motion to compel arbitration to find the order immediately appealable. <em>NRT Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Innovative Properties, Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 263, 797 A.2d 824 (2002). Seemingly unaware of Judge Wilner\u2019s analysis in <em>Regina </em>and citing <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach, </em>the court appeared to assume that the order before it was an interlocutory order (like the order in <em>Town of Chesapeake </em>Beach) that an appellate court had discretion to certify as final under Rule 8-602(e)(1). 144 Md.App. at 273-79, 797 A.2d 824. The court neither cited nor distinguished its own prior decision in <em>Regina, </em>which provided a more straightforward rationale for reaching the same <em>result </em>\u2014 i.e., for holding that the order denying a motion to compel arbitration is immediately appeal-able.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The Court of Special Appeals continued to apply the <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>analysis in subsequent cases concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>denials of motions to compel arbitration, again without any reference to its own, more directly applicable, decision in <em>Regina. See, e.g., Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc. v. Messick, </em>152 Md.App. 381, 831 A.2d 1144 (2003); <em>All State Home Mortgage, Inc. v. Daniel, </em>187 Md.App. 166, 977 A.2d 438 (2009). Thus, cases concerning the immediate appealability of a denial of a motion to compel arbitration were decided as an application of Rule 2-602 or Rule 8 \u2014 602(e)(1)\u2014appellate court certification of an order as a final judgment \u2014 rather than on the basis that the order was a final judgment under CJ 12-301, as <em>Regina </em>had determined.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Eventually, our Court weighed in on this line of analysis in two recent <em>cases </em>\u2014 Addison <em>v. Lochearn Nursing Home LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 983 A.2d 138 (2009) and <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman and Remodeling Services, </em>412 Md. 555, 989 A.2d 210 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>Addison and Case Handyman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In <em>Addison </em>and <em>Case Handyman, </em>this Court rejected appeals involving denials of motions to compel arbitration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Both of those cases were decided on the assumption that the court\u2019s jurisdiction of the appeal needed to be justified under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Rule 8-602(e) \u2014 by application of the <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>analysis. As the Majority opinion indicates, neither decision resolved the question before us \u2014 whether an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is a final appealable order under CJ \u00a7 12-301. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 468, 82 A.3d at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In <em>Addison, </em>a nursing home sued one of its residents to recover delinquent payments. The resident counterclaimed, alleging fraudulent acts by a nursing home employee, and the nursing home sought to compel arbitration of the counterclaim. The circuit court denied that motion and also denied the nursing home\u2019s request that it certify the order as final pursuant to Rule 2-602. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals certified the order as final under Rule 8-602(e) and ordered arbitration. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the circuit court\u2019s denial of the request under Rule 2-602 precluded appellate certification of the order as final under Rule 8-602(e). The Court also held that such an order is not an interlocutory order that could be appealed pursuant to CJ \u00a7 12-303. This Court never considered whether the order was final under CJ \u00a7 12-301 and, like the previous decisions of the intermediate appellate court, did not cite or distinguish <em>Regina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>Case Handyman </em>involved a putative class action against a franchisor of home improvement companies by homeowners who had dealt with a franchisee that had gone bankrupt. The circuit court denied the franchisor\u2019s motion to have the dispute referred to arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in the home improvement contract. The Court of Special Appeals reversed that decision, holding that the arbitration clause was valid and enforceable. Consistent with the <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach </em>line of cases, this Court analyzed the appealability of the circuit court order on the assumption that it was an interlocutory order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court held that the circuit court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>order denying the motion to compel arbitration was \u201cnot final in the traditional sense\u201d and therefore could not be certified by an appellate court as final under Rule 8-602(e). 412 Md. at 572, 989 A.2d 210. As in <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach, </em>the court went on to consider appealability under the collateral order doctrine, but found that the case did not satisfy all four prongs of that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">As noted earlier, Respondents argue that, in <em>Addison </em>and <em>Case Handyman, </em>this Court has already held that a denial of a motion to compel arbitration is not a final order for purposes of CJ \u00a7 12-301. A careful reading of the decisions reveals that neither case includes such a holding. The Majority opinion correctly rejects Respondents\u2019 effort to extrapolate those two cases. The question of whether the Legislature intended that such an order be treated as a final order has not been fully examined since <em>Regina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>The Majority Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">I agree with much of the Majority opinion as it shares my rejection of the cornerstone arguments of the Respondents. I part ways near the end of the Majority opinion when, by sleight of hand, it comes to the same ultimate conclusion as the Respondents \u2014 that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is not immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">To reach that conclusion, the Majority offers an original construction of a portion of the Uniform Arbitration Act that was codified in former Article 7, \u00a7 18(b); as best I can determine, no other court in Maryland or elsewhere has construed this provision as the Majority now does.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">As indicated earlier in this opinion, former Article 7, \u00a7 18(b) was derived from \u00a7 19(b) of the Uniform Arbitration Act (1956) concerning appeals and provided that \u201cThe appeal shall be taken in the manner and to the same extent as from orders or judgments in a civil action.\u201d <em>See </em>p. 480, 82 A.3d at 881 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>above. The Majority asserts that this provision incorporates an understanding of the final judgment rule that precludes an immediate appeal of an order denying a motion to compel arbitration. Majority op. at 471-75, 82 A.3d at 875-77. The Majority cites no direct authority for this proposition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A review of the annotations in the relevant volume of the Uniform Laws Annotated turns up no decision in any other jurisdiction that construes this provision of the Uniform Arbitration Act (1956) to embody a final judgment rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">To its credit, the Majority opinion recognizes that <em>Regina </em>contradicts its theory and attempts to distinguish that decision, but I find its discussion unpersuasive. The Majority opinion rejects Judge Wilner\u2019s analysis in <em>Regina </em>in favor of an earlier decision of the Court of Special Appeals that rejected an appeal on the basis that applications under the Uniform Arbitration Act had to be filed in a court of equity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As pointed out in <em>Regina, </em>law and equity merged for purposes of civil procedure in the mid-1980s, and the characterization of a motion to compel as one or the other would seem to have little bearing in the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In a footnote, the Majority opinion argues that the General Assembly has \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the idea that denial of a motion to compel arbitration is not a final judgment. Majority op. at 475 n. 19, 82 A.3d at 877-78 n. 19. The theory of \u201clegislative acquiescence\u201d is an inference drawn from legislative inaction following a contemporaneous interpretation of a statute by the Court. Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 49.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">This case would seem to be an unlikely candidate for resort to a theory of legislative acquiescence for several reasons. First, as the Majority concedes, this Court has not previously decided directly whether denial of a motion to compel arbitration is a final order under CJ \u00a7 12-301. The only case that squarely addressed that question under current Maryland civil <em>procedure </em>\u2014 Regina\u2014held that such an order is a final judgment. Second, even if this Court had previously addressed the issue, the inference of legislative acquiescence is most meaningful when bills have been introduced in the General Assembly to reverse the Court\u2019s holding, and the Legislature has declined to do so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That is not the case here. Finally, even if these two requisites pertain, legislative inaction has often been called a \u201cweak reed upon which to lean.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In sum, we have not decided the issue previously and the Legislature has not declined to overrule a decision we have not made. It is difficult to describe these circumstances as \u201clegislative acquiescence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The bottom line of the Majority opinion is that the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act from its inception to the present allows an immediate appeal of denial of an application to compel arbitration that is filed as a separate action, but does not allow for an immediate appeal if the application is filed in a related pending proceeding \u2014 even if the dispute, the parties, and the alleged arbitration agreement are identical. But this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>result sacrifices fidelity to the legislative purpose to formality without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">If the underlying concern of the Majority opinion is that arbitration has been extended and imposed on parties not within the original contemplation of the Legislature, I share that concern. One might reasonably question whether a system that prefers to funnel disputes away from the courts to alternative tribunals such as private arbitration is consistent with the basic design of our government, especially when the arbitration requirement derives from a contract involving parties with grossly unequal bargaining power.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But that is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the case or the question before us. And, when the question is before us, it should be dealt with head on as to the merits of the arbitration provision, not by sidestepping the issue by deciding the case on a formal question of appealability of an order concerning arbitration. <em>See </em>p. 489 n. 11, 82 A.3d at 886 n. 11 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">A final observation: When it adopted the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, the General Assembly directed that it was to be \u201cinterpreted and construed so as to effectuate the general purpose to make uniform the law of the states which enact it.\u201d <em>See </em>Chapter 231, Laws of Maryland 1965, <em>now codified at </em>CJ \u00a7 3-232. Virtually every other state that has adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act provides for an immediate appeal of orders denying motions to compel arbitration, either as a final judgment or as a permissible interlocutory appeal. The reasons underlying that uniform statutory policy were described by the drafters of the Uniform Act, were adopted by the Maryland General Assembly, and were honored by the code revisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Majority opinion posits instead that the Maryland statute never contemplated an immediate appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration in a pending proceeding. If the Majority is correct, the inclusion of the word \u201cUniform\u201d in the title of the \u201cMaryland Uniform Arbitration Act\u201d was a misnomer. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-234 (specifying short title of act).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In the end, the question is whether the Legislature intended that a denial of a motion to compel arbitration should be immediately appealable, whether filed in a pending proceeding or as an independent action. As explained above, in my view, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">.

At the time <em>Trionfo </em>was decided, the filing of a motion to compel arbitration in an action in a court of law did not adequately invoke an arbitration agreement and, as a result, the appeal provisions of the Act. The court's decision in <em>Trionfo </em>seems to be a straightforward application of the qualification in \u00a7 2(c) of the Uniform Arbitration Act, adopted in former Article 7, \u00a7 2, and recodified without substantive change in code revision, which limited appeals to situations in which the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the particular motion.

It is apparent from the law review articles describing the Uniform Arbitration Act at its inception that the drafters contemplated that arbitration would be utilized largely in the context of commercial and labor-management disputes. <em>See </em>M. Pirsig, <em>supra, </em>11 Bus. Law. at 44, 47; S. Gotshal, <em>supra, </em>11 Bus. Law. at 52-53, 59. The proliferation of contractual arbitration provisions has been described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Until recently, arbitration reigned in two domains: commercial transactions and labor-management relations. Businesspersons generally chose arbitration over litigation for several reasons. First, they preferred to select the people who would decide their disputes, often opting for decisionmakers with relevant expertise, rather than having courts assign generalist judges to their cases. Second, they tended to prefer resolutions based on commercial norms rather than legal standards that might be less appropriate for their disputes. Finally, they commonly anticipated that resolution by arbitration would be quicker and cheaper than court resolution, with its potential for protracted pretrial adversarialism, extensive discovery, and multiple appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">Labor unions and management included arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements for different, albeit overlapping, reasons. Both labor and management believed that resolving disputes through arbitration would minimize industrial conflict over worker grievances. They had more confidence in decisionmakers whom they selected from their own ranks than court-appointed judges from outside the affected industries. Furthermore, they wanted a conflict resolution process that would keep businesses running and avoid losses in productivity and employment. In both the commercial and labor-management domains, arbitration agreements were negotiated by sophisticated parties of approximately equivalent bargaining power who understood the benefits and costs of their bargains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">Over the past several decades, as a result of some remarkable lawmaking by federal and state appellate courts, the profile of arbitration has changed dramatically. Arbitration is no longer the prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ince of sophisticated participants. Instead, individuals pursuing long-established statutory claims, such as those brought under the federal securities and antitrust laws, and newer but long-sought civil rights claims, including race, sex, age, and disability discrimination, may now be forced to arbitrate if the parties are deemed to have assented to a predispute arbitration clause. Consumer claims have followed a similar course, such that consumers who enter into contracts that substitute binding arbitration for the public court system may be required to arbitrate disputes that arise in the course of their relationships with service or product providers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">L.J.
