On March 14, 2012, the Attorney Grievance Commission, acting through Bar Counsel (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d), pursuant to Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 751(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition For Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d (\u201cPetition\u201d) against Worthy, charging various violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, to include Rule 8.4(b), (c) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The factual bases of these charges arose out of Worthy\u2019s failure to file federal personal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007. Bar Counsel alleged that Worthy \u201cwillfully failed to file federal income tax returns for the years 2006 and 2007, resulting in a tax loss of at least $70,000.\u201d The Petition also alleged that Worthy \u201cpleaded guilty to two counts of failure to file tax returns in the [U.S.] District Court of Maryland\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>at the time of the Petition filing, Worthy was \u201cscheduled to be sentenced on those charges on March 22, 2012.\u201d In an Order dated March 13, 2012, we referred the matter to Judge Graydon S. McKee, III, of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a hearing, pursuant to Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>On March 22, 2012, Judge Roger W. Titus of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland sentenced Worthy to six months\u2019 incarceration followed by one year of supervised release. Worthy reported to serve his sentence in May of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">After his release in October of 2012, Worthy was served with process in this case in January of 2013. He then filed a Response to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, admitting that he had been convicted of two counts of willful failure to file but denying that he had violated any Rule of Professional Conduct. At the subsequent hearing, Bar Counsel and Worthy submitted a Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts and four Joint Exhibits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Worthy requested and gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>nered the opportunity to provide mitigation through his own testimony, as well as in letters from four judges in which they favorably addressed Worthy\u2019s character, after they had been duly served with subpoenas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Judge McKee issued written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which he determined that Worthy violated Rules 8.4(b) and (d), but did not violate Rule 8.4(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against the Respondent, Michael Ron Worthy, Esquire, in the Court of Appeals of Maryland on March 5, 2012, alleging that he committed professional misconduct by willfully failing to file his federal income tax returns for two years (2006 and 2007). The Court of Appeals assigned this matter to this Court on March 13, 2012, to conduct a trial of this matter. Respondent was served with process in January 2013, and filed an Answer on or about February 6, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">The Court conducted the trial on March 11 and April 12, 2013. At the March 11 hearing, the parties submitted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>agreed statement of facts and several exhibits. Respondent testified at the April 12 hearing and submitted several letters from judges regarding his character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">The Court finds that the following facts have been proven by clear and convincing evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">Michael Ron Worthy was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on December 19, 1996. After his admission to the Bar, he worked as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney in Prince George\u2019s County before establishing a law firm (Williams Worthy, LLP) in 2000. By 2006, Mr. Worthy also operated a real estate office (Esquire One) and managed several rental properties. During this time period, the law firm of Williams Worthy had approximately 14 employees while the real estate firm of Esquire One had a similar number of real estate agents. The law firm, the real estate company and the rental properties all had numerous and separate business records and bank accounts. Mr. Worthy was not very familiar with all of the accounting procedures that were necessary to run a real estate brokerage business and a law firm. His law partner, in fact, managed the books and records of the law firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">Mr. Worthy did not timely file federal tax returns for the years of 2006 and 2007. During the period of time when those returns were due, Mr. Worthy had lost some of his financial records and had to order additional bank records. Those records were insufficient to adequately prepare the returns. Mr. Worthy worked with his personal CPA to accurately prepare his tax returns. However, the tax returns were not timely filed. Mr. Worthy understood his legal obligation to file returns or obtain an extension of time. He did not file an extension request for either year. Mr. Worthy did not attempt to evade responsibility for his conduct. Mr. Worthy testified that, \u201cIt was totally my responsibility to understand what the tax laws are. I am a lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The United States Attorney brought criminal charges against Mr. Worthy. On July 7, 2010, Mr. Worthy pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Criminal No. RWT-10-253 to two counts of willful failure to file federal tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. On March 22, 2012, Mr. Worthy was sentenced to six months incarceration and served his sentence from May through October of 2012. During his period of incarceration, Mr. Worthy did not engage in the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">In his plea agreement, Mr. Worthy acknowledged that he owed at least $70,000 in federal taxes for those two years. Mr. Worthy was not charged with tax fraud or tax evasion, and there is no allegation that he committed those offenses. Mr. Worthy is working with the Internal Revenue Service to arrange a payment plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">In addition, Mr. Worthy has taken steps to ensure that his books and records are properly maintained and that his taxes are timely filed. He has taken courses involving taxation, hired a full-time accounting person for his office and meets once a month with his outside accountant. He no longer runs a real estate brokerage firm and has lost all of his investment properties. Mr. Worthy now just practices law in a sole practice firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">Four Judges of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of Maryland submitted letters regarding Mr. Worthy\u2019s character. The Honorable Hassan A. El-Amin described Mr. Worthy as having been \u201can up-front, no nonsense prosecutor\u201d who always kept his word. When Mr. Worthy later appeared before Judge El-Amin when in private practice, his clients were always well-represented. Mr. Worthy was particularly knowledgeable about Fourth Amendment issues. Judge El-Amin also noted that Mr. Worthy had excelled at training young attorneys and that he was very supportive of the J. Franklyn Bourne Bar Association. He opined that Mr. Worthy \u201cis a man of good \u2014 and in some <em>respects </em>\u2014 out<em>standing, </em>character.\u201d The Honorable Melanie Shaw Geter has known Mr. Worthy approximately twenty years. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>notes that Mr. Worthy was always honest with the court in his interactions and that she did not believe he is a deceitful person. The Honorable C. Philip Nichols, Jr. expressed a high regard for Mr. Worthy and noted that he never had an occasion to question his professional judgment in court. The Honorable Michele D. Hotten has known Mr. Worthy for fifteen years. She wrote that Mr. Worthy \u201cnever displayed any traits of dishonesty or deceit\u201d when appearing before her. She described Mr. Worthy as \u201can intelligent, zealous, resourceful, hard-working attorney\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">The Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action alleges that Mr. Worthy violated Rules 8.4(b), (c) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Rule 8.4(b) states that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201ccommit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects\u201d. Mr. Worthy\u2019s conviction for two counts of failing to file tax returns establishes that he committed criminal acts. The Maryland Court of Appeals has held on many occasions that the willful failure to file tax returns is conduct which violates Rule 8.4(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">Rule 8.4(c) states that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d. Although the Respondent willfully failed to file his tax returns for two years, there is not clear and convincing evidence showing that he did so dishonestly or in a deceitful manner. He was not charged with tax evasion or concealing income. Mr. Worthy testified that he was hampered in preparing the returns because his partner had control of some of the business records and that he lost some of the records. He attempted to recover the records from the bank, but the bank records were not sufficient to establish all of the information needed to prepare the returns. While Mr. Worthy\u2019s actions were inexcusable, there is no evidence that he intended to deceive the government or avoid his financial obligations. Particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>larly in light of the opinions of the Judges regarding Mr. Worthy\u2019s integrity and honesty, the Court finds that Respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">Pursuant to Rule 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d. Mr. Worthy\u2019s willful failure to file tax returns showed a disregard for his legal obligations and a lack of respect to governmental authority. His conduct placed the legal profession in a bad light and erodes public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession. The Court finds that Respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">In summary, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Worthy violated Rules 8.4(b) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by his willful failure to file federal tax returns but that his conduct did not violate Rule 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. 2, 28, 69 A.3d 1121, 1136 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Chapman, </em>430 Md. 238, 273, 60 A.3d 25, 46 (2013). \u201c[W]e accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as prima facie correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Fader, </em>431 Md. 395, 426, 66 A.3d 18, 36 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Rand, </em>429 Md. 674, 712, 57 A.3d 976, 998 (2012). We conduct an independent, de novo review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, pursuant to Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Neither party took exception to Judge McKee\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. We accept \u201cthe findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ate sanctions, if any.\u201d Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>see Fader, </em>431 Md. at 427, 66 A.3d at 37; <em>Attorney Grievance v. Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 358, 40 A.3d 1039, 1047 (2012). \u201cWe also accept the conclusions of law if they are supported by the factual findings.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Snyder, </em>406 Md. 21, 28, 956 A.2d 147, 151 (2008), citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mba-Jonas, </em>402 Md. 334, 344, 936 A.2d 839, 845 (2007). We find that Judge McKee\u2019s conclusions of law are supported by the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">With respect to sanction, Bar Counsel recommends indefinite suspension from the practice of law with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months. Worthy requests a finite six month suspension from the practice of law <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to May 2012, to coincide with his six months\u2019 incarceration. We will adopt Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We have often stated in attorney grievances cases with respect to sanctions that \u201cour goal is not \u2018to punish the attorney,\u2019 but rather \u2018to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession [and] to deter other lawyers from violating the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u2019 To achieve this goal, the sanction should be \u2018commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the misconduct and the intent with which it was committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Dore, </em>433 Md. 685, 717, 73 A.3d 161, 180 (2013) (alterations in original), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Taylor, </em>405 Md. 697, 720, 955 A.2d 755, 768 (2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. 595, 843 A.2d 50 (2004), in which we imposed a thirty day suspension for willful failure to file federal and state income tax returns for three years, with an attendant arrearage of $7,354.98, we articulated the then existing range of sanctions in disciplinary cases for willful failure to file tax returns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Where we have found misconduct for an attorney\u2019s failure to meet his or her tax obligations, the sanctions have ranged widely depending on the circumstances in each case. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tayback, </em>378 Md. 578, 837 A.2d 158 (2003) (imposing suspension with right to reapply after 60 days for willful failure to timely file and timely pay federal and state income tax returns); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 830 A.2d 474 (2003) (suspending attorney indefinitely with the right to, reapply after one year for, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to pay federal and state withholding taxes); <em>[Attorney Grievance </em>v.] <em>Clark, </em>363 Md. [169], 183-85, 767 A.2d [865], 873-74 [(2001)] (suspending with immediate right to reapply for repeated failures to file and pay withholding tax returns); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 745 A.2d 1086 (2000) (imposing indefinite suspension with right to reapply after one year for willful failures to file and pay state and federal tax returns over at least ten years); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 711 A.2d 193 (1998) (issuing a reprimand for failure to correct tax payment and filing delinquencies); <em>[Attorney Grievance v.] Post, </em>350 Md.

Breschi, </em>340 Md. 590, 667 A.2d 659 (1995) (imposing 180-day suspension for failure to timely file and pay federal income tax returns for two years); <em>[Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n </em>v.] <em>Walman, </em>280 Md. [453], 465-66, 374 A.2d [354], 362 [(1977)](suspending attorney for three years for failing to file and pay returns).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdnJ\">379 Md. at 614-15, 843 A.2d at 61-62. Subsequently, we addressed the appropriate sanction for willful failure to file tax returns in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Jones, </em>424 Md. 626, 37 A.3d 316 (2012), in which we imposed an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement no sooner than six months where federal and state personal income tax returns had not been filed for a period of four years, with an attendant arrearage of $108,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The parties agree, as do we, that, in the abstract, a suspension of six months may be an appropriate sanction in many cases, but they differ in two respects. Bar Counsel recommends that Worthy receive an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months, while Worthy requests a six month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Worthy also asks that we accede to his request that the suspension be coincident with his incarceration, because he did not practice law during that period. Worthy advises that prior to his incarceration he notified clients in writing of the situation, closed his law office by locking the doors and removing signs identifying it as a law practice and did not have the office phone answered, but instead routed all calls to a voicemail for return by another lawyer to notify clients that Worthy could not practice law or be contacted. Worthy asserts that he \u201cdidn\u2019t just walk away\u201d when he went to prison and \u201clet the clients fend for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Addressing the latter request first, we must emphasize that Worthy\u2019s actions in anticipation of his unavailability while incarcerated were what we would expect of any member of the Bar in his situation of incapacity to practice while incarcerated. In this respect, Rule 16-760(c) reflects our expectations when an attorney becomes incapable of representing clients due to disbarment, suspension or inactive status, situations which certainly are akin to what Worthy experienced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">(c) Duties of respondent. Unless otherwise stated in the order, an order that disbars or suspends a respondent or places a respondent on inactive status shall operate as an immediate directive that the respondent perform each of the following duties in a timely manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(1) The respondent shall not accept any new clients or undertake any new or further representation of existing clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">(2) The respondent shall take any action necessary to protect current clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>(3) The respondent shall conclude any current client matters that can be concluded within 15 days after the date of the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">(4) Within 15 days after the date of the order, the respondent shall supply to Bar Counsel or an attorney designated by Bar Counsel a list of the attorney\u2019s clients (by name, address, and telephone number) whose legal matters have not been concluded by the respondent and identify any client matters (by name, tribunal, and docket reference) currently pending in any court or agency.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">(5) Within 15 days after the date of the order, the respondent shall mail a letter to each client whose legal matter has not been concluded, to counsel for any other party or to any unrepresented party in a pending action or proceeding, and to all attorneys with whom the respondent is associated in the practice of law, notifying each of them of the order and the fact that the respondent will be unable to practice law after the effective date of the order.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The respondent shall supply copies of the letters to Bar Counsel or an attorney designated by Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">(6) Within 30 days after the date of the order, the respondent shall withdraw from all client matters.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(7) Unless suspended for a definite period of not more than one year, the respondent shall promptly request the publisher of any telephone directory or law listing to remove any listing or reference that suggests that the respondent is eligible to practice law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">(8) The respondent shall deliver promptly to clients with pending matters any papers or other property to which the clients are entitled or notify the clients and any co-counsel of a suitable time and place to obtain the papers and other property and call attention to any urgent need to obtain them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">(9) The respondent shall promptly notify the disciplinary authority in each jurisdiction in which the respondent is admitted to practice of the disciplinary sanction imposed by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">(10) Within 30 days of the effective date of the order, the respondent shall file with the Commission an affidavit that states (A) the manner and extent to which the respondent has complied with the order and the provisions of this section, (B) the names of all state and federal jurisdictions in which and administrative agencies before which the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>spondent has been admitted to practice, (C) the residence and any other address of the respondent to which future communications may be directed, (D) the policy number and the name and address of each insurer that provided malpractice insurance coverage to the respondent during the past five years and the inclusive dates of coverage, and (E) the date and manner that a copy of the affidavit required by this subsection was served upon Bar Counsel. The affidavit shall be accompanied by copies of the list required by subsection (c)(4) of this Rule and the letters mailed under subsection (c)(5) of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">(11) If the respondent is or becomes employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer, the respondent shall comply with Rule 5.3(d) of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct and assist the supervising lawyer in complying with the supervising lawyer\u2019s obligations under the Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">(12) The respondent shall maintain records of the various steps taken to comply with this section and the order of the Court of Appeals and make those records available to Bar Counsel on request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Although Worthy urges that he had done all that would have been expected of him were he to have been suspended from practice during incarceration, Bar Counsel maintains that Worthy did not because Worthy did not submit the appropriate notices to Bar Counsel and because his actions after release from incarceration were not consistent with the argument that he complied with the tenets of the Rule, as he resumed his legal practice upon release from incarceration and continues to practice law. As a result, what Worthy did in anticipation of incarceration, notifying clients of his situation and closing his law practice, was in keeping with what an attorney should do, but less than what an attorney must do if rendered incapable of practicing law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>We also disagree with Worthy as to the imposition of a finite, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>suspension for six months rather than an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after a period of six months. Our resolution emanates primarily from the fact that at oral argument, Worthy could not specify what, if any, money he has paid to the Internal Revenue Service to satisfy his arrears, which apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>stems from the fact that his original agreement to pay the Internal Revenue Service was in default. In this regard, imposition of an indefinite suspension is appropriate in instances in which the attorney is in arrears with his repayment of taxes, is not in compliance with a payment plan, or there is uncertainty as to the status of payments and filings. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Tayback, </em>378 Md. 578, 837 A.2d 158 (2003), for instance, we explained considerations when determining sanctions to include \u201c \u2018the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed\u2019 ... the attorney\u2019s remorse for the misconduct, and the likelihood of the conduct being repeated\u201d and determined that for willful failure to file federal and state income tax returns resulting in a criminal conviction, indefinite suspension was the appropriate sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 837 A.2d at 167, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v.
