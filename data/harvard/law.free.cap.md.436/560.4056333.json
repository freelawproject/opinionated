State, </em>421 Md. 434, 26 A.3d 979 (2011) and <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 31 A.3d 922 (2011), a jury instruction in which the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-14\">During this trial, you\u2019ve heard testimony of witnesses and may hear argument of counsel that the State did not utilize a specific investigative technique or scientific tests. You may consider these facts in deciding whether the State has met its burden of proof. You should consider all of the evidence or lack of evidence in deciding whether the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>dant is guilty. <em>However, I instruct you that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case. </em>Your responsibility as jurors is to determine whether the State has proven based upon the evidence, the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">(emphasis added) constituted reversible error when a defense counsel remarked in opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">There will not be any fingerprints from any door, any piece of paper or tape, or whatever they\u2019re saying, on any weatherstripping, on the doors, no fingerprints of his. There won\u2019t be [the defendant\u2019s] DNA on anything, not on any screwdriver, not on any weatherstripping, not on any piece of tape, not on anything. Quite frankly, there\u2019s just not, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Robinson committed these crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In giving the contested instruction, the judge also noted, \u201cwhat may actually have been off the record, which was our colloquy when we were preparing instructions, it\u2019s my understanding that the defense may be arguing, as good defense attorneys do, that there wasn\u2019t any scientific link of the defendant to the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We granted certiorari, <em>Robinson v. State, </em>430 Md. 11, 59 A.3d 506 (2013), to consider the following questions, which we have renumbered:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in providing to the jury, over objection, a \u201cscientific or investigative techniques\u201d instruction where defense counsel merely stated in opening statement that the lack of physical evidence demonstrated the absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>where defense counsel never mischaracterized the law, and where the trial court gave the instruction preemptively because defense counsel \u201cmay be arguing, as good defense attorneys do, that there wasn\u2019t any scientific link of the defendant to the crime\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">2. Where a co-defendant who entered a plea of guilty testified as a defense witness at Petitioner\u2019s trial two weeks later, did the trial court err in permitting the State, in the guise of cross-examination of the co-defendant, to effectively read into the record a statement of facts proffered at the co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea hearing but never adopted by the co-defendant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We shall hold that the trial court erred in giving the jury the \u201cscientific or investigative techniques\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> instruction in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In the present case, Emmanuel Ford Robinson, Petitioner, was charged in a six count indictment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with various crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>related to events that occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland, on February 28, 2011. He was eventually convicted of conspiracy to commit first degree burglary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The State\u2019s theory of the case was that Robinson \u201ctried to break into one apartment building with another young man by the name of Roland Spence [and] was unsuccessful. He then went across Route 355 [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and [broke] into a second [building] ... and then he tried to break into an apartment in that building.\u201d During his opening statement, Robinson\u2019s attorney asserted that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by his client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">[T]his is a case about speculation. You\u2019re not going to hear any witness come in and say that they saw Emmanuel Robinson attempt to pry open any door, attempt to break and enter anywhere, or break and enter into anything ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">The evidence in this case, you\u2019ll find, is so inconsistent and so unreliable that without guessing or filling in holes, speculating \u2014 which you cannot do, and His Honor will tell you that later \u2014 you will more than likely have many more questions than answers as to what really happened on February 28th. You will have very reasonable doubts and many of them, and it only takes one. What we expect the evidence in this case to show is that Mr. Robinson is not guilty of any of the charges, that there is no evidence to show that he pried open or broke into any door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>There is no evidence that he ever attempted to pry open or break into any door. There will be no evidence to show that he ever had a screwdriver on him or any kind of tool like that. There will not be any fingerprints from any door, any piece of paper or tape, or whatever they\u2019re saying, on any weatherstripping, on the doors, no fingerprints of his. There won\u2019t be his DNA on anything, not on any screwdriver, not on any weatherstripping, not on any piece of tape, not on anything. <em>Quite frankly, there\u2019s just not, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Robinson committed these crimes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Another thing is that we expect the evidence will show that there will be no witness who will be able to come in and tell you that they saw Mr. Robinson attempt to get into any of these, into any of these doors; that he was the one doing anything. The best they\u2019ll be able to say is they believe that was Mr. Robinson who was present. And His Honor will instruct you later about mere presence at the scene of a situation where somebody may be committing a crime,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ali\">(emphasis added). Testimony of two police officers, called to the stand by the State, put Spence at the scene of the crime and Robinson in the area, leaving with Spence, after which they both were detained by the police. Defense counsel cross-examined the surveillance team officers<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> called by the State whether casting for tool mark impressions had been accomplished or fingerprint and DNA testing requested, as well as questioned a Montgomery County Police Department forensic specialist<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as to whether casting for tool mark impressions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>had been performed, to which she responded in the negative. No rebuttal testimony was offered by the State before jury instructions were entertained, although, apparently, there was discussion that had occurred among the judge and counsel regarding the proposed jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">At the close of all of the evidence but before argument, the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">During this trial, you\u2019ve heard testimony of witnesses and may hear argument of counsel that the State did not utilize a specific investigative technique or scientific tests. You may consider these facts in deciding whether the State has met its burden of proof. You should consider all of the evidence or lack of evidence in deciding whether the defendant is guilty. <em>However, I instruct you that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case. </em>Your responsibility as jurors is to determine whether the State has proven based upon the evidence, the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">(emphasis added). Defense counsel objected to the specific instruction in a bench conference following the giving of all the instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">And as to the non-pattern instruction as to police investigative techniques, I object to that instruction being given. I don\u2019t believe that the evidence in the case has warranted that such an instruction be given and other than a standard argument given with regard to the absence of evidence to convict my client, I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any other justification for giving that instruction in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">All right, well, based upon the opening statement in which it was suggested that there wasn\u2019t any fingerprint or DNA evidence, and then what may actually have been off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>record, which was our colloquy when we were preparing instructions, it\u2019s my understanding that the defense may be arguing, as good defense attorneys do, that there wasn\u2019t any scientific link of the defendant to the crime. So I think it\u2019s generated by the proffered arguments here and I\u2019ll note your objection and overrule it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In closing, defense counsel, in fact, argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">And we would submit that the testing that\u2019s been done in this case and what was done in this case and quite frankly, just some of the examples of the carelessness in the investigation and just how loose the investigators were with the facts in this case and the conclusions that they jumped to in this case would suggest to you that the State has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">There has been no evidence presented in this case that Mr. Robinson pried open or broke in a door, that he ever attempted to pry in or break into any door, that he ever had any screwdriver or tool on him, that his fingerprints are on any door, screwdriver, tape, weatherstripping or anything, that his DNA was on any of those items. There\u2019s just absolutely no evidence in this case beyond a reasonable doubt that Emmanuel Robinson committed these crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfC\">After the jury found only Robinson guilty of conspiracy to commit first degree burglary, the judge imposed a sentence of ten years\u2019 incarceration, with all but four years suspended, followed by two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Robinson noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which affirmed the conviction in an unreported opinion, determining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>[defense counsel] was entitled to \u2014 and did \u2014 point out what procedures were available to investigators, he went beyond that and attributed an incorrect burden to the State, which required correction by the court ... [and] while the instruction was not given in conjunction with an explanation of the State\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the instruction correctly stated that proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a specific investigative technique or scientific evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We, then, granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In this case, we take the opportunity to more fully elucidate the <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>standards that an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction, limited only to curative administration, shall not be entertained without legal and empirical proof that a \u201cCSI effect\u201d exists and is only triggered when a material misstatement of the law occurs. We determine that the trial court erred in the instant case by giving the contested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">It is important to place the case <em>sub judice </em>in the context of the development of the theory of the \u201cCSI effect\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and its treatment by us and the Court of Special Appeals since 2002. The term \u201cCSI effect\u201d arose in 2002,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>increased popularity of forensic crime television shows and complaints that these shows were heightening juror expectations that forensic evidence, like DNA, would be admitted in criminal trials. <em>See </em>Jenny Wise, <em>Providing the </em>CSI <em>Treatment: Criminal Justice Practitioners and the CSI Effect, </em>21 Current Issues Crim. Just. 383, 383-84 (2010); Simon A. Cole &amp; Rachel Dioso-Villa, <em>Investigating the </em>\u2018CSI <em>Effect\u2019 Effect: Media and Litigation Crisis in Criminal Law, </em>61 Stan. L.Rev. 1335, 1338-39 (2009). A 2005 survey<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of 102 prosecutors in Maricopa County, Arizona, found that an overwhelming majority felt that jurors \u201cexpected to be presented with scientific evidence.\u201d Andrew P. Thomas, <em>The </em>CSI <em>Effect: Fact or Fiction, </em>115 Yale L.J. Pocket Part 70, 71 (2006), http:// www.yalelawjournal.org/images/pdfs/32.pdf. In a 2006 survey,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 1,027 prospective jurors were questioned regarding their television watching habits, pre-trial expectations of types of evidence to be provided, and the likelihood that different types of evidence would affect their reasonable doubt determination; the author concluded that \u201c[wjhile the study did find significant expectations and demands for scientific evidence, there was little or no indication of a link between those inclinations and watching particular television shows.\u201d Judge Donald E. Shelton et al., <em>A Study of Juror Expectations and Demands </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Concerning Scientific Evidence: Does the \u201cCSI Effect\u201d Exist?, </em>9 Vand. J. Ent. <em>&amp; </em>Tech. L. 331, 333 <em>(2006). </em>That same year a Fordham law journal report, concluded that, based on a survey of 306 jury eligible graduate and undergraduate students, who responded to questions regarding their television viewing habits and a mock criminal law scenario, the so-called \u201cCSI effect\u201d did not affect jury verdicts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Kimberlianne Podlas, <em>\u201cThe CSI Effect\": Exposing the Media Myth, </em>16 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media &amp; Ent. L.J. 429 (2006). A survey conducted at Arizona State University of forty-eight jury eligible university students, suggested that viewing \u201cCSI-type\u201d programs might have affected jurors\u2019 expectations for forensic evidence but likely did not affect verdicts, based on the students\u2019 responses to forensic evidence presented in a simulated transcript of a criminal trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> N.J. Schweitzer &amp; Michael J. Saks, <em>The CSI Effect: Popular Fiction About Forensic Science Affects the Public\u2019s Expectations About Real Forensic Science, </em>47 Jurimetrics 357 (2007). Results, thus, remained inconclusive as to the existence of a \u201cCSI effect\u201d and largely suggested that while jurors seem to have increased expectations regarding admission of forensic evidence, it had not been shown that these expectations were the result of viewing CSI type programs or that watching CSI type programs affected a juror\u2019s likelihood to acquit or convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In 2007, the Court of Special Appeals was called upon to address whether giving an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>error in <em>Evans v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 549, 922 A.2d 620, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 Md. 648, 929 A.2d 890 (2007).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Evans was charged with possession and distribution of heroin as a result of an undercover \u201cbuy-bust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 922 A.2d at 623. At trial, Evans\u2019s counsel cross-examined the detectives as to specific investigative techniques that were not used and argued that without video or audio surveillance tapes, \u201ccrosschecks of reliability,\u201d there was \u201cno other real ways to prove [what occurred] because the arrest team, the lack of any video surveillance evidence, whatever, none of that, absolutely none of that exists in this case.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 563, 922 A.2d at 628. Evans\u2019s co-defendant further argued, \u201c[y]ou have a situation where there are absolutely no scientific tests that implicate my client in any way. There\u2019s no audio. There\u2019s no video. There\u2019s no fingerprints. There is nothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 922 A.2d at 629. The judge issued, upon the State\u2019s request, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>identical instruction to the one at issue in the present case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 562, 922 A.2d at 628. Evans challenged the instruction in the Court of Special Appeals; the intermediate appellate court determined that giving the instruction was not an abuse of discretion, because of the \u201crobust and vehement\u201d arguments of counsel that guilt could not be proven without scientific or investigative evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 922 A.2d at 632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Four years after <em>Evans </em>issued, we heard oral argument in <em>Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 26 A.3d 979, on April 7, 2011, after which, within four months, the instruction was given in the present case. Less than one month after the instant trial concluded, we issued our opinion in <em>Atkins, </em>setting forth our standard for evaluating the giving of an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction. In the case, Atkins had been convicted by a jury of three counts of second degree assault. The State\u2019s theory of the case had been that Atkins attacked three others in a physical altercation, during which Atkins reached into his pocket, according to a witness, after which the victim suffered a serious injury from a stab wound. The State argued at trial that a 12-inch knife recovered by police from a search of Atkins\u2019s home was the weapon used in the commission of the crime. Atkins had claimed he used a smaller folding pocket knife, in self-defense during the attack, rather than the larger knife introduced by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">During trial, Atkins\u2019s counsel cross-examined the officers regarding whether forensic testing had been done on the 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>inch knife. The State, in response, requested an instruction identical to the instruction given in the present case, which issued.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Atkins appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the giving of the instruction was an abuse of discretion by the trial judge. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, relying on <em>Evans, </em>determined that in light of cross-examination by Atkins\u2019s counsel, the instruction was appropriate, \u201ca correct statement of the law, applicable to the facts, and not fairly covered by the other instructions given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We granted certiorari to determine: \u201cWhether an instruction that the State need not use certain investigative and scientific techniques violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and the Maryland Declaration of Rights by undermining the defense\u2019s legitimate strategy and bolstering the State\u2019s case?\u201d <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 437, 26 A.3d at 980. We answered that the judge abused her discretion when she gave the contested \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction, \u201cbecause it resulted in a non-neutral commentary on the evidence, or the absence of evidence, actually admitted, and invaded the province of the jury, thus violating Atkins\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 26 A.3d at 980. We distinguished the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Evans, </em>because, in <em>Atkins, </em>scientific testing concerned a critical piece of physical evidence, the weapon used in the assault, while in <em>Evans </em>the failure of the State to provide forensic testing was not a crucial issue in the case. Additionally, we noted, unlike <em>Evans, </em>that Atkins did not argue lack of evidence in closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and only briefly cross-examined the police officer regarding lack of testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Within three months our opinion in <em>Stabb </em>issued, to \u201cprovide additional guidance to Bench and Bar when confronted with requests (usually from the State) for this (or a similar) type of jury instruction seeking to avert the purported \u2018CSI effect.\u2019 \u201d 423 Md. at 457, 31 A.3d at 923. Stabb had been charged with third-degree sexual assault and second-degree assault of a minor. During trial, the child testified that Stabb touched her inappropriately; the officer, who responded to the complaint, testified that he referred the minor and her mother to a social worker but did not refer the minor for medical treatment, because vaginal penetration had not been alleged. Stabb questioned the social worker during trial as to whether she had referred the minor for medical testing for evidence of a sexual assault, which had not occurred, because the victim had bathed and changed clothes by the time she was evaluated by the social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">At the end of the case, the judge gave the same instruction given in <em>Evans, Atkins, </em>and in the instant case, based upon Stabb\u2019s cross-examination and in anticipation of closing argument, after which Stabb was convicted. After the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, we granted certiorari to consider: \u201cDid the trial court err in instructing the jury that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 31 A.3d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Based on <em>Atkins, </em>we concluded in <em>Stabb </em>that the giving of an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction was error and that the existence of a \u201cCSI effect\u201d had not been empirically or legally established. We noted, rather, that \u201cCSI\u201d studies performed on mock jurors and potential jurors reported inconsistent results and were inconclusive.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Further, we determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the giving of the instruction in <em>Stabb </em>was error, because Stabb had \u201cargued properly and without undue emphasis the lack of corroborating physical evidence of the crime\u201d and permissibly alluded to the absence of corroborating physical evidence but did not imply that the \u201cmissing evidence\u201d would favor the defense, <em>id. </em>at 471-72, 31 A.3d at 932; thus, giving the instruction had improperly relieved the State of its burden and invaded the province of the jury. We concluded that due to the lack of legal and empirical evidence that a \u201cCSI effect\u201d existed, and because the giving of the instruction is \u201cfraught with the potential for reversible error,\u201d if such an instruction is requested, and is appropriate, its use should be confined to curative situations. <em>Id. </em>at 473, 31 A.3d at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Essentially, <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>counsel that in light of \u201cthe currently inconclusive state of the scholarly legal and/or scientific communities\u2019 research, taken as a whole, regarding whether such a phenomenon as the \u2018CSI effect\u2019 exists,\u201d the instruction should not be given preemptively and should be \u201cconfined to situations where it responds to correction of a pre-existing overreaching by the defense, i.e., a curative instruction.\u201d <em>Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 472-73, 31 A.3d at 933. In particular, neither cross-examination regarding whether scientific testing had been done, nor, counsel\u2019s arguments regarding lack of scientific evidence generated giving the contested instruction; the instruction, instead, in fact relieved the State of its burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In <em>Stabb, </em>we suggested the appropriateness of the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction only \u201cwhere it can be demonstrated by appropriate scholarly research that a \u2018CSI effect\u2019 has been found to exist by the relevant legal and/or scientific communities and its scope and effect can be relied upon to tailor an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>appropriate response through voir dire questions and/or jury instructions.\u201d 423 Md. at 473, 31 A.3d at 933. In the last two years since we issued our opinion in <em>Stabb, </em>legal and empirical proof of the existence of a \u201cCSI effect\u201d is still wanting.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> An article published by the American Bar Association in <em>Insights on Law &amp; Society </em>in the Fall of 2011 by an Associate Professor of Media Studies at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro described the \u201cCSI effect\u201d as \u201cmore myth than reality\u201d because \u201c[sjcholars from law and other fields have been unable to find any empirical support for an antiprosecution \u2018CSI effect\u2019 on verdicts.\u201d Kimberlianne Pod\u00edas, <em>The Verdict on Television: How Does Television Inform Our Understanding of the Legal System?, </em>12 Insights on L. &amp; Soc\u2019y 16, 19 (2011).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In a 2012 article in the <em>University of Virginia School of Law Sports &amp; Entertainment Law Journal </em>by Caroline Kinsey, a Professor and Public Interest Fellow at the University of Michigan College of Law, suggesting how prosecutors and attorneys might adjust their practices to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>accommodate heightened expectations by jurors, noted that the validity of the \u201cCSI effect\u201d had not been established.

In a 2013 monograph on forensic science in American popular culture, Lindsay Steenberg, Professor of Film Studies at Oxford Brookes University, stated that there remains no definitive proof that viewing CSI type television shows directly affects a juror\u2019s likelihood to acquit or convict, and \u201cthe panic about one specific television show stems from a small number of sources and experts, rather than wide-ranging research or investigation.\u201d Lindsay Steenberg, Forensic Science in Contemporary American Popular Culture: Gender, Crime, and Science 104 (Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group 2013). The academic and scientific community has yet to conclude that a \u201cCSI effect\u201d exists and, thus, supports our skeptical view that the \u201cCSI effect\u201d exists.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In the face of our avowed skepticism regarding the appropriate use of an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction, the State argues that the instruction in the present case was an appropriate exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion, because of Robinson\u2019s counsel\u2019s remarks in opening statement, as well as the off the record instruction colloquy, and his cross-examination of witnesses. We iterate that the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction should not be given preemptively, as was suggested in the instant case by the judge when he addressed possible closing argument by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">While it is true that Robinson\u2019s counsel opened by saying, in part, \u201c[tjhere will not be any fingerprints from any door ... [tjhere won\u2019t be his DNA on anything, not on any screwdriver, not on any weatherstripping, not on any piece of tape, not on anything. Quite frankly, there\u2019s just not, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Robinson com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>mitted these crimes,\u201d a mere reference to the lack of evidence does not trigger giving an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction. We have reflected, for example, when reference has been made by defense counsel to the lack of fingerprint evidence, that, \u201cwhen the State has failed to utilize a well-known, readily available, and superior method of proof to link the defendant with the criminal activity, the defendant ought to be able to comment on the absence of such evidence.\u201d <em>Sample v. State, </em>314 Md. 202, 207, 550 A.2d 661, 663 (1988) citing <em>Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548, 553, 419 A.2d 384, 386 (1980); <em>see Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 683, 741 A.2d 1119, 1122 (1999) (\u201cThe law of Maryland concerning nonproduction of evidence is well-established: An inference may be made against the State.\u201d). Certainly, lack of evidence is a common defense in a criminal case to generate reasonable doubt just as in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Robinson\u2019s counsel\u2019s opening statement and cross-examination merely pointed out what procedures might have been available to the State, but did not misstate the law or the State\u2019s burden. Robinson\u2019s counsel cross-examined the officers regarding whether testing had been ordered to compare the screwdrivers recovered to pry marks on the door to the apartment and whether fingerprint or DNA tests had been ordered, but did not insinuate that the State had any obligation to perform such testing or that had tests been performed, the results of such testing would have favored his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">As a result, we hold that the trial judge erred in giving the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction which effectively relieved the State of its burden to prove Robinson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.

Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In performing a harmless error analysis, we are not to find facts or weigh evidence. Instead, \"what evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u201d \" 'Once it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility beyond a reasonable doubt.' \u201d \" \u2018To say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is, rather, to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed by the record.\u2019 \" The \"harmless error rule ... has been and should be carefully circumscribed.\u201d Harmless error review is the standard of review most favorable to the defendant short of an automatic reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\"><em>Tucker v.

In other words, Robinson\u2019s counsel: (1) equated a lack of scientific evidence with a lack of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) implied that the State was required to offer scientific evidence to satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, Robinson\u2019s counsel misstated the State\u2019s burden of proof. As a result, the circuit court accurately and properly instructed the jury that \u201cthere is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A trial court does not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>discretion in giving an anti-CSI effect jury instruction after a defendant misstates the State\u2019s burden. <em>See generally Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 451, 26 A.3d 979, 988 (2011) (\u201c[Counsel ... did not incorrectly state the law or the State\u2019s burden.... There was an insufficient basis ... generating a need for a curative or cautionary jury instruction clarifying the State\u2019s burden in regards to specific investigative techniques.\u201d); <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 473, 31 A.3d 922, 933 (2011) (This Court stated that an anti-CSI effect jury instruction \u201cought to be confined to situations where it responds to correction of a pre-existing overreaching by the defense, i.e., a curative instruction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It is entirely consistent with this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>to conclude that, here, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in giving the anti-CSI effect jury instruction. In both <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb, </em>this Court expressly declined to hold that a trial court automatically abuses its discretion in giving an anti-CSI effect jury instruction. See <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 438, 26 A.3d at 980 (\u201c[W]e do not hold that an investigative or scientific techniques instruction would be improper under different circumstances!)]\u201d); <em>Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 457, 31 A.3d at 923 (\u201c \u2018[A]nti-CSI effect\u2019 or \u2018no duty\u2019 instructions are not per se improper necessarily!)]\u201d). In fact, in both <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb, </em>this Court confined its holding to the particular facts of each case. See <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 437-38, 26 A.3d at 980 (\u201cThis conclusion ... is based on the particular facts in this case[.]\u201d); <em>Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 463, 31 A.3d at 927 (\u201c[U]nder the facts of this case, the trial court abused its discretion!)]\u201d). As discussed above, the standard that this Court ultimately enunciated in <em>Stabb, id. </em>at 473, 31 A.3d at 933 \u2014 that an anti-CSI effect jury instruction is warranted \u201cwhere it responds to correction of a pre-existing overreaching by the defense, i.e., a curative instruction\u201d \u2014 applies here, where Robinson\u2019s counsel implied that the State was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>to offer scientific evidence to satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Both <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>are factually distinguishable from this case. In <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 440-41, 26 A.3d at 982, this Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in giving an anti-CSI effect jury instruction where, while cross-examining a detective, the defendant elicited that law enforcement had not tested a knife for trace evidence. Similarly, in <em>Stabb, id. </em>at 470-71, 31 A.3d at 932, this Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in giving an anti-CSI effect jury instruction where: (1) while cross-examining a detective and a social worker, the defendant elicited that law enforcement had not conducted a sexual assault forensic examination of the victim; and (2) during his closing argument, the defendant \u201ccommented on the lack of physical evidence!.]\u201d In contrast to this case, in neither <em>Atkins </em>nor <em>Stabb </em>did the defendant ever misstate the State\u2019s burden, thus necessitating a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">I am unpersuaded by any reliance on skepticism that the CSI effect exists as a basis for determining that the circuit court abused its discretion in this case. Theoretically, the CSI effect causes jurors to \u201cunrealistic[ally] expect! ]\u201d scientific evidence, and thus misleads jurors to believe that the State is required to offer scientific evidence to satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 467 n. 3, 31 A.3d at 930 n. 3. Even if the CSI effect does not exist, a defendant can nonetheless mislead jurors by representing to them that the State is required to offer scientific evidence to satisfy its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and there would be no colorable argument against giving an anti-CSI effect instruction. As explained above, here, Robinson\u2019s counsel did essentially that. Although Robinson\u2019s counsel did not explicitly tell the jury that the State is required to offer scientific evidence, Robinson\u2019s counsel insinuated as much by: (1) listing types of scientific evidence, piece by piece; and (2) in the next sentence, telling the jury there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt!.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Under these circumstances, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in giving the anti-CSI effect jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Judge McDONALD has authorized me to state that he joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">. Any conclusion that the challenged instruction in this case \u201ceffectively relieved the State of its burden to prove Robinson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u201d Majority Op. at 580, 84 A.3d at 81, is contradicted by the text of the instruction itself, which concluded with the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>that \u201c[y]our responsibility as jurors is to determine whether the State has proven based upon the evidence, the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
