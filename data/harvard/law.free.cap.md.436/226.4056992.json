Specifically, we must determine whether Maryland\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme permits a self-insurer, such as the County, to disclaim or exclude insurance coverage, in a self-insurance guarantee, where an individual causes a collision while driving under the influence of alcohol. For the below reasons, we answer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>question in the negative and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The County\u2019s Self-Insurance Policy and Guarantee</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The County is a self-insured entity approved by the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cthe MVA\u201d). For the period from February 1, 2008, to February 1, 2009, the County agreed to provide motor vehicle liability insurance for County-owned vehicles \u201ccommensurate with the provisions as set forth in Section 17-103, Transportation Article, Annotated Code of Maryland and COMAR 11.18.02.\u201d In an application for self-insurance, dated January 8, 2008, the County stated that it would provide coverage for the minimum mandatory limits for: (1) bodily injury liability; (2) uninsured motorist claims; and (3) property damage liability. The County submitted to the MVA a signed Guarantee (\u201cthe Guarantee\u201d), which provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">This guarantee is limited to payment of valid claims arising from motor vehicle accidents resulting from use or operation of covered vehicles by persons authorized to use such vehicles and occurring within the scope of such authorization. Where the use of a County vehicle is prohibited by any applicable vehicle-use policy, coverage is excluded under this Guarantee for damage of any kind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The County\u2019s self-insurance policy and Guarantee were approved by the MVA and were in effect at the time of the collision at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">In 2008, at the time of the collision at issue, there was a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cthe CBA\u201d) in effect between the County and the Fraternal Order of Police, Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>gomery County Lodge 35, Inc. (\u201cthe FOP\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Article 35 of the CBA, entitled \u201cVehicles,\u201d set forth the policies and regulations concerning personal patrol vehicles (\u201cPPVs\u201d). Relevant provisions of Article 35 include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\"><em>Section D. General. </em>Eligible officers participating in the program will be issued a police vehicle for on-duty and off-duty use subject to the regulations in this Article. All take home vehicles assigned to officers will be defined as personal patrol vehicles (PPVs). This policy pertains to all officers assigned PPVs[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\"><em>Section G. Program Regulations. </em>The following regulations apply to all participating officers as well as those officers using PPVs on a temporary basis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">2. PPVs will not be operated within four (4) hours after the officer has ingested any amount of alcohol. PPVs will not be operated after the officer has ingested any drug that impairs his ability to operate the vehicle. No alcoholic beverages will be carried in the PPV except when they are seized as evidence or contraband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">7. The PPV will not be used to carry excessively large or heavy loads or objects which protrude from the trunk or windows, except when required in the performance of official duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">\n<em>Section H.

All officers will use seat belts when operating or riding in County motor vehicles, except when an officer\u2019s duties necessitate frequent exiting from the vehicle (i.e., checking stores within the same shopping complex)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">On May 9, 2008, at approximately 1:25 a.m., Respondent was operating a PPV, while off-dnty, and was involved in a single-vehicle collision, which damaged the PPV and resulted in financial loss to the County. At the time of the collision, Respondent was under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent was arrested, charged with multiple alcohol-related crimes, and pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. Respondent received eighteen months of probation before judgment. The Montgomery County Police Department issued against Respondent administrative charges, which resulted in department-imposed penalties, including an eighty-hour suspension without pay<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the requirement that Respondent successfully complete a stress and alcohol intervention program. As a result of the collision, the PPV was damaged and the County had to pay a total of $8,797.05, including $8,522.05 in repairs and $275 for towing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Shortly after the collision, through his union representative, Respondent filed a grievance against the County, seeking a determination that the CBA precluded the County from obtaining damages against him for the cost of repairs to the PPV. The grievance went to arbitration. The arbitrator decided that he could not determine whether the County was entitled to recover damages against Respondent, as the matter needed to be resolved through a civil action rather than an administrative action. The parties agreed that the arbitrator would retain jurisdiction, but that the County could seek a civil judgment against Respondent, and if the County succeeded, the FOP could seek to reopen arbitration to determine whether the CBA permitted the civil judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On August 3, 2010, in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Montgomery County (\u201cthe district court\u201d), the County filed a complaint against Respondent seeking to recover, the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>repairs to the PPV, and on October 14, 2010, the County filed an amended complaint in the district court, seeking the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">On October 19, 2011, the district court conducted a one-day trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On November 4, 2011, the district court ruled that the County, as a self-insurer, was entitled to relief and could recover damages against Respondent based on the \u201cexclusion/restriction\u201d of coverage in the Guarantee. The district court granted judgment in favor of the County in the amount of $8,797.05, plus court costs in the amount of $78.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Respondent noted an appeal to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d). Following a hearing, the circuit court reversed the judgment of the district court and entered judgment in favor of Respondent, ruling from the bench, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">[T]he District Court erred in finding that this was a permissive use exclusion that permitted the County to proceed and subrogate its claim against [Respondent]. I do not find that this is a permissive use exclusion which would preclude [Respondent] from being protected against [a] claim by the County. That the extension of this would deny coverage of anyone who was injured by an operator of a County vehicle who\u2019s using and operating that County vehicle happened to be driving drunk at the time would exclude that. And that\u2019s clearly contrary to the applicable law and I do not find that this is a permissive use exclusion that allows the County to proceed or subrogate[e] against [Respondent],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Thereafter, the County filed with this Court a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted on March 22, 2013. <em>See Montgomery Cnty. v. Distil, </em>430 Md. 644, 62 A.3d 730 (2013).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The County contends that it may recover damages from an employee where the employee operates a county-owned vehicle contrary to an applicable vehicle use policy. The County argues that the Guarantee: (1) provides coverage for claims arising from motor vehicle collisions resulting from \u201cuse or operation of a covered vehicle by a persons authorized to use such vehicle and occurring within the scope of such authorization\u201d; and (2) excludes coverage where the use of the County vehicle is prohibited by any applicable vehicle use policy. The County asserts that the CBA contains the applicable vehicle use policy that excludes coverage where an officer operates a PPV after consuming alcohol. The County maintains that, because the MVA approved and accepted the Guarantee, with the restriction, coverage is excluded, and it is entitled to seek damages from Respondent, regardless of whether the restriction is authorized by the General Assembly or reduces insurance coverage below that required under Maryland\u2019s compulsory insurance statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Respondent replies that contractual restrictions or exclusions in automobile insurance policies that reduce insurance coverage below that required by Maryland\u2019s compulsory automobile insurance laws, and that are not expressly authorized as exceptions by the General Assembly, are invalid and unenforceable. Respondent contends that \u201cMaryland law does not allow an insurer to exclude insurance coverage because the insured was driving under the influence\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>the General Assembly has not promulgated an exception to insurance coverage to exclude coverage for those driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Respondent contends that a self-insurer, such as the County, may not exclude coverage for its insured\u2019s operation of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, as such an exclusion would be against public policy. Moreover, Respondent asserts that the Guarantee\u2019s exclusion of coverage \u2014 stating that \u201cthe use of a County vehicle is prohibited by any applicable vehicle-use policy\u201d \u2014 is too broad and neither specifically identifies the CBA, or any section of the CBA, as containing a vehicle use policy, nor specifically prohibits driving after consuming alcohol. Respondent maintains that the CBA sets forth in different sections many procedures that an officer is to follow, and that none of the sections is identified as a vehicle use policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In a reply brief, the County responds that the applicable vehicle use policy is contained at Section G of Article 35 of the CBA, which sets forth \u201cthe scope of the permitted use of a police vehicle!,]\u201d and that the vehicle use policy does not include other sections such as Section H, \u201cwhich designates certain procedures that the officer is to follow when he or she is operating a police vehicle within the scope of permission.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In <em>Marwani v. Catering by Uptown, </em>416 Md. 312, 318-19, 6 A.3d 928, 931 (2010), we explained the standard of review applicable in cases on appeal from the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">[We] will set aside the judgment of a court based on the factual finding of that court only when those findings are clearly erroneous.

Nonetheless, we agree that the County may not recover the cost of repairs from Respondent; stated otherwise, we are satisfied that the Guarantee purporting to exclude coverage is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The County effectively failed to include the alcohol exclusion in the Guarantee. On their face and by their plain language, the County\u2019s self-insurance application and Guarantee contain nothing that purports to exclude coverage of an authorized individual who operates an insured vehicle after consuming alcohol or while under the influence of alcohol. Neither the self-insurance application nor the Guarantee mentions the word \u201calcohol\u201d or contains an express provision disclaiming all insurance coverage in the event that an authorized individual operates the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Moreover, the language \u201cany applicable vehicle-use policy\u201d is overly broad, and fails to identify with any specificity which vehicle use policies apply or where the applicable vehicle use polices being referenced may be located. The County\u2019s self-insurance policy and Guarantee cover all County vehicles, not just PPVs used by police officers. As such, the \u201capplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>vehicle-use policy\u201d could potentially refer to any number of different policies for different groups of County employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In particular, neither the Guarantee nor the self-insurance application specifically references or identifies the CBA, Article 35 of the CBA, or the regulation in Section G of Article 35 prohibiting driving within four hours of consuming alcohol as the vehicle use policy pertaining to police officers. And, equally troubling, nothing in the CBA or Article 35 of the CBA is explicitly termed a \u201cvehicle-use policy.\u201d As such, a review of the Guarantee would not result in notice that it refers to the CBA, and a review of the CBA would not result in notice that Article 35, and specifically Section G, constitutes a \u201cvehicle-use policy\u201d to which the County refers in the Guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Nonetheless, the County contends that the applicable vehicle use policy is contained solely at Section G of Article 35 of the CBA, and does not include Section H. We find this contention to be nonsensical. Section G is entitled \u201cProgram Regulations,\u201d whereas Section H is entitled \u201cPPV Operating Procedures.\u201d Both sections contain restrictions on the use and operation of PPVs. For example, item 2 of Section G provides: \u201cPPVs will not be operated within four (4) hours after the officer has ingested any amount of alcohol.\u201d Item 5 of Section H provides: \u201cAll officers will use seat belts when operating or riding in County motor vehicles[.]\u201d Both items refer to the operation of PPVs and are contained in Article 35 concerning \u201cVehicles.\u201d At oral argument, the County attempted to distinguish Section G from Section H, and maintained that not wearing a seat belt would not result in a lack of insurance coverage as would driving within four hours of consuming alcohol. As the Honorable Lynne A. Battaglia so aptly pointed out, however: \u201cHow would somebody who is a police officer ... know which one of these things [Section G or Section H] that ... he\u2019s operating under, which one will obviate the County\u2019s responsibility and which won\u2019t?\u201d The simple answer is that a police officer would not know based on the plain language of the self-insurance application, Guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>tee, and CBA which actions would result in a disclaimer of all insurance coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Case law is clear that \u201c[i]f a self-insurer desires a particular exclusion or restriction, the self-insurer should put it in its application\u201d or guarantee. <em>BGE Home, </em>377 Md. at 250, 833 A.2d at 16. In the absence of any statement or indication whatsoever that the \u201capplicable vehicle-use policy\u201d could be found in the CBA and consisted specifically of the provisions of Section G of Article 35 of the CBA \u2014 and only the provisions of Section G \u2014 the County failed to effectively include the alcohol exclusion in the Guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Our inquiry does not end there. Given the gravity of the question, we address head-on the issue of whether the County may exclude coverage where an employee causes a collision after consuming alcohol, and conclude that such an exclusion is not valid under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Undeniably, the exclusion in the Guarantee violates Maryland\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme by reducing insurance coverage below the mandatory m\u00ednimums (and, in fact, eliminating all coverage) in the absence of express approval by the General Assembly. In other words, because the County, as self-insurer, seeks to deny coverage to Respondent and essentially render him uninsured at the time of the collision, the exclusion reduces coverage below the statutory minimum levels in effect at the time of the collision. <em>See, e.g., Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 311, 841 A.2d at 864 (\u201c[T]he requirement that every driver maintain at least the[ ] minimum levels of motor vehicle insurance [pursuant to Transp. \u00a7 17-103] remains an integral part of Maryland statutory law and public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>policy.\u201d); <em>BGE Home, </em>377 Md. at 238, 833 A.2d at 9-10 (\u201c[T]he Maryland statutory provisions regulating motor vehicle insurance are comprehensive ... [and] mandate compulsory motor vehicle insurance or approved self-insurance[.]\u201d (Citations omitted) (omission and second alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Moreover, an exclusion of coverage for driving while under the influence, or driving within four hours of consuming alcohol, has not been expressly authorized by the General Assembly. The County has not identified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATV\">any Maryland statute that either expressly or impliedly gives insurers the authority to add such an exclusion to their insurance contracts, and thereby reduce or eliminate benefits below the statutory minimum levels. Upon review of title 17 of the Transportation Article and title 19 of the Insurance Article of the Maryland Code, we ... are unable to find any such provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 316-17, 841 A.2d at 868 (footnote omitted). Indeed, nothing within the applicable titles of the Maryland Code indicates an intent on the part of the General Assembly to permit insurers to deny or disclaim insurance coverage to otherwise insured individuals based on their blood-alcohol concentration level at the time of a collision. We know of no \u201cdrunk driving exclusion\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which would validate the exclusion in the instant case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The County\u2019s public policy arguments are unpersuasive. In its brief, the County argues that public policy interests concerning liability coverage are not implicated by exclusion of coverage under the circumstances presented in this case because \u201cthis case does not involve compensation for injured victims or third parties\u201d or \u201cfor property damage of others.\u201d Yet, at oral argument, the County took the position that it would not have been required to defend and indemnify Respondent if a third party had been involved in the collision because Respondent \u201cwas operating outside the scope of the authority and permission\u201d granted to him. The County acknowledged that, under such a circumstance, Respondent would have been rendered uninsured and would not have been entitled to insurance coverage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">For obvious reasons, the County\u2019s position has troubling consequences. Maryland\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme has many purposes, including \u201cassuring] that victims of automobile accidents have a guaranteed avenue of financial redress[,]\u201d <em>Rentals Unlimited, </em>101 Md.App. at 660, 647 A.2d at 1282 (citation omitted), and generally providing \u201ccoverage for the payment of liability claims.\u201d <em>Larimore, </em>314 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Md. at 619, 552 A.2d at 889 (citation omitted). Although it is true that the instant case does not involve third-party injury, as revealed by the County\u2019s stated position at oral argument, the County would disclaim coverage even in those circumstances where a third party is involved \u2014 extending the exclusion from accidents involving only the County employee to accidents involving innocent third parties. Such a position directly conflicts with Maryland\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme and undermines the spirit and purpose of the insurance scheme, namely, \u201cto give innocent third parties a source of private sector insurance funds from which to obtain compensation for their injuries.\u201d <em>Enter. Leasing Co., </em>341 Md. at 549, 671 A.2d at 514 (citations omitted). Were we to accept the County\u2019s position, we would essentially exclude a group of individuals from insurance coverage and leave innocent third parties without the ability to sue the insurer for redress and compensation for their injuries. We refuse to do so, as this would violate public policy. We reaffirm that restrictions, exclusions, or clauses \u201cthat excuse or reduce benefits below the minimum statutorily required levels or types of insurance, and are not expressly authorized by the General Assembly, are invalid[,]\u201d <em>Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 303, 841 A.2d at 860, as are any clauses that are against public policy. <em>See Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 356, 488 A.2d at 168. The exclusion in the Guarantee at issue is invalid on both counts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We reject the County\u2019s argument that <em>BGE Home </em>stands for the proposition that a self-insured entity may include any exclusion or restriction it desires into a guarantee and the restriction shall be enforceable as long as it is included in the guarantee. In <em>BGE Home, </em>377 Md. at 250, 833 A.2d at 16, we stated: \u201cIf a self-insurer desires a particular exclusion or restriction, the self-insurer should put it in its application. The exclusion or restriction will then have the same status as an exclusion or restriction in a motor vehicle insurance policy.\u201d Nothing in <em>BGE Home </em>supports the leap of logic that an exclusion in a guarantee that contravenes the compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme is valid. Indeed, we recognized that \u201ceven when exclusions from or restrictions on required coverages are expressly set forth in a motor vehicle insurance policy, Maryland law generally deems most of these exclusions or restrictions void if they were not specifically authorized by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 833 A.2d at 15 (citations omitted). Thus, <em>BGE Home </em>does not save the exclusion at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We are likewise not persuaded by the County\u2019s reliance on <em>Consumers Life Ins. Co. v. Smith, </em>86 Md.App. 570, 587 A.2d 1119, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 185, 592 A.2d 178 (1991), a case involving a life insurance policy. In <em>Consumers Life Ins., </em>86 Md.App. at 572, 587 A.2d at 1120, the insured was killed in a single-car accident that occurred when he operated his vehicle while intoxicated. The insurer propounded a public policy argument \u2014 that a \u201cbeneficiary should not recover because the Maryland Legislature has acted to deter a person who has consumed alcohol from driving on Maryland\u2019s highways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 587 A.2d at 1122 (citation omitted). In resolving the issue, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We find nothing in the enactments of the General Assembly relative to insurance to indicate that we are expected as a matter of public policy to deny recovery to a beneficiary of an accident insurance policy because the insured drove a vehicle while intoxicated. If insurance companies desire to avoid liability on such ground, they are free to insert a clause in their policies to that effect. Such a clause would be valid and binding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 577, 587 A.2d at 1122-23 (citation omitted). Although the statement above may govern life insurance policies, and specifically accidental death and dismemberment policies, for one very critical reason, it has no bearing whatsoever on the instant case involving motor vehicle insurance. Unlike life insurance and attendant policies, motor vehicle insurance is mandatory under Maryland law. <em>See BGE Home, </em>377 Md. at 239, 833 A.2d at 10. In other words, although an individual may or may not opt to purchase a life insurance policy, under Maryland\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme, an individual is required to purchase motor vehicle insurance for his or her vehicle meeting the statutory minimum coverages. Thus, the County\u2019s contention that <em>Consumers Life Ins. </em>is \u201cdispositive of the issue\u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Before concluding, we pause to explain that the clause in the Guarantee is, indeed, an \u201cexclusion\u201d rather than an omnibus clause or a permissive use clause. An omnibus clause is an overarching clause contained in an automobile insurance policy that \u201cextends coverage to a third party who operates the vehicle within the permission of the named insured.\u201d <em>Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 315, 841 A.2d at 867 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he dominant purpose of an omnibus clause is an intent to extend coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 841 A.2d at 867 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe purpose of an omnibus clause is to protect the named insured, the persons within the omnibus clause, and the public generally and its members injured by the negligent operation of the insured automobile on a public highway.\u201d <em>Agency Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>193 Md.App. 666, 673, 998 A.2d 936, 940 (2010) (citation and internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>omitted). In <em>Agency Ins. Co., id. </em>at 673, 998 A.2d at 940, the Court of Special Appeals described the \u201cobjectives\u201d served by an omnibus clause, including providing: (1) \u201cthe injured person a right to proceed against the insurer in cases in which the insurer would not otherwise be liable because the automobile was not driven by the original insured\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe additional insured the protection of automobile liability insurance without his having procured such a policy[.]\u201d (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">A permissive use clause \u201climits the coverage under the omnibus clause to claims that arise while the third party is operating the vehicle within the scope of the permission granted by the named insured.\u201d <em>Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 316 n. 10, 841 A.2d at 867 n. 10.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Permissive use clauses typically require that \u201cthe vehicle must be used for a purpose reasonably within the scope of the permission granted, within the time limits imposed or contemplated by the parties, and operated within geographical limits so contemplated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316 n. 10, 841 A.2d at 867 n. 10 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>In contrast, an exclusion in an automobile insurance policy excludes coverage under certain delineated circumstances. <em>See generally id. </em>at 304-05, 841 A.2d at 860-61. An exclusion typically utilizes the word \u201cexclusion\u201d or some variation thereof. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 304-05, 841 A.2d at 860-61; <em>Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 354, 488 A.2d at 167.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The clause of the Guarantee at issue \u2014 \u201cWhere the use of a County vehicle is prohibited by any applicable vehicle-use policy, coverage is excluded under this Guarantee for damage of any kind\u201d \u2014 is an exclusion. The clause is certainly not an omnibus clause because it does not extend coverage to third parties, or otherwise evince an intent to extend coverage or to provide added protection for third parties. In fact, the clause does exactly the opposite \u2014 it limits or eradicates all coverage under certain circumstances. The clause is also not a permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sive use clause because it does not purport to limit coverage to claims arising when the third party operates the vehicle within the \u201cscope\u201d of permission granted or authorized. Rather, the immediate previous clause in the Guarantee contains permissive use language limiting coverage to \u201cvalid claims arising from motor vehicle accidents resulting from use or operation of covered vehicles by persons authorized to use such vehicles and occurring within the scope of such authorization.\u201d Tellingly, the clause at issue explicitly provides that \u201ccoverage is excluded\u201d where \u201cthe use of a County vehicle is prohibited by any applicable vehicle-use policy[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). As with the \u201cpizza exclusion\u201d and \u201chousehold exclusion,\u201d the \u201cvehicle-use policy exclusion,\u201d or more specifically as utilized in this case, the \u201cdrunk driving exclusion,\u201d excludes all coverage under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we have no difficulty in treating the clause at issue as an exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In summary, we hold that the exclusion in the Guarantee-purportedly excluding or disclaiming all insurance coverage on the basis that Respondent operated his PPV under the influence of alcohol-is invalid because it violates Maryland\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme, is not expressly authorized by the General Assembly, and is against public policy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Bloom, </em>847 N.E.2d 175, 179 (Ind.2006), in which the Supreme Court of Indiana held that \"a self-insured employer who furnishes its vehicle for use by an employee has a duty to inform its employee of the limits of the employer's statutory obligation to third parties and the employee\u2019s potential exposure for negligent operation of the vehicle.\u201d The Court concluded that \u201cfailure to perform this duty imposes an obligation to indemnify and defend the employee against liability arising out of the employee\u2019s permissive use of the employer's vehicle, and precludes the employer from asserting indemnity or subrogation rights against the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response to Judge Adkins's question, the County acknowledged that it did not notify Respondent \"in any specific way\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that he would need to carry his own insurance. As such, under the County's construction and application of the self-insurance policy and Guarantee, Respondent was rendered uninsured and was not afforded an opportunity to obtain his own insurance policy to provide for the payment of liability claims. Such an application is clearly against public policy and violates the compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme established by the General Assembly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b280-5\">.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We have described permissive use clauses in further detail as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">A \"scope of permission\u201d or \"permissive user\u201d clause limits coverage under an omnibus clause to claims that arise while the third party is operating the vehicle within the scope of the permission granted by the named insured.

In his brief, Respondent contended that the circuit court properly determined that the County, as a self-insurer, may not subrogate against him because he was insured under the self-insurance policy and Guarantee even while operating the PPV after consuming alcohol. The County responded that subrogation is not at issue in the case because Respondent was not insured under the self-insurance policy; <em>i.e., </em>because Respondent was not insured due to his violation of the vehicle use policy, the County is not suing itself to recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We agree with Respondent that it is well-settled that an insurer may not recover from its insured as subrogee. <em>See Rausch v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>388 Md. 690, 701, 882 A.2d 801, 807 (2005). In light of our determination that the exclusion is invalid, and in the absence of any other reason advanced by the County as to why Respondent would be denied coverage under the self-insurance policy, we conclude that Respondent was, in fact, covered at the time of the collision. Accordingly, the County, as insurer, may not recover damages from Respondent, its insured, as doing so would violate the anti-subrogation rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b283-6\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">I dissent.

By the combination of the two provisions, Officer Distel\u2019s misconduct caused him to cease to be an insured, for purposes of the self-insurance guarantee, as to the County\u2019s claim against him in this case. That being said, I would not credit the County\u2019s argument had it sought to render Officer Distel an uninsured for violation of some of the less meaningful permitted use restrictions in the policy, especially where any such violation was not a proximate cause of the accident and resultant damages. What it comes down to (putting aside the keen legal analysis of the Majority opinion) is just common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Like the Majority, but for different reasons, I would not reach the question of interpreting the collective bargaining agreement and, instead, leave it to the resumption of the arbitration of Officer Distel\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">.
