Mr. Roberts, at the time of his injury, was working in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>a \u201clight duty\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> position with the Fire Department, due to problems related to a prior compensable back injury and was assigned to Fire Department Headquarters, located in Rock-ville, as opposed to his \u201cregular duty\u201d station, which was Fire Station 19. While on light duty, Mr. Roberts worked four ten-hour shifts per week, starting at 7 a.m. and ending at 5 p.m. Mr. Roberts, as with other firefighters including those on light duty, were encouraged by the Fire Department to engage in two hours of physical training per shift, was paid during those two hours, and could physically train at any location of his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">While Mr. Roberts was on light duty, approximately once per month, he would \u201cstop by\u201d Fire Station 19 to pick up his \u201cwork mail,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> left for him at that location, \u201cwhich included things such as interoffice memos and letters from Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Human Resources,\u201d and was a practice observed by firefighters on light duty, about which Mr. Roberts\u2019s supervisors were aware.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the day of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Roberts\u2019s accident and resulting injury, he arrived at Friendly High School around 7 a.m. and trained until 8:30 a.m., at which time he left and traveled to gather the mail at Fire Station 19. En route, at approximately 9:15 a.m., Mr. Roberts was involved in the accident that is the genesis of the instant case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Montgomery County contested Mr. Roberts\u2019s claim at the Commission,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> alleging that Mr. Roberts\u2019s injury did not arise out of or in the course of his employment, among other issues not before us.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission, after a hearing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> disallowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Mr. Roberts\u2019s claim in an order, which, in relevant part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">The Commission finds on the first issue that the claimant did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment as alleged to have occurred on October 28, 2010. Therefore, the remaining issues are not applicable, and the Commission will disallow the claim filed herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Mr. Roberts then filed a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review,\u201d as well as a \u201cRequest for Jury Trial,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and, thereafter, a Motion for Summary Judgment. The County responded and denied liability, as well as filed an Opposition to Claimant\u2019s Motion for Summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Judgment and a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, in which it alleged that Mr. Roberts\u2019s injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment, because he was \u201cgoing and coming\u201d to work at the time of his injury: \u201cHe was not traveling between two sections of the Employer\u2019s premises, nor was he injured in an employer-provided parking lot. He was simply on his way to work, driving his own motorcycle. None of the exceptions set forth in <em>[Board of County Commissioners for Frederick County v. Vache, </em>349 Md. 526, 709 A.2d 155 (1998)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] apply, and his claim is barred by the going and coming rule.\u201d Mr. Roberts countered that his injury was compensable, because \u201cbut for\u201d his \u201cwork-related duties of physical training and receiving his work mail, he would not have been travelling [sic] between Friendly High School and Station 19,\u201d and he was in a place he could reasonably be expected to be in going from one \u201cwork-related duty\u201d of physical training, to another, checking his work mail, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>was \u201cacquiesced to by Mr. Roberts\u2019s supervisors.\u201d The Circuit Court granted the County\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment denying Mr. Roberts\u2019s claim, ruling orally and later in writing that Mr. Roberts was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation, because the injury occurred while \u201che was coming and going\u201d to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Mr. Roberts noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, of which a panel, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court, over a dissent by Judge Albert Matricciani. The majority of the three-judge panel of the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the County and determined that Mr. Roberts was only \u201cat work\u201d when he was at Headquarters, so that his injury was not compensable, because he was going to work at the time of his accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsF\">Although Roberts\u2019s schedule on October 28, 2010, consisted of four 10-hour shifts per week, beginning at 7 a.m. and ending at 5 p.m., and his pay for the day began at 7 a.m., he did not report to work at the Rockville headquarters because he \u201cnever made it.\u201d We deduce from this evidence that although Roberts was paid for ten hours per day, he was \u201cat work\u201d only when he was at the Rockville Headquarters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The majority, moreover, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Although Roberts and his co-workers check their mail periodically and their supervisors \u201cwere aware of the practice,\u201d neither party provided evidence to show that checking work-related mail was an official part of the employees\u2019 work duties rather than waiting until it was forwarded to their place of assignment. Thus, we presume that employees were permitted to check their mail on their own time and at their own risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">In addition, in this case, Roberts was injured while on his way to Station 19 to pick up his office mail. There may have been a different outcome if Roberts had been injured while picking up his mail at Station 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Judge Matricciani, however, was \u201cunpersuaded that Roberts was \u2018at work\u2019 only when present at the Rockville Headquar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ters, as the majority indicates----His work day began at 7 a.m. and continued to 5 p.m.,\u201d and further opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">Reasonable minds can differ as to whether appellant was \u201cgoing\u201d to work when he was injured. In my judgment, he would not have been injured \u201cbut for\u201d his efforts to keep abreast of his work obligations and, thus, the \u201cpositional risk\u201d test favors him under these circumstances. <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 9-10 [690 A.2d 990] (1997) (\u201cAn injury is said to \u2018arise out of one\u2019s employment when it results from some obligation, condition, or incident of the employment.\u201d); <em>see also Livering v. Richardson\u2019s Rest., </em>374 Md. 566, 575 [823 A.2d 687] (2003) (\u201cThe positional-risk test is essentially a \u2018but for\u2019 test\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We granted certiorari, <em>Roberts v. Montgomery County, </em>431 Md. 444, 66 A.3d 47 (2013), to consider the following questions:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">1. A compensable workers\u2019 compensation injury is one that occurs in a place the employee would not have been \u201cbut for\u201d his employment and while engaged in an activity incident to his employment. Mr. Roberts was involved in a car accident while he was already on duty, being paid, and traveling between his employer-encouraged physical training session and the firehouse where he worked. Did the majority in the Court of Special Appeals err in upholding the denial of workers\u2019 compensation to Mr. Roberts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">2. The \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule bars workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that occur while an employee is on his way to or from his job at the beginning or end of the day, or for a lunch period. Mr. Roberts was involved in a car accident while he was already on duty, being paid, and traveling between his employer-encouraged physical training session and the firehouse where he worked. Did the majority in the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule bars Mr. Roberts\u2019 entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">3. Did the majority in the Court of Special Appeals below err in upholding the denial of workers\u2019 compensation to Mr. Roberts, where its decision was premised on facts not contained in the record?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In considering these questions, we must determine whether, as a matter of law, Mr. Roberts sustained a \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We will hold he did and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, located at Sections 9-101 through 9-1201 of the Labor and Employment Article, was intended \u201c \u2018to protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries by providing workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 368, 377, 61 A.3d 33, 38 (2013), quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 61, 31 A.3d 191, 195 (2011), quoting in turn <em>Howard County Assoc. for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 531, 418 A.2d 1210, 1214 (1980). The Act is remedial in nature and must be interpreted as such, \u201c \u2018in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deibler, </em>423 Md. at 61, 31 A.3d at 195, quoting <em>Design Kitchen &amp; Baths v. Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 724, 882 A.2d 817, 821 (2005), quoting in turn <em>Harris v. Board of Education of Howard County, </em>375 Md. 21, 57, 825 A.2d 365, 387 (2003); <em>see </em>Section 9-102(a) of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cThis title shall be construed to carry out its general purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Section 9-501 (a) of the Labor and Employment Article, in pertinent part, provides that \u201ceach employer of a covered employee shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to ... the covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accidental per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sonal injury is defined in Section 9 \u2014 101(b)(1) of the Labor and Employment Article as that which \u201carises out of and in the course of employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">\u201cArises out of\u2019 relates to the causal connection between the employment and the injury. <em>Livering v. Richardson\u2019s Restaurant, </em>374 Md. 566, 574, 823 A.2d 687, 692 (2003). \u201cIn the course of\u2019 refers to the \u201ctime, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 11, 690 A.2d 990, 995 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Under the \u201cpositional-risk\u201d test, as adopted in <em>Mulready v. University Research Corp., </em>360 Md. 51, 66, 756 A.2d 575, 583 (2000) and refined in <em>Livering, </em>374 Md. at 575, 823 A.2d at 692-93, the inquiry is whether the injury would have been sustained, \u201cbut for\u201d the fact that the conditions and obligations of employment placed the employee where the injury occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">The positional-risk test is essentially a \u201cbut for\u201d test. Professor Larson succinctly states the test as follows: \u201cAn injury arises out of the employment if it would not have occurred <em>but for </em>the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed [the employee] in the position where he [or she] was injured.\u201d A. Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 3.05 (2002); <em>see also </em>J.D. Ingram, <em>The Meaning of \u201cArising Out of\u2019 Employment in Illinois Work</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>ers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>29 J. Marshall L.Rev. 153, 158 (1995) (noting that under the positional-risk test \u201can injury is compensable if it would not have happened \u2018but for\u2019 the fact that the conditions or obligations of the employment put the claimant in the position where he was injured\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1d\"><em>Livering, </em>374 Md. at 575, 823 A.2d at 692 (alterations and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The positional-risk test is adduced generally in the situation where an employee is injured while engaging in activities incidental to employment. <em>See 2 </em>Modern Workers Compensation \u00a7 114:10 (1993) (\u201cIf the injury does not have an inherent connection with the employment, the positional risk or but for test is applied to determine whether a sufficient nexus exists between the injury and the employment such that the injury is deemed to have arisen out of the employment.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In <em>Mulready, </em>for example, we concluded that an allegation of injury to a traveling employee caused by a slip and fall in a hotel bathroom while attending a seminar in Canada, at the behest of her employer, arose out of her employment, because \u201cbut for\u201d the travel required by her employer she would not have been injured. In <em>Livening, </em>the positional-risk test covered the situation in which an employee, enjoying a day off, visited the restaurant at which she was employed and was injured after checking her work schedule, because she \u201cwould not have been injured but for the fact that she visited the restaurant to confirm her schedule.\u201d <em>Livering, </em>374 Md. at 580, 823 A.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In the present case, Mr. Roberts argues that \u201cbut for\u201d his participation in employer-encouraged physical exercise at Friendly High School and gathering up his work mail at Fire Station 19, with the employer\u2019s acquiescence, he would not have been traveling between the two sites when he was injured. The County, however, disagrees and posits that the going and coming rule defeats compensability, because Mr. Roberts was not at his work site until he reached Headquarters, even though, it concedes that any injury sustained during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>physical training at Friendly High School would have been covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, equating those premises to a work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The going and coming rule provides that injuries sustained by employees commuting to and from a fixed site of employment, \u201care generally not considered to arise out of and in the course of employment and are, therefore, not compensable under the Act.\u201d <em>Morris v. Board of Education of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>339 Md. 374, 379, 663 A.2d 578, 582 (1995), citing <em>Alitalia, </em>329 Md. at 44, 617 A.2d at 573-74; <em>see Salomon v. State, </em>250 Md. 150, 154, 242 A.2d 126, 129 (1968) (claimant \u201cwas simply going to her place of employment\u201d); <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corp., </em>242 Md. 299, 301, 219 A.2d 43, 44 (1966) (claimant \u201cinjured on a public highway while driving in his own car from his home to his place of employment\u201d). The rule is premised on the idea that compensation in such situations is not warranted, because \u201c \u2018getting to work is considered to be an employee\u2019s own responsibility and ordinarily does not involve advancing the employer\u2019s interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of County Commissioners for Frederick County v. Vache, </em>349 Md. 526, 531-32, 709 A.2d 155, 158 (1998), quoting <em>Morris, </em>339 Md. at 380, 663 A.2d at 580, citing in turn <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 660 A.2d 423 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The rub, then, is whether the positional risk test holds sway or the going and coming rule does. Although the County concedes that Mr. Roberts had been at Friendly High School for a work-related purpose, because he was engaging in physical training encouraged by the County, it asserts Fire Station 19 was not a work-related site; the work site it adopts, for the purposes of the going and coming rule, is Headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We disagree with the County\u2019s assertion that Fire Station 19 was not a work-related site to which Mr. Roberts was traveling, because the mail he was picking up was that left for him at the site and the practice of gathering the mail was one about which his supervisors were aware. As a result, the County \u201cacquiesced\u201d in Mr. Roberts\u2019s act of gathering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>mail at Fire Station 19. <em>See Livering, </em>374 Md. at 580, 823 A.2d at 695. Acquiescence, we have noted, is to \u201c \u2018give an implied consent ... to any act, by one\u2019s mere silence, or without express assent or acknowledgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Osztreicher v. Juanteguy, </em>338 Md. 528, 534, 659 A.2d 1278, 1281 (1995), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 22 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Mr. Roberts, thus, was en route from a work-related activity to a site where he was to engage in a work-related act, to which the employer acquiesced. His travel, therefore, was incidental to his employment. Travel incidental to employment cannot be excluded from coverage by application of the going and coming rule.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As a result, the injury he sustained is covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, because \u201cbut for\u201d his travel between work-related sites he would not have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In our analysis, we find succor in opinions of our sister states, such as <em>Jones v. Xtreme Pizza, </em>97 Ark. App. 206, 245 S.W.3d 670, 673-74 (2006) (\u201cIn the simplest terms, the going- and-coming rule does not preclude an award of benefits here because this is not a going-and-coming case____ Instead, Jones was where he was when the accident happened due to his employment-related activities.\u201d) (citing <em>Moncus v.

In its brief and during the course of oral argument before us, Montgomery County interposed the notion that Mr. Roberts did not have permission to visit Fire Station 19 and that Mr. Roberts was engaged in a \u201cfrolic\u201d or \u201cdetour\u201d at the time of his injury. In so doing, the County is apparently invoking notions reflected in <em>Atlantic Refining Co. v. Forrester, </em>180 Md. 517, 25 A.2d 667 (1942) and <em>Garrity v. Injured Workers' Insurance Fund, </em>203 Md.App. 285, 37 A.3d 1053 (2012), where compensation was denied. The County, though, had not raised the issues of permission or \"frolic and detour\u201d below so we do not consider the issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\">. A firefighter is placed on \"light duty,\u201d when he or she cannot \"physically perform the tasks of his job or meet the demands of working as a firefighter\u201d and is assigned to \"performing less physically strenuous tasks.\u201d <em>See Montgomery County v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 58, 31 A.3d 191, 193 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. Mr. Roberts testified before the Commission that he traveled to Fire Station 19 to check to see if he had any \"office mail.\u201d In the affidavit attached to his Motion for Summary Judgment filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Mr. Roberts averred that he was traveling to Fire Station 19 to pick up his \"work mail, which included things such as interoffice memos and letters from Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Human Resources.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. During the hearing before the Commission, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">[MR. ROBERTS\u2019S ATTORNEY]: How often would you go to the station before you would go to light duty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">[MR. ROBERTS]: About every month or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">[MR. ROBERTS'S ATTORNEY]: What\u2019s the specific reason you would need to stop at the station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">[MR. ROBERTS]: To go by there and check and see if I had any office mail or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">[MR. ROBERTS\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So mail that\u2019s directed to you would go to a slot or a box at the station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>[MR. ROBERTS]: Yes, my officer would put it in my box.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In his Summary Judgment affidavit, Mr. Roberts stated: \u201cApproximately once a month, while I was on light duty, I would stop by my fire station to pick up my work mail.... I received no personal mail at the fire station. Other fire fighters on light duty would also do this and my supervisors were aware of the practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. Mr. Roberts\u2019s Summary Judgment affidavit in its totality, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">1. I have been a paid career Montgomery County firefighter since 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">2. On October 28, 2010, I was working in a \"light duty\u201d position with the Montgomery County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, due to problems related to my 2004 compensable back injury at work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">3. At the time of my injury on October 28, 2010 my schedule consisted of four 10-hour shifts per week, beginning at 7 a.m. and ending at 5 p.m. On October 28, 2010, my shift, and my pay for the day, began at 7 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">4. All fire fighters, including those on \u201clight duty,\u201d are encouraged by their supervisors and allowed to do two hours of physical training during their 10-hour shifts. This physical training can be done at any place of the fire fighter's choosing. The amount of physical training a fire fighter does is significant on the fire fighter's yearly performance appraisal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">5. On October 28, 2010, I went to Friendly High School to use the school's track to walk laps for physical training. I arrived there shortly before 7 a.m., when my shift started and my pay for the day began.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">6. Approximately once a month, while I was on light duty, I would stop by my fire station to pick up my work mail, which included things such as interoffice memos and letters from Montgomery County's Department of Human Resources. I received no personal mail at the fire station. Other fire fighters on light duty would also do this and my supervisors were aware of the practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">7. On October 28, 2010, I walked approximately 10 laps around the track, and then left Friendly High School at approximately 8:30 a.m. I then left the school on my way to my station to pick up my work mail. I was riding my motorcycle. Traffic was very heavy that day and so instead of taking the Georgia Avenue exit to get to my station, I took the exit before that, Colesville Road, to get off the congested highway. Shortly after I exited the Capital Beltway onto Colesville Road, I lost control of my motorcycle and crashed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b628-4\">.

[1.] Thus, where the employer furnishes the employee free transportation to and from work, the employee is deemed to be on duty, and an injury sustained by the employee during such transportation arises out of and in the course of employment. <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corporation, </em>242 Md. 299, 304, 219 A.2d 43 (1966); <em>Rumple v. Henry H. Meyer Co., Inc., </em>208 Md. 350, 357, 118 A.2d 486 (1955). [2.] Compensation may also be properly awarded where the employee is injured while traveling along or across a public road between two portions of the employer's premises. <em>Wiley Mfg., </em>280 Md. at 206, 373 A.2d 613; <em>Procter[Proctor]-Silex v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 482, 252 A.2d 800 (1969). [3.] The \"proximity\u201d exception allows compensation for an injury sustained off-premises, but while the employee is exposed to a peculiar or abnormal degree to a danger which is annexed as a risk incident to the employment. <em>Pariser Bakery v. Kooniz, </em>239 Md. 586, 591, 212 A.2d 324 (1965); <em>see Md. Paper Products Co. v. Judson, </em>215 Md. 577, 584-588, 139 A.2d 219 (1958).
