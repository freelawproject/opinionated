For reasons provided below, we answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On September 4, 2011, at approximately 1 A.M., the respondent, James Robert Spies, III, was observed by Maryland State Trooper Brad Hall (\u201cTrooper Hall\u201d) to have \u201cfail[ed] to obey [a] traffic control device\u201d while driving on Main Street in Grasonville, Maryland. Trooper Hall pulled the respondent\u2019s vehicle over and, upon approaching the vehicle, detected a \u201cmoderate odor of an alcoholic beverage on [the respondent\u2019s] breath.\u201d Trooper Hall\u2019s request that the respondent submit to a standard field sobriety test (\u201cSFST\u201d) was refused. Trooper Hall placed the respondent under arrest and transported him to the Maryland State Troopers Barracks in Centreville, Maryland. Once there, Trooper Hall, pursuant to Maryland Code \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Transportation Article, requested that the respondent submit to a blood alcohol content test. After being advised, through the MVA\u2019s DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the consequences of refusing or failing a chemical test for alcohol, and, pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the administrative sanctions attendant to the taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>or refusing of a test for alcohol content, the respondent refused to take that test, as a consequence of which he was subjected to a 120 day suspension of his driver\u2019s license for the first offense. On September 23, 2011, the respondent requested, and was granted, an administrative show-cause hearing pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to challenge the MVA\u2019s suspension of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>On December 8, 2011, the respondent appeared before Administrative Law Judge Charles Boutin (\u201cALJ\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ALJ admitted into evidence, without objection, a continuation letter received by the respondent, two copies of Trooper Hall\u2019s certification order of suspension, a photocopy of the respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and the DR-15 advice of rights form signed by both Trooper Hall and the respondent. The respondent contended that he obeyed the traffic control device, and, as a result, Trooper Hall lacked \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to stop him or request the field sobriety tests. The respondent conceded that the odor of alcohol emanating from his breath provided a sufficient basis for Trooper Hall to conclude that he had used alcohol and, consequently, to permit him to investigate further. The respondent denied, however, that it was enough to suspect him of having been under the influence. Thus, relying on <em>Blasi v. State, </em>167 Md.App. <em>483, 893 </em>A.2d 1152, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 Md. 245, 900 A.2d 751 (2006), the petitioner contended that the MVA failed to establish that Trooper Hall had a basis for suspecting that the admitted use of alcohol impaired his driving.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Arguing, therefore, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>MVA failed to meet its burden, he requested that the ALJ take no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The ALJ denied the respondent\u2019s request and affirmed the respondent\u2019s 120-day suspension, concluding that the MVA\u2019s evidence outweighed the respondent\u2019s evidence and arguments. The ALJ specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201c[Tjhere\u2019s more than sufficient information from a reasonable articulable suspicion point of view. We have a violation of a traffic device, we have moderate odor of alcohol, we have a licensee who flat out says, \u2018I\u2019m not going to take the field sobriety tests,\u2019 and then he\u2019s advised and he refused to take the test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">On December 19, 2011, the respondent filed in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County a petition for judicial review of the administrative decision. Relying on <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 735 A.2d 491 (1999), he asserted that the ALJ erred in his assessment of the sufficiency of the proffered indicia of alcohol use; the respondent\u2019s alleged failure to obey a traffic control device, the moderate smell of alcohol, and the respondent\u2019s refusal to take the field sobriety tests, he argued, were insufficient to establish \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for a request to take an alcohol content test. The MVA responded that <em>Ferris, </em>a criminal case, is inapposite<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that, pursuant to <em>Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 14-15, 997 A.2d 768, 775-76 (2010) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Delawter, </em>403 Md. 243, 256-57, 941 A.2d 1067, 1076 (2008)), the Circuit Court should give deference to Trooper Hall\u2019s observations, his statements, and the negative inference Trooper Hall drew from the respondent\u2019s initial refusal to take the field sobriety-tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Circuit Court rejected the MVA\u2019s arguments. Concluding that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the MVA failed to establish \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect the respondent of driving while under the influence and, then to request that he take the test, it reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Circuit Court determined that the record, which lacked documentation specifying the nature of the respondent\u2019s traffic control device violation, did not contain substantial evidence in support of the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions. Observing that the question of whether \u201cthe moderate odor of alcohol alone\u201d is enough for law enforcement to reasonably suspect a person of driving under the influence or while impaired by the use of alcohol was left open by <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 19-20, 997 A.2d at 779, the Circuit Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201cIt is well-established that a low level of suspicion is required in a \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 analysis. That being said, the record, as it was presented to the ALJ, was deplete of any sufficient indicia of alcohol use, namely because the failure to obey a traffic control device, the moderate smell of alcohol, and Petitioner\u2019s refusal to submit to a SFST, without more, simply do not rise to the level of \u2018reasonable grounds,\u2019 as articulated in this State\u2019s case law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On July 30, 2012, the MVA filed, pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-305 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a petition for <em>writ of certiorari, </em>which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>granted on October 19, 2012. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Spies, </em>429 Md. 81, 54 A.3d 759 (2012). The issue presented by the petition, and for which we granted \u201ccert\u201d, was whether a \u201c \u2018moderate odor\u2019 of alcohol alone may have been enough to permit [the trooper] to suspect that [the driver] was driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol,\u201d and, therefore, may constitute \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to request that a motorist take an alcohol content test pursuant to Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In applying \u00a7 16-205.1, we do not \u201cwrite on a clean slate\u201d and must consider the guidance contained in our earlier cases. <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 15, 997 A.2d at 776. In <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Sanner, </em>434 Md. 20, 27, 73 A.3d 214, 218 (2013), we considered a similar issue to the one in the case <em>sub jvdice: </em>whether an arresting officer who detected \u201ca strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from person and breath\u201d of a motorist, who had been involved in an accident, had reasonable grounds to request the test pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2). The principle difference between the dispositive question in <em>Sanner </em>and the dispositive question in the present case is that, in <em>Sanner, </em>the question was premised on there being a \u201cstrong\u201d odor of alcohol, whereas here, the arresting officer only detected a \u201cmoderate\u201d odor of alcohol. As we shall see, this distinction is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In <em>Sanner, </em>we relied on <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 1300 v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>305 Md. 380, 393, 504 A.2d 1132, 1138 (1986), for the proposition that \u201c[a] sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>strong odor of alcohol on the motorist\u2019s breath can furnish reasonable grounds\u201d to \u201crequest or require an individual to take a chemical test for alcohol [under 16-205.1].\u201d 434 Md. at 33-34, 73 A.3d at 222. In reaching our ultimate conclusion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cSection 16-205.1 of the Maryland Transportation Article, also known as Maryland\u2019s \u2018implied consent\u2019 or \u2018administrative per se\u2019 law, was enacted to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and protect public safety. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 374, 739 A.2d 58, 68 (1999). <em>See Shea, </em>415 Md. at 15, 997 A.2d at 776; <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 255, 923 A.2d 100, 108 (2007); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 178-79, 844 A.2d 388, 396-97 (2004); <em>Embrey v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>339 Md. 691, 697, 664 A.2d 911, 914 (1995); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. 188, 194, 626 A.2d 972, 975 (1993); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. 306, 313, 604 A.2d 919, 922 (1992). In order to further this goal, \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) authorizes the detention of any individual who is suspected of \u2018driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol.\u2019 Probable cause to arrest is not necessary before requesting that a driver take a test to determine alcohol concentration. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 368 n. 7, 739 A.2d at 64 n. 7. All that is required is \u2018reasonable grounds,\u2019 on the part of the police officer, \u2018to believe [that] the individual was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both.\u2019 <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cThis Court previously held that \u2018the term, reasonable grounds, as used in \u00a7 16-205.1 means \u2018reasonable articulable suspicion\u2019 and not preponderance of the evidence or probable cause.\u2019 <em>Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 254, 923 A.2d at 107. Our cases make clear that this standard is met when a police officer detects a strong odor of alcohol, combined with other signs of impairment. <em>See, e.g., [i]d. </em>at 246, 923 A.2d at 102-103 (strong odor of alcohol on driver\u2019s breath combined with speeding, bloodshot eyes, a preliminary breath test result of .10, and the driver\u2019s admission that he drank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>two beers established reasonable grounds); <em>[Motor Vehicle Admin. v.] Illiano, </em>390 Md. [265] at 268-69, 888 A.2d [329] at 331-32 [(2005)] (strong odor of alcohol coming from vehicle combined with driver\u2019s statements and performance on field sobriety tests established reasonable grounds); <em>Atterbeary, </em>368 Md. at 484-85, 796 A.2d at 78 (strong odor of alcohol on driver combined with slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and failed sobriety tests established reasonable grounds).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">\u201cIn this case, Trooper Clinton\u2019s detection of a \u2018strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the person and breath of Mr. Sanner,\u2019 combined with the undisputed fact that Mr. Sanner was the driver of one of the vehicles involved in an accident more than meets the standard of reasonable suspicion that the statute and our case law require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 73 A.3d at 221-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 997 A.2d 768 (2010) is to similar effect. In that case, we framed the question before the Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201cDoes a police officer\u2019s certification that a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage was of sufficient strength to suspect that a motorist was driving while impaired by alcohol, along with subsequent field sobriety tests that led to the driver\u2019s arrest, allow an administrative law judge to find reasonable grounds to request an alcohol content test under Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2), without application of Fourth Amendment standards to evaluate the sufficiency of a police officer\u2019s reasonable grounds?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 12, 997 A.2d at 774. We observed that \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d for the establishment of which only a \u201clow quantum of suspicion\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is required, <em>id. </em>at 20, 997 A.2d at 779, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>considered in the context of the statute\u2019s purpose, \u201cto reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 997 A.2d at 776 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 255, 923 A.2d 100, 108 (2007), in turn citing <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 374, 739 Md. 58, 68 (1999)). Thus, we concluded that, while the \u201cmoderate odor of alcohol alone may have been enough to permit [the officer] reasonably to suspect that Respondent was driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol,\u201d we did not decide if it was in that case, \u201cbecause the ALJ was permitted to infer, as he obviously did, that Officer Phelps arrested Respondent because his performance on the [field sobriety tests] suggested alcohol impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20, 997 A.2d at 779. Although we left the question of the effect of a moderate odor of alcohol open, we emphasized that \u201cthe statute [is] not meant to protect drivers\u201d who are suspected of drunk driving. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 997 A.2d at 776 (quotations omitted). We also stated that the purpose of \u00a7 16-205.1 is \u201cto prevent unscrupulous or incompetent persons from engaging in the licensed activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 997 A.2d at 777 (quoting <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 372-73, 739 A.2d at 67-8). \u201cTo accomplish that purpose, the Statute establishes an administrative process that is \u2018informal and summary in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>nature,\u2019 <em>[Richards, </em>356 Md.] at 376-77, 739 A.2d at 70, thereby providing for \u2018speedy Administrative sanctions [that] [ ] help the offender to recognize the cause and effect relationship between the offense and the sanction which would otherwise be weakened by lengthy delays in the court processes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Loane, </em>420 Md. 211, 229-30, 22 A.3d 833, 843-844 (2011) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Aiken, </em>418 Md. 11, 29, 12 A.3d 656, 666 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Other decisions of this Court regarding \u00a7 16-205.1, and earlier versions of the \u201cimplied consent\u201d statute, <em>see </em>1989 Md. Laws, ch. 284; 1981 Md. Laws, ch. 244; 1969 Md. Laws, ch. 158, have expressly held that \u201ca very slight odor of alcohol on the driver\u2019s breath,\u201d with no other sign of intoxication, sufficed to raise a jury question \u201cwhether [the motorist] was actually under the influence of intoxicating liquor in any degree[.]\u201d <em>Singleton v. Roman, </em>195 Md. 241, 247, 72 A.2d 705, 707 (1950). We have also recognized that \u201c[a] sufficiently strong odor of alcohol on the motorist\u2019s breath can furnish reasonable grounds\u201d to believe that the individual had been driving under the influence and thus justify requesting the individual to undergo a breath test under \u00a7 16-205.1. <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 1300 v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>305 Md. 380, 393, 504 A.2d 1132, 1138 (1986); <em>cf. State v. Werkheiser, </em>299 Md. 529, 531, 474 A.2d 898, 899 (1984). In the years following <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>we have affirmed the suspension of a driver\u2019s license for refusal to take a chemical breath test under \u00a7 16-205.1 where the police officer\u2019s suspicion of drunk driving was first prompted by what the ALJ described as \u201ca moderate odor of alcohol on [the driver\u2019s] breath.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 360, 739 A.2d at 60; <em>but see id. </em>at 358-59, 739 A.2d at 60 (quoting unattributed text characterizing the odor as \u201cstrong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Applying the above authorities to the present case, we now conclude that, consistent with the purpose of 16.205.1, a \u201cmoderate odor\u201d of alcohol alone is enough to constitute \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d i.e. is sufficient for a request to take an alcohol content test. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the \u201ccommon sense\u201d basis for \u201creasonable grounds\u201d is that Trooper Hall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>smelled a moderate odor of alcohol emanating from the respondent. <em>See Shea, </em>415 Md. at 19, 997 A.2d at 778. The odor of alcohol is one of the \u201cpractical aspects of daily life,\u201d and its detection is \u201chow reasonable and prudent people\u201d could come to suspect that another person is under the influence of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>We have similarly held that a trial court errs if it denies a jury the opportunity to consider such evidence to determine whether the driver \u201cwas actually under the influence\u201d of alcohol because ordinary people are able to draw common sense inferences regarding possible intoxication from even a \u201cslight odor of alcohol on the driver\u2019s breath.\u201d <em>Singleton, </em>195 Md. at 247, 72 A.2d at 707. Consequently, we conclude that Trooper Hall\u2019s detection of a moderate odor of alcohol on the respondent\u2019s breath amounts to \u201cmore than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,\u201d and does indeed satisfy the \u201clow quantum of suspicion necessary for \u2018reasonable grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 20, 997 A.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s legal determination was based upon the correct application of Maryland law, and that there existed substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Trooper Hall met the requirements of \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2). We therefore reverse the decision of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.

One of the issues in that case was whether the police officer had probable cause to stop the defendant, <em>id. </em>at 493, 893 A.2d at 1158, not whether he had reasonable suspicion to suspect that the defendant was driving while intoxicated or under the influence and, thus, grounds to request that the defendant take a test for alcohol content. The tests are decidedly different. In any event, we have rejected a \"fault/no fault\u201d approach to the resolution of the latter question. In <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Sanner, </em>434 Md. 20, 73 A.3d 214 (2013), the Circuit Court for Carroll County applied that approach, which we rejected, explaining: \"[the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Court\u2019s] fault/no-fault based definition of \u2018reasonable grounds' imposes a requirement that cannot be supported by either the plain language of \u00a7 16-205.1 or this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33-34, 73 A.3d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"A9h\">The respondent also attacked Trooper Hall\u2019s credibility, contending that he had a vested interest in making arrests and \u201cprosecuting cases.\u201d The respondent further alleged that Trooper Hall\u2019s observations on the MVA form were inconsistent with his statements in the police report.

State, </em>355 Md. 356, 735 A.2d 491 (1999), we considered whether an operator of a motor vehicle is seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when he is asked to get out of his car for questioning after a traffic stop is completed, and if so, whether the seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion. We concluded that the stop was a seizure within contemplation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the seizure was not supported by reasonable suspicion. <em>Id. </em>at 387, 735 A.2d at 507. At issue there was whether <em>Ferris </em>was in possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>a controlled substance with the intent to distribute.

Reasonable suspicion requires less in the way of quantity and quality of evidence than is required for probable cause, <em>see Alabama v.
