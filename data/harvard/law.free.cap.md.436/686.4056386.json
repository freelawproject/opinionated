Vol.), \u00a7 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article, which requires the trial court to determine whether the defendant was competent to stand trial based on evidence presented on the record. We shall hold that defense counsel did not trigger the trial judge\u2019s duty to make a competency determination, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Petitioner Kivi Kennedy (\u201cKennedy\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d) was charged with first degree murder, two counts of attempted first degree murder, and related weapons offenses stemming from a 2010 Baltimore City shooting death. The circumstances leading to the charges against Petitioner in this case are largely irrelevant to this appeal, and a brief recitation of those facts are included only to provide context. The State\u2019s evidence showed that on February 25, 2010, Petitioner arranged to meet his friend, Kevin Newsome, at the intersection of Fulton Avenue and Baker Street in Baltimore City. New-some arrived with two people, Dejuan Green and Kelly Roy, in his truck with him. Petitioner got in the backseat of New-some\u2019s truck and subsequently shot Newsome, Green, and Roy. Petitioner fled on foot. Newsome and Roy were treated for gunshot wounds and released, and Green was pronounced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>dead at the hospital as a result of three close range gunshot wounds to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Pertinent to this appeal are certain events that transpired over the course of Petitioner\u2019s jury trial. On the first day of trial, during cross-examination of Kevin Newsome, the State\u2019s first witness, Petitioner began crying. Defense counsel requested a break in the proceedings, and the trial judge dismissed the jury to the jury room. Counsel approached the bench, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">[Defense Counsel]: And, Your Honor, this is something that I showed Judge Peters that I couldn\u2019t relate to my client and he wouldn\u2019t come visit me when I would go to the jail and he refused to come to court one day and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">[Trial Judge]: Well, do you know what provoked his reaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">[Defense counsel]: I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t tell if, I mean, as a layman, not as a professional doctor, I haven\u2019t been able to really communicate with this guy. He like, I\u2019ll say somethin\u2019 to him and he\u2019ll say the same thing over and over again, like he didn\u2019t hear what I said to him. And I tried to express that to Judge Peters before he sent us here. I\u2019m not askin\u2019 for a mistrial or anything like that, but I did \u2014 you heard me tell Judge Peters that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">[Prosecutor]: Do you think there\u2019s something wrong with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">[Trial Judge]: If you are requesting any relief, do you want the evening break now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Yes, if we could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-13\">[Prosecutor]: Fine. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">When the trial resumed the following day, defense counsel made no reference to the day before, nor did he request any relief. The State continued to call witnesses on the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>and third days of trial, all without incident. Several times throughout the trial, Petitioner asked clarifying questions of the judge, including why his motion for judgment of acquittal was denied, and what it meant to impeach him. Following explanation by the judge, Petitioner stated that he understood in both instances. Petitioner, defense counsel, and the trial judge also engaged in a discussion regarding Petitioner\u2019s right to testify or not to testify. Ultimately, Petitioner decided to testify, and during his testimony, he explained why he cried on the first day of trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">[Petitioner]: I cried because we all [sic] here today \u2018cause of me. That\u2019s why we here today \u2018cause of the situation and I\u2019m sittin\u2019 over there as somebody who committed these crimes. I cried yesterday \u2018cause I almost lost my life that night and I didn\u2019t shoot anybody. And I\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya\u2019ll that and I\u2019m tellin\u2019 the family that I did not shoot your family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Petitioner then testified about the events leading to his arrest. He stated that an unidentified man approached the vehicle where Petitioner was seated and pulled a gun on him, and thereafter, a struggle between Petitioner and the unidentified individual ensued. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Petitioner to re-enact this alleged struggle over the gun with her using a magic marker as a prop. In the process of re-enacting this struggle, Petitioner used enough force to cause the prosecutor to fall back several steps and collide with the courtroom easel. Immediately following the incident, Petitioner said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d The jury was excused, and Petitioner continued to apologize and asked if the prosecutor was alright. The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, at this time I would ask the Court for a mistrial. I believe the jury has been prejudiced. They now have an impression of my client based on the State\u2019s Attorney requesting him to demonstrate. I, I believe I noticed the jury\u2019s reaction. Everyone was shocked and I believe the jury\u2019s tainted. And I don\u2019t believe my client will be given a fair trial, not because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>evidence that was presented, but because of the incident that just occurred that was provoked by [the prosecutor], [Trial Judge]: Well, let\u2019s, let me put on the record, although there is a video which may show what occurred, let me state that [the prosecutor] asked the witness while standing outside of the box, he was sitting in the box, to demonstrate how he tussled for the gun using a marker. And it is this [c]ourt\u2019s finding that it was not provoked in any way by the State, that Mr. Kennedy, I guess lacks all judgment, but used strong force, enough to push [the prosecutor] several feet back and knock over the easel, far beyond anything that would ever be done in a re[-]enactment or demonstration. So I reject the notion that the State has provoked anything in the Defendant\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">After the trial judge denied the motion for mistrial, defense counsel asked to approach the bench, and thereafter the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I would express again that this is a continuous situation with myself and [Petitioner], At several times I have problems communicating with him. I communicate directly with him and he seems not to understand what I\u2019m saying to him. Your Honor, I don\u2019t\u2014 [Trial Judge]: Well, how is this incident the result of a communication problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s something consistent I\u2019ve seen in [Petitioner] as far as a lack of understanding with things. If we attribute it to he used too much force and improper force, I would consistently say this is what I\u2019ve experienced with him, a lack of understanding of things I say to him. I don\u2019t understand things that he says to me at times. I haven\u2019t been able to talk to him about the case and I would just ask the Court for a mistrial\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">[Trial Judge]: All right. The motion is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 and have him evaluated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">[Trial Judge]: The motion is denied. As I\u2019ve said in connection -with this incident, I think it\u2019s a lack of judgment. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Thereafter, the prosecutor requested to proceed with the trial, and defense counsel stated: \u201cI would just make a last argument. This could be misconstrued by the jury as my client being violent and he\u2019s, he\u2019s been prejudiced by this act and I\u2019ll submit on that. Thank you.\u201d The trial judge then responded that the \u201c[mjotion for mistrial is denied,\u201d which was his third time doing so. Cross-examination of Mr. Kennedy was completed without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">At the conclusion of trial, the jury convicted Petitioner of second degree murder, two counts of attempted second degree murder, three counts of use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and one count of wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun. Petitioner was sentenced to 65 years incarceration. Petitioner noted a timely appeal. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in an unreported opinion. This Court granted <em>certiorari, Kennedy v. State, </em>432 Md. 211, 68 A.3d 286 (2013), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Did defense counsel trigger the competency statute, requiring the trial court to order a competency evaluation and make a competency determination, when counsel informed the court that he had trouble communicating with his client and that his client was unable to assist in his defense, mentioned that there was \u201csomething wrong\u201d with his client, and requested that his client be evaluated?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u201cIt has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 903, 43 L.Ed.2d 103, 112-13 (1975). Once the issue of a defendant\u2019s competency has been raised, the proceedings cannot continue until the trial judge determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Peaks v. State, </em>419 Md. 239, 252, 18 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>917, 925 (2011). \u201cAdditionally, competency to stand trial is a factual determination which will not be reversed unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The proper procedure the trial court must follow when determining a criminal defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial is codified in Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-104(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article (hereinafter \u00a7 3-104(a)), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case or a violation of probation proceeding appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">A person is incompetent to stand trial when he or she is unable \u201c(1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) to assist in one\u2019s defense.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f) of the Criminal Procedure Article (hereinafter \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">This Court has visited the procedures mandated by \u00a7 3-104(a) many times,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and has determined that, when an accused\u2019s competency is properly called into question, the actions that must be undertaken by the trial judge can be distilled into three steps: \u201c(1) First, a determination of competency may be made at any time before or during a trial; (2) Second, such a determination must be made if the defendant in a criminal case appears to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial; and (3) Finally, the court must make its determination on the evidence presented on the record.\u201d <em>Roberts v. State, </em>361 Md. 346, 364, 761 A.2d 885, 895 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">At issue in the present case is the second step, which delineates the appropriate avenues to bring the issue of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>petency properly before the court. \u201cAs the statute makes plain, a trial court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of the accused is triggered in one of three ways: (1) upon motion of the accused; (2) upon motion of the defense counsel; or (3) upon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 85, 622 A.2d 727, 730 (1993). An allegation of competency must be \u201csufficient\u201d to alert the trial court to its duty to determine whether the defendant is competent to stand trial. <em>Cf. Jones v. State, </em>280 Md. 282, 286-87, 372 A.2d 1064, 1067 (1977) (concluding that the Court of Appeals need not decide whether defense counsel\u2019s allegations of competency were sufficient because the trial judge regarded the statements as adequate for that purpose). Petitioner asserts only that \u00a7 3-104(a) was triggered upon motion of the defense counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Petitioner contends that \u00a7 3-104(a) was triggered by defense counsel\u2019s motion based on several occurrences: that defense counsel informed the trial judge he had trouble communicating with his client and that he believed there was \u201csomething wrong\u201d with him, and when defense counsel requested Petitioner be \u201cevaluated.\u201d Respondent, meanwhile, asserts that defense counsel failed to trigger the competency determination requirement under \u00a7 3-104(a) where the request was embedded in a motion for mistrial, the request was not pursued despite ample opportunities to do so, and any proffered facts did not raise a bona fide doubt as to Petitioner\u2019s competency. We agree with Respondent, and shall hold that defense counsel\u2019s passing request to have Petitioner \u201cevaluated\u201d was not sufficient to trigger the trial judge\u2019s duty to make a determination of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">While it is not necessary for a party to \u201crecite a specific litany\u201d to request a course of action by the trial court, <em>see In re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. 26, 34, 797 A.2d 39, 44 (2002), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>party must sufficiently \u201cmake[ ] known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-323(c) (codifying the method of making objections, including motions for a mistrial). If a party \u201cclearly makes the judge aware of the course of action he or she desires the court to take and the reasons for such course of action, the party shall have adequately preserved that issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>In re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. at 35, 797 A.2d at 45. Indeed, it will not always be necessary for defense counsel to recite the specific words \u201ccompetency determination\u201d when making such a request. In the present case, however, defense counsel did not make his request known to the court with sufficient clarity to trigger the requirements under \u00a7 3-104(a). Here, the only instance in which defense counsel could possibly have requested that the trial judge make a determination of Petitioner\u2019s competency was when he made a vague request to have Petitioner \u201cevaluated.\u201d This \u201crequest\u201d was made at the end of a long colloquy with the trial judge regarding defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and was actually made after the trial judge had already begun ruling on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Moreover, despite defense counsel\u2019s persistence in renewing the motion for mistrial, his request to have Petitioner \u201cevaluated\u201d was never pursued, even though there were ample opportunities to do so. Petitioner argues that defense counsel\u2019s assertions that he had trouble communicating with Petitioner and he did not think Petitioner understood him were further support of the sufficiency of defense counsel\u2019s motion for a competency determination. In our view, the only remedy that defense counsel sought in this case was a mistrial. These statements, concerning counsel\u2019s lack of communication with his client, were made in the context and in support of a motion for mistrial. There is no clear indication that the comments were offered as a basis for challenging Petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">It is important to consider the circumstances in which defense counsel made the request to \u201chave him evaluated.\u201d As evident from the trial transcript, this request was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>where the focus of the motion was for a mistrial. The decision the trial judge must undertake when determining whether to grant a motion for mistrial is entirely different from the decision to grant a request for an evaluation to determine competency to stand trial. This Court has explained that, when a defendant makes a motion for a mistrial, \u201c[t]he question is whether the prejudice to the defendant was so substantial that he was deprived of a fair trial[.]\u201d <em>Kosmas v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 594-595, 560 A.2d 1137, 1141 (1989). The motion made by defense counsel that is at issue here was made following the defendant\u2019s botched re-enactment of his struggle to take away the gun that allegedly took place when the underlying crimes occurred. The trial judge\u2019s focus was clearly on whether this re-enactment was so prejudicial that the proceedings should be aborted. This is an entirely different analysis than the analysis a trial judge engages in to decide whether to grant a request to delay proceedings in order to evaluate the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. In that situation, the judge must decide ultimately, prior to resumption of proceedings, whether the defendant understands the nature of the proceedings and is able to assist in his own defense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-101(f). Because of the vague nature of defense counsel\u2019s request to \u201chave him evaluated,\u201d and without further clarification that the request was for a competency evaluation, the trial judge\u2019s attention was clearly on the prejudicial nature of what occurred in front of the jury and not on whether defendant required a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In addition, defense counsel\u2019s request to \u201chave him evaluated\u201d is not sufficiently clear as to the type of evaluation defense counsel was requesting. There are several different types of \u201cevaluations\u201d in the criminal context, all of which could feasibly be the type of evaluation defense counsel intended to request. For example, defense counsel here could have been referring to a court ordered evaluation of Petitioner for alcohol and drug abuse. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1982, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-505-06 of the Health-General Article (codifying the procedures for committing a criminal defendant for an alcohol or drug abuse evaluation and mandating that such orders may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ordered during trial). Additionally, defense counsel could have been requesting an evaluation pursuant to a potential plea of not criminally responsible, Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article, or an emergency evaluation if counsel believed the defendant presented a danger to himself or others, Md.Code (1982, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-622 of the Health-General Article. Because defense counsel requested to \u201chave him evaluated\u201d following a violent display by Petitioner, all three of the above alternative evaluations were plausible requests defense counsel could have intended to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Despite Petitioner\u2019s attempt to compare the present case to <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. 346, 761 A.2d 885, and <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 369 A.2d 98 (1977), both cases are readily distinguishable and illustrate requests for a competency determination that are sufficiently clear so as to trigger the trial judge\u2019s duty under \u00a7 3-104(a). In <em>Roberts, </em>defense counsel filed a written Motion to Request Mental Examination with the trial court. 361 Md. at 354-55, 761 A.2d at 890. In general, the motion provided that defendant had a long history of psychiatric problems, that counsel had difficulty communicating with defendant, and that both of defendant\u2019s physicians believed she should have been placed in a psychiatric hospital. <em>Id. </em>The Motion concluded by stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqSP\">Ms. Roberts, through counsel[,] asks this Court to issue an order that she be evaluated by a suitable licensed or certified examiner.... Counsel believes that this examination is very necessary and should be done as soon as possible.... If the Court believes that a hearing on the issue of competency is necessary or if any additional information is required, counsel would be more than happy to provide same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6m\"><em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 355, 761 A.2d at 890. To be sure, this motion made by defense counsel in <em>Roberts </em>was a model of clarity. Although such an extensive proffer is not necessary\u2014 indeed, \u201ca defendant merely needs to ... allege incompetence in order to trigger the need for a competency determination,\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 365 n. 14, 761 A.2d at 895 n. 14 \u2014 it does clearly and unequivocally alert the trial judge of his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>duty to make a determination of competency. In the present case, the defense counsel did not allege incompetence with any clarity and this situation is therefore distinguishable from <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In <em>Hill, </em>on the second day of trial, defense counsel informed the trial judge that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">Defendant indicated to me further for the first time yesterday evening that one time [last year] he had been at Clifton T. Perkins for seven months for some type of evaluation. He indicated he wishes me to interpose a plea of ... not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the alleged commission of the offense <em>and is not competent to stand trial at this time.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">35 Md.App. at 99, 369 A.2d at 99 (emphasis in original). We agree with the intermediate appellate court in <em>Hill </em>that \u201c[t]he language used by trial counsel unequivocally directed the attention of the trial court to the dual issues (a) of insanity ... and (b) of the competency of the accused to stand trial.\u201d 35 Md.App. at 104, 369 A.2d at 101. Indeed, there is no question as to what defense counsel in <em>Hill </em>was requesting. Although defense counsel in <em>Hill </em>did make a motion with dual purposes, namely a desire to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and a request for a determination of defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, both requests were made with equal weight in order to alert the trial judge to the dual issues with sufficient clarity. That, however, is not this case. Here, defense counsel made several motions for a mistrial throughout Petitioner\u2019s trial and, only at the end of a long colloquy with the trial judge about the reasons for mistrial, did counsel make a vague request to \u201chave him evaluated.\u201d There is nothing \u201csufficiently clear\u201d about this request to alert the trial judge to his duty under \u00a7 3-104(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The situation in <em>State v. Northam, </em>421 Md. 195, 26 A.3d 344 (2011), is more comparable to the present case, and while it is not a case involving competency, we agree with the intermediate appellate court that it is instructive. In <em>Northam, </em>the defendant filed a motion for a change of venue, which listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>several reasons why he was so entitled. 421 Md. at 202-03, 26 A.3d at 348. At the end of the motion, the defendant stated that he was \u201crequesting a Court appointed attorney and Change of Venue.\u201d <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 203, 26 A.3d at 348. This Court concluded that the motion made by the defendant was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">sufficient only to alert the prosecutor and the trial court that [Northam] wanted a change of venue ... and his vague request that he wanted a \u201cCourt appointed attorney,\u201d buried in the final sentence of the final paragraph of what was captioned and pled specifically and solely as a change of venue motion stands in stark contrast to other cases where [waiver of counsel] inquiries were mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 206, 26 A.3d at 350. Additionally, we reasoned that the defendant had opportunities both at the pretrial hearing as well as prior to trial to request a discharge of counsel, and because he failed to do so, the waiver of counsel rule was not implicated. <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 207, 26 A.3d at 350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In the present case, like in <em>Northam, </em>an alleged separate request for court action was embedded in a motion heralded as something else. Northam\u2019s request for \u201ca Court appointed attorney\u201d was embedded in a motion for a change of venue, just as Petitioner\u2019s request to \u201chave him evaluated\u201d was embedded in a motion for mistrial. If anything, Petitioner\u2019s request was even more vague than Northam\u2019s request because it was made at the end of a long verbal exchange, rather than made at the end of a written motion where the trial judge could potentially go back and review what was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Moreover, we concur with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reasoning when it recognized that \u201c[h]ere, as in <em>Northam, </em>there were ample opportunities, before and during the trial, for defense counsel to bring clearly to the court\u2019s attention that appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial was an issue.\u201d If defense counsel indeed had intended to request a competency evaluation for his client, he would have, or should have, pursued such a motion as he did when he made multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>motions <em>for </em>a mistrial. In this vein, we think explanatory language from <em>Northern </em>is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">[Petitioner] may not take advantage of an obscurely situate[d], undecided motion.... If the question is not of such importance to [defense counsel] that he remembers to request an answer, the court cannot be charged with screening previously decided motions to discern an unanswered sentence obscured by a plethora of unrelated issues. Nor can we permit such distended motions to be set as a trap for an unwary judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\"><em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 206-07, 26 A.3d at 350 (quoting <em>White v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 151, 326 A.2d 219 (1974)). The onus is on the defendant or defense counsel to make a request for a competency evaluation with sufficient clarity. In the interest of fairness, one cannot expect a trial judge to parse out each phrase uttered in a colloquy with defense counsel to determine what is being requested. Defense counsel made it clear that he was requesting a mistrial, but did not make it sufficiently clear that he was requesting a competency evaluation. Furthermore, defense counsel did not pursue his request for a competency evaluation when it became clear that the trial judge was only aware of the motion for mistrial, despite ample opportunities to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Petitioner, in effect, frames his argument as a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This type of analysis may be appropriate if Petitioner were arguing that the trial judge had a duty to <em>sua sponte </em>address his competency to stand trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but because he is not doing so, we believe this argument has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>no merit. Petitioner argues only that the trial judge\u2019s duty was triggered under \u00a7 3-104(a) by the motion of defense counsel, but then asserts that this motion was formed from several statements spoken throughout the trial. A sufficiently clear application for a court order does not involve piecing together various statements made over the course of a multiday trial to form a coherent and clear request for court action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we believe it useful to point out facts before the trial judge that Petitioner failed to acknowledge, which shed further light on why \u00a7 3-104(a) was not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Petitioner\u2019s contention is that \u201cdefense counsel triggered the competency statute ... when counsel [1] informed the court that he had trouble communicating with his client and that his client was unable to assist in his defense, [2] mentioned that there was \u2018something wrong\u2019 with his clientf,] and [3] requested that his client be evaluated.\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that these statements were made over the course of the multi-day trial and a totality of the circumstances analysis is not proper to determine whether defense counsel made a motion under \u00a7 3-104(a), this argument fails to take into account several factors before the trial judge. Perhaps most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>importantly, the trial judge had the opportunity to observe Petitioner firsthand during a four-day trial. Over the course of the trial, Petitioner asked clarifying questions of the judge, including why his motion for judgment of acquittal was denied, and what it meant to impeach him. Following explanation by the judge, Petitioner stated that he understood in both instances. Petitioner, defense counsel, and the trial judge also engaged in a discussion regarding Petitioner\u2019s right to testify or not testify. Later, during Petitioner\u2019s testimony, he explained why he cried on the first day of trial. Rather than indicating incompetency, Petitioner\u2019s testimony reasonably shows his understanding of the court proceedings and gravity of the situation. Therefore, these circumstances omitted by Petitioner\u2019s argument shed further light on why the trial judge may not have been aware that defense counsel\u2019s request to \u201chave him evaluated\u201d was, in fact, a request for a competency determination. Because defense counsel never made a motion or request triggering the trial judge\u2019s duty to make a competency determination under \u00a7 3-104(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">HARRELL and BATTAGLIA, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">. This statute was formerly Md.Code (1982, 1987 Cum.

Although Petitioner does not designate his argument as such, we believe this label is appropriate because Petitioner calls for this Court to consider statements made throughout the four-day trial to support the assertion that defense counsel made a proper request for a competency evaluation under \u00a7 3-104(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. A trial judge has a duty to raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s competency <em>sua sponte </em>if he or she has a bona fide doubt that the defendant is competent to stand trial. Because \u201c[ejvidence relevant in determining whether there exists a bona fide doubt as to an accused\u2019s competence[ ] includes evidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial[,]\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Wood v. State, </em>436 Md. 276, 291, 81 A.3d 427, 436 (2013) (quotations and citations omitted), would be relevant under a totality of the circumstances analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. We believe that the method for making a request for a competency determination is analogous to the method for making objections to rulings or orders during a criminal trial. The proper method for making objections is prescribed by Md. Rule 4-323(c), which states in pertinent part that \u201cit is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d In the present case, defense counsel\u2019s \"request\u201d for an evaluation did not specifically make known the action defense counsel desired the court to make. Moreover, all the statements made by defense counsel prior to his vague request to \"have him evaluated\u201d did not occur at the time the request was sought. Because all but one of the statements made by defense counsel were not made at the time the ruling was sought, and because defense counsel did not make it known the action he desired the court to take, defense counsel's request was not sufficiently clear when analogized to the proper method for making an objection to a ruling or order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">. Respondent posits that despite this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wood, </em>436 Md. 276, 81 A.3d 427, an implicit finding of competency by the trial judge is acceptable in this situation if we conclude that \u00a7 3-104(a) was triggered. This is an incorrect reading of <em>Wood. </em>To reemphasize our conclusion in <em>Wood, </em>on review we do not take into consideration whether a judge made an implicit determination as to a defendant's competency once \u00a7 3-104(a) has been triggered. Once \u00a7 3-104(a) has been triggered, either upon motion of defendant, defense counsel, or because the trial judge has a bona fide doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency, it is the trial judge\u2019s duty to \"determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b732-7\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">dissenting, in which BATTAGLIA, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">I dissent. The Majority opinion concedes, as it must, that the threshold to trigger a trial judge\u2019s need to refer a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>defendant for a mental competency evaluation is a low hurdle. Maj. op. at 697, 85 A.3d at 113, citing <em>Roberts v. State, </em>361 Md. 346, 365 n. 14, 761 A.2d 885, 895 n. 14 (2000) (\u201c \u2018[A]n extensive proffer is not necessary \u2014 indeed, a defendant merely needs to ... allege incompetence in order to trigger the need for a competency evaluation.\u2019 \u201d). That notwithstanding, the Majority faults Kennedy\u2019s defense counsel for not making his request known to the court with sufficient clarity. Maj. op. at 694-95, 85 A.3d at 111. Although specificity is to be desired generally in gleaning a record to ascertain what relief (if any) a lawyer seeks for his or her client, I arrive at the view of this case that Kennedy\u2019s lawyer\u2019s efforts were sufficient to have put the trial judge on notice that Kennedy\u2019s mental competency was questioned and that the court should have understood that an evaluation of same was sought or, at a minimum, clarification was needed to understand better what Kennedy\u2019s lawyer wanted done. Looked at as a totality of circumstances, Kennedy\u2019s lawyer made the following points to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u2022 Kennedy refused (without reason) to meet with his lawyer on occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u2022 Kennedy refused (without reason) to attend court on one occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u2022 There were continuous communication impediments (apparently not of a foreign language barrier type) to Kennedy appearing to understand what his lawyer was saying to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u2022 \u201cThere is something wrong with him [Kennedy].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u2022 \u201cI [Kennedy\u2019s lawyer] haven\u2019t been able to talk [effectively] to him about the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u2022 I would just ask the Court ... have him evaluated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Of course, much of the above was commingled with talk of a possible mistrial over the shoving incident in the courtroom. Nonetheless, it strikes me that it is not unreasonable for a judge to separate into compartments the two different concepts \u2014 a mistrial sought because of the courtroom shoving incident and the strongly-implied (at the least) request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>mental competency evaluation. To ignore the latter is merely to stick one\u2019s head in the sand beyond one\u2019s ears.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I would reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings, to include a referral for mental competency evaluation of Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
