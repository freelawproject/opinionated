Alexander, </em>Case No. C-98-2181, is hereby vacated. The underlying Petition for Contempt, in view of <em>In the Interest of G.L.A., Jr., E.L.A., and R.R.A., </em>195 S.W.3d 787, 791-93 (Tex.App.2006) (holding that, where the former wife, a resident of Texas, registers a divorce decree issued by a court in Maryland, where the parties were residing when the decree was issued, and asks for its enforcement, and the former husband voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Texas court, \u201cthe [Texas] trial court must enforce the order as required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution\u201d); Maryland Code (2004, 2012 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 9.5-201(a) and 9.5-206(a) of the Family Law Article, was moot. Moreover, because the Petition for Contempt was filed by Appellee and the order finding Appellant in contempt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>entered by the court after the parties and their children were no longer residents of the State of Maryland (the mother and children being residents of Texas and the father of Delaware), the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to enter it. <em>See Harris v. Melnick, </em>314 Md. 539, 554, 552 A.2d 38 (1989), and cases cited therein (noting that \u201cCourts generally give the decree-rendering state a strong presumption of continuing modification jurisdiction until all or almost all connection with the parents and the child is lost\u201d); Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction &amp; Enforcement Act \u00a7 202 cmt. 2, 9 U.L.A. 673 (1999) (\u201cContinuing jurisdiction is lost when the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent no longer reside in the original decree State.\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
