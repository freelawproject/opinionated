The first element, central to this order, is the work incentive program, which couples a 1.3% decrease in benefit levels with the waiver of certain federal AFDC rules that limit the amount of income a recipient can earn without a corresponding reduction in benefits. Cal.Welf. &amp; Inst.Code \u00a7 11450.-01(b). The second element is a one year residency requirement which limits benefits to an AFDC applicant not residing in California during the prior year to the level of benefits the applicant would have received in the state of prior residence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11450.-03(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-20\">The residency component of the Demonstration Project was the subject of prior litigation in this court. <em>See Green v. Anderson, </em>811 F.Supp. 516 (E.D.Cal.1993). By order filed January 28, 1993, the court preliminarily enjoined application of the durational residency requirement in section 11450.03(a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>the validity of that section is not now at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">The work incentive portion of the Demonstration Project does not comply with several requirements of the Social Security Act governing the provision of public assistance benefits. Accordingly, California requested that the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services approve waivers of those requirements under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315(a). On October 28, 1992, the Secretary granted three waivers<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> necessary to implement the work incentive portion of the Demonstration Project: (1) a waiver of certain rules limiting the work hours and earned income of some AFDC recipients;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) a waiver of the requirement of uniform statewide benefits to permit the State to establish, for research purposes, a control group exempt from the benefit cut and work incentives; and (3) a waiver of the \u201cmaintenance of effort\u201d requirement that conditions federal approval of state medicaid plans on the state\u2019s maintenance of benefit levels at or above the levels existing on May 1, 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The 1.3% benefit cut places AFDC benefits below the May 1988 floor, hence the State\u2019s request for waiver of this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Plaintiffs are California AFDC recipients subject to the grant reduction and residency requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They challenge the Demonstration Project\u2019s benefit cut and the Secretary\u2019s grant of waivers on a number of different grounds. First, plaintiffs argue that it was arbitrary and capricious of the Secretary to grant waivers for the Demonstration Project because the waivers permit statewide application of the Project when only 10,000 AFDC recipients from four counties will be studied, and because the waivers permit application of the benefit cut to those unable to work. Second, plaintiffs argue that the Demonstration Project and associated waivers violate the safeguards for human research subjects provided in section 211 of the Department of Health and Human Services 1992-1993 Appropriations Act, Pub.L. No. 102-394, 106 Stat. 1792 (1992). Plaintiffs contend that the benefit cut poses a danger to the well-being of AFDC recipients and therefore requires their written, informed consent. Third, plaintiffs argue that the benefit cut and work incentive aspects of the Project discriminate against those disabled AFDC recipients who are unable to work in violation of section 12132 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (1991). Finally, plaintiffs contend that the Demonstration Project and waivers violate the requirements for work-related programs specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 684(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">Plaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction invalidating the waivers necessary to implement the 1.3% benefit cut, and enjoining the State\u2019s application of that cut to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>AFDC families headed by disabled adults. Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the expenditure of federal funds on the Project. The Secretary moves to dismiss all claims against her, primarily on the basis that her decisions concerning the Demonstration Project are not subject to judicial review. Both motions were heard on April 9, 1993. For the reasons stated below, the court finds that the Secretary\u2019s decision is subject to review but that plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits as to any of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">I. <em>Review of the Secretary\u2019s Waivers</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuVq\">A. <em>Is the Secretary\u2019s Decision Subject to Review?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">The Social Security Act grants discretion to the Secretary to waive certain of the Act\u2019s requirements. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315(a), the Secretary may waive a state\u2019s compliance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-7\">In the case of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project which, <em>in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives </em>of ... Part A or D of subchapter IV of this chapter, in a State or States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-8\">(1) the Secretary may waive compliance with any of the requirements of section ... 1396a of this title, as the case may be, <em>to the extent and for the period he finds necessary </em>to enable such State or States to carry out such project....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315(a) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs claim that the waivers permitting California to implement the Demonstration Project and benefit cut do not comply with the requirements of section 1315(a) and thus may be invalidated as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. In addition to contesting this assertion on its merits, the Secretary argues that her decision to grant waivers is \u201ccommitted to agency discretion\u201d and so is not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">Sections 701-706 of the APA govern judicial review of agency action. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. Section 702 generally provides a right of review to any person \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by agency action. However, \u201cto the extent that an agency action is committed to agency discretion by law,\u201d the APA precludes judicial review. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). The Secretary argues that section 1315 does just this. Because the section is drafted in subjective terms \u2014 according to the Secretary\u2019s judgment and the Secretary\u2019s finding \u2014 as opposed to objective criteria, the Secretary is of the view that the decision to grant a waiver is committed to agency discretion and thus unreviewable under the APA. To prevail on this point, the Secretary must overcome the \u201cstrong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\u201d <em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>476 U.S. 667, 670, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 2136, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">Agency decisionmaking has been found unreviewable under section 701(a)(2) in limited circumstances. An agency\u2019s exercise of its discretion not to prosecute or begin enforcement proceedings is unreviewable because such decisions involve \u201ca complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within [the agency\u2019s expertise]\u201d and because \u201creview is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s. exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1655, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985); <em>see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (section 701(a)(2) applies in \u201crare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply\u201d). An agency\u2019s decision as to how to budget funds from a lump-sum appropriation \u201cis another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.\u201d <em>Lincoln v. Vigil, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 2024, 2031, 124 L.Ed.2d 101 (1993). A lump-sum appropriation evinces a congressional purpose to give the agency maximum flexibility and discretion while the allocation of such resources involves numerous competing demands which the agency is better suited to resolve than the courts. <em>Id. </em>113 S.Ct. at 2031-32. Finally, the decision by the Director of Central Intelligence to terminate an employee is not reviewable under the APA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number><em>Webster v. Doe, </em>486 U.S. 592, 601, 108 S.Ct. 2047, 2052, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988). This decision, affecting the national security, concerns \u201can area of executive action \u2018in which courts have long been hesitant to intrude.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lincoln, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2031 (quoting <em>Franklin v. Massachusetts, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 112 S.Ct. 2767, 2785, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). Moreover, the particular statutory provision at issue \u201cfairly exudes deference to the Director\u201d by vesting the decision to terminate in the Director\u2019s judgment as opposed to some objective standard. <em>Webster, </em>486 U.S. at 600, 108 S.Ct. at 2052 (\u201c[Section] 102(c) allows termination of an Agency employee whenever the Director \u2018shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States,\u2019 not simply when the dismissal <em>is </em>necessary or advisable to those interests.\u201d). The <em>Webster </em>Court relied as well on the overall structure of the National Security Act, which grants broad authority to the Director of Central Intelligence to assure the confidentiality of agency sources of information and the reliability of its employees. <em>Id. </em>at 600-01, 108 S.Ct. at 2052-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">Three overlapping considerations emerge from the eases as central to the decision of whether a matter is committed to the agency\u2019s discretion under section 701(a)(2): first, the language of the statutory provision at issue and whether the statute \u201cexudes deference\u201d to the agency\u2019s subjective judgment or rather provides objective standards that courts may apply; second, the overall statutory scheme, of which the specific provision is a part, and whether that scheme is consistent with judicial review or rather bespeaks a congressional will to commit the particular area of decisionmaking to the agency\u2019s unreviewable discretion; and third, whether the area of decisionmaking traditionally has been viewed as within the agency\u2019s exclusive domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">As applied to section 1315(a), and in light of the presumption of reviewability, these considerations suggest that the Secretary\u2019s decision to grant waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements is reviewable under the APA. It is true, as the Secretary emphasizes, that the language of section 1315(a) is drafted in terms of the Secretary\u2019s subjective judgment. The section permits a waiver \u201cin the judgment of the Secretary\u201d and \u201cto the extent and for the period [she] finds necessary.\u201d But this language by itself is not determinative. <em>See County of Esmeralda v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Energy, </em>925 F.2d 1216, 1218-19 (9th Cir.1991) (finding reviewable a provision of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act which gives the Energy Secretary discretion to define the units of local government affected by radioactive waste repositories).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the statute provides standards, law to apply, by providing that the Secretary may grant waivers when \u201clikely to assist in promoting the objectives\u201d of the AFDC program <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cto the extent and for the period ... necessary\u201d to enable the state to carry out the project. Thus, although within the Secretary\u2019s discretion, the decision to grant a waiver is not entirely open-ended. <em>Cf. State of Nevada v. Watkins, </em>914 F.2d 1545, 1563 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">Further, the structure of the Social Security Act does not suggest that the matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>waivers is committed to the agency\u2019s unre-viewable discretion or that judicial review would \u201cendanger\u201d that statutory scheme. <em>See Esmeralda, </em>925 F.2d at 1219. Unlike the National Security Act in <em>Webster, </em>the provisions of the AFDC program do not reveal a congressional commitment to the unfettered discretion of the Secretary. Rather than confer to the Secretary a general and unspecific mandate to aid dependent children, Congress has instead devised complex and detailed assistance programs which the Secretary is directed to implement. Although it would have been possible for Congress to draft section 1315 in less discretionary terms, nowhere in the AFDC program is there a clear statement or even an implication that such decisions, if discretionary, are not subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">Finally, the granting of an exemption from statutory requirements is not an area of agency discretion traditionally unreviewable. Indeed, it would be somewhat surprising were Congress to grant unreviewable discretion to the Secretary to exempt States from such an all-encompassing series of statutory requirements. Perhaps for this reason, every court that has looked at section 1315 has assumed that the Secretary\u2019s waiver decisions are subject to at least limited review. <em>See Aguayo v. Richardson, </em>473 F.2d 1090 (2d Cir.1973); <em>Crane v. Mathews, </em>417 F.Supp. 532 (N.D.Ga.1976); <em>California Welfare Rights Organization v. Richardson, </em>348 F.Supp. 491 (N.D.Cal.1972).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One may acknowledge that the Secretary\u2019s position is of some force particularly in light of certain of the language in <em>Webster. </em>But on a broader view, the relevant considerations suggest that the decision of the Secretary to grant a waiver under section 1315 is not committed to agency discretion by law. The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim on this basis is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">The court now turns to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Secretary\u2019s grant of waivers here violated the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">B. <em>Scope of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">The parties agree that under section 706(2)(A) of the APA the substance of the Secretary\u2019s decision to grant the waiver may only be overturned if \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d Under this standard, the court must merely \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823-24, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). \u201cThe court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Review here must be particularly narrow because the terms of the waiver provision in section 1315(a) so emphasize that the decision is discretionary and within the Secretary\u2019s judgment. Judicial review is limited to whether the Secretary had a rational basis for making a judgment that the waiver was warranted. <em>Aguayo, </em>473 F.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-13\">At oral argument, plaintiffs came close to conceding that they would not prevail in a challenge to the substance of the Secretary\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and instead focused their argument on a <em>procedural </em>review of the Secretary\u2019s action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that section 1315 requires the Secretary to make two specific findings: (1) that in the Secretary\u2019s judgment the Demonstration Project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>was likely to assist in promoting the objectives of the AFDC.statute; and (2) that the extent and time period of the waiver was necessary to enable the State to conduct the project. Because neither finding explicitly appears in the administrative record, plaintiffs contend that the waiver must be invalidated and the case remanded to the Secretary to make the required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of section 1315 is in error. The statute nowhere requires the Secretary \u201cto make findings.\u201d The statute merely authorizes the Secretary to grant a waiver for a time period and to an extent the Secretary \u201cfinds\u201d \u2014 in the sense of determines \u2014 necessary to carry out the state project. This language is not the equivalent of a requirement to make findings. Similarly, the Secretary must exercise \u201cjudgment,\u201d but need not make a \u201cfinding,\u201d to determine that the project is likely to promote the objectives of the Act. In none of the three published cases challenging a Secretary\u2019s waiver decision under section 1315 did the court order the Secretary to make formal findings. <em>See Aguayo, </em>473 F.2d at 1103, 1106 (the court acknowledged there was no statement of grounds for the decision in the record before it, but found the papers on which the agency acted sufficient to conduct a review of the decision); <em>California Welfare Rights Organization, </em>348 F.Supp. at 496 (the court discerned on its own, without apparent guidance from the Secretary, the objectives the project and waiver were designed to meet); <em>Crane, </em>417 F.Supp. at 538 (between the first and second hearings on plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion, the Secretary issued a memorandum setting forth in detail the objectives the project and waiver were designed to achieve; there is no indication the court required the memorandum).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">In the absence of a statutory directive, formal findings are not required under the APA. <em>Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 417, 91 S.Ct. at 824.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet there must exist enough of a record to support the agency action \u2014 to show that the agency has considered the relevant factors and to enable the court adequately to review whether the agency\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious. <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion, </em>470 U.S. 729, 744, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 1607, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985); <em>Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142-43, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 1243-44, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973). If the agency\u2019s failure to explain frustrates effective judicial review, \u201cthe proper course is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d <em>Florida Power, </em>470 U.S. at 744, 105 S.Ct. at 1607; <em>see also Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 420, 91 S.Ct. at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">While the court may not supply a basis for the agency decision that the agency itself has not given, it may \u201cuphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2867, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). Further, a lower standard of justification is warranted where the statute merely requires the Secretary to make an overall judgment, rather than requiring the Secretary to make specific findings based on prescribed criteria. <em>See Aguayo, </em>473 F.2d at 1103 (it is \u201clegitimate for an administrator to set a lower threshold for persuasion\u201d when required to reach a \u201cjudgment\u201d about a project which is merely experimental and of limited duration); <em>see also Sierra Pac. Indus. v. Lyng, </em>866 F.2d 1099, 1107 (9th Cir.1989) (Secretary of Agriculture has discretion to impose different conditions on two timber sale contracts and the Secretary need not provide an explanation where \u201cit is manifest\u201d that the contracts are qualitatively different).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">In the circumstances of this case, no remand is necessary because the record before the court is adequate for judicial review. The situation is similar to that in <em>Aguayo; </em>the Secretary has not explicitly presented the grounds for the waiver decision, yet the materials before the Secretary at the time of the decision, as well as the Secretary\u2019s approval letter, suffice to examine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>Secretary failed to \u201cconsider the relevant factors\u201d or made a \u201cclear error in judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, the record includes: (1) the Secretary\u2019s October 29, 1992 approval of the project, including a letter to California officials, a list of waivers granted, and detailed \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d of the waiver approval, see Pis.\u2019 Ex. 4; (2) California\u2019s waiver request dated September 17, 1992, which includes a statement of the objectives and hypotheses of the research project, see Pis.\u2019 Ex. 3; and (3) comments by the Western Center on Law and Poverty, plaintiffs\u2019 lead counsel in this suit, objecting to numerous aspects of the Demonstration Project. As discussed in the following section, these materials are sufficient to determine if the Secretary considered the relevant factors and made a clear error in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">C. <em>Validity of the Waivers</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_T\">The Secretary\u2019s waivers are arbitrary and capricious if inconsistent with the standards for waivers provided in section 1315. There is no dispute that as to the first component of the waiver statute\u2014whether the project \u20187s likely to assist in promoting the objectives\u201d of the AFDC program\u2014the Secretary\u2019s decision to grant waivers was reasonable. The goals of the work incentive component were outlined by the State in its waiver request as (1) providing incentives to seek and maintain employment; (2) reducing the attractiveness of welfare; (3) creating an incentive to work while still on aid; (4) increasing the long term earnings potential of AFDC recipients; and (5) removing barriers to full-time and part-time employment. Pis.\u2019 Ex. 3 at 8, 12. These goals are consistent with at least one of the objectives of the AFDC statute: \u201cto help ... parents or relatives [of needy dependent children] to attain or retain capability for the maximum self-support and personal independence consistent with the maintenance of continuing parental care and protection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601. That the Secretary considered the Project\u2019s likelihood of promoting this objective is evident in the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d accompanying the waiver approval. Condition number 3.11 requires the State to conduct an \u201cimpact study\u201d to examine the extent to which the Demonstration Project \u201chelp[s] AFDC recipients to achieve self-sufficiency,\u201d as well as the effect of the project on \u201cemployment rates, length of employment, amount of earned income, and exit and recidivism rates for AFDC and Food Stamps.\u201d Pls.Ex. 4, Waiver Terms and Conditions at 7. The Secretary considered the relevant factors and her judgment that the Demonstration Project promotes the objectives of the AFDC statute is not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">The waiver statute also instructs the Secretary to permit waivers \u201cto the extent and for the period he finds necessary to enable such State ... to carry out such project.\u201d Plaintiffs challenge the breadth of the waivers for the work incentive project. They claim that it was arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to approve statewide waivers when data will only be collected from a handful of counties. This challenge to the Secretary\u2019s action fails. As a preliminary matter, the Secretary\u2019s decision to approve the research design appears well considered. The detailed \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d attached to the approval of the waivers demonstrate the Secretary\u2019s evaluation of the feasibility and validity of the research design as well as its overall cost-neutrality. See Pis.\u2019 Ex. 4, Waiver Terms and Conditions at 2, 4-6, 8-12. Comments submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys specifically raised the objection that the waivers were broader than necessary to accomplish the purpose of the project. See Pis.\u2019 Ex.C. These comments, and the Secretary\u2019s evident rejection of them, suggest that the agency considered and rejected a narrower research scope. <em>See Aguayo, </em>473 F.2d at 1105-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">Nor is the breadth of the waivers arbitrary or capricious. As the Secretary notes, the language of section 1315(a) asks the Secretary to determine if a waiver is necessary to accomplish the <em>State\u2019s </em>project. Since the State designed a five year, statewide project, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>the Secretary argues that any waiver must be that broad. Even if this argument appears somewhat disingenuous in light of the detailed \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d attached to the approval, the Secretary surely may grant a broad degree of latitude to the states in the design and scope of experimental projects. Moreover, it is evident from the record that a good deal of thought went into the Secretary\u2019s approval of the research design. It is understandable that the State and the Secretary would require that a project providing a benefit cut should be implemented on a statewide basis for reasons of-equity and to avoid the possible movement of AFDC recipients from counties covered by the project to those that were not. The Secretary\u2019s determination that statewide waivers were warranted is not a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-3\">Plaintiffs also contend that the Secretary acted arbitrarily or capriciously in granting waivers for the work incentive program because the application of benefit cuts to those of the disabled who are unable to work, and so unable to make up the benefit cut through earnings, violates the ADA. In response, the Secretary argues that the Social Security Act does not exist to enforce the ADA and thus she need not consider potential violations of the ADA when exercising her discretion under the Social Security Act. While the court is unwilling to endorse the view that the Secretary need never consider the requirements imposed by other federal laws in deciding whether to approve a waiver, in the circumstances here it was not arbitrary or capricious to, fail to do so. As discussed at length in a later section of this memorandum, the Demonstration Project does not violate the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">For the reasons stated above, the court finds that plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their section 1315 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AoZU\">II. <em>The Human Subjects Experimentation Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Congress has restricted the ability of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) to expend federal funds on experimental projects which present a danger to the physical, mental or emotional well-being of any human participants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1274-8\">None of the funds appropriated by this Act or subsequent ... Appropriation Acts shall be used to pay for any research program or project or any program, project or course which is of an experimental nature, or any other activity involving human participants, which is <em>determined by the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction to present a danger to the physical, mental, or emotional well-being of a participant </em>or subject of such program, project, or course, <em>without the written, informed consent of each participant </em>or subject, or a participant\u2019s parents or legal guardian, if such participant or subject is under eighteen years of age. The Secretary shall adopt appropriate regulations respecting this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, Pub.L. No. 102-394, \u00a7 211, 106 Stat. 1792, 1812 (1992) (emphasis added). While first enacted in the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare (\u201cHEW,\u201d the predecessor agency to HHS) Appropriations Act of 1975, Pub.L. No. 93-517, \u00a7 412, 88 Stat. 1634, this language has been included in every subsequent HEW and HHS appropriations act. Plaintiffs claim that the Secretary\u2019s expenditure of federal funds on the Demonstration Project<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without obtaining the written, informed consent of all AFDC recipients subject to the benefit cut violates section 211 and constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">Defendants move to dismiss this claim on two grounds^ (1) that there is no judicial review of a violation of section 211; and (2) that an experiment which merely reduces welfare benefits does not, as a matter of law, present a danger to participants within the meaning of section 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">A. <em>Reviewability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-12\">The APA provides a cause of action for review of the Secretary\u2019s actions under section 211. There is no dispute that plaintiffs are human participants in a federally-funded \u201cexperiment.\u201d <em>See Crane, </em>417 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>F.Supp. at 546; Federal Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss at 47. As such they are \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by a decision not to provide them with informed consent, and \u201centitled to judicial review\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. <em>See Doe v. Sullivan, </em>938 F.2d 1370, 1382 (D.C.Cir.1991) (finding reviewable under the APA plaintiffs claim that a Food and Drug Administration regulation was invalid because it conflicted with the informed consent requirements of the Department of Defense Authorization Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">The Secretary\u2019s argument to the contrary is not persuasive. The Secretary argues as before that because the granting of waivers under section 1315 is, in her view, \u201ccommitted to agency discretion,\u201d so must be a decision under section 211 as to whether the particular program under review amounts to a danger to the participants. But even if section 1315 waivers were committed to agency discretion, the Secretary\u2019s actions under section 211 would be independently reviewable. The duties imposed on the Secretary under section 211 are wholly separate and different from those imposed under section 1315. Further, the language of section 211 does not \u201cexude deference\u201d to the agency. <em>See Webster, </em>486 U.S. at 600, 108 S.Ct. at 2052. Athough it allows the Secretary discretion to determine when a danger is presented by a project, it provides specific criteria\u2014\u201cdanger to physical, mental or emotional well-being\u201d\u2014to guide that discretion and requires the Secretary to issue regulations consistent with the statutory criteria. Finally, far from excluding judicial review, or committing the matter solely to the agency\u2019s discretion, Congress expressly provides that the courts may determine whether danger is present within the meaning of the statute. A1 of these factors support the conclusion that judicial review of section 211 under the APA is not foreclosed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">B. <em>No Danger as a Matter of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">The Secretary urges dismissal of the section 211 claim because demonstration projects that reduce public assistance benefits do not, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d pose a danger to the physical, mental or emotional well-being of recipients within the meaning of the statute. This interpretation is not supported by the language of the statute, its legislative history, or the Secretary\u2019s implementing regulations. <em>See Alaniz v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>728 F.2d 1460 (Fed.Cir.1984) (a position adopted by an agency for the purpose of litigation, when no evidence in the record supports the interpretation, is not due deference). The Secretary acknowledges that the language of section 211 nowhere expressly exempts\u2019 financial injury from a benefit cut from the definition of \u201cdanger.\u201d Fed.Defs.\u2019 Reply on Mot. to Dismiss at 35-36. Further, when first enacted in the 1975 Appropriations Act, the language in section 211 was intended to apply an existing set of 1974 HEW regulations governing the use of HEW grants and contracts on human subjects research to projects undertaken by HEW itself. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 31,596-97 (1974) (statement of Sen. Buckley) (\u201c[T]his amendment ... simply establishes in law and somewhat broadens the protection of human subjects of research and experimentation and similar activities which is already a part of HEW regulations ... to include activities carried out by HEW itself.\u201d). Those original 1974 regulations protected any individual exposed to the possibility of \u201csocial\u201d as well as physical or psychological harm. 38 Fed.Reg. 27,882 (1973). It is not clear that financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>harm was necessarily excluded from those broader regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-3\">Finally, HHS has implemented the Appropriations Act directive through its regulations governing human subject research at 45 C.F.R. Part 46. The regulations provide that research involving human subjects conducted, supported or regulated by HHS must comply with two primary safeguards: (1) prior review of the project by an institutional review board (IRB), <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46.107\u2014.115; and (2) informed consent of research subjects, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46.116-.124. Section 46.-101(b)(5)(i) explicitly exempts research involving public benefit programs, including changes in benefit levels, from the safeguards provided in the regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-4\">(b) Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this policy: ... (5) Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or subject to the approval of department or agency heads, and which are designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-5\">(i) Public benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">However, the regulations provide for discretionary application of safeguards to exempted research:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-7\">(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 46.102(d). Thus, the regulations do not provide a blanket exemption for decreases in levels of public benefits. Instead, the regulations provide that as a general rule a project which changes benefit levels will not present a danger such that informed consent is required, but do not foreclose such a finding of danger in any particular case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The motion to dismiss on this basis is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">C. <em>Validity of Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">In asking the court to overturn the Secretary\u2019s implicit finding of no danger, plaintiffs urge that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute, as expressed in the regulations defining danger, is not entitled to deference. As discussed above, the regulations issued under the statute provide that public benefit projects are generally exempt from the informed consent requirements of section 211 and thus that \u201cdanger to physical, mental or emotional well-being\u201d within the meaning of section 211 generally excludes risks created by public benefit research projects, including those which change the level of benefits provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">Deference is due \u201cto any reasonable construction of a regulatory statute adopted by the agency charged with the enforcement of that statute.\u201d <em>Clarke v. Securities Indus. Assn., </em>479 U.S. 388, 404-05, 107 S.Ct. 750, 759-60, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987); <em>see also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). No deference is appropriate, however, if Congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43,104 S.Ct. at 2781-82. The court \u201cmust reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 2782 n. 9. If, however, Congress is silent on the issue or congressional intent is ambiguous, the agency\u2019s interpretation is up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>held if based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. \u201cThe court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute\u201d when the agency has issued a reasonable interpretation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">The plain language of section 211 and its legislative history do not establish an unambiguous intent to include financial injury from public benefit research within the scope of projects presenting a \u201cdanger to the physical, mental or emotional well-being.\u201d Terms such as \u201cdanger\u201d and \u201cwell-being\u201d are not self-defining and Congress recognized as much by providing that the Secretary should issue implementing regulations. The legislative history suggests that the sponsors of section 211 were focused primarily on medical research projects using human subjects. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 31,596-97 (1974) (statements of Sen. Biden, Sen. Buckley). Surely if Congress intended that any experimental cut to any federally supported public benefit program would require the written informed consent of the recipients, either the statute or the legislative history would explicitly express this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Given that the intent of Congress to include public benefit programs is not clear from the face of the statute, the court must uphold the agency\u2019s construction of the statute unless unreasonable, and here the agency\u2019s position is not unreasonable. Legitimate reasons for exempting public benefit projects are evident from the record. First, in a 1976 interpretation, the agency explained why the 1974 regulations (upon which section 211 was based) did not apply to protect individuals from potential financial injury posed by a research project: \u201c[C]ausing a lowering of ... income ... would not depart from the normal experiences which other Americans can expect to encounter in their daily lives and would thus not constitute the type of departure from \u2018ordinary and accepted methods\u2019 to which the regulations were intended to apply; ... [the regulations were] not intended to protect individuals from the \u2018ordinary risks of daily life.\u2019 \u201d 41 Fed.Reg. 26,573 (1976). Second, comments published with regulations proposed in 1982 and promulgated in 1983 express the belief of the agency that public benefit projects are already subjected to substantial review by state and federal officials and that subjecting them to further regulation would be \u201cduplicative and needlessly burdensome,\u201d and would result in \u201cunnecessary delays in project implementation.\u201d 48 Fed.Reg. 9266 (1983); 47 Fed.Reg. 2278 (1982). Public benefit research involves matters such as eligibility criteria and delivery systems, which are more within the expertise of program officials than a review board. 48 Fed.Reg. 9268 (1983). For these reasons the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute as generally excluding public benefits projects is based on reasonable considerations and is entitled to deference.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 865, 104 S.Ct. at 2793.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">D. <em>Section 211 and the California Demonstration Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">Section 211 does not require the Secretary to make a formal finding of no \u201cdanger to the physical, mental or emotional well-being of a participant.\u201d Thus, the court may uphold the Secretary\u2019s decision not to require informed consent of AFDC recipients \u201cif the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, </em>463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2867. Here, there is no reference to the section 211 requirement in the Secretary\u2019s letter and attachments approving the waiver. However, in their comments submitted to the agency prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>waiver approval, counsel for plaintiffs argued that a danger under section 211 did exist for AFDC recipients. Pis.\u2019 Ex. C. These comments provide some evidence that the agency-considered its obligation under section 211 prior to taking action. <em>See Aguayo, </em>473 F.2d at 1105-06. Further, an explicit determination of no danger is not required by the regulations; the Secretary must only take action if she determines the public benefit exemption should <em>not </em>apply. In these circumstances, one fairly may assume that the Secretary found no reason to treat the Demonstration Project as an exception to the general rule. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s determination that no danger was presented by the 1.3% benefit cut is discernable from the waiver approval itself and from the materials before the agency at the time of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-3\">The Secretary\u2019s failure to require informed consent from AFDC recipients subject to the 1.3% benefit cut was not error. Plaintiffs experience a degree of hardship when there is any decrease in benefits. But a 1.3% cut is not so significant as to remove the Demonstration Project from the general exemption of benefits projects from the informed consent requirement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, this is exactly the type of project at which the public benefits exemption is directed, one involving \u201cchanges in ... levels of payment.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.101(b)(5)(i).

The states are required to provide qualified disabled persons with aids, benefits and services that are as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, benefit or level of achievement as that provided to others, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 35.130(b)(l)(iii), and may not utilize criteria or methods of administration that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of a program with respect to qualified disabled individuals, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 35.130(b)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">In addition, the regulations prohibit a public entity from denying equal services, programs or activities to an individual or entity \u201cbecause of the known disability of [a person] with whom the individual or entity is known to have a relationship or association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 35.130(g). Further, section 35.130(b)(7) requires a public entity to \u201cmake reasonable modifications in policies, practices or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d unless the modifications fundamentally alter the nature of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the Demonstration Project violates the ADA by cutting the AFDC payments of that subset of disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>persons who cannot work and therefore cannot take advantage of the benefits of the project\u2019s various work incentives.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The argument is of some force. It is not disputed that the Demonstration Project was intended to create work incentives for recipients able to work; the effect of the project on those disabled recipients who are unable to work appears unintended and serves no stated goal of the project.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It appears harsh to cut the benefits of those who cannot work, and of their dependents, as part of a work incentive experiment. Nonetheless, the Demonstration Project does not violate the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">Plaintiffs do not argue that any cut in social welfare programs violates the ADA, and it would place extraordinary restrictions on the states\u2019 ability to design a budget and to fashion and alter welfare programs were this the ease. Even so, an across the board cut in benefits undoubtedly falls heaviest on the disabled since they are less able to offset the loss through employment or other adjustment. <em>Cf. Alexander v. Choate, </em>469 U.S. 287, 289, 105 S.Ct. 712, 714, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985) (disproportionate impact on disabled Medicaid recipients of a cut in benefits does not violate the Rehabilitation Act).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nor do plaintiffs attack the work incentives other than the benefit cut provided by the Demon-station Project or contend that any work programs or work incentives provided by a state must violate the ADA since some of the disabled may not be eligible for such programs. The benefits of such programs are not available to those unable to work, but the ADA prohibits discrimination only as against qualified individuals with disabilities and one unable to work would not be qualified for such work related programs. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131; <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979). Thus, had the Demonstration Project only enhanced work incentives, by permitting working AFDC recipients to retain more of their earnings, plaintiffs could not attack the project under the ADA even though the effective income of AFDC recipients, unable to work, would be diminished relative to those recipients able to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">Plaintiffs suggest that although the State could independently reduce AFDC benefits and enhance work incentives, it may not, under the ADA, do both as part of a single project. It is unclear why the State may not do in one program what- it may do in two. The ADA prohibits the State from excluding the qualified disabled from participation in the \u201cbenefits of [its] services, programs, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Under the Demonstration Project, disabled AFDC recipients continue to receive AFDC in the same amounts as other recipients. The benefit cut cannot fairly be characterized as a \u201cservice, program, or activity,\u201d and if it can be, it falls on all recipients alike. If it is the intended enhanced incentive to work that may follow upon a benefit cut which is the \u201cservice, program, or activity,\u201d no distinction can be drawn between the benefit cut and the other work incentives, such as the more generous rules on retained earnings, which plaintiffs do not attack and which do not violate the ADA. Plaintiffs who are unable to work are not \u201cqualified\u201d persons under the ADA for the benefit of a work incentive, whether that benefit takes the form of a cut to AFDC, or a work training program, or a change in the rules concerning retention of earned income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Certainly the State could exclude from the benefit cut those of the disabled who are unable to work. It would be humane to do so. Whether this would be difficult administratively does not appear from the record now before the court. But the ADA does not require the State to make this accommodation. <em>Cf. Alexander, </em>469 U.S. at 308, 105 S.Ct. at 724 (State need not minimize effect of proposed benefit cut on the disabled).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Here the same benefit \u2014 AFDC payments \u2014 are offered to the disabled and non-disabled alike. No benefit for which the wholly disabled are qualified is denied to them.

Even were plaintiffs to raise serious questions regarding these claims, the balance of hardships does not tip sharply in their favor. This benefit cut, while serious for AFDC recipients, is not draconian. Where a motion for preliminary injunctive relief involves public assistance programs, \u201cthe public interest is a factor to be strongly considered.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 1432, 1435 (9th Cir.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>463 U.S. 1328, 104 S.Ct. 10, 77 L.Ed.2d 1431 (1983).

The motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1267-14\">. AFDC is a \"cooperative federalism\u201d program created by the Social Security Act of 1935. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-687.

In addition to review under the APA, plaintiffs claim that section 211 creates an implied private right of action allowing aggrieved research subjects to obtain an independent judicial determination of \"danger.\u201d But even were there a cause of action under section 211, the court would be guided by the Secretary\u2019s regulations, and agency interpretations of those regulations, in determining whether there were a \"danger\" to plaintiffs under the Demonstration Project. For this reason, review under the APA and directly under section 211 will not be materially different and it is not necessary on this motion for preliminary injunction to decide whether a private right of action exists on section 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">Plaintiffs also claim that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \"creates a vehicle by which plaintiffs can seek redress against the State for violation of the Appropriations Act.\" Pis.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 23. This argument fails because section 211 is directed at the Secretary and imposes no requirement or obligation on the state. <em>See Suter </em>v. <em>Artist M., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 1367-68, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992); <em>Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v.

Even the Secretary\u2019s 1976 interpretation of the original HEW regulations, cited by the defendants as the strongest statement that the regulations never intended to cover financial injury, is not absolute: \"[A] diminution in the level of welfare benefits <em>(within prescribed boundaries) </em>payable to some but not all similarly situated welfare beneficiaries, ... would not constitute burdens or effects of the nature that the regulations are intended to encompass.\" 41 Fed.Reg. 26,572-73 (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">. Plaintiffs also argue that little deference is due to the Secretary's interpretation because her position has been inconsistent. <em>See INS v. Cardozo-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 446 n. 30, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1221 n. 30, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (\u2018\u2018[a]n agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency\u2019s earlier interpretation is 'entitled to considerably less deference' than a consistently held agency view\u201d). This argument is without merit. The agency\u2019s interpretation of section 211 has been largely consistent over the last twenty years, beginning with the 1976 interpretation at 41 Fed.Reg. 26,572 and continuing to the present version of the regulations at 45 C.F.R. Part 46. In 1981, the agency did promulgate regulations which subjected public benefit experiments as a class to IRB review; but even then the regulations continued to provide discretionary exemptions of public benefit projects from informed consent requirements. 46 Fed. Reg. 8386, 8390 (1981). The general exemption for public benefits projects was reinstated in 1983, and has remained in the regulation since.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">.
