The policy insured two automobiles owned by Russell Tye, including a 1975 Ford Mustang, for liability and uninsured motorist coverage. Russell Tye paid a substantial additional premium on the policy because his twenty-year-old grandson, Eric Lilze, was a \u201crated driver\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">On March 12, 1988, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Russell Tye gave Lilze, who lived in the Tye household, permission to drive the Mustang to a job interview in Mt. Carmel, Ohio, which was a short distance from the Tye residence. However, Lilze did not return directly home after the interview. Instead, Lilze drove to Morrow, Ohio, to visit Jennifer Seebree and Seebree\u2019s six-year-old son, Shawn Kelly. Subsequently-, they were joined by Seebree\u2019s friend, Glenna Hawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">At approximately 6:00 p.m., Lilze called the Tye residence and informed his grandmother, Frances Tye, the insured\u2019s spouse, that he would be late but would be home for dinner. Frances Tye was aware that Eric was driving the Mustang and was calling from outside the Mt. Carmel area. Russell Tye was present in the room when Lilze called.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Lilze and Seebree apparently spent several hours consuming alcoholic beverages. Subsequently, Lilze, Seebree, Hawk and Kelly went for a drive in the Mustang. Lilze originally drove the car. However, at some point, Seebree asked if she could drive and Lilze turned the keys over to her. While Seebree was driving, she lost control of the vehicle, causing it to run off the road. The resulting crash killed Lilze, Seebree and Kelly and injured Hawk. An autopsy report revealed that Seebree\u2019s blood alcohol level was .25.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">On November 15, 1989, Kelly\u2019s estate filed a complaint for wrongful death against Seebree\u2019s estate. Subsequently, Kelly\u2019s estate filed an amended complaint naming Lilze\u2019s estate as an additional defendant. Lilze\u2019s estate then filed a cross-claim against Seebree\u2019s estate for the wrongful death of Lilze.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">On April 2, 1990, Nationwide filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against the estates of Kelly, Seebree and Lilze and against Russell Tye. In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>complaint, Nationwide asked the court to declare that it did not have to provide coverage under Russell Tye\u2019s policy for the claims of the estates of Lilze, Seebree and Kelly. After a bench trial, the trial court concluded that, because Lilze and Seebree drove the vehicle without permission at the time of the accident, Nationwide was not obligated to furnish coverage under either the liability or uninsured motorist coverage of Russell Tye\u2019s policy. Kelly\u2019s estate, Lilze\u2019s estate, and Russell Tye filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Kelly\u2019s estate presents two assignments of error for review, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in holding no coverage existed under the policy of insurance in question for any liability incurred by the Estate of Eric Lilze to the Estate of Shawn Kelly due to Lilze\u2019s negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s finding that Eric Lilze\u2019s use of the covered vehicle was outside the scope of the named insured\u2019s permission was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Lilze\u2019s estate and Russell Tye collectively (\u201cLilze\u2019s estate\u201d) present two assignments of error for review, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">\u201cThe court erred as a matter of law in finding that Nationwide is not obligated to furnish coverage under the liability provisions of the subject automobile insurance policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">\u201cThe court erred as a matter of law in finding that Nationwide is not obligated to furnish coverage under the uninsured motorist provisions of the subject automobile insurance policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">Since appellants\u2019 first assignments of error are identical, we will consider them together. Appellants argue that because Lilze was a member of the Tye household, he was covered under Russell Tye\u2019s policy, regardless of whether he had permission to drive the Mustang at the time of the accident. We find these assignments of error to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">An insurance policy is a contract and the relationship between the insurer and the insured is purely contractual in nature. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marsh </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 15 OBR 261, 262, 472 N.E.2d 1061, 1062. The interpretation and construction of insurance policies is a matter of law to be determined by the court using rules of construction and interpretation applicable to contracts generally. <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 275-276, 436 N.E.2d 1347, 1348-1349; <em>Value City, Inc. v. Integrity Ins. Co. </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 274, 276, 30 OBR 472, 474, 508 N.E.2d 184, 186. In insurance policies, as in other contracts, words and phrases are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning unless there is something in the contract which would indicate a contrary intention. <em>Olmstead v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 212, 216, 51 O.O.2d 285, 288, 259 N.E.2d 123, 126. Where the provisions of an insurance policy are clear and unambiguous, courts may not indulge themselves in enlarging the contract by implication in order to embrace an object distinct from that contemplated by the parties. <em>Gomolka, supra, </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 168, 24 O.O.3d at 276, 436 N.E.2d at 1348. However, where the provisions of a contract of insurance are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Under the heading \u201cAuto Liability-Coverage,\u201d the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cProperty damage and bodily injury liability coverage. Under this coverage, if you become legally obligated to pay damages resulting from the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of your auto, we will pay for such damages. <em>Anyone living in your household has this protection. Also </em>protected is any person or organization who is legally responsible for the use of your auto and uses it with your permission. This permission may be expressed or implied. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Applying the plain language of the policy, we find there are two classes of individuals covered: (1) anyone living in the insured\u2019s household, <em>and </em>(2) any person who is legally responsible for the use of the insured auto and uses it with the insured\u2019s permission. Otherwise, the term \u201calso\u201d has no purpose. The \u201chousehold member\u201d clause is unqualified by any reference to permission and the issue of permission is irrelevant. Therefore, the trial court erred in basing its conclusion that there was no coverage on the issue of permission. Lilze was covered under the policy because he was a member of the Tye household. This holding is in accord with that of other jurisdictions interpreting similar policy language. <em>Preston v. Tromm </em>(Apr. 26, 1990), Marion App. No. 9-88-31, unreported, 1990 WL 61748; <em>State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hawk </em>(Mar. 17, 1986), Stark App. No. CA-6751, unreported, 1986 WL 3922; <em>Kenyon v. Newton </em>(1988), 144 A.D.2d 901, 534 N.Y.S.2d 600; <em>Peerless Ins. Co. v. Vigue </em>(1975), 115 N.H. 492, 345 A.2d 399; <em>Oregon Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hollopeter </em>(1968), 251 Ore. 619, 447 P.2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Because Lilze is an insured under the policy, Nationwide is required to provide coverage and defense provided Lilze was \u201cusing\u201d the covered vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The policy provides coverage for an insured from liability arising out of the \u201cuse\u201d of a covered vehicle. Appellants argue that because Lilze, a covered insured, was present in the vehicle when the liability occurred, he was \u201cusing\u201d the vehicle. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Appellants rely on <em>Brown v. Kennedy </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 457, 26 O.O. 6, 48 N.E.2d 857, in which the Ohio Supreme Court held in the syllabus: \u201cWhere an insurance policy covers one who uses the specified automobile with the permission of the named insured, the insurance company is not relieved of liability by reason of the fact that while the permittee was using the automobile it was being driven by another at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Brown </em>involved an accident where Bennett White was driving an automobile with the permission of Dorothy Kennedy, the named insured\u2019s daughter. The named insured\u2019s daughter was in the car when the accident occurred. The relevant portion of the named insured\u2019s policy provided that the policy covered any person using the automobile mentioned in the policy with the permission of the named insured. The court held that Dorothy Kennedy was using the automobile despite the fact that she was not actually driving the car. The court stated that \u201cthe words \u2018using,\u2019 \u2018used,\u2019 and \u2018actual use\u2019 do not have the limited meaning of \u2018operating,\u2019 \u2018operated,\u2019 or \u2018actual operation.\u2019 The defense that Bennett White was driving does not negative that fact that Dorothy Kennedy was using the automobile.\u201d <em>Id., </em>141 Ohio St. at 464, 26 O.O. at 9, 48 N.E.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><em>Brown </em>clearly stands for the proposition that the term \u201cuse\u201d is broader than operating or driving. See, also, <em>MacLellan v. Motorists Ins. Co. </em>(June 21, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 57169, unreported, 1990 WL 84264. In the present case, Lilze was present in the vehicle when the accident occurred and under the rule expressed in <em>Brown </em>he was \u201cusing\u201d the vehicle. Accordingly, the accident arose out of the \u201cuse\u201d of the covered vehicle by a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The trial court distinguished <em>Brown </em>on the basis that, in <em>Brown, </em>Dorothy Kennedy was using the automobile with the permission of the named insured. The trial court specifically held that Lilze was not using the automobile for any purpose for which he had been given permission by the named insured. However, the language of the policy in <em>Brown, </em>unlike the policy in the present case, specifically required the permission of the named insured even for a household member. We have already concluded that under the policy in the present case, permission was not a requirement for a household member to be covered, and we find this distinction to be irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In sum, we conclude that, under the plain language of the policy, Eric Lilze was a covered individual, and the trial court erred by concluding he was not. We would also note that appellee\u2019s reliance on the issue of negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>entrustment is inappropriate in this declaratory judgment action, the purpose of which is to determine insurance coverage. That issue is more appropriately determined in the underlying liability suit. We hold that Nationwide is required to provide a defense for Eric Lilze and to pay any claims against Lilze in the event he should be found liable in the underlying wrongful death suit. Accordingly, both appellants\u2019 first assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In its second assignment of error, Kelly\u2019s estate claims that the trial court\u2019s finding that Lilze\u2019s use- of the covered vehicle was outside the scope of the named insured\u2019s permission was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Since we have already concluded that Lilze was a covered individual regardless of whether he had permission to drive the vehicle, we need not determine this issue. Accordingly, Kelly\u2019s estate\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In its second assignment of error, Lilze\u2019s estate claims that it is entitled to uninsured motorist coverage under Tye\u2019s policy for claims it has against Seebree\u2019s estate, since Seebree was an uninsured motorist. It argues that the exclusion under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy for use of a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner is unenforceable. We find this assignment of error to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">R.C. 3937.18 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">.\u201c(A) No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless both of the following are provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201c(1) Uninsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for bodily injury or death under provisions approved by the superintendent of insurance, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting therefrom;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">\u201c(2) Underinsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for an insured against loss for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, where the limits of coverage available for payment to the insured under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured are less than the limits for the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>accident. The limits of liability for an insurer providing underinsured motorist coverage shall be the limits of such coverage, less those amounts actually recovered under all applicable bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The applicable uninsured motorist provisions of the policy provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkK\">\u201cUnder this coverage, we will pay bodily injury damages that you or your legal representative are legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle. Damages must result from an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured vehicle. Bodily injury means bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">As to the claims of Lilze\u2019s estate, the Mustang was an uninsured motor vehicle because Seebree was the only party who might be liable for Lilze\u2019s death, and Seebree was uninsured. However, under the uninsured motorist provision, the policy contains a specific exclusion for \u201cuse of a motor vehicle by an insured without permission of the owner.\u201d The trial court concluded that because Lilze was not using the vehicle with the owner\u2019s permission, the exclusion applied and Nationwide was \u201cnot bound by the uninsured motorists provisions of the subject policy.\u201d The trial court made a specific finding of fact that Lilze was driving without permission. This finding was supported by competent, credible evidence and this court will not disturb it. See <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 10 OBR 408, 461 N. E.2d 1273; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. Therefore, the exclusion, if valid, must apply and uninsured motorist coverage is not available. The key question presented in this assignment of error, then, is whether the exclusion is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The Ohio Supreme Court recently decided <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Alexander </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 397, 583 N.E.2d 309, where it held in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201cAn automobile insurance policy may not eliminate or reduce uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, required by R.C. 3937.18, to persons injured in a motor vehicle accident, where the claim or claims of such persons arise from causes of action that are recognized by Ohio tort law. <em>{Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Finch </em>[1987], 32 Ohio St.3d 360, 513 N.E.2d 1324, paragraph two of the syllabus, overruled.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">In <em>State Farm, </em>Percy Alexander had an automobile insurance policy for his Ford Aerostar van with State Farm Automobile Insurance Company, with limits of $50,000/$100,000 for liability and uninsured motorist coverage. On May 7, 1988, Alexander was a passenger in his van, which was being driven by O\u2019Neal Cosey. While being driven by Cosey, the van was involved in a single-vehicle accident, which resulted in Cosey\u2019s death and Alexander suffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ing severe injuries. At the time of the accident, Cosey had an automobile insurance policy with limits of $12,500 for bodily injury, which was paid by Cosey\u2019s insurance company. Alexander sought underinsured motorist coverage from State Farm, which denied coverage due to a \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d for a motor vehicle insured under the liability provisions of Alexander\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court found the household exclusion to be invalid. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201cR.C. 3937.18(A)(1) and (2) are premised on the tortfeasor\u2019s <em>legal liability </em>to the injured insured. * * * Thus, the intent of the statute is to provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for injured persons who have a legal cause of action against a tortfeasor but who are uncompensated because the tortfeasor is either (1) not covered by liability insurance or (2) covered in an amount that is less than the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201cState Farm\u2019s household exclusion ignores the statute\u2019s basic premise, to wit: the tortfeasor\u2019s legal liability to the insured. The State Farm policy eliminates uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage based solely on the fact that the tortfeasor is driving the insured\u2019s automobile. By excluding coverage for torts that occur in the insured\u2019s vehicle, State Farm seeks to escape from part of the uninsured motorist coverage that R.C. 3937.18 requires it to provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201cIn essence State Farm\u2019s exclusion is an attempt to change Ohio\u2019s tort law, by contractual definition, in order to circumvent its duty to provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to R.C. 3937.18. This it cannot do. Accordingly, State Farm\u2019s exclusion is unenforceable because it conflicts with R.C. 3937.18.\u201d See, also, <em>Barr v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 595, 595 N.E.2d 531; <em>Ross v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 27, 1990), Franklin App. No. 90AP-165, unreported, 1990 WL 140549.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">In the present case, Lilze\u2019s estate is legally entitled to recover damages for the wrongful death of Lilze if Seebree\u2019s conduct is determined to be tortious in the underlying wrongful death suit. See R.C. 2125.02. However, it will be uncompensated because Seebree had no liability insurance. Therefore, under the provisions of R.C. 3937.18(A), Lilze\u2019s estate is entitled to uninsured motorist coverage. If it is determined that Lilze\u2019s estate has a legal right to recover from Seebree, then the issue of whether Lilze was driving with permission is irrelevant and the exclusion contravenes the provisions of the statute. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Alexander, supra, </em>we conclude that the exclusion for use of a motor vehicle without permission is invalid and Lilze\u2019s estate is entitled to uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Nationwide argues that because this case was pending before <em>Alexander </em>was decided, <em>Alexander </em>should not be applied retroactively. We disagree. The general rule is that an Ohio Supreme Court decision overruling a former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>decision is retrospective in operation. \u201c * * * [T]he effect is not that the former was bad law, but that it was never the law.\u201d <em>Peerless Elec. Co. v. Bowers </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 209, 210, 57 O.O. 411, 411, 129 N.E.2d 467, 468, appeal dismissed (1956), 352 U.S. 804, 77 S.Ct. 30, 1 L.Ed.2d 38. The one general exception to this rule is where contractual rights have arisen or vested rights have been acquired under the prior decision. <em>Peerless, supra, </em>at 210, 57 O.O. at 411, 129 N.E.2d at 468. We do not find that this exception applies since the contractual rights of the parties were always subject to the provisions of R.C. 3937.18 and the policies underlying it. Nationwide\u2019s claim that because insurance policies involve contractual rights, Supreme Court decisions could never be applied retroactively in insurance cases is erroneous. See <em>Blackburn v. Hamoudi </em>(Feb. 8, 1991), Franklin App. No. 89AP-1102, unreported, 1991 WL 16137; <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Zeiter </em>(Dec. 10, 1990), Seneca App. Nos. 13-89-27 and 13-89-28, unreported, 1990 WL 197918.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred by finding that Nationwide was not obligated to provide coverage under the uninsured motorist provisions of Russell Tye\u2019s policy. Accordingly, Lilze\u2019s estate\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b599-6\">Koehler, P.J., Walsh and Henderson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b599-7\">John W.
