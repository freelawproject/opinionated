This court affirmed Hamilton\u2019s convictions on February 7, 1990. <em>State v. Hamilton </em>(Feb. 7, 1990), Summit App. No. 14177, unreported, 1990 WL 11720.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Hamilton filed his initial petition for post-conviction relief during the pendency of his direct appeal. This action was dismissed by the trial court. Hamilton did not appeal from this dismissal. Following his direct appeal, Hamilton filed a second motion for post-conviction relief, which was also dismissed by the trial court. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal in <em>State v. Hamilton </em>(Jan. 23, 1991), Summit App. No. 14695, unreported, 1991 WL 6176.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">This cause is now before the court upon the trial court\u2019s denial of Hamilton\u2019s third motion for post-conviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing the defendant-appellant\u2019s post-conviction [sic] on the grounds of <em>res judicata, </em>a violation of defendant-appellant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by the Ohio and United States Constitutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Hamilton asserts that the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on his initial petition for post-conviction relief as his direct appeal was in process at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Hamilton made a similar assertion in his previous post-conviction relief appeal. See <em>State v. Hamilton, Id. </em>As in this previous case, \u201c[w]e find this contention [to be] devoid of merit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">Assignments of Error Nos. II and III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">\u201cII. The trial court erred and abuse <em>[sic </em>] it\u2019s <em>[sic </em>] descretion <em>[sic </em>] to the detriment of defendant-appellant by stateing <em>[sic </em>] the wrong statue <em>[sic </em>] for his reasoning as to what constitue [sic] a lesser included offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-15\">\u201cHI. Trial court\u2019s violation of defendant-appellant\u2019s due process rights as were guaranteed by the Ohio and United States Constitutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">Hamilton has failed to provide this court with a transcript of proceedings of the trial leading to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In the absence of an adequate record, which is appellant\u2019s responsibility, the court of appeals is unable to evaluate the merits of these assignments of error. <em>Volodkevich v. Volodkevich </em>(1989), 48 Ohio App.3d 313, 314, 549 N.E.2d 1237, 1238-1239. Furthermore, the lack of a transcript of the criminal proceedings against Hamilton suggests that there was not a transcript before the court, thereby foreclosing its review of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Accordingly, the second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Assignment of Error No. IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cTrial counsel\u2019s failure to represent the denfendant <em>[sic </em>]-appellant during trial amounted to ineffective assistance of trial counsel. A violation of the defendant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by the Ohio and United States Constitutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Hamilton asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Hamilton made a similar assertion in <em>State v. Hamilton, supra, </em>wherein this court held that Hamilton had failed to produce sufficient operative facts to demonstrate ineffectiveness, and had failed to demonstrate prejudice. Furthermore, in the absence of a transcript of proceedings, this court is unable to assess trial counsel\u2019s performance at trial, and is thereby unable to evaluate the merits of this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Assignment of Error No. V</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">\u201cAppellant <em>\\sic </em>] counsel was ineffective for not giving defendant-appellant effective assistance of counsel during appeal and for not raising viable claims on appeal.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are not cognizable in post-conviction relief proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2953.21. <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-17\">Reece, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b621-18\">Quillin, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
