A jury verdict awarded Laddie and Donna Marous awards of $465,000 and $10,000, respectively, which were reduced to $348,750 and $7,500, respectively, because Laddie Marous was found to have been twenty-five percent contributorily negligent. After motion and hearing the trial court granted a R.C. 1343.03(C) motion for prejudgment interest. On appeal appellant assigns the following error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in granting plaintiff/appellees\u2019 motion for prejudgment interest on the underlying judgment entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">R.C. 1343.03(C) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">\u201cInterest on a judgment * * * for the payment of money rendered in a civil action based on tortious conduct * * * shall be computed from the date the cause of action accrued to the date on which the money is paid, if * * * the court determines at a hearing held subsequent to the verdict or decision in the action that the party required to pay the money failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case and that the party to whom the money is to be paid did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">\u201cThe decision as to whether a party\u2019s settlement efforts indicate good faith is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court * * * [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>[tjhis court will not overturn a finding on this issue unless the court\u2019s actions indicate an abuse of discretion\u201d <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 159, 25 OBR 201, 203, 495 N.E.2d 572, 574. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude. <em>Cedar Bay Constr., Inc. v. Fremont </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 19, 552 N.E.2d 202.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cA party has not \u2018failed to make a good faith effort to settle\u2019 under R.C. 1343.03(C) if he has (1) fully cooperated in discovery proceedings, (2) rationally evaluated his risks and potential liability, (3) not attempted to unnecessarily delay any of the proceedings, and (4) made a good faith monetary settlement offer or responded in good faith to an offer from the other party. If a party has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he has no liability, he need not make a monetary settlement offer.\u201d <em>Kalain, supra, </em>at syllabus (holding award of prejudgment interest an abuse of discretion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We note that the Ohio Supreme Court more recently addressed the issue of whether a failure to make a good faith effort to settle exists by stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cFurthermore, a lack of good faith means more than poor judgment or negligence; rather, it imports a dishonest purpose, conscious wrongdoing or ill will in the nature of fraud. <em>Ware v. Richey </em>(1983), 14 Ohio App.3d 3, 9, 14 OBR 6, 12, 469 N.E.2d 899, 905.\u201d <em>Villella v. Waikem Motors, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 36, 42, 543 N.E.2d 464, 470.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cDishonest purpose, conscious wrongdoing or ill will in the nature of fraud\u201d is <em>Ware\u2019s </em>definition of bad faith which <em>Ware </em>equates to a lack of good faith effort to settle. However, <em>Kalain, </em>whose syllabus <em>Villella </em>quoted, had specifically rejected the argument that a failure to make a good faith effort necessarily requires a finding of bad faith. <em>Kalain, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 159, 25 OBR at 203, 495 N.E.2d at 574. \u201cA party may have \u2018failed to make a good faith effort to settle\u2019 even when he has not acted in bad faith. * * * <em>Ware v. Richey </em>(1983), 14 Ohio App.3d 3 [14 OBR 6, 469 N.E.2d 899] disapproved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a footnote <em>Kalain </em>notes that bad faith has been defined as \u201c \u2018 \u201ca dishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, breach of a known duty through some ulterior motive or ill will partaking of the nature of fraud.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at fn. 1, quoting <em>Hoskins v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 272, 276, 6 OBR 337, 341, 452 N.E.2d 1315, 1320.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">However, not only did <em>Villella </em>contradict <em>Kalain </em>and cite a case specifically disapproved of by <em>Kalain </em>but the comments about the definition of lack of good faith appear to be dicta. In <em>Villella </em>the court vacated the award of prejudgment interest after setting out the statute, stating <em>Kalain\u2019s </em>syllabus (test for determining when a party has not failed to make a good faith effort), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>repeating <em>Kalain\u2019s </em>holding that a party with an objectively reasonable belief that he has no liability need not make a monetary settlement offer, effectively defining a lack of good faith as bad faith (and citing <em>Ware), </em>and then concluding after analysis that there is no need to award prejudgment interest on punitive damages, as had been done in <em>Villella. </em>Up to that point it appeared that there were two grounds for the decision to vacate but the court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cConsequently, because punitive damages over and above the amount adequate to compensate the plaintiff were awarded, prejudgment interest to compensate for delay in payment was unnecessary and the award of prejudgment interest must be vacated.\u201d <em>Villella, </em>at 42, 543 N.E.2d at 471.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Thus, the sole reason for holding that the award had to be vacated was the fact that it was on punitive damages. The statements concerning the definition of a lack of good faith were merely dicta and we are still bound by <em>Kalain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s prejudgment interest hearing was improperly conducted; Ohio Bell was improperly prohibited from presenting evidence as to plaintiff\u2019s lack of good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Appellant attempted to show appellees\u2019 failure to cooperate in discovery by questioning appellees\u2019 counsel about appellees\u2019 failure to produce documents requested by appellant. Appellant cites the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it also true that I asked your client to produce for me the business records of the hay and grain business and the farm operation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201cA. Yes, Mr. Bettendorf, and we produced them. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\u201cQ. Were you present at the deposition of Mrs. Marous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">\u201cA. You know, I said before, I may not * * *. I came a little bit late to the deposition of Donna Marous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">\u201cQ. Were you there at the time that Mrs. Marous testified that she had all of those records in a box at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">\u201cA. I think she said she had records in a box at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Does that have to do with whether or not you made an offer to settle this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: One of the issues in this case, Your Honor, is whether or not the Plaintiff himself made a good faith effort to settle the matter. That\u2019s what the Plaintiff has got to show in this hearing, and not only did Ohio Bell not make a good faith effort\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Are you saying they didn\u2019t make any effort to settle the case, a good faith effort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: I am saying that one of the tests that the Supreme Court has outlined concerning whether or not good faith was done is whether or not they produced documents\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You stayed on an' offer of zero dollars right up until after the trial commenced and you say it\u2019s an issue as to whether they made a good faith effort[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: I think it is, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think you are absolutely wrong on that, Mr. Bettendorf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: That was the purpose of my inquiry here, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you\u2019re absolutely wrong on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: I think the Kalain case and the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>The Kalain case is really not relevant to this matter today. </em>The fact of the matter is, you made absolutely no offer when there was an incident. There was a fall. There was [an] injury. There was at least allegations of negligence and ultimately a Jury found that there was negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: The test is not a 20/20 hindsight, Your Honor, as you know. It\u2019s whether or not based upon the evidence available\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Whether or not you made a reasonable good faith effort. Well, you have all of the evidence available to you right from the beginning of this through two lawsuits here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: I would submit, Your Honor, that we did not. That was the point of my inquiry concerning Mrs. Marous right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, Mrs. Marous is such a minor matter of this whole thing. Hers is simple derivative. What you have to determine here is what the real action, real claim here is. You made nothing on the real claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-17\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: The testimony of this Plaintiff was that he was unable to work. We know that he was able to work his farm and the person that had information\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: He was not able to work at his usual employment. He lost that job apparently as a result of this fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-19\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: My only point is that the Plaintiff spouse was allegedly running the business, about which we had a right to know and we requested in good faith both informally and formally the documents that would show what this business was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s such a minor aspect of this whole thing, but you\u2019re nitpicking this thing this afternoon, Counsellor, <em>and I\u2019ll be frank to tell you, it\u2019s not doing you any good. </em>Proceed if you have any further questions that are relevant here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201cMR. BETTENDORF: That\u2019s all I had, thank you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The trial judge misstated the law and did not understand that the issue in question concerned evidence of Mr. Marous\u2019 ability to work and alleged damages rather than the consortium claim of Mrs. Marous. However, the trial court\u2019s written opinion acknowledges <em>Kalain </em>as controlling and states the proper test. Appellant failed to file a motion to compel. The documents were not necessary because, as appellant concedes, Mr. Marous\u2019 tax returns provided the needed information. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cWhen compared with the court\u2019s ultimate award of prejudgment interest for plaintiff, the trial court\u2019s concluding remarks at the prejudgment interest hearing show that the trial court failed to apply the correct test for determining the prejudgment interest issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion for prejudgment interest the trial judge made lengthy remarks in which he said that an award of prejudgment interest would be unjust and that based on the evidence available to appellant before trial it was able to, in good faith, make a statement that it would not pay anything because appellees might easily have lost. Therefore, appellant contends, the trial court awarded prejudgment interest simply because appellant made no offer before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">As noted, although the trial judge made an incorrect statement of law and offered preliminary opinions, he later wrote an opinion which correctly states the applicable law <em>(Kalain). A </em>court speaks through its journal entries, <em>Atkinson v. Grumman Ohio Corp. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 80, 83, 523 N.E.2d 851, 854, not extemporaneous remarks specifically contradicted by a later journal entry. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s statements about Ohio Bell\u2019s attitude were improper (and unfounded); and, in light of the prejudgment interest award, the statements played an impermissible role in the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">The trial court did improperly remark that it had been his experience that utilities such as appellant run up litigation expenses to discourage plaintiffs and refuse to settle. However, in the same commentary the trial judge later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>said that appellant\u2019s record with regard to settling was good and that appellant had a good faith belief that it was not liable. There is no evidence that the later ruling against appellant was motivated by the attitude toward utilities. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s dismissal of his first lawsuit itself should preclude his recovery of prejudgment interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Mr. Marous had filed an earlier complaint which he dismissed shortly before trial and refiled almost a year later. The prejudgment interest statute grants interest back to the date that the cause of action accrued. Appellant argues that there was nothing new in the second complaint and that the dismissal was simply because Mr. Marous and/or his counsel were not prepared for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Mr. Marous had a right to dismiss his claim without prejudice, Civ.R. 41(A)(1), and refile within a year, R.C. 2305.19. There is no evidence of the reason for the dismissal (although the parties agree Mr. Marous had surgery after the dismissal) but no reason is required. The new case increased the amount in the prayer but also added Ms. Marous as a plaintiff. Her claim would have been lost. We cannot infer an intention to unnecessarily delay the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">V</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">\u201cOhio Bell\u2019s $55,000 offer to settle the case was made in good faith based upon all the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Appellant argues that the trial court awarded prejudgment interest because there was no offer before trial. However, appellant refers to the commentary whereas, as noted, the journal entry set out the proper standard. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">VI</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201cOhio Bell\u2019s pretrial evidence was sufficient to warrant its belief in nonliability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">Appellant had to prove that it had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that it had no liability before it could be held blameless for making no offer at all prior to trial. In its attempt to do so, at the hearing on the motion for prejudgment interest appellant presented the testimony of its trial counsel. However, a bare statement that counsel had been told, or believed, or knew is clearly insufficient even if he refers to documentation when that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>documentation is not part of the record before this court. Appellant offered no exhibits at the hearing. This court is limited to the record below. Appellant attaches to its brief an affidavit and portions of a deposition (Mr. Wiskoff) not filed with the court or otherwise made a part of the trial record. The testimony and evidence at the arbitration hearing to which the case was referred are not part of the record. Appellant refers to other depositions but only those of Bolanz and Sadlik were filed with the court. We are limited to those depositions, the exhibits elicited during discovery and the testimony at trial in which witnesses acknowledged their testimony during deposition. Appellant had to demonstrate what it knew by evidence contained within the record below to which this court is limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u201ca. Plaintiff admitted misuse of the ladder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Appellant notes that in depositions Mr. Marous, Cuthbert, Marous\u2019 supervisor, Bolanz, that supervisor\u2019s supervisor, and Wiskoff, Mr. Marous\u2019 ladder expert, admitted that Mr. Marous\u2019 method of moving the ladder was a violation of his employer\u2019s safety manual and an improper and unsafe practice. The depositions of Mr. Marous, Cuthbert, and Wiskoff are not part of the record. We cannot consider the excerpts of the Wiskoff deposition that are attached to appellant\u2019s brief. Bolanz\u2019s deposition was filed with the trial court and reveals that he testified that he wouldn\u2019t lean back or jerk in one direction and that it is common sense not to push or pull in such a manner that a slip will move the body away from the ladder. Appellant also notes that at trial appellees\u2019 expert, Burko, agreed that in his report he stated that Mr. Marous told him that he leaned back and that a ladder is moved by a \u201cworker\u201d leaning forward or backward with a jerk. However, that evidence of appellee\u2019s misuse went solely to contributory negligence and did not prove that the appellant would be absolved of liability. There was also evidence that appellant\u2019s own regulations required inspections and that they were not performed. Although Mr. Marous was supposed to inspect also that did not excuse appellant. It was not reasonable to assume that appellees could not prevail, albeit with a reduced award due to contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201cb. AT &amp; T was contractually responsible for plaintiff\u2019s working conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Appellant\u2019s brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">\u201cThe installation contract which plaintiff was performing for Ohio Bell on AT &amp; T\u2019s behalf specifically provided that AT &amp; T was responsible for plaintiff\u2019s working conditions, including conditions, equipment, etc., in the Ohio Bell facilities. The contract also <em>required AT &amp; T to perform a preperformance inspection </em>of Ohio Bell\u2019s equipment to ensure its suitability (and safety) for the work to be performed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The contract is not in evidence. Earlier, appellant\u2019s statement of facts insisted that as \u201cAT &amp; T\u2019s man \u2018in charge,\u2019 plaintiff was performing an AT &amp; T's contract with Ohio Bell. That contract provided, among other things, that AT &amp; T was responsible for the working conditions of its own employees, <em>ie., </em>including within Ohio Bell\u2019s facilities.\u201d A review of the pages to which appellant cites reveals that the trial transcript cites refer to testimony that established that Mr. Marous was working on appellant\u2019s property performing a contract under which appellant hired AT &amp; T to do certain work for which Mr. Marous was a supervisor. The hearing transcript cite refers to an exchange during examination of appellees\u2019 counsel in which appellant\u2019s counsel asked appellees\u2019 counsel if he remembered \u201cthe provision in that contract that says AT &amp; T is responsible for the work conditions associated with the AT &amp; T performance of its contract.\u201d However, appellees\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cNo, I do not.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel succeeded only in having appellees\u2019 counsel concede that he didn\u2019t deny it was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellant points to no evidence to show that under the contract AT &amp; T was responsible for Mr. Marous\u2019 working conditions, including equipment in appellant\u2019s facilities, or that the contract required AT &amp; T to perform a preperformance inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u201cc. Plaintiff\u2019s method of moving the ladder inordinately weakened the brake cable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Appellant argued that Burko, Mr. Marous\u2019 expert, testified at trial and at deposition that Mr. Marous\u2019 method of moving the ladder caused the wire to \u201cbirdcage,\u201d <em>ie., </em>to weaken the fibers of the wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The deposition is not part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">At trial Burko testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">\u201cSomewhere this cable was weakened and the <em>pulling of the cable by Mr. Marous caused it to separate. * * * I can\u2019t say exactly what caused this particular cable to break, </em>but when you have braided * * * wire * * * if the * * * wire becomes loosened and sort of spreads apart, there is a phenomena called birdcaging * * *. That weakens the rope if it\u2019s kinked or twisted, * * * if the things that clamp the cable to the top of the brake and the bottom of whatever the handle was that you pull on, if they are not secure properly or attached properly, it weakens the rope in those locations * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Immediately prior to this testimony Burko testified that Mr. Marous \u201cfell because this particular cable broke and it was weakened.\u201d Appellant is reading the statement \u201cthe pulling of the cable by Mr. Marous caused it to separate\u201d to mean that Burko felt Mr. Marous\u2019 method caused the cable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cbirdcage\u201d or weaken. A review of the transcript belies that contention. Burko first said the fall was because the weakened cable broke and then explained that the cable broke because it was weakened and the pulling caused it to separate <em>(i.e., </em>break). When asked what caused the weakening he did not say that Mr. Marous\u2019 pulling caused the weakening. He said he could not say exactly but something caused birdcaging. He had earlier stated that what Mr. Marous did was \u201cacceptable\u201d and \u201c[i]t was not improper and it was not an unsafe way to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Appellant also contends that Mr. McKeon, appellant\u2019s expert, testified at the arbitration that Mr. Marous\u2019 method of moving the ladder and the effect of doing so repeatedly \u201ccould\u201d have combined to break the wire whether appellant annually inspected or not. That expert\u2019s speculation is not part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u201cd. Plaintiff\u2019s alleged \u2018photographs\u2019 of Ohio Bell ladders showing \u2018other\u2019 frayed cables were simply untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">Appellant insists that it knew that Mr. Marous was lying about having taken photographs of several frayed cables at the appellant\u2019s facility because appellant\u2019s employees had changed three of the six such cables \u201cbefore the day the photographs were allegedly taken and brought the <em>remaining </em>thre\u00e9 cables into court * * Mr. Marous said that the night of his accident he looked at the other cable at the Beachwood office and most of the five or six such cables at that office were also frayed. A few days or a week later he took some photographs of those other frayed cables.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Appellant argues that the frayed cables in the photographs were not from Beachwood since three of the six cables had been replaced by Mr. Morielli on the day of the accident. The affidavit by Morielli, which is attached to appellant\u2019s brief, speaks of the replacements but that affidavit is not part of the record before this court. The only evidence of appellant\u2019s pretrial knowledge are exhibits, the filed depositions of Sadlik and Bolanz and the trial admissions made during impeachment by deposition. Ironically, at trial an effort to refer to an affidavit by Morielli was successfully objected to by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Appellant also argues that appellant\u2019s employee, Carrabine, swore in an affidavit that the kind of cable in Mr. Marous\u2019 photograph had never been in the Beachwood office. As noted, attached to appellant\u2019s brief is an affidavit to that effect by <em>Morielli, </em>not Carrabine. There is no evidence in the record of an affidavit by Carrabine. The affidavit by Morielli says that it was prepared for the arbitration but there is no evidence that it became part of the record below.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201ce. During the period of his alleged \u2018disability\u2019 plaintiff climbed ladders and worked both his farm and his hay and grain business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Appellant argued that although Mr. Marous claimed that within a few months of his accident he was unable to climb any ladders, his supervisor, Bolanz, said that Mr. Marous climbed ladders at AT &amp; T even while on restriction. In Bolanz\u2019 deposition he states that after the accident Mr. Marous worked from April 10, 1986 to some time in 1987 and was climbing ladders but shortly after he went back to work he started getting numbness in his legs and when the restriction was placed he stopped. Later, however, he said that on Mr. Marous\u2019 return in 1986 Mr. Marous was \u201cworking on a transition for a step by step and I would have to <em>assume </em>in order to perform that he would have to leave the desk and climb the ladder to take a look at the terminal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That evidence is less than convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Appellant also contends that Mr. and Mrs. Marous testified at deposition that Mr. Marous was fully fit to operate his farm and hay and grain brokerage business. The depositions of Mr. and Mrs. Marous are not part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Last, appellant argues that in contrast to appellant\u2019s expert and some of Mr. Marous\u2019 own doctors only Dr. Gableman said Mr. Marous could not work, but Gableman saw Mr. Marous fifty-one times, referred Marous to Gableman's own physical therapy clinic, was unfamiliar with the type of rolling ladder in question and was ignorant of Mr. Marous\u2019 outside jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">First, Gableman did not conclude that Mr. Marous could not work and Mr. Marous never claimed that he could not work. The complaint alleged only that Mr. Marous\u2019 \u201cability to work has been permanently impaired.\u201d Gable-man testified that Mr. Marous had numbness in his foot and could not climb ladders. AT &amp; T will not permit him to return to his old job, or any job, if he cannot climb ladders. Second, the fact that Gableman\u2019s credibility could be attacked did not discount his opinion entirely. His lack of knowledge of the fact that Mr. Marous continued to work at his outside jobs (other than climbing ladders) does not negate his opinion. He simply concluded that the fall caused the numbness. Appellant could not assume that he would not be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">VII</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201cThe jury\u2019s finding of 25% contributory negligence alone confirms Ohio Bell\u2019s good faith belief in its nonliability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Appellant contends that if the ultimate jury verdict is relevant the fact that this jury found Mr. Marous twenty-five percent contributorily negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>supports appellant\u2019s belief in its complete lack of liability. That conclusion does not follow from the premise. The verdict supports the appellant\u2019s position that Mr. Marous was partly to blame but would never justify a contention that he was entirely to blame or more than fifty percent contributorily negligent. The evidence aside, had appellant known that the jury would find appellant twenty-five percent contributorily negligent that fact would still not have justified making no offer at all prior to trial. In any event, the ultimate verdict is irrelevant. The question is the effort to-settle, not whether the verdict was the one anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In the journal entry granting prejudgment interest the trial judge did note that there had been no offer before trial. However, the trial judge made this observation during the course of his opinion in which he concluded that appellant did not objectively believe it had no liability and had failed to evaluate on a rational basis. The trial judge pointed out that appellant knew the ladder had not been inspected as required by its own regulations and that there was some evidence that the fall proximately caused the injury. The trial judge also mentioned the fact that appellees prevailed at the arbitration and appellant failed to settle the prejudgment interest claim or pay the judgment as of the date the motion was ruled on, but those are not legitimate factors to consider. As <em>Kalain </em>stated, the issue is pre-trial behavior, not post-trial. In addition, losing the arbitration is irrelevant. Many parties lose at arbitration and then prevail at trial. Parties should not be forced to settle just because they lost at arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The trial court did not rely on any alleged attempt to delay or failure to cooperate in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">A rational evaluation of the case could only result in the conclusion that appellant had not inspected and that appellees had evidence that the injury was the proximate result of the fall caused by the break in the cable. Although appellees\u2019 doctor might be discredited, he might still be believed. Appellant could not assume he would not be. Appellant was counting on Mr. Marous being barred a recovery due to comparative negligence. However, even if Mr. Marous did lean back with a jerk, as his expert\u2019s report said he told the expert, the fall could have been prevented if the cable had been inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The decision of the trial court cannot be reversed unless the order granting prejudgment interest was an abuse of discretion. As the parties note the Ohio Supreme Court has defined an abuse of discretion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201c \u2018[A]n abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in * * * opinion * * *. The term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ations. In order to have an \u201cabuse\u201d in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias. * * \u201d <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 222, 15 OBR 311, 361, 473 N.E.2d 264, 313 quoting <em>Spalding v. Spalding </em>(1959), 355 Mich. 382, 384-385, 94 N.W.2d 810, 811-812. We cannot say that the decision to grant prejudgment interest was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-8\">John F.
