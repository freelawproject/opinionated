Appellant assigns the following errors for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding there is no probable cause for defendant\u2019s arrest for disorderly conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201cThe court erred in finding that because there was no probable cause for the disorderly conduct that there was no probable cause on the resisting arrest, menacing or assault charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">A review of the record reveals the following facts pertinent to this appeal. On the late evening of January 29, 1991, Patrolman Greg Frazier of the Gallipolis Police Department and Officer Burton of the Gallia County Sheriff\u2019s Department were on routine patrol in Gallipolis. Frazier testified he saw appellee\u2019s vehicle approaching them at a high rate of speed. Entering a curve, appellee\u2019s car first slid to the right and then went left of center, narrowly missing the officers\u2019 patrol car. The officers quickly turned their vehicle around and began pursuit of appellee. The officers briefly lost sight of appellee, but received a radio message which led them to appellee\u2019s car where it was parked in the driveway of his mother\u2019s house. Appellee was no longer in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Upon arrival, Frazier approached the vehicle and began taking down the temporary tag number. Appellee then appeared from the side of the house and approached Frazier, yelling and cussing at him. Several people emerged from neighboring houses to see what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">After being warned to calm down, appellee continued to yell and cuss at Frazier. Appellee was then arrested for disorderly conduct. It is apparent from the record that appellee was also later charged with resisting arrest, assault, aggravated menacing, fleeing and eluding, OMVI, driving without an operator\u2019s license and reckless operation. All of the above offenses were charged as violations of Gallipolis City Ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">On July 9, 1991, appellee filed a motion to suppress \u201cany and all evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by the Constitution of Ohio, Article I, Section 14.\u201d In the accompanying memorandum of law, appellee contended all charges against him should be dismissed as the arresting officer did not have probable cause to believe appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>had committed any offense. At the September 24, 1991 hearing on appellee\u2019s motion, both sides adduced testimony. At the close of the hearing, and by judgment entry dated September 25,1991, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion to suppress any evidence pertaining to the disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, assault and aggravated menacing charges. The court found that probable cause existed for the four traffic offenses. The state filed a timely notice of appeal and certification. See Crim.R. 12(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In its first assignment of error, appellant contends the court erred in finding there was no probable cause for defendant-appellee\u2019s arrest for disorderly conduct. Appellant argues the test is an objective one: \u201cwhether a reasonable officer would have been provoked to want to respond violently to Defendant\u2019s language and conduct.\u201d Appellant further maintains that, employing this objective test, Frazier\u2019s testimony clearly established probable cause for appellee\u2019s arrest for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Appellee agrees that the test is an objective one, but notes that appellant does not assert that the trial court abandoned the objective test in making its ruling. Appellee maintains the trial court was justified in concluding that appellee did not use \u201cfighting words\u201d and therefore that there was no probable cause for arrest for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Appellee was charged with a violation of Gallipolis City Ordinance 509.03 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201c(a) No person shall recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to another by doing any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201c(5) Creating a condition which is physically offensive to persons or which presents a risk of physical harm to persons or property, by any act which serves no lawful and reasonable purpose of the offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">A person may not be punished for speaking boisterous, rude or insulting words, even with the intent to annoy another, unless the words by their very utterance inflict injury or are likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. <em>Cincinnati v. Karlan </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 107, 110, 68 O.O.2d 62, 64, 314 N.E.2d 162, 164; <em>State v. Hoffman </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 129, 11 O.O.3d 298, 387 N.E.2d 239. See, also, <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 568, 573, 62 S.Ct. 766, 770, 86 L.Ed. 1031, 1036. That is, the words spoken must be \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>State v. Wylie </em>(1984), 19 Ohio App.3d 180, 19 OBR 287, 482 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>At the suppression hearing, Officer Frazier testified that appellee was \u201cshouting the entire time.\u201d Appellee said to Frazier: (1) \u201cwhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d; (2) \u201cgo ahead, tow the motherfucker\u201d (referring to appellee\u2019s vehicle); and (3) \u201clook at the motherfucker\u201d (referring to the temporary tags on his vehicle). Frazier further testified that \u201che [appellee] started motherfucking me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Upon cross-examination, Frazier testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201cQ.' At no time during this entire night did you, none of what Keith said moved you to fight did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cA. It wasn\u2019t what he said that would, would cause an altercation, it was his resistance after the point of arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201cQ. Well, we\u2019re not here about what happened after the arrest. What I\u2019m asking you is based on your training and experience as a police officer. What Keith Lamm was saying to you really did not upset you at all did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201cA. I\u2019ve been called those names before sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. And it\u2019s something that you just let it roll off your back, you just go along, you just go do your job, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">\u201cA. I usually make an arrest in those events, but yes, that, that doesn\u2019t bother me. I don\u2019t lose any sleep over it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Finally, on re-direct, Frazier testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">\u201cQ. Did you feel that there was physically offensive, presented a risk of physical harm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">\u201cA. If it had continued certainly. It was certainly offensive and I\u2019m certain that someone would have eventually you know, taken some action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">While we do not condone the use of profanity or disrespect towards police officers, we are persuaded that the evidence presented failed to establish that the words uttered by appellee were likely to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the people gathered outside were alarmed, annoyed or inconvenienced by appellee\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, the trial court. did not err in its finding that there was no probable cause for appellee\u2019s arrest for disorderly conduct. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">In its second assignment of error, appellant contends the court erred in finding that because there was no probable cause for appellee\u2019s arrest for disorderly conduct, there was no probable cause on the resisting arrest, aggravated menacing and assault charges which arose after the disorderly conduct arrest. Appellant, relying on <em>Coffel v. Taylor </em>(S.D.Ohio 1978), 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>O.O.3d 253, appears to argue that appellee need not be proved guilty of disorderly conduct to establish that appellee resisted a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Appellee concedes this fact, but maintains that the arrest itself must still be lawful. As there was no probable cause for arrest, appellee argues, the arrest was unlawful. Therefore, there could be no resisting arrest offense charged, as that crime includes, as an essential element, a lawful arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Appellee was charged with resisting arrest in violation of Gallipolis City Ordinance 525.09:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201c(a) No person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with a lawful arrest of himself or another.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Because the element of a \u201clawful arrest\u201d is part of the plain language of the statute, the ordinance only prohibits the resisting of a lawful arrest. <em>Hoover v. Garfield Hts. Mun. Court </em>(C.A. 6, 1986), 802 F.2d 168, 174; <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1982), 6 Ohio App.3d 56, 6 OBR 268, 453 N.E.2d 1101; <em>State v. McCrone </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 831, 580 N.E.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In <em>Columbus v. Fraley </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 173, 70 O.O.2d 335, 324 N.E.2d 735, the Supreme Court held in paragraph three of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cIn the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, a private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows, or has good reason to believe, is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">However, in <em>Fraley, </em>the court construed Columbus City Code 2355.01, which does not contain \u201clawful arrest\u201d as an element of the offense. Therefore, the holding in <em>Fraley </em>does not control in the case <em>sub judice. Johnson </em>and <em>McCrone, supra; State v. Parks </em>(Sept. 3, 1987), Ross App. No. 1306, unreported, 1987 WL 16567.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">In the case at bar, as we determined under our discussion of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, appellee\u2019s arrest was not lawful because an average person would not have been provoked by appellee\u2019s language to respond violently. That is, appellee\u2019s arrest was made without probable cause, and was therefore illegal. Absent a legal arrest, appellee cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>charged with resisting arrest. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-6\">Grey and Peter B. Abele, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\">.

While appellant contends in its second assignment of error that the court erred in suppressing evidence relating to the disorderly conduct, menacing and assault charges, its brief addresses solely the charge of resisting arrest. Errors not specifically pointed out in the record and separately argued by brief may be disregarded. App.R. 12(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-14\">.
