No other judge out of court has the power. Such was <em>(Code </em>398) the practice as held in the case of <em>Smith and another </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>(7 <em>How. R., </em>39). Again, the Code requires that the order should be a chamber order, and that the same must be filed with the clerk-of the city and county of New York ; and it is only from the time the receiver receives a copy of the order, certified by the county clerk that he has any power to act at all. The judge in an order appointing a receiver has no authority to direct an assignment.of personal property; and in respect to debts owing to the judgment debtor, can only forbid any transfer or other disposition of them until an opportunity be given the receiver to sue. <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Hurlbert, </em>5 <em>How.
