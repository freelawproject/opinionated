After issue was joined, the defendant, John, was examined as a witness at the instance of the plaintiff un- ' der \u00a7 391 of the Code, and testified among other things in answer to plaintiff\u2019s inquiry that he executed the note for himself; that he signed his brother Lawrence\u2019s name and under Ms mark to said note, that Lawrence had no knowledge of such act, and had given him no authority to make such signature, and had never sanctioned, authorized, or ratified it. <em>Upon the </em>trial the plaintiff rested without having read John\u2019s testimony so taken.

Lawrence was afterwards called as a witness, on his own behalf, to prove that he did not sign said note, or authorize John to sign it, which evidence, upon objection by the plaintiff, was rejected, and defendant excepted. The plaintiff obtained a verdict for the amount of the note and interest; proceedings thereon were stayed, and the case and exceptions were ordered heard in the first instance at the general term. Some other questions were raised upon the trial, which need not be noticed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\">Ballard <em>&amp; </em>Warren, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">Cited <em>Green </em>agt. <em>Wood </em>(15 <em>How., </em>341, 344), <em>Suydam </em>agt. <em>Suydam </em>(11 <em>id., </em>518), <em>Plato </em>agt. <em>Kelley </em>(16 <em>Abb., </em>188), <em>Watson </em>agt. <em>Gage </em>(12 <em>id., </em>215), <em>Franklin </em>agt. <em>Pinkney </em>(18 <em>id., </em>186: 41 <em>Barb., </em>635) <em>and Code, </em>\u00a7 392.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-7\">A.

There are certain exceptions to the right of the defendant to use such answer, but subject to such exceptions the right of the defendant to use his own evidence given in answer to such bill of discovery was absolute. <em>(3d. Green. Fiv., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 284, 289, 290 ; <em>Holt </em>agt. <em>Ten Eyck, 2d. J. ch., </em>89, <em>etc.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The act of 1847 without abolishing the' bill of discovery provided for the examination of* an adverse party, on commission,- conditionally or upon the trial. To guard against the possible wrong which might result from the examination of an adverse party, and a refusal on a new or second trial to again examine such adverse party, because such examination was unfavorable to the party calling him, it is provided by $ 5 that in case of such refusal, such adverse party may offer himself as a witness in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Then came the provisions of the Code, substantially as they now stand <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 389 <em>to </em>395), by which the action to obtain discovery was abolished, and the mode therein prescribed substituted. It will be recollected that parties could not then offer themselves as witnesses as now authorized by \u00a7 399. By the Code, then, as well as now <em>(\u00a7 </em>392), such examination may be read by either party on the trial ,\u2022 and the commissioners, in submitting the Code to the legislature, remarked of this clause, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u201cWhen a party has called his adversary to be sworn as a witness, the testimony ought to be deemed evidence in the case, in the same manner as the deposition of any other witness, and if the examining party will not use it, the party examined\" should be permitted to do so.\u201d <em>(Rep. of Com\u2019s, </em>1848, <em>note to ch. </em>6 <em>of title </em>12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">It is thus apparent that the law has always designed to protect a party against the artifice of an adversary, who, if possible, would indulge these fishing expeditions with the option to use or reject the spoils as <em>his </em>interest might dictate. When parties were made competent as witnesses in their own behalf in 1857, the provision for examining an adverse party became of much less consequence, and have since been but little used. But when a party is sworn in his own behalf, he has been greatly restricted in the nature ' of the evidence he may give if his adversary objects. If no objection is made or <em>a fortiori </em>if the adversary examine a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>upon subjects which he would be permitted to testify to, in his own behalf, it is not error and its evidence is competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00a1Now in this case the plaintiff examines the defendant John, and draws out from him a mass of evidence which John would not have been permitted to have sworn to in his own behalf, and then finding the evidence hostile to the cause of action, plaintiff refuses to use it himself, or to allow the defendant to use it. In this I think the plaintiff is wrong, ' and the following cases confirm the views I have taken of the question. <em>Gellatty, receiver, &amp;c., </em>agt. <em>Lowery, </em>(6 <em>Bosw., </em>113); <em>Conkle </em>agt. <em>Underwood, </em>(3 <em>Duer., </em>670, 679); <em>Plato </em>agt. <em>Kelly, </em>(16 <em>Abb., </em>188); <em>Watson </em>agt. <em>Gage, </em>(12 <em>id., </em>215); <em>Suydam </em>agt. <em>Suydam, </em>(11 <em>How., </em>518); <em>Green </em>agt. <em>Wood, </em>(15 <em>id., </em>388, 344); <em>Partin </em>agt. <em>Schackstone, (2d Code R., </em>66 <em>cited in Voorh. Code 4th ed. note to </em>\u00a7 390).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">These authorities warrant the views I have taken, though by no means are they conclusive, since the force and effect of \u00a7 399 upon an examination taken under \u00a7 <em>392 </em>is not considered or even brought in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">It follows from what has been said that a party examines an adverse party under \u00a7\u00a7 390, 391 and 392 at his peril,and whatever evidence is taken, whether before or at the trial without objection, is competent and may be used notwithstanding the restriction of \u00a7 399. But upon the other question of allowing the defendant to testify that he did not sign the note, I think there was no error. It would allow the proof of a negative which should determine the whole issue in a manner impossible perhaps if the intestate were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Such a practice would violate the letter and spirit of \u00a7 399, as thoroughly as for a defendant to swear he had never received any money of the deceased, if the acts could establish by evidence that he had. <em>(Clark </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>46 <em>Barb., 30.) </em>The case of <em>Franklin </em>agt. <em>Pinkney, </em>(18 <em>Abb., </em>86) is quite distinct. There the plaintiff was allowed to ove by himself that he had deposited money to the credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of defendants intestate, such intestate not being present or knowning thereof. It was held that this was not a personal transaction between them within ^ 399. While this d\u00e9cision is not necessarily in conflict with my views, it seems difficult to' reconcile it with the case o\u00ed <em>Dubois, administrator </em>agt. <em>Baker, </em>(40 <em>Barb., </em>550, <em>552, affd. </em>30 <em>N. Y., </em>355) in which the defendant to relieve himself from the suspicions of wrong in presenting anote of $5,000 against the estate represented by plaintiff, the body of which note was in ink of one color, and the signature of intestate in another, offered to prove that he usually carried an inkstand with him. It was rejected as showing a fact as a personal transaction between deceased and defendant. But for the reason first assigned I think the verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
