The deed was to be delivered on or before the 2d of January, 1868, and was to convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the fee simple of the premises, free from all incumbrances, except as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">Besides the $500, plaintiff also paid defendant the further sum of $3,000 on the 2d of January, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">On his examination of the titles, plaintiff\u2019s conveyancer ascertained that in 1860 the title was in Daniel D. Lord, who conveyed to Henry J. Surtees. Surtees executed two purchase money mortgages for $5,500 to James Cooper Lord, and subsequently, in lSf60, conveyed the premises to David Vreeland, subject to these mortgages, which Vreeland assumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">Vreeland, by an instrument dated January 7, 1861, and recorded in the office of the county clerk of the city and county of New York, in Liber 4 of General Assignments, page 27, January 7, 1861, made a general assignment, for the benefit of creditors, to Henry J. Irving, and .conveyed these premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel was apprised of this general assignment by the return to his county clerk\u2019s search. Nearly eighteen months after this assignment, Mr. Lord commenced an action for the foreclosure of his mortgages. The assignee, Henry J. Irving, was not made a party to the foreclosure, and has never sold or conveyed said premises. This omission brings up one question on this \u25a0 appeal. It was regarded by the purchaser as an objection to the title, which the seller, by his contract was bound to obviate, but which he failed to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-9\">The seller still retains his property, and plaintiff\u2019s $3,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-10\">The plaintiff sought a specific performance of the contract or the return of his money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-11\">The cause was tried in April, and decided in December last. No opinion was delivered, but the complaint was dismissed with costs. \u2022 '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-12\">This appeal is from the judgment on that decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-13\">The judgment below was based on the conclusion of law, that the record of the general assignment in the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>clerk\u2019s office was not constructive notice thereof, so that the assignee was not a proper party to the foreclosure.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-5\">George H. Forster, <em>attorney, and </em>John A. Weeks, <em>counsel for plaintiff, appellant.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">I. The laws of this state have provided several record offices for the different descriptions of conveyances and incumbrances, affecting the titles to real estate. In this city, the register office for deeds and mortgages, loan commissioners\u2019 office for their mortgages, county clerk\u2019s office for judgments, mechanics\u2019 and unsafe building liens, <em>lis pendens, </em>sheriff\u2019s and marshal\u2019s certificates, insolvent assignments, foreclosures by advertisement, and appointment of receivers, U. S. circuit court clerk\u2019s office for judgments of that court, U. S. district court clerk\u2019s office for judgments of that court, adjudications, of bankruptcy and appointment of assignees, tax, arrears, assessments, and Croton aqueduct department for unpaid taxes, assessments and Croton wrater rates, and sales for the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">\u25a0 From the searches of Mr. Day, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in preparation for the foreclosure, it appears that he did not include general assignments in his requisition, while the requisition for general assignments contained in the search of Mr. Weeks brought out the return of this Vreeland assignment. The record of this assignment in Liber 4 of general assignments;, January 7th, 1861, under the law \u00a1massed April 13th, 1860, shows the number of these assignments in that short period so recorded, pursuant to \u00a7 6 of ch. 348, laws 1860, page 596.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">II. The court at special term, concluded that Henry J, Ii ving, though not a party, was fully barred by the decree in the foreclosure. The notice of <em>Us pendens </em>was filed the 25th of June, 1862.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">By \u00a7 132 of the Code \u201c Every person whose conveyance or incumbrance is subsequently executed, or subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>recorded, shall be bound by all proceedings taken after the filing of such notice.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">But this general, assignment was executed and recorded nearly 18 months prior. Section 132 of the Code does not limit the place of record to the register\u2019s office. This assignment was not recorded there. The register\u2019s office is the place for the record of deeds and mortgages; other conveyances \u2022 and incumbrances affecting real estate are to be recorded elsewhere. .

By \u00a7 33 <em>(sec. </em>28,) of article 3, \u00a7 9 of article 5, title 1, chapter 5, of the 2d part of the Revised Statutes, the effect of the insolvent assignments there provided for bylaw, is declared to be to vest in the assignees all the interest of the insolvent at the time of executing the same in any estate or property,- real or personal, whether such interest be legal or equitable (2 <em>R. S., 21 and </em>30). Every assignment executed under the third, fourth, fifth and sixth articles of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>title, shall be recorded by the clerk of the county in which it was executed, upon being acknowledged or proved, in the same manner as deeds of real estate. <em>(\u00a7 </em>20 <em>of article seventh of same title </em>; 2 <em>R. S., </em>38, <em>p. </em>112 <em>of 3d vol. of 5th edition.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">\u2022So that before the law of 1860, the statutory insolvent assignments were recorded, in New York, in the county clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">In like manner, and in conformity with this practice, the place of record for general assignments under act of I860 was fixed by the sixth section of that act as the county clerk\u2019s office, <em>(f </em>6, <em>eh. </em>348, <em>act of April </em>13, 1860, <em>p. </em>596, <em>Taws of </em>1860.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">IV. That is the only place by law designated for the record of such assignments. By such record of this assignment in that office, on the 7th of January, 1861, Henry J. Irving, within the meaning of \u00a7 132, was a person whose conveyance or incumbrance was executed and recorded prior to the filing of the <em>lis pendens, </em>in <em>Lord </em>agt. <em>Vreeland, </em>and was, therefore, wholly unaffected by the judgment in the foreclosure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\">The decision at special term would require a double record of every general assignment in this city, in order to give them validity as to real estate, while the statute requires but one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-9\">This court has heretofore sustained the provisions of this law and sustained assignments under it, passing real estat\u00e9. <em>(Morrison </em>agt. <em>Atwell, </em>9 <em>Bosw., </em>503 ; <em>Read </em>agt. <em>Worthington, </em>9 <em>Bosw., </em>617.) The intention of this statute as to these assignments was <em>\u201c </em>to protect those interested under them \u201d <em>(p. </em>629).</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-10\"><em>Scott </em>agt. <em>Guthrie, </em>(10 <em>Bosw., </em>408,) where it is expressly stated that the assignment was recorded with the clerk of the city and county of New York <em>{p. </em>410) fifth line from bottom of page : <em>\u201c </em>The section of the act which requires that assignments shall be recorded in the clerk\u2019s, office of the county where the assignors resided at the delivery of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>signment must receive a liberal construction.\u201d \u201c The purposes of the statute\u201d (in case of non-residence, the case then) <em>\u201c </em>are answered by recording the assignment in the county where the assigned property is\u201d <em>(p. </em>416). <em>(Powers </em>agt. <em>Gradon, </em>10 <em>Bosw., </em>630 ; <em>Iselin </em>agt. <em>Dalrymple, 2 Robt., </em>142 ; <em>Loeschigh </em>agt. <em>Jacobson, 2 Rolt., </em>645.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">The supreme court has likewise sustained such assignments and construed the provisions and intentions of said act in like manner. <em>(Baldwin </em>agt. <em>Tynes, </em>19 <em>Abb., </em>32 ; <em>Haton </em>agt. <em>Neidig, </em>17 <em>Abb. , </em>332 ; <em>Juliand </em>agt. <em>Rathbone, </em>39 <em>Barb., </em>97 ; <em>Turner </em>agt. <em>Jaycox, </em>40 <em>Barb., </em>164.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">V. The assignee, Henry J. Irving, inasmuch as he was entitled, under the general assignment which was recorded January 7, 1861, eighteen months prior to the filing of the notice of <em>lis pendens, </em>is within the protection of the principles of <em>Price </em>agt. <em>Philips, </em>in this court,.and unaffected by the foreclosure proceedings. (3 <em>Robertson, </em>448; <em>Walsh </em>agt. <em>Rutgers Fire Ins Co., </em>13 <em>Abb. P.

Co., </em>agt. <em>Lent, </em>6 <em>Paige, </em>635.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-8\">VI. The court erred in its decision at special term, in that it merely dismissed the complaint and did not finally decide all the rights of the parties on the questions presented by complaint and proof. The whole case was before the court; and the plaintiff was entitled to have, a decision of all the matters in controversy. <em>(Bidwell &amp; Banta </em>agt. <em>Astor Mutual Ins. Co., </em>16 <em>N. Y., </em>263.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\"><em>ee </em>The rule of courts of equity was when, they had acquired jurisdiction, and had the whole merits before them, to proceed and to complete justice between the parties,\u201d and the Code makes that rule applicable to all actions. <em>(Philips </em>agt. <em>Gorham, </em>17 <em>N. Y., </em>270; <em>N. Y. Ice Co. </em>agt. <em>N. W. Ins. Co., </em>23 <em>N. Y. R., </em>357; <em>See </em>agt. <em>Partridge, 2 Duer, </em>463; <em>Marquat </em>agt. <em>Marquat, </em>11 <em>N.

The court should have adjudged a specific performance of this contract, on the payment of the balance of purchase money, and have held plaintiff liable for, such damages, by way of interest, as defendant might have suffered by plaintifi\u2019s delay, which certainly was not unreasonable. Or if defendant preferred to retain his property, he should be adjudged to return plaintiff\u2019s money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">The judgment of dismissal was erroneous, and should be reversed, and a proper judgment rendered, which should dispose of all the questions arising on the facts between these parties.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\">Joseph C. Levi, <em>attorney, and </em>Joshua M. Van Cott, <em>counsel for defendant, respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-9\">I. The general registration acts, require all conveyances of interests in land, in the city and county of New York, to be recorded in the office of the register of deeds, to charge <em>bona fide </em>purchasers with constructive notice thereof. (1 <em>R. S., </em>755, <em>sec. </em>1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-10\">Voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors are not excepted from the operation of the general act, by the assignment act of 1860. <em>(Laws </em>1860, <em>ch. </em>348, <em>p. </em>594, <em>sec. </em>6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-11\"><em>u </em>Every conveyance or assignment made by any debtor or debtors under the provisions of this act, shall be recorded <em>in the clerlds </em>office. <em>of the county in which such debtor or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>debtors resided at the date thereof; </em>and every inventory of . the property of such debtor or debtors, made under the provisions of this act, shall be <em>filed </em>in the same office where such judgment is recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">\u2022 The general purpose of this act was to remedy certain notorious evils and secure to creditors notice and knowledge (1) of the <em>fact </em>of such assignment (\u00a7 6) and (2) notice of its provisions, and of the property which passed to the assignee; (3) a remedy (\u00a7 5) against the assignee, enforcing a due administration of the assigned estate. Of course, the record is notice to the <em>creditors </em>and to all persons interested in the <em>assignment. </em>The act does not in terms, or by reasonable implication, affect persons who are not creditors or interested in the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">It will be observed, that the assignment may be of <em>all the assignor\u2019s property, </em>without specifying whether it is real or personal, or designating the property in any way. The debtor \u201c within twenty days \u201d after making the assignment, is required (\u00a7 2) to deliver a schedule\" or inventory of his property to the county judge; and \u00a7 6 provides, that <em>\u201c </em>every <em>inventory </em>of the property of such debtor or debtors made under the provisions of this act, shall be <em>filed </em>in the same office where <em>such assignment is recorded.\u20191'1 </em>. So that there is no <em>record, </em>but simply a <em>filing </em>of the description of the real estate which passes under the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">All the provisions of this act are enjoined, although only <em>personal </em>estate passes under the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-8\">II. The act of I860 has no feature common to general registration acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-9\">1. Those acts require, the conveyance, which <em>describes </em>the property, to be recorded; this act merely requires a general inventory of the property, real and personal, to <em>he filed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-10\"><em>2. </em>Those acts require the conveyance to be recorded <em>before </em>it becomes effective, as notice to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers; this act permits the designation of the property to be <em>filed, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>for all the effective purposes of the act, twenty days <em>after </em>the making of the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">3. Those acts require the conveyance to be recorded in the <em>registration district </em>where the property is situated; this act requires the filing of the inventory, not where the property is located, but in any county, however remote, where the assignor may happen to reside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">The effect of this construction would be, to require every person dealing with real property after 1860, to know, first, where every person who had had an interest in it <em>had at any time </em>thereafter resided; second, whether any such person had been insolvent; third, when he had been insolvent; fourth, whether he had ever made an assignment, and where he resided when he made it. Upon this construction and theory, our title would be defective, if Irving <em>(the assignee) </em>had been a party to the foreclosure, if the assignor had happened to make an assignment in some other county where he lived at a prior date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">Consequences so extraordinary, and so inimical to the convenience and safety of transactions in real estate, could not have been intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\">ITT.

But, before the delivery of the deed, the plaintiff discovered upon an examination of the title, that in 1860, David Vreeland, the then owner of the premises, mortgaged the same to J. C. Lord, for $5,500; that in 1861, Vreeland conveyed and assigned the land, with other property, to Henry J. Irving, for the benefit of the assignor\u2019s creditors, which deed of assignment and conveyance was filed in the county clerk\u2019s office as an assignment; that in 1862, a foreclosure suit was brought upon the Lord mortgages, resulting in a judgment under which the premises were sold by the sherifi to John Douglas, who subsequently conveyed them to one Fitzpatrick, by whom they were granted to the defendant, but that Irving, the assignee of Vreeland, was not made a party to such foreclosure suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">On ascertaining those facts (which I may here say were fully proven upon the trial, as well - as the further fact, that some of the creditors mentioned in the assignment were still \u2022 unpaid) the plaintiff objected to the title,-upon the ground, that the estate and interest of Irving in the premises, were unaffected by the decree of foreclosure, and requested the defendant to procure a release of that interest, and sub-z sequently also requested him to return the $3,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The defendant refused to comply with either of those requests, but made and tendered to the plaintiff a deed of the premises, which deed the plaintiff rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>l\u00edo evidence was given upon the trial tending to prove that Vreeland\u2019s deed of assignment to Irving, had ever been recorded in the office of the register of deeds, nor that the defendant, or either of the persons under whom he derived title, subsequent to the sheriff\u2019s sale, had any actual notice or knowledge of the existence of such assignment, and for that reason, the learned justice, before whom the trial was had, directed a judgment dismissing the complaint with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The ultimate question to be determined by the court on this appeal, is whether the deed which was made and tendered by the defendant to the plaintiff, would, if accepted by the latter, have vested in him an estate of inheritance in the premises in fee simple, free from incumbrance. For if it would, such tender and refusal exonerated the defendant from all obligation, either to convey the land or to return that portion of the purchase money which he had received upon the contract, and the judgment dismissing the complaint upon the merits, was consequently just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The assignment to Irving was not a mere incumbrance upon the title, but was a full and complete deed of conveyance of the premises in fee, for the purposes of the trust. A purchaser therefore, deriving his title from Vreeland subsequent to his grant to Irving, must be presumed to have purchased in good faith, and in ignorance of that deed, unless it appears that he had notice thereof, at the time of the conveyance to himself. The notice required may be either actual or constructive, the latter being the mere creature of the statute, as provided for in a single section (1 <em>R. S., </em>756, \u00a71), and the other, embracing at least such knowledge or information, in the actual possession of the purchaser at the time of the conveyance to himself in regard to the prior grant, as would put a careful, prudent man upon further in- \u201e quiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The fact that the deed of assignment was recorded in the county clerk\u2019s office, was wholly unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The statute provides for but one kind of constructive notice viz: the recording of the deed in the register\u2019s office ; and therefore, the purchaser finding there, upon examination, no .record of a prior grant, would have a right to suppose none existed, unless he had beeft informed in some way, that such grant had been made. In the absence of such information, he was no more bound for his own safety, to search the-records in the county clerk\u2019s office for a deed of conveyance, than he was to examine the records of this court for that purpose; although if he has been informed that a conveyance of the land was embraced in an assignment made by Vreeland to Irving for the benefit of creditors, it probably would have been his duty to examine the records in the clerk\u2019s office, to see if that assignment contained a conveyance of the \"land.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove, upon the trial, that the assignment to Irving was recorded as a deed, in the register\u2019s office, prior to the recording there of the sheriff\u2019s deed, or to show by competent evidence, that the grantee in that deed, and also, Lis grantee and the defendant, were informed prior to the recording of their deeds, respectively, that the land had previously been conveyed by Vreeland. For, if either of those persons took and recorded the conveyance to himself in good faith, and in ignorance of the prior grant, his title was not only good, but he could confer a like perfect title upon one who had a full knowledge of such prior conveyance. \u201cIf this were otherwise,\u201d as Chancellor Walworth says, in <em>Varick </em>agt. Briggs, (6 Paige, 323) \u201ca <em>bona fide </em>purchaser might be deprived of the power of selling his property for its full value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">As neither of those facts were proven, the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">I concur, S. Jones, F. J. Fithian, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
