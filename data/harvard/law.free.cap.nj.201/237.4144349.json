In addressing that question in the first instance, the Tax Court concluded generally that there was such a limitation embodied in our Court Rule, <em>see R. </em>8:7(e), as a result of which the municipality\u2019s dismissal motion was untimely. In an interlocutory appeal, the Appellate Division disagreed. <em>Lucent Techs. v. Twp. of Berkeley Heights, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>257, 963 A.2d 1248 (App.Div. 2009). The panel concluded that neither the governing statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, nor <em>Rule </em>8:7(e) limited the time within which the municipality was required to move to dismiss a tax appeal founded on a false or fraudulent account, <em>id. </em>at 264-65, 963 A.2d 1248, and directed the Tax Court to enter judgment dismissing the tax appeal, <em>id. </em>at 266, 963 A.2d 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">By this Court\u2019s April 21, 2009 order, we granted plaintiffs motion for leave to appeal from the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment. <em>Lucent Techs. v. Twp. of Berkeley Heights, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>126, 970 A.2d 1044 (2009). Although we agree that the municipality\u2019s dismissal motion was not untimely, we reverse the appellate panel\u2019s judgment that the tax appeal must be dismissed in its entirety and we remand to the Tax Court for a reasonableness hearing consistent with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10-12, 547 A.2d 691 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The circumstances that have given rise to this dispute are fully set forth in the Appellate Division\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lucent Techs., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>supra, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 259-60, 963 A.2d 1248. We therefore include only a brief summary of the facts and the procedural history of this matter to aid in explaining our analysis of the issues before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On June 29, 2001, plaintiff Lucent Technologies, Inc., transferred title to the subject property in Berkeley Heights to LTI NJ Finance LLC (LTI), a limited liability company of which plaintiff was the sole member. At the same time, plaintiff entered into a leaseback agreement with LTI that included a twenty-year term. The agreement designated LTI as the landlord and plaintiff as the tenant and it specifically described the agreement as a \u201ctrue lease\u201d for purposes of \u201cstate law\u201d and federal income taxes. In addition, the agreement fixed an annual rental fee and granted plaintiff an option to purchase the property in certain circumstances for an agreed-upon sum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In June 2003, a tax assessor for defendant, Township of Berkeley Heights, mailed a request to plaintiff for income and expense information related to the property, as authorized by statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. Such an inquiry from a tax assessor is commonly referred to as a Chapter 91 request. <em>See Great Adventure, Inc. v. Twp. of Jackson, </em>10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>230, 231 n. 1 (App.Div.1988). Plaintiffs tax manager, Steven Stockert, responded to the Chapter 91 request in writing, stating that \u201cthis property is owner occupied with the exception of certain areas the OFS (Optical Fiber Solutions) occupies____ They currently occupy 72,000 square feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In June 2004, defendant\u2019s tax assessor made another Chapter 91 request, by sending plaintiff a letter and a copy of the 2004 Annual Statement worksheet. The letter requested that plaintiff provide \u201cthe current income and expense data for the property identified\u201d for the \u201cyear ending December 31, 2003.\u201d On July 8, 2004, plaintiff\u2019s tax manager again responded: \u201cPlease be advised that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>this property is owner occupied with the exception of less [than] 5% being occupied by OFS (Optical Fiber Solutions).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In like fashion, in June of each of the two following years, defendant\u2019s tax assessor sent Chapter 91 requests to plaintiff, using an address in Murray Hill that Stockert had notified the Berkeley Heights tax assessor should be used. Each year, plaintiffs tax managers, Steven Stockert in 2005 and Garnette R. Smith in 2006, submitted identical responses, asserting that the property is \u201cowner occupied\u201d except for the space leased to OFS (Optical Fiber Solutions), which was described as being less than two percent of the building space.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">On March 10, 2005, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Tax Court, appealing its 2005 assessment. In that forum, defendant served interrogatories, to which plaintiff responded on July 18, 2005. In that response, plaintiff revealed for the first time that LTI, rather than plaintiff, was the owner of the property, and described the leaseback agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">In June 2001, Lucent Technologies transferred the subject property and two other major corporate facilities in Whippany and Holmdel Township, New Jersey to LTI NJ Finance LLG, a wholly owned limited liability corporation [in order to] facilitate the mortgage financing of such properties. Lucent Technologies Inc. immediately leased back the subject property [and] the Whippany and Holmdel Township properties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The answers to the interrogatories also disclosed, for the first time, that there were actually four subleases. In addition to the OFS lease that plaintiff had previously identified in its Chapter 91 responses, small portions of the property had also been leased to Sychip, Inc., Affinity Federal Credit Union and Fleet National Bank. Copies of documents relating to the leaseback transaction and subleases were attached to plaintiffs answers to the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Plaintiff filed its tax appeals for 2006 and for 2007 on March 23, 2006, and March 22, 2007, respectively. Defendant served interrogatories on plaintiff seeking information relating to those tax years on May 19, 2006, and June 21, 2007. Plaintiff responded to both sets of interrogatories on September 24, 2007. The respons<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>es supplied information relating to the leaseback transaction and the subleases that was similar to the interrogatory answers served in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In November 2007, defendant moved to dismiss all three of plaintiffs tax appeals, arguing that because each rested on responses to the Chapter 91 requests that were false or fraudulent, the taxpayer was entitled to no relief. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. The Tax Court granted the application only for the tax years 2006 and 2007, declining to dismiss the 2005 tax appeal because of what the court characterized as the Township\u2019s delay in filing its dismissal motion. In reaching its conclusion, the Tax Court reasoned that motions for relief pursuant to the statute are governed by the 180-day timeframe established in <em>Rule </em>8:7(e), a limitation that made the motion timely only as it related to the 2006 and 2007 tax years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The Appellate Division granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal the Tax Court\u2019s denial of its motion to dismiss the 2005 tax appeal. In reversing the order of the Tax Court, the Appellate Division looked to the language and the history of both the governing statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-34, and our Court Rule, <em>R. </em>8:7(e). Based on that review, the court reasoned that \u201cneither the Legislature nor the Court intended to limit, through time constraints, a municipality\u2019s ability to seek dismissal of tax appeals where there has been a false or fraudulent Chapter 91 response.\u201d <em>Lucent Techs., supra, </em>405 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 266, 963 A.2d 1248. Applying that logic, the panel remanded the matter to the Tax Court, with directions that the Court enter judgment in favor of the Township, dismissing the 2005 tax appeal. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Plaintiffs arguments before this Court focus on the analysis used by the Appellate Division and on the scope of the relief that the panel granted to the municipality. In short, plaintiff argues that the Appellate Division failed to analyze the statute and the Court Rule correctly, interpreting them as if they were substantive rather than procedural. Plaintiff asserts that this approach resulted in the erroneous conclusion that the <em>Rule </em>provides an unlimited time within which to file the dismissal motion and led the panel to grant relief contrary to precedents established by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In contrast, defendant first contends that the Appellate Division\u2019s analysis of the clear and unambiguous language of the <em>Rule </em>was correct, and urges that we affirm the panel\u2019s conclusion that the time limitation did not apply to the motion to dismiss the 2005 tax appeal. Further, defendant asserts that the Appellate Division\u2019s direction that the tax appeal be dismissed did not conflict with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ocean Pines, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 10-12, 547 A2d 691, because the language of the Tax Court\u2019s order on appeal afforded plaintiff an opportunity to request a reasonableness hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The issue raised in this appeal is a narrow one, arising in the context of a tax appeal that rests upon the taxpayer\u2019s submission of a \u201cfalse or fraudulent\u201d account.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Within that context, this appeal calls upon us to interpret the interplay between the statute commonly referred to as Chapter 91, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, and our Court Rule, <em>R. </em>8:7(e), that fixes time frames for filing of motions seeking to enforce that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The statute, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Every owner of real property of the taxing district shall, on written request of the assessor, made by certified mail, render a full and true account of his name and real property and the income therefrom, in the case of income-producing property, and produce his title papers, and he may be examined on oath by the assessor, and if he shall fail or refuse to respond to the written request of the assessor within 45 days of such request, or to testify on oath when required, or shall render a false or fraudulent account, the assessor shall value his property at such amount as he may, from any information in his possession or available to him, reasonably determine to be the full and fair value thereof. <em>No appeal shall be heard from the assessor\u2019s valuation and assessment with respect to income-producing property where the owner has failed or refused to respond to such written request for information within 45 days of such request or to testify on oath when required, or shall have rendered a false or fraudulent account.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\"><em>Rule </em>8:7(e), entitled \u201cMotions pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-34,\u201d serves as the enforcement mechanism for this statute, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-P\"><em>Except in the case of a false or fraudulent account, </em>all motions to dismiss for refusal or failure to comply with N.J.S.A. 54:4-34 shall be filed no later than the earlier of (1) 180 days after the filing of the complaint, or (2) 30 days before the trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">[B. 8:7(e) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The heart of the dispute before this Court is whether the 180-day limitation that <em>Rule </em>8:7(e) imposes on the filing of motions for relief pursuant to the statute in the case of a taxpayer that fails or refuses to respond to a Chapter 91 request also limits the time for filing a dismissal motion based on a taxpayer\u2019s submission of a \u201cfalse or fraudulent\u201d response to a Chapter 91 inquiry. Deciding that question requires that we consider both the language and intent of the statute and the way in which our Court Rule operates to effectuate that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">We begin with the language of the statute, which is plain and unambiguous. It first requires every real property owner to respond to certain specified requests made by the tax assessor and to submit, if requested, to an examination under oath. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. The statute next imposes a forty-five-day time limitation within which the taxpayer must respond, further providing that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the taxpayer \u201cfails or refuses\u201d to do so within that time frame, or if the taxpayer \u201cshall render a false or fraudulent account,\u201d the tax assessor is permitted to make his or her valuation of the property based on the information available. <em>Ibid. </em>The authority of the assessor in either circumstance is not unbounded, because it is qualified by the requirement that the assessor \u201creasonably determine ... the full and fair value\u201d of the property. <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, as it relates to income-producing properties, if the taxpayer fails or refuses to respond within the permitted time frame, or if the taxpayer responds by submitting a false or fraudulent account, the statute provides that there shall be \u201cno appeal\u201d from the assessment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">As initially enacted in 1918, <em>L. </em>1918, c. 236, \u00a7 403, the statute applied to taxpayers generally, making no distinctions relating to whether the property was income-producing or not. The 1918 enactment described the assessor\u2019s estimate of the value of the property to be made in the absence of a response or in the case of a false or fraudulent account as being \u201cat the highest value he has reason to suppose it may be placed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The 1918 statute, however, did not impose any time limit on the taxpayer\u2019s obligation to respond to an assessor\u2019s request for information, or on the taxpayer\u2019s right to appeal an assessor\u2019s estimate. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">When the statute was amended in 1960, the Legislature expanded the list of the information required of the property owner by including disclosure of \u201cincome therefrom, in the case of income-producing property.\u201d <em>L. </em>1960, c. 51, \u00a7 29. The 1960 amendment also added the language qualifying the assessor\u2019s right to estimate the value of the property if the taxpayer had not provided the requested information or had supplied a false or fraudulent account. The amendment, in place of the \u201chighest value\u201d language, <em>see L. </em>1918, c. 236, \u00a7 403, substituted the requirement that the estimate be \u201creasonably determine[d] to be the full and fair value\u201d based upon \u201cany information in [the assessor\u2019s] possession or available to him.\u201d <em>L. </em>1960, c. 51, \u00a7 29. Like the original enactment, the 1960 amendment did not limit the property owner\u2019s time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>for submitting a response or the taxpayer\u2019s right to appeal such an assessment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It was not until the statute\u2019s most recent amendment, in 1979, that the Legislature added the language that is the focus of this appeal. The 1979 amendment added both the forty-five-day time for a taxpayer\u2019s response and the limitation on the taxpayer\u2019s right to appeal the assessor\u2019s valuation of the property if the owner failed to timely respond or rendered false or fraudulent information. <em>See L. </em>1979, c. 91, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The 1979 amendment differs from the original bill submitted for the Senate\u2019s consideration. The original bill was only concerned with addressing a taxpayer\u2019s failure to respond to a tax assessor\u2019s request for information. Senate Bill No. 309 (pre-filed for 1978). As explained by the accompanying statement of its sponsor, the bill was designed to address the fact that under the existing statute, a taxpayer could withhold information by failing to respond, then file a tax appeal and confront the tax assessor at trial with the previously undisclosed information, leaving the assessor unable to adequately respond. Sponsor\u2019s Statement, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 309, </em>at 1-2 (pre-filed for 1978). Its proposed solution did not include a mandatory time within which the taxpayer was required to respond, instead imposing a limitation on an appeal if the taxpayer had not responded. Senate Bill No. 309 (pre-filed for 1978). According to the Sponsor\u2019s Statement, \u201c[u]nder the provisions of this bill a hearing on an appeal from the assessor\u2019s valuation is precluded unless and until the required information is provided.\u201d Sponsor\u2019s Statement, <em>swpra, </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The originally-filed bill was amended by the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee (Committee), which articulated the reasons for the amendment to the statute in more expansive language than that used by the Sponsor. The Committee explained its concerns as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">While current statutes provide the assessor with a procedure whereby an assessment can be made notwithstanding the refusal of a property owner to provide income information, the property owner is not subject to any penalty for not disclosing property income information. The property owner is free to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>assessment, notwithstanding his refusal to provide information which would have affected the valuation, and, perhaps, avoided the appeal from the assessment. Further, whore an appeal has been filed, the assessor currently has no access to information on which the appellant is basing his appeal and thus the assessor is unprepared to testify in argument to the appellant\u2019s representations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">[Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 80S </em>(Jan. 26,1978) (Committee Statement).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In order to address the shortcomings in the existing statute, therefore, the Committee added the language imposing the obligation to respond within forty-five days and expanded the proposed limitation on a tax appeal to preclude such an appeal in the case of a false or fraudulent account as well. Senate Bill No. 309 (pre-filed for 1978) (second reprint). Echoing the concerns expressed by the Sponsor, the Committee stated that it had added the forty-five day limitation to create an \u201corderly procedure\u201d for the timely receipt and consideration of information by the assessor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Committee Statement, <em>supra. </em>The Committee did not comment on its decision to include the limitation on an appeal based on a false or fraudulent account beyond the explanation that some of the changes were \u201ctechnical in nature, conforming the amendatory language to be consistent with existing language in this section of law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The last part of the amendment added the requirement that the assessor enclose, as part of any written request for information, a copy of the statute. <em>See L. </em>1979, c. 91, \u00a7 1. Although not specifically addressed in the legislative history, the inclusion of that requirement served to place the taxpayer bn notice about the significant consequences of failing to respond or of responding with information deemed to be false or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In addition to the statutory commands, this Court has adopted <em>Rule </em>8:7(e) to serve as the mechanism through which the municipality effectuates the relief that the statute affords. The <em>Rule </em>establishes certain procedural requirements for enforcing the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>ute by imposing a time limit on when the municipality\u2019s dismissal motion may be filed. The time limits set forth in the <em>Rule, </em>however, apply only to tax appeals in which the taxpayer has failed or refused to make a timely response to the Chapter 91 request. In language that is directly relevant to the dispute before this Court, <em>Rule </em>8:7(e) explicitly begins with the admonition that the limitations shall apply \u201c[e]xcept in the case of a false or fraudulent account.\u201d <em>R. </em>8:7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">This Court has previously considered the meaning and intent of the statutory prohibition on pursuing an appeal in the context of a taxpayer\u2019s failure or refusal to provide information about an income-producing property. <em>See Ocean Pines supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 7-10, 547 A.2d 691. In doing so, the Court considered the taxpayer\u2019s assertion, presumably based on the Sponsor\u2019s Statement that accompanied the original version of the 1979 amendment, that an appeal was not precluded, but was only deferred pending the taxpayer\u2019s submission of responses. Rejecting that argument, the Court noted that the statutory language is both clear and unambiguous in providing that the taxpayer\u2019s absolute failure to make any response to the Chapter 91 inquiry precluded it from pursuing its appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 547 A.2d 691. However, this Court also considered whether the \u201cstrict enforcement\u201d of the prohibition on an appeal could withstand constitutional challenges, concluding that the statute deprived the taxpayer of neither a substantive nor a procedural due process right. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 547 A.2d 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Although enforcing the statutory preclusion of a tax appeal, this Court interpreted the statute\u2019s requirement that the assessor\u2019s valuation be reasonable, even in the context of a taxpayer\u2019s failure to respond, as providing a limited avenue for relief for the taxpayer. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 547 A.2d 691. In doing so, however, we harmonized that remedy with the statute\u2019s clear preclusion of an ordinary tax appeal, pointing out that there were two significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>limitations on the reasonableness proceeding that the statute made available to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We noted, first, that the taxpayer\u2019s appeal would be limited to a review of whether the valuation was reasonable, both as to the underlying data considered and the methodology utilized, in light of the information that was available to the assessor at the time of the assessment. <em>Ibid. </em>Second, this Court pointed out that because of the limited nature of that remedy, the taxpayer was entitled to specific discovery, but had no right to a plenary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 547 A2d 691. We therefore concluded that the taxpayer would be barred from introducing the contrary proofs that it had withheld from the assessor so as to remain faithful to the statutory language generally precluding an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 547 A2d 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Were we to simply consider this appeal in light of our decision in <em>Ocean Pines, </em>we would reach the same result that we did there, and for similar reasons. That is, nothing in the statutory expression about the consequence of submitting a false or fraudulent account is any less clear than the language we there considered relating to a taxpayer\u2019s failure or refusal to timely respond. Indeed, although the Sponsor\u2019s Statement provided the basis for arguing that the Legislature only intended to delay the hearing on an appeal until withheld information was supplied, there can be no suggestion about any similar intent when the information provided is false or fraudulent. Applying the clear and unambiguous language of the statute, we conclude that the Legislature intended that there be no appeal in those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">This appeal, however, asks us to look beyond our decision in <em>Ocean Pines </em>and to consider whether <em>Rule </em>8:7(e), which was subsequently promulgated, imposes a time limitation that restricts the right of the municipality to move to dismiss a tax appeal based on a false or fraudulent account. We conclude that it does not. Instead, our <em>Rule </em>is entirely consistent with the statutory prohibition of a tax appeal in those circumstances in which the taxpayer has submitted a false or fraudulent account. The <em>Rule, </em>although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>it imposes time limits on motions to dismiss filed by the municipality, explicitly exempts from its embrace any motion based on the filing of a false or fraudulent account. In light of that exception, the time limit set forth in <em>Rule </em>8:7(e) does not apply to the matter now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In spite of the clear language of our <em>Rule, </em>plaintiff argues that the appellate panel erred by concluding that applying it required the matter be dismissed in its entirety. <em>See Lucent Techs., supra, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 963 A.2d 1248. Plaintiff asserts that in remanding the matter to the Tax Court with directions to enter judgment in defendant\u2019s favor, the appellate panel interpreted the <em>Rule </em>to be substantive rather than procedural, contrary to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ocean Pines. See Ocean Pines, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 11, 547 A.2d 691; <em>see also Paulison Ave. Assoc. v. Passaic City, </em>18 <em>N.J. Tax </em>101, 106-13 (Tax 1999). Defendant responds by arguing that because the Tax Court\u2019s order afforded plaintiff the opportunity for a reasonableness hearing in connection with the dismissal of the 2006 and 2007 tax appeals, that order would sufficiently protect plaintiffs rights once the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the 2005 tax appeal was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We find nothing in the appellate panel\u2019s decision that suggests a misunderstanding about the procedural nature of the <em>Rule, </em>but we conclude that the language used to effect the statutory remedy is inconsistent with the relief we found was appropriate in <em>Ocean Pines. </em>That is, we do not read the statute\u2019s command that \u201cno appeal shall be heard\u201d to completely foreclose any remedy. Regardless of whether the taxpayer\u2019s shortcoming is its failure to respond to the Chapter 91 request in a timely manner or its submission of false and fraudulent information, we do not understand the Legislature to have intended, by precluding a tax appeal, to have permitted as a consequence the imposition of an unreasonable valuation or use of an unreasonable methodology. <em>Ocean Pines, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 10-12, 547 A2d 691. Instead, the language of the statute, which permits the harsh result of dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>al, is itself tempered by the bedrock principle that all valuations be reasonable in light of the information with which the assessor was equipped. We conclude, as we did in <em>Ocean Pines, </em>that the complaint in the Tax Court should not be dismissed, but that the remedy available to the taxpayer must be one that is severely circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We therefore conclude that the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment, to the extent that it directed the complaint to be dismissed in its entirety, was in error. In its place, we impose the same limited remedy that this Court concluded was available in <em>Ocean Pines. </em>We therefore vacate that portion of the panel\u2019s judgment that directed the Tax Court to dismiss the complaint and we remand this matter to the Tax Court for the limited purpose of conducting a reasonableness hearing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Division, to the extent that it directed that the complaint be dismissed, is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Tax Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> The record reflects that the documents evidencing the transfer of title were not filed in Berkeley Heights. Instead, the documents were recorded in Murray Hill, the neighboring township in which a part of the tract is located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Technically, the 180-day limitation only made the application as to the 2007 tax appeal timely. The Tax Court, recognizing that limitation, read a reasonableness exception into <em>Rule </em>8:7(e), thus sustaining a two-month extension that was needed to make the motion timely as to the 2006 tax appeal. Plaintiff has not challenged either of these dismissals before the Appellate Division or this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> The appeal arises only from our grant of defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, as a result of which our focus is limited to the issues raised in that application. In that context, we note that because plaintiff did not cross-move for relief from any portion of the Tax Court\u2019s Order, it has not challenged that court's finding that plaintiff's Chapter 91 responses were false or fraudulent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> Although not relevant to the issue before the Court in this appeal, the Committee also added the language granting leave to the County Board of Taxation to extend the time for responding in the event that the owner was unable to comply with the time limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b323-8\">Justice ALBIN,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayl\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">I concur with the Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion, but add these few words.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">A municipality, knowing that a taxpayer has filed a false Chapter 91 response, presumably will make a timely motion to dismiss a taxpayer\u2019s appeal. However, there may be cases in which a taxpayer inadvertently files false information and quickly attempts to remedy the mistake. I do not read the Court\u2019s opinion to preclude\u2014in rare circumstances\u2014the tax court from exercising its equitable powers to deny a municipality\u2019s dilatory motion to dismiss, provided the taxpayer does not have unclean hands. <em>See Knorr v. Smeal, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>169, 836 A.2d 794 (2003) (applying equitable doctrines of estoppel and laches to deny defendant\u2019s dilatory motion to dismiss under Affidavit of Merit statute because defendant delayed fourteen months in filing motion, putting plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tiff through lengthy and expensive discovery during which defendant learned that plaintiff had meritorious cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Justice LONG joins in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b324-6\">Justice RIVERA-SOTO,</author>\n<p id=\"A8y\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Without reservation, I join Justice Hoens\u2019s clear and comprehensive opinion. I write separately, however, to place the concurrence submitted by Justice Albin in its proper context.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In Justice Albin\u2019s view, \u201cthere may be cases in which a taxpayer inadvertently files false information and quickly attempts to remedy the mistake.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 251, 989 A.2d at 853. Having created that straw man, Justice Albin proceeds to knock it down, stating he \u201cdo[es] not read the Court\u2019s opinion to preclude\u2014in rare circumstances\u2014the tax court from exercising its equitable powers to deny a municipality\u2019s dilatory motion to dismiss, provided the taxpayer does not have unclean hands.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 251, 989 A.2d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The scenario posed by Justice Albin, that is, the application of a plainly worded statutory remedy to instances where a taxpayer \u201cinadvertently file[d] false information and quickly attempt[ed] to remedy the mistake\u201d is entirely absent in this case. As Justice Hoens\u2019s opinion clearly sets forth, the taxpayer in the controversy presently before us filed clearly false and fraudulent responses to a tax assessor\u2019s request for income information under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34, a conclusion reached by the trial court that stands unchallenged on appeal. In that context, extrapolating legal principles needlessly past their proper context, as the concurrence does, has a name: it is dicta, something that \u201cis unnecessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential!.]\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1100 (7th ed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Justice Albin\u2019s bogeyman is simply not present in this case. Any consideration of it lies outside of this case\u2019s decisional authority and belongs instead somewhere in the non-precedent netherworld of dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>For reversal and </em>remandment\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justices LONG, LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, WALLACE, RIVERA-SOTO and HOENS\u20147.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Concurred\u2014ALBIN, LONG, RIVERA-SOTO.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Opposed\u2014N one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
