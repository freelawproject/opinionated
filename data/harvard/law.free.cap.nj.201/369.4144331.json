Specifically, we are called on to clarify the standard for deciding when the cleric-penitent privilege may be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">In this matter, defendant J.G. and Pastor Glenford Brown spoke in private about allegations that J.G. had sexually abused his daughters. During their half-hour meeting, the two parties did not explicitly discuss whether the conversation was to be kept confidential, and each left the session with a very different understanding. Pastor Brown later revealed details of the conversation to J.G.\u2019s wife and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">J.G. was indicted, and he moved before trial to prevent his statements to Pastor Brown from being introduced in evidence. J.G. argued that the statements were protected by the cleric-penitent privilege. The trial court concluded that the statements were privileged and barred them. The Appellate Division reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">In this appeal, J.G. contends that he was seeking help and spiritual counseling during the conversation with Pastor Brown. The State counters that Pastor Brown acted to protect J.G.\u2019s daughters and not for any religious purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">The critical question, then, is how to determine whether the privilege can properly be invoked. We hold that the cleric-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>penitent privilege applies when, under the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable penitent would believe that a communication was secret, that is, made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character or role as a spiritual advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Applying that standard in a manner consistent with what the trial court stated, we conclude that the privilege applies. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The following description of events relies on Pastor Brown\u2019s testimony at an evidentiary hearing. J.G. and Pastor Brown knew one another for more than thirty years, since J.G. was six years old and the two lived in Jamaica. Pastor Brown oversaw a number of churches in Jamaica, including one J.G. belonged to and attended regularly for a while. Each later moved to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">In about 1985, Brown became pastor of the New Creation of Apostolic Faith, a church located in Somerset, New Jersey. Brown\u2019s pastoral duties took up only half his time; he was also employed elsewhere as a warehouse supervisor. J.G. was not a member of Brown\u2019s New Jersey congregation, but he did attend church there two or three times, and his wife and their two daughters were members.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In May 2000, J.G.\u2019s daughters told their mother that J.G. had sexually abused them. The mother then called Pastor Brown at home to inform him. That same night, Pastor Brown met J.G.\u2019s wife at the church to discuss the details of the allegations. Afterward, Brown felt that he had a duty, as the family\u2019s pastor, to protect the children by preventing J.G. from returning home. Brown telephoned for J.G. at work and left two or three messages with another person. The record is ambiguous as to precisely what Pastor Brown said in the messages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and how much informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tion was actually relayed to J.G. J.G. returned Brown\u2019s call the following day, and the two arranged to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Later in the day, Pastor Brown met J.G. outside of Brown\u2019s home and suggested that they walk to a public play area behind the house to sit and talk. Although Pastor Brown later testified that he would not allow J.G. inside his home, Brown did not say so aloud. As the men walked to the play area, J.G. tried to hold the Pastor\u2019s hand. Brown refused, telling J.G. that he did not want anyone \u201cthinking that we\u2019re gay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The two spoke in private in the play area; no one else was there. Pastor Brown asked J.G. how he could have molested his daughters. J.G. attempted to blame his wife. In response, Pastor Brown proclaimed, \u201cif it was [i]n the days of the law in the bible ... I\u2019d kill you myself because I think what you\u2019ve done is deserving of death.\u201d The Pastor also told J.G. that he was a sick man who needed help.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">J.G. unsuccessfully tried to convince Pastor Brown to persuade J.G.\u2019s wife and children to let him back into the family\u2019s apartment. Without directly admitting the allegations, J.G. said that if anything happened again, they could call the police or the Pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">During the conversation, J.G. asked the Pastor to \u201chelp\u201d and \u201ccounsel\u201d him. Pastor Brown refused, explaining that he was too close to the situation and too angry. The Pastor also believed that he was not qualified to offer the psychological help he thought J.G. needed. Instead, the Pastor offered to find an organization that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>could counsel J.G. J.G. declined the offer \u201cbecause he thought [Brown] would have to explain\u201d to others what J.G. had done, \u201cand then he would end up in jail.\u201d Pastor Brown replied, \u201cthat is probably where you need to be anyway.\u201d At some point during the conversation, J.G. asked Pastor Brown to baptize him, but Brown refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">One or two weeks later, J.G. attended the Pastor\u2019s church on a Sunday and again asked to be baptized. Pastor Brown again refused. J.G. also called and spoke twice with the Pastor after their meeting. During the conversations, Pastor Brown encouraged J.G. to surrender to the police. J.G. ultimately agreed. The Pastor offered to escort J.G. to the police station because J.G. feared reprisals from the Jamaican community if he turned himself in.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On June 29, 2000, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted J.G. on four counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2(a), three counts of second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2(b) and (c), two counts of third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-3(a), one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3(b), and two counts of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">J.G. moved to prevent the Pastor from testifying about their conversations at trial. At a pretrial evidentiary hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Pastor Brown. In deciding whether the communications between J.G. and the Pastor were privileged, the court looked to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-23, which defines the cleric-penitent privilege, and considered the three-prong test outlined in <em>State v. Cary, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 241, 751 A.2d 620 (App.Div. 2000). The trial judge found that Brown reached out to J.G., that J.G. had known him as a Pastor for many years, that J.G. desired to be baptized, and that the two had spoken in private. The court noted that J.G.\u2019s desire to be baptized was critical to its decision. \u201cLooking at the big picture,\u201d the court concluded, the communications fell within the privilege and could not be introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The State filed a motion for leave to appeal, which the Appellate Division granted. In a published opinion, <em>State v. J.G., </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 298, 953 A.2d 1214 (App.Div.2008), the Appellate Division concluded that the communications between Pastor Brown and J.G. were not privileged and therefore reversed the trial court. The panel reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">Applying the <em>Cary </em>test, we find that although Brown was a cleric and spoke to defendant without anyone else present, (1) defendant did not ask and Brown did not offer to keep the conversation confidential; (2) Brown reached out to defendant\u2014not as a spiritual advisor\u2014but to protect defendant\u2019s children; and (3) Brown specifically told defendant he could not counsel him or even baptize him because defendant needed professional help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 298, 953 A.2d 1214.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">This Court granted J.G.\u2019s motion for leave to appeal on October 16, 2008. 196 <em>N.J. </em>589, 960 A2d 386 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">J.G. argues that his conversation with Pastor Brown is protected by the cleric-penitent privilege. J.G. submits that when a defendant communicates with a cleric, the defendant\u2019s intent must govern as to whether the conversation will remain confidential. J.G. maintains that under the circumstances presented, he reasonably expected that his communications with someone he knew as a Pastor since age six, from whom J.G. was seeking counseling, spiritual guidance, and baptism, would remain private. To the extent there is any ambiguity, J.G. argues that the public interest demands \u201cthe tie should go to the penitent.\u201d He also contends that if a member of the clergy does not intend to have a confidential, pastoral conversation, the cleric should convey that information at the start, which Brown did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The State maintains that the conversation is not protected by the privilege. It argues that privileges are to be narrowly construed as a general rule, and that various aspects of the interaction between Pastor Brown and J.G. demonstrate that their conversation was not protected: Brown\u2019s initiation of the meeting; his secular purpose of protecting the children; his decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>meet in a play area to keep J.G. out of his house; Brown\u2019s refusal to hold J.G.\u2019s hand; Brown\u2019s tone, focus on allegations of sexual abuse, and disgust over J.G.\u2019s behavior; and Brown\u2019s refusal to provide counseling or help of a religious nature. Under those circumstances, the State contends there was no need for Pastor Brown to inform J.G. of the obvious\u2014that their conversation was not confidential. Furthermore, the State submits that Brown could not be considered a spiritual advisor during the session.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The State also notes that the privilege protects certain communications, not relationships between a cleric and penitent. The State submits that the overall test for confidentiality should focus on whether it is reasonable under all the circumstances for the holder of the privilege to expect that his or her communications will remain private.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We granted amicus curiae status to the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL) and the Attorney General. The ACDL argues that under the facts of this case, J.G. had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in his communications to Pastor Brown and a reasonable belief that Brown was serving in the role of a spiritual advisor. More broadly, the ACDL submits that \u201ca penitent has a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in all private and personal conversations with a cleric unless the cleric affirmatively warns the penitent that the communication is not confidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The Attorney General contends that the standard to be applied in determining whether communications are privileged \u201cshould be based on the totality of the circumstances analysis using an objective reasonable person.\u201d The Attorney General maintains that J.G. failed to establish that his communications with Pastor Brown were privileged because J.G. could not reasonably have expected that his communications to Brown were confidential or that Brown was acting as a spiritual advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The cleric-penitent privilege is \u201crooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.\u201d <em>See Trammel v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>445 <em>U.S. </em>40, 51, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>906, 913, 63 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>186, 195 (1980). The privilege \u201crecognizes the human need to disclose to a spiritual counselor, in total and absolute confidence, what are believed to be flawed acts or thoughts and to receive priestly consolation and guidance in return.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the underlying rationale for the privilege is the public interest in fostering the cleric-penitent relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Justice Garibaldi carefully traced the origins of the privilege and its history in <em>State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 422-31, 640 A.2d 817 (1994). The cleric-penitent privilege originated with the Catholic seal of confession. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 640 A.2d 817. Under the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church, it was a crime, punishable by excommunication, for a priest to break the seal of the confessional by revealing information acquired during a confession. <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">As Justice Garibaldi further explained, \u201c[t]he sanctity of the confession was recognized in English law from the Norman Conquest in 1066 until the English Reformation in the Sixteenth Century. After the Reformation, hostility towards the Catholic Church in England resulted in a refusal to recognize the privilege.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). As a result, the cleric-penitent privilege did not exist as part of the common law when our nation was founded. <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Morehous, </em>97 <em>N.J.L. </em>285, 295, 117 A. 296 (E. &amp; A.1922). Courts in New Jersey and elsewhere thus looked to developing statutory law as the basis for the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">New Jersey first recognized the privilege by enacting a statute in 1947. <em>See L. </em>1947, c. 324 (N.J.S.A 2A:81-9 (1947)). The law provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">[a] clergyman, or other minister of any religion, shall not be allowed or compelled to disclose in any court, or to any public officer, <em>a confession </em>made to him in his professional character, or as a spiritual advisor, or as a spiritual advisor in the course of discipline <em>enjoined by the rule </em>or practice of the religious body to which he belongs or of the religion which he professes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>As the text reveals, the statute hewed closely to religious doctrine: it protected only confessions, and it expressly linked them to situations prescribed by the rule or practice of a religious body.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The Evidence Act of 1960 repealed and expanded the 1947 statute. <em>See L. </em>1960, c. 52, \u00a7 23 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 (I960)). The new law\u2014labeled the \u201cpriest-penitent privilege\u201d\u2014read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">Subject to Rule' 37 [relating to waiver of the privilege], a clergyman, minister or other person or practitioner authorized to perform similar functions, of any religion shall not be allowed or compelled to disclose a confession or <em>other confidential communication made to him in his professional character, or as a spiritual advisor in the course of the discipline or practice of the religious body to which he belongs or of the religion which he professes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\"><em>[L. </em>1960, c. 52, \u00a7 23 <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-23 (I960)) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The new statute thus expanded the privilege in a number of significant ways. It extended the privilege to a broader group of religious figures\u2014\u201ca clergyman, minister or other person or practitioner authorized to perform similar functions, of any religion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It protected from disclosure not only confessions but also \u201cother confidential communication[s].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In addition, it deleted the phrase \u201cenjoined by the rules\u201d of the religious body, thereby removing language that tied protected communications to the prescribed rules of a religion. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">In 1981, the Legislature again expanded the privilege by adding to the 1960 statute the language underscored below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">Subject to Rule 37, a clergyman, minister or other person or practitioner authorized to perform similar functions, of any religion shall not be allowed or compelled to disclose a confession or other confidential communication made to him in his professional character, or as a spiritual advisor in the course of the discipline or practice of the religious body to which he belongs or of the religion which he professes, <em>nor shall he be compelled to disclose the confidential relations and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>communications between and among him and individuals, couples, families or groups with respect to the exercise of his professional counseling role.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAQ\"><em>[L. </em>1981, <em>c. </em>303, \u00a7 2 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 (1981)) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The new law was part of a legislative package that originated with proposed changes to the psychologist-patient privilege. S. 1295 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 199th Leg. (N.J. May 19, 1980). Previously, confidential relations and communications between psychologists and <em>individuals </em>were protected; the new statute enacted in 1981 covered communications with couples, families, and groups. <em>L. </em>1981, c. 303, \u00a7 2 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 (1981)). To bring about that change, Senator Matthew Feldman initially introduced legislation to amend only the Practicing Psychology Licensing Act. S. 1295 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 199th Leg. (N.J. May 19, 1980). His bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Labor, Industry, and Professions where it was amended \u201cto provide similar confidentiality for duly ordained ministers of religion exercising their professional counseling roles.\u201d <em>S. Labor, Indus. &amp; Professions Comm. Statement to S., No. 1295 with S. Comm. Amendments, </em>199th Leg. (N.J. Dec. 11, 1980). An Assembly statement about Senate Bill 1295 explained that \u201c[t]he increasing proliferation of group therapy, marriage counseling, family therapy and other types of group therapy has created a need to broaden the existing confidentiality provisions.\u201d <em>Assem. Commerce, Indus. &amp; Professions Comm. Statement to S., No. 1295, </em>199th Leg. (N.J. June 15, 1981). Thus, the expansion of the priest-penitent privilege in 1981 was driven by changes to the psychologist-patient privilege and not by religious doctrine or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The 1981 revision paralleled the psychologist-patient privilege in one other way: it protected both communications and the fact that a confidential relationship existed between a cleric and a penitent. <em>L. </em>1981, c. 303, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 <em>(N.J.S.A </em>45:14B-28 and 2A:84A-23 (1981)); <em>Cary, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 240-41, 751 A.2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">When the current rules of evidence were adopted on July 1, 1993, the cleric-penitent privilege found at <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-23 was included without change as <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>This Court addressed the privilege in <em>Szemple </em>in 1994, when it considered whether the cleric or the penitent held the privilege. 135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 640 A2d 817. In a 4-3 decision, the Court held that the cleric was the sole holder of the privilege and that he or she alone could decide whether to waive it and disclose confidential communications. <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 433, 640 A2d 817. Justice O\u2019Hern dissented and explained that the \u201cclergy privilege exists not for the cleric to choose among the worthy members of the flock but to furnish a secure repository for the confessant\u2019s confidences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 640 A2d 817 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In response to <em>Szemple, </em>the Legislature once again expanded the privilege. It overturned <em>Szemple </em>and amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\"><em>Any communication </em>made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character, or as a spiritual advisor in the course of the discipline or practice of the religious body to which the cleric belongs or of the religion which the cleric professes, shall be privileged. Privileged communications <em>shall include </em>confessions and other communications made in confidence between and among the cleric and individuals, couples, families or groups in the exercise of the cleric\u2019s <em>professional or spiritual counseling role.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">As used in this section, \u201ccleric\u201d means a priest, rabbi, minister or other person or practitioner authorized to perform similar functions of any religion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">The privilege accorded to communications under this rule shall belong to both the cleric and the person or persons making the communication and shall be subject to waiver only under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">(1) both the person or persons making the communication and the cleric consent to the waiver of the privilege; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">(2) the privileged communication pertains to a future criminal act, in which case, the cleric alone may, but is not required to, waive the privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-23; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The 1994 amendment thus brought about several important changes. First, the Legislature provided that both the cleric and penitent hold the privilege and that neither alone may waive it\u2014 except for communication of a future criminal act. <em>L. </em>1994, c. 123, \u00a7 1 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23). Second, the amendment introduced the generic term \u201ccleric\u201d and defined it to include priests, rabbis, ministers, and other religious practitioners. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Cary, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 241, 751 A.2d 620 (quoting Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511 (2000)). Third, the amendment broadened the rule to refer to \u201c[a]ny communication made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character.\u201d <em>L. </em>1994, c. 123, \u00a7 1 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23). The Legislature also described \u201cprivileged communications\u201d without using words of limitation; instead, it noted the term \u201cshall include\u201d confessions, counseling, and other communications. <em>Ibid. </em>Fourth, the Legislature did not include language from the 1981 amendment which protected even the fact that a confidential relationship exists between a cleric and penitent. Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 2 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The dissent understands the statutory changes from 1947 to the present to mean that the Legislature \u201ctook pains to tether the existence of the privilege firmly to its religious moorings,\u201d <em>post </em>at 396, 990 A2d at 1138, and \u201chas steadfastly required that any such privilege claim be closely aligned to a religious practice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 397, 990 A.2d at 1139. In actuality, the development reflects a broad change over time from the privilege\u2019s strict religious roots\u2014 expanding the privilege from a protection for confessions made to clergy in 1947, as \u201cenjoined by the rules\u201d or practice of a religious body, to the current protections afforded to professional counseling for couples, families, or groups, which reflect a cleric\u2019s broader role. The rule still considers whether a communication was made in connection -with the practice of religion, but it is no longer anchored to religious rules or doctrine. Moreover, as the legislative history reveals, certain changes had little to do with religious rules or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">New Jersey is not alone in the path the Legislature has followed. As noted in one article surveying the privilege and its history,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">[t]he priest-penitent privilege grew out of the need to protect the uniquely Catholic confessions made within a confessional, which Catholic priests were obligated by canon law to keep secret____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Today, however, the privilege is extended to protect conversations between spiritual leaders of non-Catholic Western religious groups and followers of those religions____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">The central policy behind the privilege today is no longer to preserve the free exercise of religion that would be hampered if Catholic priests were forced, despite religious rules, to disclose confidential communications made within the confines of the confessional. Today, the most important and powerful justification for the privilege is that the community believes the relationship between priest and penitent is significant and worth fostering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">[Chad Horner, Note, <em>Beyond the Confines of the Confessional: Tlte Priest-Penitent Privilege in a Diverse Society, </em>45 <em>Drake L.Rev. </em>697, 729-30 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">We turn now to delineate the boundaries of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 for the first time since the statute was amended in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">As a general rule, we construe testimonial privileges narrowly because they prevent the trier of fact from hearing relevant evidence and thereby \u201cundermine the search for truth in the administration of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>432, 444, 877 A.2d 1258 (2005) (quoting <em>State v. Dyal, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>229, 237, 478 A.2d 390 (1984)). As a result, courts sensibly accommodate privileges to the \u201caim of a just result,\u201d <em>State v. Briley, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>498, 506, 251 A.2d 442 (1969), and accept them to the extent they outweigh the public interest in full disclosure. <em>See Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 413-14, 640 A.2d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The statute itself provides the basic framework for determining when the cleric-penitent privilege may be invoked. As the Appellate Division recognized in <em>Cary, supra, </em>the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 outlines three requirements that must be present for the privilege to apply: the communication must be made (1) in confidence, (2) to a cleric, (3) in the cleric\u2019s professional character or role as a spiritual advisor. 331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 241, 751A 2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">In evaluating whether the privilege should be invoked, some courts have employed an objective standard. In other words, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>have focused on whether communications were made with a <em>reasonable </em>expectation of confidentiality. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 239-40, 246, 751 A.2d 620 (finding that communications to pastor and deacon, who was also State Trooper, made after deacon searched defendant and advised him of his right to remain silent, were not privileged because defendant could not have reasonably expected that his communications would remain confidential); <em>State v. List, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super., </em>169, 174-75, 636 A.2d 1054 (App.Div.1993) (finding that defendant\u2019s letter to his pastor, \u201cleft for anyone to find and read\u201d in unsealed file folder in a file cabinet in defendant\u2019s abandoned house, was not made with \u201ca reasonable expectation of confidentiality\u201d); <em>see also In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>918 F.2d 374, 377 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that clergy-communicant privilege protects persons \u201cwho reasonably expect that their words will be kept in confidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We agree that the test should be an objective one. An objective reasonableness standard that allows for consideration of all the facts lends itself to the varied exchanges between clerics and penitents. Indeed, the nature of those conversations may be as diverse as the individuals who engage in them. An objective approach also separates idiosyncratic views from reasonable ones and disregards subjective thoughts that are not conveyed. In addition, a fact-sensitive analysis avoids bright-line rules that would extend the privilege to all communications between a penitent and a cleric, regardless of whether they meet the statutory test. The flexibility of an objective reasonableness standard would allow courts to draw distinctions\u2014if appropriate based on the facts of a case\u2014between a casual conversation with a cleric at a public, crowded sporting event and a private meeting with a pastor in connection with a religious practice or counseling session.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In evaluating whether the cleric-penitent privilege applies, therefore, courts should use <em>Cary\u2019s </em>three-part test and employ an objective standard that encompasses all the facts presented. We believe that the proper test is as follows: Would an objectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>reasonable penitent, under the totality of the circumstances, believe that a communication was secret, that is, made in confidence to a cleric in that cleric\u2019s professional character or role as spiritual advisor?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On balance, such a standard affords proper respect both to the search for the truth and to what Justice O\u2019Hern described as \u201cthe most privileged of all communications.\u201d <em>Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 441, 640 A.2d 817 (O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The dissent proffers a different test. It explains that \u201ccivil law will protect those communications between a cleric and a penitent made in confidence under circumstances where religious dogma bars disclosure.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 392, 990 A.2d at 1136. Accordingly, \u201cinvocation of the privilege must be moored to the confidentiality requirements of specific religious tenets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398, 990 A.2d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">That approach misinterprets what the Legislature has accomplished since 1947 and misreads existing law. To see why, we apply the dissent\u2019s test to a practicing Roman Catholic, using the parameters the dissent outlines. \u201cIf a communication would not be deemed privileged by the relevant religious authorities ... then it should not be deemed privileged by civil authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 990 A.2d at 1142. According to the dissent, \u201cRoman Catholicism grants absolute confidentiality only to those communications made under the seal of confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 990 A.2d at 1140 (citation omitted). Assuming that is correct, it would therefore follow that only communications made under the seal of the confessional would be protected under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">That view ignores the plain language of the statute and evidence rule. The privilege is no longer \u201cenjoined by the rules\u201d of a \u201creligious body,\u201d as was the case in 1947. Under the current statute, for example, the privilege specifically extends to \u201ccommunications made in confidence between and among the cleric and individuals, couples, families or groups in the exercise of the cleric\u2019s professional or spiritual counseling role.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>That rule of confidentiality, therefore, applies even if Canon Law does not extend that far. <em>See post </em>at 399, 990 A.2d at 1140-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Legislature was well within its right to make judgments about the scope of the cleric-penitent privilege. It could determine, as it did, that confidences in addition to those conveyed in the confessional should be addressed\u2014that confidences relayed to a cleric during group or family counseling are worth protecting from disclosure in court. The Judiciary is obligated to respect that determination. Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s statutory changes demonstrate profound respect for the role of religion, religious practice, and religious leaders in our society, according communications with penitents far greater protection today than they had sixty years ago. But the amendments do not establish religious law as the foundation for evidence rules used in civil and criminal courtrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The dissent\u2019s test is problematic in another regard. Its test \u201cmust be grounded on the fundamental tenets and practices of the religious belief represented by the cleric and espoused by the penitent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392-93, 990 A.2d at 1136. As a result, civil judges attempting to apply such a test would first have to identify and define the specific religious tenets of a particular religion, which may not always be readily apparent. The statute does not call for that approach, and it might well raise constitutional questions that are not now before the Court. <em>See Klagsbrun v. Va\u2019ad Harabonim of Greater Monsey, </em>53 F.Supp.2d 732, 739-42 (D.N.J.1999) (dismissing defamation claim that arose from dispute over religious divorce under Jewish law (\u201cGet\u201d) on First Amendment grounds, because \u201cquestions of religious doctrine permeate\u201d complaint and resolving claim would \u201cdelve dangerously into questions of doctrine and faith\u201d), <em>affd o.b., </em>263 F.3d 158 (3d Cir.2001); <em>Abdelhak v. The Jewish Press, Inc., </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 217, 985 A.2d 197 (App.Div.2009) (dismissing defamation claim that would invite excessive entanglement contrary to First Amendment, because jury could not evaluate claim involving Get \u201cwithout developing a keen understanding of religious doctrine, and without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>applying such religious doctrine to the facts presented\u201d); <em>see also Presbyterian Church in the U.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Mem\u2019l Presbyterian Church, </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>440, 450, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>601, 607, 21 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 658, 666 (1969) (noting that while civil courts may apply neutral principles of law to resolve church property disputes, they may not \u201cdetermine matters at the very core of religion\u2014the interpretation of particular church doctrines and the importance of those doctrines to the religion\u201d because \u201c[p]lainly, the First Amendment forbids civil courts from playing such a role\u201d); <em>McKelvey v. Pierce, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>26, 45, 800 A.2d 840 (2002) (noting distinction between secular disputes, capable of review by civil courts, and ecclesiastical ones about ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law, which are not).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is not to suggest that a court, in evaluating the totality of the circumstances, cannot consider a proffer of evidence about religious practices that are relevant to the particular interaction between the cleric and penitent. To the extent that the proffer bears on the penitent\u2019s objectively reasonable belief, the evidence should not be foreclosed. <em>See Elmora Hebrew Ctr., Inc. v. Fishman, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>404, 414, 593 A.2d 725 (1991) (\u201c[Cjourts can and do decide secular legal questions in cases involving some background issues of religious doctrine, so long as the courts do not intrude into the determination of the doctrinal issues.\u201d). Thus, for example, if relevant to determine a penitent\u2019s objectively reasonable belief, it would not be improper to consider basic background information about the practice of going on the Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca, so long as a court did not attempt to decide whether that practice constituted a doctrinal tenet of Islam.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It is unclear whether the trial court followed the objective reasonableness approach outlined in section IV. The court appropriately \u201clook[ed] at the big picture\u201d\u2014the totality of the circumstances\u2014but the record does not reveal the test it applied. Although the court may have tested the facts against the benchmark we have announced, we cannot be sure that it did so. As a result, we now apply the above standard in keeping with what the trial court said and conclude that there is ample support in the record for the court\u2019s conclusion that the privilege applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As to the first prong of the privilege\u2014whether the communication was made in confidence\u2014an objective penitent in J.G.\u2019s position could reasonably have thought that the communication would remain confidential in light of several facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">First, although the privilege is designed to protect communications and not relationships, the nature of the relationship between a cleric and penitent can be a relevant consideration. That is particularly true in this case, in which the parties knew one another and interacted in a religious context for decades. J.G. was a member of Pastor Brown\u2019s church in Jamaica, had attended Brown\u2019s church in New Jersey two or three times, and was aware that his family belonged to that congregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The trial court found and weighed heavily the fact that J.G. knew Brown as a pastor for many years. Its factual findings should not be disturbed on appeal so long as they are \u201csupported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007) (citations omitted). A trial court\u2019s findings may only be disturbed \u201cif they are so clearly mistaken \u2018that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 927 A.2d 1250 (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Under the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that after receiving a message from Pastor Brown, someone in J.G.\u2019s position would believe that he had been summoned by a cleric, not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>secular figure or warehouse supervisor. The State places great weight on the fact that Brown reached out to J.G. and not the other way around, but the nature of the interaction is more telling than who initiated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Second, Pastor Brown and J.G. met and spoke in private. The trial court \u201cperceived [that the communication] was done in confidence, not in front of everybody but in a very quiet place.\u201d At the evidentiary hearing, the Pastor explained that he chose the park area near his townhouse because he did not want J.G. to enter his home. That is irrelevant under an objective reasonableness standard, which cannot rely on subjective, unspoken thoughts revealed only after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Third, based on the exchange that took place, it was apparent that J.G. expected the conversation would remain confidential. In particular, he declined the Pastor\u2019s offer to find a group that could provide counseling because J.G. feared Brown \u201cwould have to explain\u201d what had happened \u201cand then [J.G.] would end up in jail.\u201d J.G. plainly did not want others to know what they were discussing. By not dispelling that expectation, Pastor Brown made it appear reasonable. J.G. did not have to ask Brown specifically to keep their exchange private.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We do not suggest that communications will always be deemed confidential unless a cleric affirmatively states otherwise\u2014a bright-line rule advanced by the ACDL. For any number of reasons, it would be inappropriate for courts to script conversations between penitents and clergy and require specific disclaimers. For similar reasons, we do not insist on a formulaic request by the penitent, or an offer by the cleric, to keep communications between them confidential. However, when the nature of a given conversation invites a response\u2014as happened here\u2014silence may be considered in gauging the reasonableness of a penitent\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The State conceded the second prong of the privilege and does not dispute that Pastor Brown is a cleric.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>As to the third prong\u2014whether Pastor Brown was acting in a cleric\u2019s professional character or role as a spiritual advisor\u2014a reasonable penitent could have concluded that Brown was serving in that capacity. Looking at the meeting as it unfolded, Pastor Brown first refused J.G.\u2019s effort to hold his hand. One could view J.G.\u2019s gesture as reaching out for consolation or absolution. Brown thought that J.G. acted \u201clike he was weak.\u201d Brown\u2019s response\u2014telling J.G. that he did not want anyone \u201cthinking that we\u2019re gay\u201d\u2014sheds no light on the applicability of the privilege. If Brown harbored another, subjective reason, it would have no bearing if not conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Next, toward the outset of the conversation, Brown set the tone by invoking biblical law to condemn J.G.: \u201c[I]f it was [i]n the days of the law in the bible[,] I told him I\u2019d kill you myself because I think what you\u2019ve done is deserving of death.\u201d That statement, viewed objectively, clouds Brown\u2019s professed secular purpose of protecting the children. Instead, it suggests he was there in his professional role as a religious figure. A cleric may choose to rebuke a penitent in the context of a sacred relationship. That practice is part of a long tradition rooted in various religious faiths. As an example familiar to many, a modern-day cleric in the style of Pastor Jonathan Edwards\u2014whose fiery sermons warned of divine wrath, <em>see </em>George Anastoplo, <em>Constitutionalism, The Rule of Rules: Explorations, </em>39 <em>Brand\u00e9is L.J. </em>17, 62 (2001) (citations omitted)\u2014could still be considered a spiritual advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Furthermore, during the course of the meeting and afterward, J.G. sought spiritual advice and counseling from Pastor Brown and asked to be baptized multiple times. Brown\u2019s refusal might lend support to the State\u2019s position that the Pastor was acting in a secular, and not a clerical, role. The ACDL, on the other hand, points out that a cleric\u2019s refusal to grant forgiveness does not necessarily strip a penitent\u2019s admissions and plea for help of protection. Indeed, Brown himself conceded that as part of his regular pastoral duties, he does refuse to baptize people. Faced with different views, the trial court was well within its right to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>on J.G.\u2019s requests to be baptized in concluding his communications were privileged. <em>See Elders, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 243, 927 A.2d 1250. The trial court considered that theme \u201ccritical in [its] decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The State argues that <em>Magar v. State, </em>308 <em>Ark. </em>380, 826 <em>S. W.2d </em>221 (1992), helps demonstrate that the privilege does not apply in light of the facts of this case. The Appellate Division also referenced <em>Magar </em>in support of its conclusion. <em>J.G., supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 296-97, 953 A.2d 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>Magar </em>involved similar facts. A pastor asked defendant Magar to meet with him and then confronted Magar with allegations of sexual abuse. <em>Magar, supra, </em>826 <em>S.W.2A </em>at 222. Magar admitted the allegations. <em>Ibid. </em>Although the pastor and Magar had engaged in many private counseling sessions in the recent past, the Supreme Court of Arkansas placed great weight on the pastor\u2019s view that the meeting was disciplinary in nature and not a spiritual counseling session. <em>Id. </em>at 222-23. In a divided decision, the Court declined to exclude the pastor\u2019s testimony at trial. The two dissenting justices faulted the majority\u2019s approach because it \u201cdwells on [the pastor\u2019s] expectations rather than those of Magar,\u201d yet \u201cit is Magar\u2019s expectations that count under the [Arkansas] Rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225-26 (Newbern, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The standard we announce today follows neither course applied in <em>Magar. </em>For that reason, <em>Magar </em>does not control the outcome here. Rather than focus on the subjective views of a penitent or cleric in deciding whether the privilege applies, judges are to consider the objectively reasonable expectations of the penitent in light of all the circumstances. Under that standard, the communications between Pastor Brown and J.G. in this case were privileged, as the trial court concluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\"> Brown\u2019s testimony mixes <em>what </em>he said with his <em>reasons </em>for calling. For example, Brown testified, \"I left a message that I wanted to talk to him because I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>didn't want him to go back and sleep into the house that night.\" In response to another question about what he relayed in his message, Brown said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">[t]hat I wanted to talk to him because I understand, you know, that something serious had happened so I wanted to talk to him and, like I said, I didn't want to expose these kids any longer to what I perceived as danger to them and so I wanted to talk to him to let him know he should leave the house immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">It is not possible, from a reading of the transcript, to separate what Brown said from his state of mind in placing the calls, and the trial judge made no findings in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\"> This Court has previously recognized that although confession is not a tenet of all religious traditions, many Protestant denominations, including the Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and American Baptist Churches USA, adhere to the principle of confidentiality for communications between clerics and congregants. <em>Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>NJ. </em>at 424, 640 A.2d 817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b459-5\"> The dissent iinds support for its test in various law review articles. <em>Post </em>at 398-99, 990 A.2d at 1140.

One theory endorsed by the dissent suggests a narrower privilege \"to exclude those religions that do not require confidentiality and includfe] only those that do.\" Horner, <em>supra, </em>at 729 (quoted in <em>post </em>at 399, 990 A.2d at 1140).

In addition, the County Prosecutor and amicus Attorney General both recommended an objective reasonableness standard based on the totality of the circumstances\u2014the test used in today\u2019s decision\u2014and both framed their arguments around that test. Neither argues that the standard should be grounded on the fundamental tenets of a particular religious faith. Therefore, while the State may disagree with the test\u2019s application, it is not disadvantaged by seeing a standard that it has agreed with used in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-6\">Justice RIVERA-SOTO,</author>\n<p id=\"AV8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 and <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511 codify a privilege firmly-rooted in tradition and common sense: civil law will protect those communications between a cleric and a penitent made in confidence under circumstances where religious dogma bars disclosure. That tradition and common sense, however, draw their foundation from the acknowledgement of and the respect accorded to core religious tenets. Ignoring that fundament, the majority has adopted a rule that hermetically insulates the cleric-penitent privilege from its origins, eschews the privilege\u2019s clear tradition, and ignores the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Based on an unexpressed but nevertheless palpable fear of entangling itself in religious controversy, the majority has secularized this religion-based privilege, concluding expansively that \u201cthe cleric-penitent privilege applies when, under the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable penitent would believe that a communication was secret, that is, made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character or role as a spiritual advisor.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 372-73, 990 A.2d at 1124. That conclusion stretches the narrow cleric-penitent privilege far past its moorings and renders it untethered to its roots. Because we speak of the cleric-penitent privilege, the majority\u2019s standard perforce must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>grounded on the fundamental tenets and practices of the religious belief represented by the cleric and espoused by the penitent, the objective facts surrounding the communications, the identity and purpose of the initiator of the communications, and any exchanges between the cleric and the penitent directly relevant to their spiritual relationship after the communications for which the privilege has been claimed have concluded. Anything else renders the \u201ccleric\u201d portion of the privilege surplusage, leaving only a generalized, utterly rootless and dangerously limitless \u201cconfidentiality\u201d privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Moreover, the majority\u2014although adopting a new rule of law and without assessing whether that rule should be afforded full retroactivity, pipeline retroactively, purely prospective effect or prospective application\u2014has applied its new standard to the facts as developed under a different rule of law to \u201cconclude that the privilege applies.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 373, 990 A.2d at 1124.

United States, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>40, 50, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>906, 912, 63 L.Ed.2d 186, 195 (1980) (quoting <em>United States v. Bryan, </em>339 <em>U.S. </em>323, 331, 70 <em>S.Ct. </em>724, 730, 94 <em>L.Ed. </em>884, 891 (1950)). The guiding precepts that govern the assertion of a claim of privilege are clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">We begin our analysis by reviewing well-established principles regarding evidentiary privileges. As a general proposition, privileges are to be narrowly construed. That rule of construction stems from the fact that privileges contravene the fundamental principle that the public has a right to every man\u2019s evidence. They are obstacles in the path of the normal trial objective of a search for ultimate truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Because privileges may often undermine the search for truth in the administration of justice, they are accepted only to the extent that they outweigh the public interest in the search for truth. They are accepted only because in the particular area concerned, they are regarded as serving a more important public interest than the need for full disclosure. Thus, privileges should always be construed and applied in sensible accommodation to the aim of a just result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\"><em>[State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 413-14, 640 A.2d 817 (1994) (citations, internal quotation marks and editing marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Those guiding precepts then must be applied within the context and in respect of the purpose for which a privilege is asserted. When, as here, there has been an assertion of the priest-penitent or cleric-penitent privilege, one cannot ignore that specific privilege\u2019s origins and purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">The prospect of clergy going to jail to comply with their religious beliefs rather than disclosing a penitent\u2019s confession resulted in various religious groups bringing pressure ... to enact a clergyperson privilege. Thus, the origin of the priest penitent privilege as well as the moving force behind the enactment of the statutory privilege was to protect the clergyperson from being forced <em>against his or her mil </em>to reveal confidences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">[/d at 424, 640 A2d 817 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">In the aggregate, those are the principles that must guide our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The Supreme Court of the United States early asserted that, as a matter of common law, \u201csuits cannot be maintained which would require a disclosure of the confidences of the confessional[.]\u201d <em>Totten v. United States, </em>92 <em>U.S. </em>105, 107, 23 <em>L.Ed. </em>605, \u2014 (1876). In New Jersey, however, a different understanding of the common law then obtained in respect of the confidentiality accorded as a matter of law to cleric-penitent communications. Our case law explains plainly that \u201c[n]o privilege of this nature exited at common law[ and, prior to 1947, t]here is no statute in New Jersey bestowing such a privilege.\u201d <em>State v. Morehous, </em>97 <em>N.J.L. </em>285, 295, 117 <em>A. </em>296 (E. &amp; A.1922) (citations omitted). That void was filled in 1947, when the Legislature adopted the following priest-penitent privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">A clergyman, or other minister of any religion, shall not be allowed or compelled to disclose in any court, or to any public officer, a confession made to him in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>professional character, or as a spiritual advisor, or as a spiritual advisor in the course of discipline enjoined by the rules or practices of the religious body to which he belongs or of the religion which he professes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">[Zr. 1947, c. 324, \u00a7 1 (eff.

Oct. 26, 1994), <em>codified at N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 and <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511. The privilege retained the substance of the additions made in 1981, providing that \u201c \u2018cleric\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>means a priest, rabbi, minister or other person or practitioner authorized to perform similar functions of any religion[,]\u201d and that \u201c[p]rivileged communications shall include confessions and other communications made in confidence between and among the cleric and individuals, couples, families or groups in the exercise of the cleric\u2019s professional or spiritual counseling role.\u201d <em>Ibid </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again, the invocation of the cleric-penitent privilege remained inextricably tied to a communication made <em>\u201cin confidence to a cleric </em>in the cleric\u2019s professional character, or as a spiritual advisor <em>in the course of the discipline or practice of the religious body to which the cleric belongs or of the religion which the cleric professes </em>[.]\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The lesson learned from the development of the privilege in New Jersey is clear. Although the Legislature has expanded the scope of the priest-penitent\u2014or the now cleric-penitent\u2014privilege from its early \u201cseal of confession\u201d origins, it has steadfastly required that any such privilege claim be closely aligned to a religious practice; confidentiality alone is insufficient to invoke the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">By stating that it \u201capplies when, under the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable penitent would believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that a communication was secret, that is, made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character or role as a spiritual advisor[,]\u201d <em>ante </em>at 373, 990 A.2d at 1124, the majority\u2019s newly stated standard turns the cleric-penitent privilege on its head, secularizes an otherwise religion-based privilege, and sterilizes it from its religious foundations. The better rule is to remain true to the privilege\u2019s limited purpose\u2014and thereby also honor the principle that privileges are to be applied narrowly\u2014and continue to require that the invocation of the privilege must be moored to the confidentiality requirements of specific religious tenets.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">It has been noted most persuasively that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">[i]n determining whether a clergy-communicant privilege exists, we weigh Dean Wigmore\u2019s four fundamental prerequisites for a privilege against the disclosure of communications:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(1) The communications must originate in a <em>confidence </em>that they will not be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(2) This element of <em>confidentiality must be essential </em>to the full and satisfactory-maintenance of the relation between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">(3) The <em>relation </em>must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously <em>fostered</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(4) The <em>injury </em>that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be <em>greater than the benefit </em>thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\"><em>[In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>918 F.2d 374, 383-84 (3d Cir.1990) (citation omitted; emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The first two prerequisites speak to the same point: a statement made in confidence under a well-founded expectation of confidentiality. And, in order to be well-founded, any expectation of confidentiality must trace its genealogy directly to a recognized religious tenet. As one commenter has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">The confidentiality requirement imposes further limits on the privilege: <em>only that communication which is a cleric is prohibited by the dictates of his religion from, disclosing should be deemed privileged. </em>In the absence of such an obligation on the part of the cleric, the privilege\u2019s claimant (the penitent) cannot argue that confidentiality was both expected and necessary____[C]ommunications lacking ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">a guarantee of confidentiality cannot be considered privileged. <em>As only those communications in which secrecy on the part of the cleric is required by the dictates of the cleric\u2019s religion satisfy this requirement, only those communications ought to be considered privileged.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>[Ronald J. Colombo, Note, <em>Forgive Us Our Sins: The Inadequacies of the Clergy-Client Privilege, </em>73 <em>N.Y.U. L.Rev. </em>225, 246-47 (1998) (footnote omitted; emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Thus, in striking the necessary balance in determining whether a cleric-penitent communication is worthy of the privilege, it is entirely right and proper under New Jersey\u2019s statute and <em>Rule of Evidence </em>\u201cto exclude those religions that do not require confidentiality and include[e] those that do[.]\u201d Chad Horner, Note, <em>Beyond the Confines of the Confessional: The Priest-Penitent Privilege in a Diverse Society, </em>45 <em>Drake L.Rev. </em>697, 729-30 (1997) (suggesting that privilege should apply only \u201cif the religious tenets of a elergyperson\u2019s religion prohibit <em>under all circumstances </em>disclosure of such communications\u201d (emphasis supplied)).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In light of the variety of religious beliefs that today find respectful expression in our society, the notion that a claim of cleric-penitent privilege must be rooted firmly in the religious mores of the cleric is not only compelled by our statutory history and structure, it is self-evident. Without purporting to exhaust all relevant religions, reference to the tenets of a few major religions is illustrative. For example, Roman Catholicism grants absolute confidentiality only to those communications made under the seal of confession. <em>See </em>Robert John Araujo, S.J., <em>International Tribunals and Rules of Evidence: The Case for Respecting and Preserving the \u201cPriestr-Penitent\u201d Privilege Under International Law, </em>15 <em>Am. U. Int\u2019l L.Rev. </em>639, 643-48 (1999-2000) (describing origins of priest-penitent privilege). Yet, although contrary to Catholic dogma, the majority\u2019s iteration of the principle would shield even non-confessional conversations between a priest and a penitent, a result far outside Roman Catholic Canon Law and far broader than the universe of communications the privilege originally was intended to protect. Thus, under the majority\u2019s iteration of the cleric-penitent privilege, an odd and topsy-turvy result obtains: an observant Buddhist speaking \u201cin confidence\u201d with a Roman Catholic priest successfully may assert the privilege even though the Code of Canon Law to which that Roman Catholic priest must abide does not require any such confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Other Christian denominations may fare differently. Because some \u201cProtestant clergy cannot claim that <em>religious law </em>prevents them from testifying),]\u201d Homer, <em>supra, </em>45 <em>Drake L.Rev. </em>at 729 (emphasis in original), the only basis for the assertion of the privilege in that setting is not religious, but some ill-defined promise of confidentiality. That basis, however, is entirely illusory: \u201cMerely promising a penitent that a confession will be kept secret should not protect the communication. Often people make promises not to divulge information. Their promises, however, cannot withstand a court subpoena. <em>The difference [in allowing the privilege] is simply that the context is religious.\u201d Ibid. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Similarly, \u201cMuslims are required to treat other people\u2019s confidences with the utmost respect. Prophet Muhammad calls such confidences \u2018trusts.\u2019 \u201d Azizah al-Hibri, <em>The Muslim Perspective on the Clergy-Penitent Privilege, </em>29 <em>Loy. L.A L.Rev. </em>1723, 1725 (1995-96) (footnote omitted). Thus, \u201cobserving the relationship of trust is very important in Islam, and is the duty of every Muslim.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Yet, despite this overarching duty of confidentiality, a Muslim to whom a murderer has confessed \u201chas no option but to advise [the murderer] to confess and to inform the authorities of the confession if [he] refuses to do so himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1731. This is so because \u201c[m]urder is viewed in Islam as such a heinous crime that it would provide sufficient justification for overriding the confidentiality requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1732. <em>See also People v. Johnson, </em>115 A.D.2d 973, 497 N.Y.S.2d 539, 539-40 (1985) (holding that \u201cconfidential communications between a Muslim brother acting as a spiritual advisor may, in some cases, be privileged\u201d and that \u201c[f]or communications to be privileged, they must have been made with the purpose of seeking religious counsel, advice, solace, absolution or ministration [and t]hey must also have been made with the intention that they remain confidential\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). It is in respect of Islam that the illogic resulting from the majority\u2019s religion-adverse statement of the privilege starkly comes into focus: a Muslim, who is duty-bound by his faith to disclose a murderer\u2019s confession, will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>barred from making that disclosure by the assertion of a privilege originally founded on a deep and abiding respect for religious beliefs. That result needlessly pits civil law antagonistically against one of the World\u2019s major religions; it cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Likewise, based generally on the Biblical injunctions that \u201cjustice, justice thou shall pursue[,]\u201d <em>Deuteronomy </em>16:20, and the direct commandment to Moses that \u201cyou shall not stand aside while your fellow\u2019s blood is shed[,]\u201d <em>Leviticus </em>19:16, Judaism imposes the prohibitory law of Lo Ta\u2019amod Al Da\u2019am Reiacha, pursuant to which \u201cMaimonidies ruled that one who is in a position to save another by reporting on a wrongdoer, and refrains from doing so, has violated the prohibition of standing idly by.\u201d Israel M. Greisman, Comment, <em>The Jewish Criminal Lawyer\u2019s Dilemma, </em>29 <em>Fordham Urb. L.J. </em>2413, 2432 (2001-2002) (citing Maimonidies, <em>Mishna Torah Hilchos Rotzeiach </em>1:14). Arising out of that passage in <em>Leviticus, </em>Jewish law implies that \u201cyou should always keep confidences, but only to the extent that such will not present a danger to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2433 (citing Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, <em>Yechava Daas </em>4:60).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Suffice it to note that even less \u201cmainstream\u201d religions treat certain communications between parishioners and clergy as confidential. <em>See, e.g., </em>Natasha Bita, <em>Scientologists in Privilege Claim, The Australian, </em>Oct. 26, 2009, <em>available at </em>http://www. theaustralian.com.au/news/scientologists-in-privilege-claim/story-e6 frg6oo-1225791165224 (explaining that Church of Scientology maintains \u201caudit\u201d file on parishioners that are \u201cprivileged and sacrosanct.... [They] are notations of a parishioner\u2019s spiritual progress,\u201d and reporting privilege claim sustained against coroner\u2019s demand for information).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The overarching lesson gleaned from this most cursory review is clear: applying a cleric-penitent privilege without mooring it to some core religious tenet that protects the cleric trivializes the privilege and, more importantly, the societal goals it is designed to protect. Yet, there is no room in the majority\u2019s iteration of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>standard for the bedrock religious concerns that gave rise to the privilege in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Therefore, a better, more sensible rule would temper the standard adopted by the majority so that proper weight is given to the logical and historical underpinnings of the cleric-penitent privilege. Thus, it should be made explicit that the party asserting the cleric-penitent privilege must bear the burden of going forward and of persuasion, and demonstrate that an objectively reasonable penitent would believe that the challenged communication was made in confidence, <em>as acknowledged by recognized religious tenets, </em>to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character or role as a spiritual advisor. Plainly said, in order for the cleric-penitent privilege to make sense, the question of whether the communication was made \u201cin confidence\u201d must be informed and governed by the fundamental tenets and practices of the religious belief represented by the cleric and espoused by the penitent, the objective facts surrounding the communications, the identity and purpose of the initiator of the communications, and any exchanges between the cleric and the penitent directly relevant to their spiritual relationship after the communications for which the privilege has been claimed have concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In its application, then, the rule should be quite simple. If a communication would not be deemed privileged by the relevant religious authorities, that is, by \u201cthe discipline or practice of the religious body to which the cleric belongs or of the religion which the cleric professes[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-23; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511, then it should not be deemed privileged by civil authorities. On the other hand, if the communication is one that would have been deemed privileged in the proper religious context and it is made to one satisfying the definition of a cleric, that is, \u201ca priest, rabbi, minister or other person or practitioner authorized to perform similar functions of any religion[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-23; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511, then the privilege should apply. In the end, that plain rule does nothing more than acknowledge the New Testament\u2019s injunction, one that also finds expression in the Establishment Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. I, and paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article I of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, HH3-4: \u201cRender therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d <em>Matthew </em>22:21.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Because the majority eschews such common sense and historically laden interpretation of the privilege in favor of an antiseptic, purely secular formulation, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Even if one were to agree that the majority\u2019s statement of the standard applicable for the invocation of the cleric-penitent privilege was correct, the majority\u2019s application of that standard in this case separately requires that I dissent for two reasons: the majority\u2019s failure to analyze whether its new standard constitutes a new rule of law, requiring a full-fledged analysis of its retroactive or prospective effect; and the brute force application of this new standard in this case, without allowing the parties to frame their proofs in conformity with the majority\u2019s new standard, denies the State even a modicum of the fairness required by due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">This Court has made clear that \u201ca case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the State or if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d <em>State v.

Given that conclusion, one must determine \u201cwhether the rule we announce today \u2018is to be applied retroactively and, if so, to what extent, a determination that implicates a three-step analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Molina, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 542-43, 902 A.2d 200 (quoting <em>Cummings, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 96-97, 875 A.2d 906).

Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 402-03, 427 A.2d 525 (1981).) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Although the majority\u2019s new standard undoubtedly qualifies as a new rule of law, the required analysis of whether that new rule should be applied in this case\u2014or in any other case\u2014is noticeably absent. The majority does not address whether its new rule is one to which retroactivity analysis applies; the majority does not engage in the critical, necessary weighing analysis due between the old and new rule; and the majority does not determine what level of retroactivity or prospective application its new rule should have. Because the majority fails to discuss whether it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>adopted a new rule or whether that rule should have retroactive or prospective effect, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Finally, eschewing any form of new rule/retroactivity analysis, the majority simply applies its new rule to the facts as developed below\u2014albeit in respect of a different rule of law\u2014and reaches its own conclusions. Even though it admits that \u201c[i]t is unclear whether the trial court followed the ... approach\u201d adopted by the majority, <em>ante </em>at 388, 990 A2d at 1133, the majority nevertheless \u201cconclude[s] that there is ample support in the record for the ... conclusion that the privilege applies.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because that procedure artificially and needlessly forecloses the parties from the opportunity or ability to develop a proper record while cognizant and on notice of the controlling legal principles, I also must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">It hardly need be said: a bedrock principle of due process is that parties must be on notice of what is to be litigated. <em>McKesson Corp. v. Hackensack Med. Imaging, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>262, 275, 962 A.2d 1076 (2009) (quoting <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>286, 291, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>559, 564, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 497 (1980)). <em>See also Simmermon v.

Given the result forcibly commanded by the majority, defendant should have little cause for complaint. The State, on the other hand, is in these very real respects a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>litigant like any other, and one that also is entitled to fairness, a leitmotif that pervades our jurisprudence. <em>See, e.g., Pasqua v. Council, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>127, 142, 892 A.2d 668 (2006) (stating that due process \u201cis nothing more than affording \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 to a litigant in a particular situation\u201d (citing <em>Lassiter v.

McCann, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 553, 919 A.2d 136 (App.Div.2007) (stating that judicial disqualification implicates, among other concerns, fairness to litigants); <em>Arenas v. Gari, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 19, 706 A.2d 736 (App.Div.1998) (holding that \u201cjurors must not only be fair and impartial, they also must appear so, in order to maintain the litigants\u2019 confidence in the basic fairness of the trial\u201d); <em>Klajman v.

Anything less is trial by ambush, and nothing more than an unfair change in the rules after the match has been played.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">For the reasons presented, I would adopt a standard for the evaluation of cleric-penitent privilege claims that incorporates the relevant religious tenets in determining whether the conversation to be disclosed was in fact confidential and, therefore, worthy of the privilege.
