Besler filed a federal civil rights claim pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, alleging that he was entitled to express his grievances at the meeting\u2014a public forum\u2014and that the Board violated his free-speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. A jury found that the Board did not have a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to justify silencing Besler and awarded him monetary damages in the amount of $100,000. The Appellate Division affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In this appeal, the Board contends that the singular actions of its Board President did not make it liable for any claimed First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Amendment violation under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983. The Board also argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The Board maintains that the evidence supported only one conclusion\u2014that it was enforcing a content-neutral policy of curtailing repetitive remarks for the purpose of conducting an orderly public meeting. Last, the Board urges that we overturn the damages award as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">First, we find that, for purposes of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, the Board President was acting as a final policymaker while presiding over the public comment period of the Board meeting and therefore the Board could be held liable for a violation of Besler\u2019s First Amendment rights. Second, we hold that Besler presented sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that the Board silenced him for no reason other than the unpopular viewpoint he expressed. We thus must respect the jury\u2019s finding that the Board violated Besler\u2019s free-speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Finally, Besler offered only minimal evidence of emotional distress\u2014transient embarrassment and humiliation as a consequence of the abrupt manner in which he was prevented from completing his remarks. We conclude that the damages award is so clearly excessive that it constitutes a miscarriage of justice and therefore remand to the trial court for a remittitur or, alternatively, a new trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In January 1998, Philip Besler, his wife Carolann, and daughter Jennifer filed a twelve-count complaint in the Superior Court, Law Division of Mercer County, naming as defendants the Board of Education of West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District, the girls high school basketball coach, the District\u2019s Superintendent, the high school Principal, and others. Only one of the twelve counts dealt with Mr. Besler\u2019s claim that he was denied his First Amendment rights when silenced at the January 28, 1997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Board of Education meeting. In that count, the Board was the only named defendant. The remaining eleven counts addressed various other claims\u2014that the basketball coach, Daniel Hussong, verbally abused and harassed Jennifer, that the District was blindly indifferent to her plight, and that the police retaliated against the Beslers for the complaints they raised with the District. The complaint specifically alleged violations of the federal and state constitutions, the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to \u201449, Title IX, 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1681 to 1688, as well as common law claims of negligent supervision, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">A jury trial was conducted between December 2003 and March 2004 encompassing thirty-two days of testimony from more than fifty-five witnesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Only a fraction of the testimony concerned Mr. Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The Board appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict. At this procedural stage, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Besler. <em>Lewis v. Am. Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>544, 567, 715 A.2d 967 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The jury heard that Philip Besler began attending and speaking at School Board meetings in the spring of 1996 as a concerned parent and citizen. His daughter, Jennifer, then a senior at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and member of the girls varsity basketball team, claimed that her basketball coach, Daniel Hus-song, repeatedly verbally abused her and other team members. Jennifer asserted that Hussong singled her out for particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>harsh treatment, making her the target of profanity-laeed tirades and disparaging comments about her weight. The mistreatment took a physical and emotional toll on Jennifer, causing an eating disorder and a condition called amenorrhea, a disruption of her menstrual cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Philip Besler considered Hussong\u2019s conduct grossly unprofessional and felt that the School District\u2019s administrators were indifferent to Hussong\u2019s behavior and Jennifer\u2019s plight. When Mr. Besler\u2019s wife Carolann had approached Hussong to express her concerns, Hussong told her to \u201cget out of my [f* * *ing] gym. The problem on this [f* * *ing] team is you [f* * *ing] parents and I want you to leave my [f* * *ing] girls alone.\u201d From April 1996 through January 1997, Mr. and Mrs. Besler met with the West Windsor-Plainsboro High School Principal, Michael Carr, and the District\u2019s Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Ray Bandlow; wrote letters to Carr, Dr. Bandlow, and the President of the Board of Education, Dr. Lester Bynum; and attended various Board meetings. Their purpose was to force the School District not only to take action against Hussong, but also to address the need for civility in coaching. Ultimately, the Beslers believed that the District was unresponsive to the issues they had raised. During the public comment period of nine Board meetings, the Beslers addressed their concerns about the failure of the District to hold coaches accountable for inappropriate and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">At the April 23, 1996 meeting of the Board of Education, Mr. Besler asked the Board to \u201clook[] into coaching behavior and distributed an article about problems with \u2018unsportsmanlike\u2019 behavior on the part of some coaches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">At the May 21 Board meeting, Mr. Besler commented on what he perceived was the District\u2019s double standard of requiring language-appropriate conduct by students using information technology but not imposing a similar code of conduct on coaches on the playing field. Dr. Bynum and the Assistant School Superintendent responded that the District \u201c[did] not sanction inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ate language\u201d by coaches and insisted that a code of conduct applied to coaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">At the May 28 Board meeting, Mr. Besler indicated that, based on his reading of the code of conduct applicable to coaches, Hussong was in violation of the District\u2019s policies. He called for an investigation of Hussong\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Mr. Besler attended the June 18 Board meeting because \u201cit was rumored\u201d that a vote would be taken on Hussong\u2019s contract at the next meeting. Because he would not be available on that date, he asked that the matter be postponed. Mr. Besler was advised that \u201cpersonnel action would not be subject to public comment at a meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">At the June 25 Board meeting, Mr. Besler expressed \u201chis concerns regarding the vulgar and abusive language used by his daughter\u2019s high school coach.\u201d He stated that he had taken his complaints to the administration but was told that it was \u201cunable\u201d to investigate the coach. He noted that after raising his concerns with the administration his daughter became the target of a police investigation stirred by \u201can anonymous letter and telephone call.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He again complained that the rules governing \u201cunacceptable language\u201d for teachers and students in the classroom and on the Internet did not seem to apply to coaches on the playing field. Last, he requested that the Board vote on each coach\u2019s reappointment individually. At that same meeting, five members of the public spoke in favor of the District\u2019s coaching staff, and Hussong was reappointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Five months later, on November 26, Mr. Besler attended his next Board meeting. During the public comment period, he read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>a statement expressing Ms belief that the members of the Athletic Review Committee formed to look into the rules of conduct governing coaches did not possess the requisite impartiality to perform their duties. Mr. Besler noted that the Athletic Review Committee consisted of, among others, Hussong\u2019s wife, who was an assistant coach on the girls basketball team; another of Hus-song\u2019s assistant coaches who allegedly watched his \u201cabusive behavior\u201d with indifference; and various student-athletes who would be placed in the untenable position of making recommendations about the coaches for whom they played.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">At the December 17 Board meeting, Mrs. Besler read the same statement her husband had delivered at the previous meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On January 21,1997, during the Board\u2019s public comment period, Mr. Besler attempted to ask the School District\u2019s Director of Planning a question. At this point, Carr, the Principal, \u201cjump[ed] up\u201d and stated that Mr. Besler should not be allowed to speak. The Board President, Dr. Bynum, directed Carr to sit down and allowed Mr. Besler to pose a question regarding a paragraph in the District Strategic Planning Committee Report that read: \u201cWe will not tolerate behavior that diminishes the dignity, self-worth, or safety of any individual.\u201d Dr. Bynum then told Mr. Besler that he had raised the issue before, that the Board and admimstration had responded to his concerns, and that Besler would not receive an answer \u201cagain at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Mr. Besler also attended the January 28, 1997 Board meeting, which is the focus of this case. At least one hundred people were at this meeting. The public comment period began with a statement by Dr. Bynum: \u201cThis is the time in each regular monthly Board of Education meeting that we invite the thoughts and reactions on items of concern from members of our community who are present.\u201d Dr. Bynum stated that the public comment period would last no longer than thirty minutes and that no speaker would have more than five minutes of comment time.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The first member of the public to speak was a District resident who had spoken at length at numerous Board meetings. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>evening his comments lasted more than seven-and-one-half minutes and addressed various subjects, such as the effect of \u201caffordable housing\u201d on the School District, the need for equal treatment of women in the high school sports program, and the potential costs if Title IX (gender-discrimination) litigation were instituted against the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Mr. Besler had his hand raised to speak next. Before calling on him, Dr. Bynum made remarks that appeared specifically tailored for Mr. Besler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">Before I recognize the next person, let me just make some clarifications on this public comment section of our meeting. This section of the meeting is not intended for personnel discussions of individuals. It\u2019s not intended for allegations or insinuations about staff behavior or staff performance. It\u2019s for public comment only. It\u2019s not to allow people a stage or a forum to present their own personal views, particular views under litigation, on matters under litigation. So when those kinds of things occur, the chair reserves the right to cut off any discussion of that nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Besler then gave his name and address and, after speaking for no more than thirty seconds, was silenced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">Besler: A few months ago, this Board discussed policies for the use of technology in the system; specifically, you said that the use of harassing or abusive language or any obscenities on the Internet is strictly prohibited. Last week at the meeting of this Board, this district\u2019s strategic plan was introduced. Within the parameters, it was stated that we will not tolerate behavior which diminishes the dignity, self worth, or safety of any individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">[Four loud bangs of the gavel.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">Bynum: You are out of order. We\u2019ve heard those comments before several times from you, and the Board will not entertain those comments tonight again for the numerous times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">Besler: May I hand my speech to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">Bynum: You can hand out, yes, whatever you have to say, but we are not going to entertain those comments. Any other comments from the public?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">Had Besler been permitted to complete his prepared written comments, he would have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">My questions to this Board are: Do these guidelines apply to students as well as staff persons employed by this district? Secondly, Does the use of profanity including repeated use of the \u201cF\u201d word constitute abusive language? Lastly, Does the use of abusive language repeatedly, diminish the dignity of an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">Besler also intended to expand on his prepared remarks if he had not been cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>After Besler sat down, two other members of the public spoke during the public comment period, one engaging in dialogue with the Board for more than twelve minutes and the other for more than eight minutes. Both spoke on various topics ranging from the budget to technology issues to courtesy busing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Dr. Bynum later admitted that he could not recall ever preventing a parent or student from making positive remarks about a faculty member. The immediate past Board President noted that, during his tenure, the public comment period of board meetings was a time when members of the public could speak for three minutes \u201con any topic that they wish[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, on Jennifer\u2019s claims, the jury found Hussong liable for reckless infliction of emotional distress and negligence, and the Board of Education and certain officials liable for negligent supervision. The jury awarded Jennifer $3,000,000 but reduced the award by fifty-one percent due to Jennifer\u2019s failure to mitigate her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The jury entered a verdict against the Board of Education on Mr. Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim, awarding Besler $100,000 in damages for pain and suffering.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">After the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict on Jennifer\u2019s claims and dismissed those claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court denied the Board of Education\u2019s motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, and a remittitur on Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim. Earlier, in denying the Board\u2019s motion for a directed verdict against Besler, the court found that a reasonable jury could conclude that \u201cthe Board simply did not want to hear what plaintiff had to say\u201d and did not have \u201ca significant or compelling governmental reason\u201d to silence Besler at the Board meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In an unpublished per curiam opinion, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Jennifer\u2019s claims. The panel also affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that there was sufficient evidence to present Mr. Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim to the jury. The panel determined that the School Board meeting was a public forum and therefore any content-based restrictions had to be both \u201cnarrowly drawn to achieve a compelling governmental interest,\u201d (citing <em>Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>37, 45-46, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794, 805 (1983)), and \u201cleave[ ] open ample alternative channels for communication of the information,\u201d (quoting <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>781, 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2746, 2753, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, 675 (1989)). The panel found the \u201ccritical issue\u201d to be whether the Board\u2019s restriction on Besler\u2019s speech was content-based or content-neutral. In other words, the jury had to decide whether the Board restricted Besler\u2019s speech because of the content of what he had to say or because it was merely conducting an orderly and efficient meeting. In sustaining the verdict, the panel held that Dr. Bynum\u2019s motivation in gaveling down Besler was a question of fact to be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The panel also held there was sufficient evidence to hold the Board directly liable for a First Amendment violation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>658, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2018, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>611 (1978), because \u201cthe evidence indicated the Board had a policy permitting free speech for a limited period at each Board meeting.\u201d The panel did not address the Board\u2019s argument that the $100,000 pain-and-suffering damages award was excessive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We granted the Board\u2019s cross-petition for certification. <em>Besler v. Bd. of Educ. of West Windsor-Plainsboro Reg\u2019l Sch. Dist., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>314, 966 A.2d 1079 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Board has raised four issues for our consideration: (1) whether the Appellate Division articulated the proper standard for public-entity liability under <em>Monell; </em>(2) whether, under <em>Monell, </em>liability could \u201cbe imputed to [the Board] for the isolated act of one of its Board Members\u201d; (3) whether Besler presented sufficient evidence to support a violation of his right to free speech under the First Amendment; and (4) whether the evidence supported the jury\u2019s award of $100,000 for Besler\u2019s pain-and-suffering damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We first address whether the silencing of Besler by Dr. Bynum at the January 28, 1997 Board meeting was an act attributable to the Board under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983 and the case law interpreting that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In its charge to the jury on Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim, the trial court never distinguished between Dr. Bynum and the Board. The jury instructions made clear that if Dr. Bynum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>violated Besler\u2019s right to free speech, the Board would be liable for his actions. The Board was given the opportunity to object to this portion of the jury instructions at the charge conference. It did not. Neither did the Board object when the charge was delivered to the jury. Indeed, the Board, in its own proposed charge, presented Dr. Bynum\u2019s and the Board\u2019s actions as one. Only after an unfavorable verdict did the Board assert, in a post-trial motion, that it could not be held hable, under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 -1983, as the direct cause of any constitutional violation because the Board did not implement \u201ca <em>custom </em>or <em>policy\u201d </em>that infringed on Besler\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">At least at the time of trial, it appears that the parties accepted that Dr. Bynum\u2019s actions were sufficient to bind the Board for liability purposes under \u00a7 1983. That may be because the case law interpreting \u00a7 1983 makes clear that a final policymaker, by his actions, may possess the authority to bind a public entity for a constitutional infringement, <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>469, 480, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1292, 1298, 89 L.Ed.2d 452, 463 (1986), and that the court, not a jury, decides the issue, <em>Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>701, 737, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2702, 2723-24, 105 L.Ed.2d 598, 627-28 (1989). Although the record strongly suggests that the Board has waived any right to challenge the verdict based on a claim that Dr. Bynum was not a final policymaker, <em>R. </em>1:7-2, we will address the merits of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983 provides that a \u201cperson who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage ... causes to be subjected, any [citizen or person] to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law____\u201d A school board is a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>Monell, supra, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>at 662, 690, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2021, 2035-36, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 618, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">In <em>Monell, </em>the United States Supreme Court determined that, under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, a municipality or school board can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>be held liable for acts committed by one of its employees or agents, pursuant to a government policy or custom, that violate the Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d at 638. <em>Monell </em>distinguished between acts directly attributable to a municipality and acts committed by one of its employees. <em>Id. </em>at 690-92, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2035-37, 56 L.Ed.2d at 635-36.

Moreover, determining whether a person is a final policymaker for a public body, such as a school board, is a question of law for the trial court and is not an issue to be submitted to the jury. <em>Jett, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 737, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2723-24, 105 L.Ed.2d at 627-28; <em>see also Loigman, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 591-92, 889 A.2d 426 (finding Township\u2019s special counsel \u201cwas not a municipal \u2018policymaker\u2019 for \u00a7 1983 purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Typically, in determining which officials \u201cspeak with final policymaking authority for the local governmental actor concerning the action alleged to have caused the particular constitutional ... violation at issue,\u201d the trial court should review \u201cstate and local positive law, as well as custom or usage having the force of law.\u201d <em>Jett, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 737, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2724, 105 L.Ed.2d at 628 (internal quotation marks omitted). Once the trial court has determined that an individual official has \u201cthe power to make official policy on a particular issue,\u201d it is then for the jury to decide whether that individual\u2019s decision \u201ccaused the deprivation of [the] right[ ] at issue.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">With those principles in mind, we now address the Board\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">First, we agree with the Board that the Appellate Division misapprehended the <em>Monell </em>standard. The issue is not whether \u201cthe evidence indicated the Board had a policy permitting free speech for a limited period at each Board meeting,\u201d as the Appellate Division perceived. Rather, the issue is whether the Board\u2019s practice, custom, or policy, or the action of its final policymaker, is the moving force that causes a violation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>constitutional right. <em>See Monell, supra, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>at 694, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Second, at least before the jury returned a verdict, both the parties and the court evidently considered Dr. Bynum, who presided over the Board\u2019s proceedings and the public comment period, to be the final policymaker. <em>See McMillian, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 785, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1737, 138 L.Ed.2d at 8 (noting that official need only have final policy-making authority in \u201ca particular area[ ] or on a particular issue\u201d of municipal business to be final policymaker). No one questioned that the Board would be responsible for Dr. Bynum\u2019s actions. Indeed, Dr. Bynum stated during the public comment period on January 28,1997, \u201cthe chair reserves the right to cut off any discussion.\u201d In addition, at the charge conference, the Board\u2019s counsel conceded that Dr. Bynum, as Board President, controlled the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Even if the remaining members of the Board had the authority to overrule Dr. Bynum and insist that Besler be heard, they obviously acquiesced in the decision to silence Besler. No Board member raised a voice that Besler should be permitted to speak. In that sense, the members of the Board, by their silence, ratified Dr. Bynum\u2019s gaveling down of Besler. <em>See Gros v. City of Grand Prairie, </em>181 F.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cA policy or custom becomes official for purposes of \u00a7 1983 when it results from the decision or <em>acquiescence </em>of the municipal officer or body with \u2018final policymaking authority\u2019 over the subject matter of the offending policy.\u201d (emphasis added and citation omitted)). Clearly, Dr. Bynum and other Board members were the final policymakers for the Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Last, even a single act or decision by a municipal policymaker violating the constitutional rights of and causing injury to a citizen can form the basis for municipal liability. <em>Pembaur, supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 480, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1298, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 463 (\u201c[I]t is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.\u201d); <em>Stomel, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 146, 927 A.2d 129. If Besler was wrongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>silenced in violation of his First Amendment rights at the January 28 Board meeting and he suffered an injury, he has established the fundament of a cause of action. He does not have to establish that on multiple other occasions his free-speech rights were infringed by the Board before he can seek redress. <em>Pembaur, supra, 475 U.S. </em>at 480-81,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1298-99, 89 L.Ed.2d at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We therefore conclude, as a matter of law, that Dr. Bynum was the final policymaker for the Board of Education during the public comment period of the Board meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We next turn to the Board\u2019s challenge to the jury\u2019s verdict on Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Besler argues that the Board of Education\u2019s President, Dr. Bynum, silenced him during the public comment period of the January 28, 1997 meeting because he was expressing a viewpoint disagreeable to the Board. In contrast, the Board submits that Dr. Bynum cut Besler off because Besler\u2019s comments were a rehash of remarks given at prior meetings. The basic issue presented to the jury was whether Dr. Bynum\u2019s motives in stopping Besler from delivering remarks critical of the Board and its employees were content-based or content-neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from abridging \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d or \u201cthe right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend.

A governmental entity may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on speech in a public forum so long as \u201cthe restrictions \u2018are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 105 L.Ed.2d at 675 (quoting <em>Clark v.

Significantly, once a governmental entity, such as a school board, opens the floor for discussion of relevant matters of public interest and concern, it \u201cmay not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.\u201d <em>Mosley, supra, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>at 96, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2290, 33 L.Ed.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Although the government may not use a regulation as a pretext to suppress \u201cspeech because of disagreement with the message it conveys,\u201d it may impose \u201c[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of [the] expression ... even if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2754, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 675. \u201cGovernment regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">A public body may control its proceedings in a content-neutral manner by stopping a speaker who is disruptive or who fails to keep to the subject matter on the agenda, <em>Jones v.

For example, in <em>Eichenlaub v.

The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs First Amendment claims, finding that the chairman\u2019s aims and motives in ejecting the plaintiff were content-neutral: \u201cto prevent [ ] badgering, constant interruptions, and disregard for the rules of decorum.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Third Circuit emphasized that the First Amendment does not require the presiding officer of a public meeting to sit idly by while a speaker attempts to \u201chijack\u201d or \u201cfilibuster\u201d the proceedings. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The government or a school board, however, has the burden of showing that its restriction of speech in a public forum was done for a constitutionally permissible purpose. <em>See U.S. v.

The trial court instructed the jury that the Board was entitled to run an \u201corderly and efficient\u201d meeting and that allowing Besler \u201cto distribute copies of his statement ... was an alternative means to express his views.\u201d The jury was told that it should find in favor of the Board if Dr. Bynum interrupted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Besler\u2019s remarks because they were \u201cirrelevant to the agenda, involved a matter in litigation or [were] repetitious.\u201d On the other hand, the jury was charged that it should find for Besler if Dr. Bynum suppressed his speech \u201cbecause the Board did not simply want to hear what [Besler] had to say, or because the Board disagreed with [Besler\u2019s] viewpoint.\u201d The trial court placed in the hands of the jury the task of making ultimate findings of fact and reaching legal conclusions based on those factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Besler is that Dr. Bynum gaveled him down at the January 28 meeting because he was attempting to expose the hypocrisy between words and reality, between the Board\u2019s strategic plan, which did \u201cnot tolerate behavior which diminishes the dignity, self-worth, or safety of any individual,\u201d and the Board\u2019s condoning foul-mouthed, abusive coaches who belittled and demeaned student-athletes. Unquestionably, the Board\u2019s failure to curb abusive coaching practices was a theme of Besler\u2019s previous remarks. But the jury was permitted to find that Besler, even if plowing similar ground, was touching on a new subject, the strategic plan, and that the Board was merely attempting to paper over an unpleasant topic that it did not want aired in a hall filled with one hundred people. Besler was gaveled down thirty seconds into his presentation, whereas three other members of the public each commanded the floor for periods in excess of five minutes. The evidence does not suggest that Besler\u2019s conduct was obstreperous or truculent, or that he was attempting to hijack or filibuster the proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, Besler respectfully sat down when instructed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The jury was free to find that Dr. Bynum\u2019s warning comments, evidently directed at Besler, who was the next speaker, revealed impatience and antagonism toward a viewpoint he did not want to hear. Dr. Bynum cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>This section of the meeting is not intended for personnel discussions of individuals. It\u2019s not intended for allegations or insinuations about staff behavior or staff performance. It\u2019s for public comment only. It\u2019s not to allow people a stage or a forum to present their own personal views, particular views under litigation, on matters under litigation. So when those kinds of things occur, the chair reserves the right to cut off any discussion of that nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Dr. Bynum, however, had never interrupted any person who offered a favorable opinion about school personnel or showered compliments on the coaches.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the Board did not argue in its trial summation or on appeal that Mr. Besler was barred from speaking because his remarks touched on a subject concerning litigation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board President silenced Besler for one ostensible reason: \u2018We\u2019ve heard those comments before several times from you, and the board will not entertain those comments tonight again for the numerous times.\u201d Besler, however, contends that the Board\u2019s claim of repetitiveness was merely a cover to suppress an unpopular opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Clearly, Besler was not a cheerleader of the Board; he was a critic of its policies and actions. Dr. Bynum and other board members may have considered Besler\u2019s remarks grating and tiresome, but the public comment period was a time for citizens, including Besler, \u201cto make known their opinions to their representatives, and to petition for redress of grievances.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. 1,118. For public officials, particularly those who may be subject to \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks,\u201d <em>New York Times, supra, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>at 270, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 721, 11 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 701, free speech is not for the fainthearted. Such officials must be thick-skinned enough to tolerate the uninhibited and robust debate on public issues that the First Amendment demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The jury was required to engage in a highly fact-sensitive analysis. Ultimately, in rendering its verdict, the jury found that the Board did not prove that Dr. Bynum interrupted Besler\u2019s \u201cspeech for a significant or compelling governmental reason.\u201d The jury obviously determined that Dr. Bynum\u2019s motivation was not content-neutral, rejecting his claim that he silenced Besler because of the sheer repetitiveness of his remarks. Furthermore, the jury rejected the Board\u2019s argument that it muzzled Besler for the purpose of conducting an \u201corderly and efficient\u201d meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Reasonable persons may disagree about whether the Board should have been held liable. However, this Court is not a juror of last resort. We are satisfied that this jury rendered a verdict that is sustainable on the evidence. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the Board\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Nevertheless, we are constrained to remand to the trial court for a remittitur of the damages award or, alternatively, for a new trial. We find that the damages award is clearly excessive and was likely caused by the evidential spillover from Jennifer\u2019s ease, which prejudiced the Board\u2019s ability to receive a fair consideration on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, a constitutional violation, standing alone, does not entitle a plaintiff to compensatory damages. <em>Memphis Cmty.

Stated differently, \u201c[a] trial court should not order a new trial or remit a jury\u2019s damages award unless it is so clearly disproportionate to the injury ... that it may be said to shock the judicial conscience.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 927 A.2d 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant moves for a new trial, successfully claiming that a jury awarded excessive damages,\u201d a court has the power of remittitur\u2014that is, to reduce the damages and to give the plaintiff the opportunity to accept the reduced amount or opt for a new trial on damages. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 280-81, 927 A.2d 1269; <em>see also Fertile v.

Jastram v. Kruse, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>216, 228, 962 A.2d 503 (2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We apply the same standard of review as the trial court in assessing whether a damages award is excessive, with the significant exception that we must give due \u201cdeference to the trial court\u2019s \u2018feel of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 282, 927 A.2d 1269 (citation omitted).

A trial or appellate court that grants a remittitur must give a statement of \u201creasons for reducing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>damages award.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When articulating reasons for an award reduction, a court must cite to the trial record and may compare the damages award to other such awards. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In light of our remittitur jurisprudence, we now turn to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In assessing whether the $100,000 damages award is commensurate with Besler\u2019s claimed injuries, we begin by observing that Besler\u2019s First Amendment claim and Jennifer\u2019s multiple tort claims were presented to the same jury. The vast majority of the more than fifty-five witnesses at the three-month-long trial spoke almost exclusively about Jennifer\u2019s case. Those witnesses gave emotionally jarring testimony about Coach Hussong\u2019s intemperate behavior, such as his frequent use of profane language and, in one instance, his slamming a locker room door on the hand of an athlete. The jury also heard testimony about Jennifer\u2019s eating disorder and t\u00e9mporary loss of her menstrual cycle. This evidence bore little relevance to whether the Board violated Besler\u2019s free-speeeh rights or his claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The jury awarded Besler $100,000 in pain-and-suffering damages based on testimony that, after he was gaveled down at the January 28 Board meeting, he was \u201ccompletely embarrassed,\u201d \u201cshocked,\u201d \u201cbewildered,\u201d \u201csick to [his] stomach,\u201d and felt like a leper. That was largely the testimony describing the injury Besler suffered as a result of the violation of his First Amendment rights. Although Besler was not required to present psychological or psychiatric expert testimony about his mental anguish, he offered no testimony on the depth or degree of his emotional distress or suffering. <em>See Bolden v. Se. Pa. Tramp. Auth, </em>21 F.3d 29, 36 (3d Cir.1994) (holding \u201cexpert medical evidence is not required to prove emotional distress in section 1983 cases\u201d). For example, he did not claim that the incident caused nightmares or sleeplessness, or impaired his reputation, his relations with others, or his ability to function. The jury was left with testimony that supported, at best, transient emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>On the one hand, federal circuit courts of appeals have overturned compensatory damages awards based on minimal emotional-distress testimony. <em>See Price v. City of Charlotte, </em>93 F.3d 1241, 1243, 1255-57 (4th Cir.1996) (reducing \u00a7 1983 emotional-distress damages award of $3,000 to nominal damages of $1 based on generic testimony that plaintiffs felt \u201cbetrayed,\u201d \u201cembarrassed,\u201d \u201cdegraded,\u201d and \u201cdevastated\u201d over failure of municipality to promote on account of race), cert. <em>denied, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>1116, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1246, 137 L.Ed.2d 328 (1997); <em>Spence v. Bd. of Educ. of the Christina Sch. Dist., </em>806 F.2d 1198, 1201 (3d Cir.1986) (affirming district court\u2019s elimination of emotional-distress damages award of $22,060 in First Amendment case because plaintiff made merely general assertions \u201cthat she was depressed and humiliated by the [job] transfer and that she had lost her motive to be creative\u201d); <em>Nekolny v. Painter, </em>653 F.2d 1164, 1166, 1172-73 (7th Cir.1981) (reversing emotional-distress damages awards on First Amendment claim for three plaintiffs ranging from $5,000 to $2,500 because \u201c[a] single statement by a party that he was \u2018depressed,\u2019 \u2018a little despondent,\u2019 or even \u2018completely humiliated\u2019 ... is not enough to establish injury even when the statement is considered along with the facts of [the] case\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1719, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>139 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On the other hand, when plaintiffs have sufficiently articulated emotional distress or pain and suffering, damages awards have been sustained. <em>Miner v. City of Glens Falls, </em>999 F.2d 655, 662-63 (2d Cir.1993) (upholding $12,000 emotional-distress damages award in \u00a7 1983 case where plaintiffs testimony demonstrated trauma of losing his home, income, and professional standing in community); <em>DeNieva v. Reyes, </em>966 F.2d 480, 482, 487 (9th Cir.1992) (affirming $50,000 damages award in \u00a7 1983 case for violating plaintiffs constitutional right to travel due to government\u2019s wrongful confiscation of plaintiffs passport for eleven days where testimony \u201cindicated] that [plaintiff] had suffered emotional distress and physical trauma,\u201d including insomnia, dizziness, and vomiting, during eleven-day period); <em>Rodriguez v. Comas, </em>888 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>F.2d 899, 900, 906 (1st Cir.1989) (affirming $75,000 damages award in \u00a7 1983 case where plaintiff was illegally arrested and evidence included psychiatrist\u2019s testimony that plaintiff suffered from \u201ca post traumatic stress disorder\u201d involving \u201cchest pains, headaches, insomnia, and recurrent invasive recalls or memories of the events\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We discern from these cases that compensatory damages for emotional distress, in the amount awarded here, must be based on more than de minimis mental anguish, or fleeting embarrassment, or mere shock and bewilderment. Clearly, Besler was deeply upset and humiliated because he was not accorded the right to complete his statement to the Board. We also recognize that some jurisdictions may pay less deference than we do to a jury\u2019s damages award. Nevertheless, viewing the record in the light most favorable to Besler, we conclude that the $100,000 damages award is so clearly excessive that it constitutes \u201ca miscarriage of justice.\u201d We are convinced that the evidential spillover from Jennifer\u2019s case infected the jury\u2019s consideration of damages. Whereas the jury\u2019s finding of a constitutional violation is grounded in evidence in the record, even the most generous consideration of the testimony from Besler\u2019s perspective does not support the damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We therefore remand to the trial court for a remittitur of the damages, award, leaving to its sound discretion the appropriate reduction. In the event that Besler does not accept the remittitur, he will be entitled to a new trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">For the reasons expressed, we affirm that part of the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment that upheld the jury\u2019s finding that the Board violated Besler\u2019s First Amendment rights. We reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of a remittitur.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We remand to the trial court for a remittitur hearing consistent with the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Justice RIVERA-SOTO, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">According to the majority, the following summarizes the salient facts at issue in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">During the public comment period of a meeting of the Board of Education of the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District (Board), the Board President denied plaintiff Philip Besler the opportunity to complete a statement critical of both Board policy and a high school coach he believed had verbally abused student-athletes, including- his daughter. Besler filed a federal civil rights claim pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, alleging that he was entitled to express his grievances at the meeting\u2014a public forum\u2014and that the Board violated his free-speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. A jury found that the Board did not have a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to justify silencing Besler and awarded him monetary damages in the amount of $100,000. The Appellate Division affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\"><em>[Ante </em>at 554, 993 A.2d at 810-11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Thus, before us are not Besler\u2019s original claims\u2014whether his daughter had been \u201cverbally abused\u201d by her high school basketball coach\u2014as those claims were rejected by the courts below and are not encompassed in this appeal. Instead, this appeal is narrowly focused on Besler\u2019s claim that, at his ninth consecutive appearance during the public comment period of a Board meeting at which he raised that same subject, he was interrupted once, and that such interruption alone gives rise to liability for infringement of his constitutional rights. In far simpler terms, this is nothing more than a case where the tail seeks to wag the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Based on its factual predicate, the majority reaches three legal conclusions. First, the majority concludes that \u201cfor purposes of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, the Board President was acting as a final policymaker while presiding over the public comment period of the Board meeting!,]\u201d <em>ante </em>at 555, 993 A.2d at 811, from whose acts, in the proper circumstances, liability could flow to the Board. That conclusion is legally unassailable and, to that limited extent, I readily concur with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">However, the majority also holds that \u201cBesler presented sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that the Board silenced him for no reason other than the unpopular viewpoint he expressed!,]\u201d explaining that \u201c[w]e thus must respect the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>finding that the Board violated Besler\u2019s free-speeeh rights.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 555, 993 A.2d at 811. It further states that \u201cBesler offered only minimal evidence of emotional distress\u2014transient embarrassment and humiliation as a consequence of the abrupt manner in which he was prevented from completing his remarks[,]\u201d thus concluding that \u201cthe damages award is so clearly excessive that it constitutes a miscarriage of justice and therefore remand[ing] to the trial court for a remittitur or, alternatively, a new trial on damages.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 555, 993 A.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The majority\u2019s main conclusion\u2014that \u201cBesler presented sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that the Board silenced him for no reason other than the unpopular viewpoint he expressed[,]\u201d <em>ante </em>at 555, 993 A.2d at 811 \u2014is based on an incomplete, and thus impermissibly skewed, recitation of the evidence of record in this appeal. Fairly and impartially viewing <em>all </em>of the record evidence through the required procedural prism applicable here, the conclusion that, as a matter of law, there is sufficient credible evidence in this record to sustain the verdict in Besler\u2019s favor is simply unsupportable. Therefore, based on the absence of competent proofs of liability, Besler\u2019s claim should fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Moreover, even if one were to accept the premise that the paltry liability proofs adduced by Besler somehow were barely sufficient to squeak by the threshold needed to sustain a jury verdict, the skimpy proofs of damages Besler presented\u2014that, as a result of being \u201cgaveled down,\u201d he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d and his \u201cstomach start[ed] gurgling[,]\u201d all without any independent manifestation of injury\u2014are so pathetically trivial, so legally insignificant, so factually inconsequential as to constitute no proof of cognizable damages at all. Thus, the judgment in Besler\u2019s favor should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Because the majority sustains Besler\u2019s ill-gotten judgment and remands only as to the quantum of damages to be awarded, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The majority\u2019s factual recitation is not complete. As this appeal arises from the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a more robust summary of the facts is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">During the 1995-1996 academic year, Jennifer Besler was a senior at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School, where she was a member of the girls\u2019 varsity basketball team. At some point in the basketball season, Jennifer claimed to her parents that her basketball coach had told her to lose weight and had used profanity in addressing his players. Besler and his wife, Carolann, took offense in respect of the treatment of their daughter, at least as they perceived it. However, because Jennifer asked them to \u201cstay out of it,\u201d they remained silent, while their resentment obviously simmered at a boiling point.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">After the 1995-1996 basketball season ended in a loss to Piscataway High School in the Central Jersey Girls\u2019 Basketball Championship game,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Besler embarked on a one-man vendetta against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>daughter\u2019s now-former coach. As noted in the Board\u2019s minutes, on April 28, 1996, Besler attended a meeting of the Board and, during the public comment period, \u201cspoke to the [B]oard concerning the possibility of looking into coaching behavior and distributed an article about problems with \u2018unsportsmanlike\u2019 behavior on the part of some coaches.\u201d Three days later, on April 26, 1996, Besler followed up with a letter to the president of the Board, complaining about \u201cthe coaching situation at the high school[,]\u201d enclosing certain written material, and threatening that \u201cif this matter is not remedied quickly, then I will have no alternative but to seek redress through other available means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Undaunted, on May 21, 1996, Besler once again attended a Board meeting, where he again spoke during the period reserved for public comment. As reflected in the Board\u2019s minutes, he \u201ccommented on what he perceives as a two[-]tiered system\u2014why do we have a code of conduct for technology on one hand for students, and allow use of inappropriate language by adults on the playing field?\u201d The minutes also reflect that both the president of the Board and an assistant superintendent of schools \u201cstated that we do not sanction inappropriate language, that there is, indeed, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>code of conduct for coaches, which is handled through administrative procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Dissatisfied with that response, the very next day, May 22,1996, Besler, through his lawyer and as a predicate to filing his lawsuit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issued a written notice to the Board alleging that (1) the coach had verbally and mentally abused his daughter and thus had \u201ccaused and continues to cause emotional and mental suffering[;]\u201d (2) the high school principal had \u201cfailed and/or refused to supervise, investigate or prevent the conduct of the [coach] in spite of notice to him of these incidents, causing further damage[;]\u201d and (3) the Board had \u201cfailed and/or refused to implement procedures which would prevent such abusive behavior or conduct, causing further damage[.]\u201d For these claims, Besler sought \u201creimbursement in the amount of $1,250,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Less than one week later, on May 28, 1996, Besler again attended a Board meeting, where, also during the public comment period, he claimed he had reviewed the code of conduct governing coaches and that, in his opinion, the girls\u2019 basketball head coach \u201cbroke most of them.\u201d According to Besler, he attended that meeting \u201cto identify the rules that [the coach] broke that were against those regulations that [the Board] had in place\u201d and \u201cto come up with a policy on coaches, a policy that was enforceable.\u201d He \u201casked for an investigation\u201d of the girls\u2019 basketball head coach. Following that appearance at the May 28, 1996 Board meeting, Besler met with the superintendent of schools on May 31, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>where he again repeated his charges against the girls\u2019 basketball head coach.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Seemingly oblivious that he, through his counsel, had placed the Board on written notice of a million dollar-plus claim, utterly unaware of the actions taken in respect of the coach\u2019s March 1996 evaluation, and although his daughter\u2019s dealings with the basketball coach had ended and she was to graduate in short order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Besler followed up on the May 31, 1996 Board meeting by writing directly to the superintendent of schools. By a letter dated June 4, 1996, Besler sought to \u201csolidify and put into writing [his] complaint concerning the girls[\u2019] basketball coach\u201d at the high school. Listing eight incidents Besler alleged had \u201coccurred while [his daughter] was on the varsity team[,]\u201d he demanded to \u201cknow within ten days ... what action you will be pursuing.\u201d Staring down a $1,250,000 claim, it is entirely unremarkable that the superintendent of schools neither acceded to nor responded to Besler\u2019s \u201cdemand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">By a letter dated June 11, 1996, Besler again wrote to the president of the Board, this time enclosing \u201ca comparison of students and coaches being controlled[,]\u201d noting that, \u201cin [his] opinion, the comparison highlights the inconsistency the School Board is exhibiting in strictly monitoring the students but allowing the coaches to break those same rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">A week later, on June 18, 1996, Besler attended the next meeting of the Board. The minutes reflect two diametrically opposed points raised concerning the Board\u2019s treatment of coaches. Early in the meeting,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">a high school teacher[ ] read a statement from the district\u2019s coaches expressing concern that the [B]oard had stepped beyond their mandated role of policy maker into the role of supervisor. The statement cited the contents of a recent letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>district coaches informing them that the [B]oard would be reviewing their evaluations [that] evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">The coaches ask the [B]oard to follow the model they are responsible for maintaining, not only through policy, but through the district\u2019s current mission to strengthen site-based decision making.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">With this proposed review of evaluations, it is felt that the [B]oard is creating a precedent that has implications not only on the playing field, but in the classroom as well. The coaches asked the Board to recognize the implications of their actions and reconsider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In contrast, Besler later \u201ctold the [B]oard that it was \u2018rumored\u2019 that a vote would be taken on a personnel matter [the coach\u2019s contract] at the [B]oard meeting on June 25th.\u201d Asserting \u201che would be out of the country on that date,\u201d Besler \u201crequested that the [B]oard defer the vote to another time[.]\u201d A member of the Board \u201ctold Mr. Besler that a personnel action would not be subject to public comment at a meeting.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board member further explained that \u201c[p]ublic comment is reserved for policy and general management issues, and it would be inappropriate to subject personnel items to public comment.\u201d As permitted by Section 7(b)(8) of the Open Public Meetings Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4\u2014 12(b)(8), once the public portion of the June 18, 1996 meeting concluded at 10:15 p.m., the Board met in executive session, during which it \u201ccontinued the discussion relative to the evaluation and performance of members of the High School coaching staff.\u201d Its executive session minutes report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Upon [the high school principalis assurance that he would be personally responsible for improved performance of the coaches under question, or their removal from their coaching position, and [the superintendent of schoolsfs support for [the high school principalis position as well as a general description of how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>process of improved performance would take place, the Board of Education approved the inclusion of all recommended coaches for the full academic year on next week\u2019s voting agenda.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Although he claimed he would be \u201cout of the country,\u201d Besler did attend the June 25, 1996 meeting of the Board. As the first member of the public to speak during the public participation portion of the meeting, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">reviewed his concerns regarding the vulgar and abusive language used by his daughter\u2019s high school coach. He told the Board that he had gone to the administration with the request that the coach be investigated, but was told that this was unable to be done____ He asked why teachers and students are prohibited from using unacceptable language both in the classroom and on the Internet, while coaches are allowed to use abusive [language] on the playing field. He requested that the Board vote individually on the reappointment of each high school coach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In contrast, two young women/former high school students \u201cspoke in support of the coaches at the high school. They told [B]oard members that they always had coaches who supported them in their endeavors and urged [B]oard support of coaches.\u201d Another member of the public stated that he \u201cagreed with Mr. Besler that coaches should not use abusive language. He also said that if a parent has a concern, he should deal directly with the coach about it.\u201d That said, that public participant declared that \u201c[h]e supports the coaching staff and feels that they work hard for the children and do an exceptional job of coaching the students as well as of preparing them for life.\u201d A teacher within the district \u201calso spoke in support of coaches and said that different types of coaching styles and personalities are needed in order to prepare the students for what they may have to face in the future.\u201d She added that \u201cour children are not always going to be nurtured and they must learn to deal with all types of individuals.\u201d Yet another member of the public \u201calso spoke in favor of district coaches. He said that all his children have participated in sports in the district. He feels that coaching is a difficult task, and he heartily supports our coaches and the job they do.\u201d In sum, the only discordant voice at that Board meeting in respect of the high school coaches belonged to but one speaker: Besler.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>When the Board reached the personnel section of its agenda, the high school principal read the following statement to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">I am recommending that coaches be approved for the 1996-97 school year. Consistent with Board policy, our discussions regarding individuals have taken place in closed session.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">The Board of Education has given a clear direction to the secondary schools to undertake a review of our athletic programs. This is the first such comprehensive charge regarding athletics during my tenure as principal. Although the task is challenging, it is a worthy one. In addressing it, we are to maintain the program\u2019s many positive aspects and to address concerns expressed by [the B]oard and community members regarding such topics as philosophy, individual team rules, communication and coaches\u2019 behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">When it develops its annual objectives, the Board links program improvement to the district mission statement and beliefs about what is good for children. We have a record of success in addressing these objectives. Tangible improvement ha[s| come at a secondary level in [a number of areas].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">Our district has an excellent reputation for athletics. We want to maintain this tradition. However, in our \u201cnew\u201d Athletic Program, it will be clear to all that the development of the child is the reason for interscholastic athletics, and that the behavior of coaches, parents, the student-athlete, and fans should reflect that central focus. It is not only my hope, but my expectation that, with the cooperation of coaches, parents, and students, we will develop an athletic program of which our community can truly be proud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">I am, therefore, asking that all coaches be approved so that we can get on with this necessary and important \u201cwork.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The president of the Board noted that the Board had \u201cspent considerable time discussing the athletic program, listening to parental concerns, and listening to administrators regarding how they propose to deal with these concerns.\u201d He explained that the Board had \u201cagreed to proceed with the administration\u2019s program as outlined in the [high school principal\u2019s statement] and will hold the administration accountable for making sure the program stays on track.\u201d He thus noted that the Board would \u201cproceed with the recommendation of the administration to approve the coaching positions.\u201d In the end, the Board approved a lengthy list of appointments, including the appointment of a total of seventy-seven coaches at the high school; one was the girls\u2019 basketball head coach who was the object of Besler\u2019s crusade.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Thus scorned, Besler sought to ratchet up his attack. By a letter dated July 24, 1996, Besler, through his counsel, supplemented his earlier Tort Claims Act notice, now also claiming that the superintendent of schools also had \u201cfailed and/or refused to supervise, investigate or prevent the conduct of the [coach] in spite of written notice to him of these incidents, causing further damage[,]\u201d and repeating his earlier claim that the Board had \u201cfailed and/or refused to implement procedures which would prevent such abusive behavior or conduct, causing further damagef.]\u201d Altogether, then, it was Besler\u2019s contention that the coach had verbally and mentally abused his daughter, and that the high school principal, the superintendent of schools and the Board were all hable for failing to supervise, investigate or prevent that alleged conduct. Astonishingly, for these claims and despite absolutely no change in the underlying facts, Besler increased his demand for \u201creimbursement\u201d from a heady $1,250,000 to the breathtaking sum of $2,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">After making his $2,000,000 \u201creimbursement\u201d demand, Besler lay dormant until he appeared at a meeting of the Board on November 26, 1996. During the public comment portion of that meeting, he \u201cread a [two-page] letter to [B]oard members concerning the committee that was formed to review the rules of conduct of district coaches.\u201d The minutes reflect that, \u201c[b]ased on its makeup, he feels that the committee is biased and would like the [B]oard to investigate the situation further.\u201d A Board member \u201ctold Mr. Besler that the [B]oard would look into the matter.\u201d A review of the letter Besler read shows that he objected to each and every member of that committee: he objected to each Board staff member who was appointed to the committee (because of biases perceived and asserted only by him); he objected to each parent appointed to that committee (because they might have children who wish to play sports); and he objected to each student-athlete appointed to that committee (because \u201c[e]ach one of these students have [sic] some athletic connection with the staff persons they must sit across the table from and make recommendations for\u201d). In short, although no one else objected in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>to the composition of that committee, not a single appointment to that committee was deemed satisfactory to Besler.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">As part of the public comment component of a meeting of the Board held on December 17, 1996, Besler\u2019s wife \u201caddressed the [B]oard concerning the attached letter her husband read at last month\u2019s [BJoard meeting regarding an investigation into the makeup of the committee to review the rules and conduct of district coaches.\u201d In doing so, \u201c[s]he read it again to [B]oard members and requested that the letter be included in the minutes of this evening\u2019s meeting.\u201d It was so included.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On January 21, 1997, at the next meeting of the Board, Besler again appeared and, again during the public comment period, \u201craised a hypothetical question with regard to coaching behavior and how he perceives its relation to parameter # 3 of our Strategic Plan.\u201d The president of the Board \u201ctold Mr. Besler that this issue has been discussed in the past, the [B]oard and administration have already responded to his concerns, and he sees no need to address it again at this time.\u201d That response triggered a letter dated the following day, January 22,1997, from Besler to the high school principal, stating in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">I am deeply offended by your discourteous and unprofessional behavior at the school board meeting on January 21, 1997. Since when is it the responsibility of the high school principal to censor a private citizen to keep him from speaking out on an agenda item at a public meeting? I and the rest of the audience were kind enough to let you present your views regarding agenda items which could have been questioned and disputed publicly. The fact that I was not afforded the same consideration by someone in your position of public trust is outrageous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">I have always felt that although we might disagree on specific points, you shared with my wife and me a common respect for parents and caring for children. Unfortunately, your behavior at the meeting and your handling of the most recent incident has seriously undermined this belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Besler sent copies of that letter to the superintendent of schools, the assistant superintendent of schools and, through a different assistant superintendent of schools who also served as the Board\u2019s secretary, to each member of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>That is the factual predicate that serves as the proper backdrop against which Besler\u2019s nascent First Amendment violation claim must be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On January 28, 1997, Besler again attended a meeting of the Board. As reflected in the minutes, before Besler spoke\u2014but after another member of the public had spoken\u2014the president of the Board \u201ctold the audience that the public comment section of the meeting is not intended for personnel discussions, allegations or insinuations about staff performance or behavior, or to be a forum for personal views, in particular, views on matters under litigation.\u201d He noted that \u201c[w]hen and if that occurs, the chair reserves the right to cut off any discussion of that nature.\u201d The audiotape of the meeting shows that, before Besler was to speak, the president of the Board in fact stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">Before, before I recognize, ah, the next person, let me, let me just, ah, make some clarifications on this public comment section of our meeting. Ah, this section of the meeting is not, ah, intended for personnel discussions of individuals. It is not intended for allegations or insinuations of, of, about staff behavior or, or staff, ah, performance. Ah, it\u2019s for public comment only. Ah, it\u2019s not, ah, to allow people a stage or a forum to present their own personal views, particularly views of litigation, of matters under litigation. So, when those kinds of things occur, ah, the chair reserves the right, ah, to cut off any discussion of that nature. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The president of the Board then acknowledged Besler who, according to the minutes, \u201cagain raised the issue regarding the district policy of prohibiting abusive language on the Internet, as well as one of the parameters within our Strategic Plan regarding non tolerance of behavior which diminishes the dignity, self-worth or safety of any individual.\u201d As the audiotape recording of that meeting discloses, Besler started to read a prepared statement. He read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">A few months ago this Board discussed policy for the use of technology in this district. Specifically, you said that the use of harassing or abusive language or any obscenities on the Internet is strictly prohibited. Last week at the meeting of this Board the District Strategic Plan was introduced. Within the parameters it was stated that, \u201cWe will not tolerate behavior which diminishes the dignity, self-worth, or safety of any individual.\u201d ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>At that point, four raps\u2014presumably of a gavel\u2014are heard and the president of the Board interrupts, stating: \u201cYou\u2019re out of order. We\u2019ve heard those comments before, ah, several times from you and, ah, the Board will not entertain those comments tonight.\u201d Tellingly, Besler does not state that, when he was interrupted, he was not being repetitive; he does not state that he was not speaking of matters that were not the subject of pending litigation threatened by him; and he does not state that he was addressing a topic other than the one he had raised many times before. Instead, he asked only if he could hand out his written comments. In response, the president of the Board stated that Besler could \u201chand out, yes, whatever you have to say, but we\u2019re not going to entertain those comments.\u201d Again, Besler did not protest that he intended to address anything other than the comments he had presented at least seven times before. The president of the Board then solicited \u201cany other comments from the public\u201d and immediately recognized the next speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The entirety of Besler\u2019s written comments in fact were appended to the Board\u2019s minutes for that meeting. The portion of the written statement that was not read aloud stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOi\">My questions to this Board are: Do these guidelines apply to students as well as staff persons employed by this district? Secondly, [d]oes the use of profanity including repeated use of the \u201cF\u201d word constitute abusive language? Lastly, [dloes the use of abusive language repeatedly, diminish the dignity of an individual?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">And, although it has been intimated that the reading of the written statement in full may have marked the end of Besler\u2019s comments, that view is rejected by Besler himself. At trial, in response to his own counsel\u2019s questions, Besler testified that, once he had read his prepared statement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">And then, I was gonna talk about, you know, Jennifer, and all that stuff____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">Q. And if you hadn\u2019t been gaveled, what else would you have talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag3\">A. Well, I wanted to lead into the Jennifer situation. I wanted to be more specific about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">On cross-examination, after confirming that Besler had heard and understood the limitation on the use of the public comment portion of the meeting explained by the Board president, counsel for the Board returned to Besler\u2019s transparently disingenuous theme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Q. Now, the minutes say that a complete copy of your entire comments is attached. You gave him what your comments were going to be and they\u2019re now attached?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">A. Only my comments, not what else I was going to say, but, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">Q. You were going so say more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Q. And you told us today that what you wanted to do is you wanted to again talk about the situation with Jennifer and the coach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">A. Yes, I wanted\u2014did I say coach? I wanted to talk about the situation with Jennifer. I\u2019m not sure I said coach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">Q. And that situation involved the [girls\u2019 basketball coach], did it not? That\u2019s the only situation you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">A. Yes, you could infer that, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">In simpler terms, if Besler had been permitted to continue his comments at the January 28, 1997 Board meeting, he would have acted in a manner entirely consistent with his eight prior appearances before, and several letters to, the Board: he would have launched into yet another tirade against the girls\u2019 basketball head coach.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">In the end, then, in an eight month period, Besler appeared, either directly or by proxy, and spoke on the same topic\u2014his incessant objections to the girls\u2019 basketball head coach\u2014during at least nine separate Board meetings. During that same time period, he sent five separate letters to the Board, again on that same topic. And, he had his counsel send two separate Tort Claims Act notice letters to the Board, demanding first $1,250,000 and then $2,000,000 for \u201creimbursement.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Almost a year later, on January 23, 1998, Besler, his wife and his daughter filed a 31-page, twelve-count complaint against the Board, its superintendent of schools, its high school principal, its girls\u2019 basketball head coach, his wife, and several others. Of these, only the ninth count\u2014where Besler sought damages against only the Board based on the claim that he was prevented from making his desired presentation before the Board on January 28, 1997, thus depriving him of his constitutional right \u201cto speak freely on a subject of public concern\u201d in violation of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983-remains viable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At trial, it was conceded that Besler\u2019s statement had been interrupted; the only issue thus placed before the jury in this respect was whether that interruption was proper. The verdict sheet inquired: had the Board \u201cproved, by a preponderance of the evidence that it interrupted [BeslerJ\u2019s speech for a significant or compelling governmental reason?\u201d The jury\u2019s unanimous verdict was \u201cno.\u201d The jury was then asked if Besler had \u201cproved by a preponderance of the evidence that the restriction upon his freedom of speech caused emotional distress?\u201d The jury unanimously said \u201cyes.\u201d Finally, the jury was asked: \u201cWhat amount of money should be awarded to [Besler] for his pain and suffering resulting from the Board\u2019s restriction upon his freedom of speech?\u201d The jury unanimously awarded $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The trial court denied the Board\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Besler\u2019s Section 1983 claim. On Besler\u2019s application, the trial court modified the jury verdict (1) to award pre-judgment interest, (2) to account for the tax effect of receiving the award and prejudgment interest in a lump sum, and (3) to award counsel fees. The judgment entered awarded Besler the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>tax-effected/enhanced sum of $170,561 in damages, $78,202 in prejudgment interest, and $307,410 in counsel fees and costs, for a grand total of $556,173. Astonishingly, then, Besler was awarded in excess of one-half million dollars in damages, all because he was told he could not\u2014for the ninth time\u2014hijack the public comment portion of a school board meeting to mount his favorite soapbox and rail about an issue over which he already had threatened to file a $2,000,000 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In an unpublished opinion, the Appellate Division affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for recalculation of Besler\u2019s Section 1983 damages. Although it sustained the jury\u2019s liability and damages awards, the panel concluded that \u201cthere is no statutory or other legal basis for an enhanced award for negative tax consequences of non-economic damages.\u201d It proclaimed that, \u201cabsent clear direction from our Supreme Court, we decline to accept the trial judge\u2019s approach and reverse the award of additional tax offset sums to [Besler].\u201d The remand, thus, was exclusively for a \u201cre-calculation of [Besler]\u2019s damages consistent with\u201d the panel\u2019s conclusion in respect of the absence of authority permitting the enhancement of a non-economic damages award to offset for negative tax effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">As noted at the outset, I concur with the majority\u2019s reasoning and conclusion in respect of whether, for purposes of imputing liability pursuant to the federal Civil Rights Act, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the president of the Board had the authority to bind the Board for the infringement of a constitutional right, because, \u201cas a matter of law, [the president of the Board] was the final policymaker for the Board [ ] during the public comment period of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Board meeting\u201d on January 28, 1997. <em>Ante </em>at 568, 993 A2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">That said, I must part company with the majority in respect of both of its subsequent conclusions: that \u201cthis jury rendered a verdict that is sustainable on the evidence!,]\u201d but that the case must be remanded \u201cfor a remittitur of the damages award or, alternatively, for a new trial [because] the damages award is clearly excessive[.]\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 575, 993 A2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">This appeal arises out of the trial court\u2019s denial of the Board\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:40-2(b). In that context, we have explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">Depending on the stage of the trial, three principal motions for judgment are available to the parties: a motion for judgment at the close of plaintiffs case, <em>B. </em>4:37\u20142(b); a motion for judgment at the close all of the evidence, <em>R. </em>4:40-1; and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, <em>R. </em>4:40-2(b). All three are governed by the same evidential standard:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">[I]f, accepting as true all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according him the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\"><em>[Estate of Roach v.

He has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">The Supreme Court of the United States\u2014the final arbiter in respect to this uniquely federal statute\u2014has made clear that \u201cthe first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 suit ... is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right \u2018secured by the Constitution and laws\u2019 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the United States.\u201d <em>Martinez v.

Therefore, as a threshold matter, one must address the nature of the right asserted by Besler to determine whether it is worthy of protection under Section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. I,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and paragraphs 6 and 18 of Article I of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art.

That right reflects \u201ca profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v.

That rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the right to speak freely\u2014-was firmly embedded during the infancy of our national consciousness as an independent nation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the State was to make men free to develop their faculties; and that in its government the deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an end and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law\u2014the argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\"><em>[Whitney v.

It is not\u2014and, in an ordered democracy, cannot be\u2014a license childishly to babble, rant or needlessly offend; limits on that right can and are imposed, as reasonable restrictions on speech remain consonant with the constitutional guarantees. Thus, it consistently has been central to First Amendment jurisprudence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">[t]hat the freedom of speech which is secured by the Constitution does not confer an absolute right to speak, without responsibility, whatever one may choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license giving immunity for every possible use of language and preventing the punishment of those who abuse this freedom; and that a State in the exercise of its police power may punish those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to incite to crime, disturb the public peace, or endanger the foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow by unlawful means, is not open to question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\"><em>[Whitney, supra, </em>274 <em>U.S. </em>at 371, 47 <em>S.Ct </em>at 646-47, 71 <em>L.Ed. </em>1095 (citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds, Brandenburg v.

Before Besler began to speak<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\u2014and given the Board\u2019s familiarity-by-repetition with Besler\u2019s personal crusade\u2014the president of the Board set forth reasonable restrictions on <em>all </em>speakers: that a speaker could not engage in \u201cpersonnel discussions of individuals!];]\u201d that a speaker could not raise \u201callegations or insinuations ... about staff behavior or ... staff ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>performance!;]\u201d and that a speaker could not usurp the public comment period as \u201ca stage or a forum to present their own personal views, particularly views of litigation, of matters under litigation.\u201d <em>All </em>speakers were warned that \u201cwhen those kinds of things occur ... the chair reserves the right ... to cut off any discussion of that nature.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Those restrictions, which are firmly rooted in the now well-settled exceptions to the Open Public Meetings Act, were reasonable in their scope and neutral in their viewpoint. The salient proof of their reasonableness and neutrality lies in the uncontested fact that Besler was permitted to submit his statement in writing to be made part of the minutes\u2014as he had in the past; thus, the restriction imposed was not on the <em>content </em>of Besler\u2019s message, but on the medium of expression. Furthermore, since its adoption in 1975, the Open Public Meetings Act has specifically provided that \u201c[n]othing in this act shall be construed to limit the discretion of a public body to permit, prohibit or regulate the active participation of the public at any meeting!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:4-12(a). <em>See Fuhrmann v. Bd. of Educ. of Borough of Middlesex, </em>93 N.J.A.R.2d (EDU) 416 (N.J.Adm.,1993) (concluding that total prohibition of public comment period at board of education meeting was lawful because \u201cboards of education have the lawful authority, and need the operating flexibility, to regulate public participation at board meetings\u201d). Indeed, if the Open Public Meetings Act vests discretion in a public body to \u201cpermit, prohibit or regulate\u201d the public comment portion of a meeting, how can a restriction that forbids trampling on areas specifically excluded from the Open Public Meetings Act\u2019s reach be unreasonable or fixed on any specific viewpoint?</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>At its core, Besler and, by accepting Ms claim, the majority confuse the fundamental difference between liberty and license. Although our constitutional provisions safeguard our citizens\u2019 liberty to speak freely, that does not mean that citizens have the license to speak as, when and where they choose. The exercise of a right carries with it the obligation to exercise it responsibly. And the prohibitions against curtailing freedom of speech cannot be so trivialized to protect every single expression in a one-man personal vendetta. Confronted with Besler\u2014who continually sought to impose Ms personal animosities and acrimomous views on the Board\u2014and its countervailing obligations to the public, the Board was placed squarely in a quandary: whether to allow Besler selfishly to impose his personal agenda\u2014time and again\u2014on all others, those who both attend and staff those evemng meetings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That is a Hobson\u2019s choice, no choice at all; \u201cfor the presiding officer of a public meeting to allow a speaker to try to hijack the proceedings, or to filibuster them, would impinge on the First Amendment rights of other would-be participants.\u201d <em>Eichenlaub v. Twp. of Indiana, </em>385 <em>F.</em>3d 274, 281 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">When the evidence in this case is viewed in the light most favorable to Besler, and giving him the benefit of all reasonable inferences, one, and only one, conclusion obtains: as a matter of law, the Board\u2019s imposition of reasonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions\u2014not an outright ban\u2014on Besler\u2019s participation during the public comment portion of the Board\u2019s January 28, 1997 meeting was, of necessity, lawful. Therefore, judgment should be entered in the Board\u2019s favor on the mnth and sole remaining count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of Besler\u2019s complaint. To the extent the majority reaches a contrary conclusion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Assuming Besler somehow were to vault the proof obstacles that lie in the way to fixing liability on the Board, his proofs of damages were so insignificant as to be no proof at all. Therefore, even if one were to conclude that Besler has presented a cognizable and actionable violation of his constitutional right to free speech, his failure to present competent proof of injury dooms his cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The majority correctly notes that \u201c[ujnder 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, a constitutional violation, standing alone, does not entitle a plaintiff to compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576, 993 A.2d at 823 (citations omitted). It properly notes that \u201c[a] plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 ease can only recover compensatory damages for a constitutional violation if he proves that he suffered an \u2018actual injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576, 993 A.2d at 823 (citations and footnote omitted). It recognizes that \u201c[ejmotional distress can constitute an actual injury under \u00a7 1983[,]\u201d but that \u201ca plaintiff must show a causal connection between the constitutional violation and the emotional distress\u2014the injury\u201d because \u201c[ejmotional-distress damages are not presumed; they must be proved.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576, 993 A.2d at 824 (citations omitted). Although the majority acknowledges that \u201ccompensatory damages for emotional distress, in the amount awarded here, must be based on more than de minimis mental anguish, or fleeting embarrassment, or mere shock and bewilderment!\u2019,]\u201d <em>ante </em>at 580, 993 A.2d at 826, it fails to identify any specific damages and simply finds the jury award to be \u201cclearly excessive that it constitutes \u2018a miscarriage of justice\u2019 \u201d and that \u201ceven the most generous consideration of the testimony from Besler\u2019s perspective does not support the damages awarded.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 580, 993 A.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Even in the somewhat permissive Section 1983 setting, \u201c[t]he cardinal principle of damages in Anglo-American law is that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>compensation for the injury caused to plaintiff by defendant\u2019s breach of duty.\u201d <em>Carey v.

Focusing on the types of damages Besler asserted here, it is clear that, \u201calthough mental and emotional distress caused by the denial of [a constitutional right] is compensable under \u00a7 1983, ... neither the likelihood of such injury nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as to justify awarding compensatory damages without proof that such injury <em>actually </em>was caused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1052, 55 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 265 (emphasis supplied). Stated differently, \u201c[a] plaintiff in a section 1983 case cannot recover for emotional distress unless he or she presents evidence of \u2018actual injury.\u2019 There is no right to damages other than nominal ones for violation of a constitutional right unless actual injury is proven.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., </em>21 F.3d 29, 34 (3d Cir.1994) (citations omitted). Although, \u201c[i]n light of the purpose of the civil rights laws [there is] no reason to require that a specific type of evidence be introduced to demonstrate injury in the form of emotional distress[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 36, at a minimum there must be proof of \u201cactual injury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The sum total of Besler\u2019s proof of injury in respect of the January 28, 1997 meeting of the Board was as follows: \u201cevery time I came to a board meeting, or back from a board meeting, I mean, I was depressed. There was like-I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I was bewildered. I couldn\u2019t understand it. I was sick to my stomach.\u201d Yet, Besler presented no independent evidence of depression, that he lost sleep, that his work or family life was adversely affected, or that he suffered any cognizable injury causally related to the alleged deprivation of his constitutional rights on January 28,1997.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The operative rule is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201cThe effect on freedom of speech may be small, but since there is no justification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights it need not be great in order to be actionable. Yet even in the field of constitutional torts <em>de minimis non curat lex. </em>Section 1983 is a tort statute. A tort to be actionable requires injury.

However, the Act merely states that the Board may go into private session when discussing such matters. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4\u201412(b) provides that \"[a] public body may exclude the public only from that portion of a meeting at which the public body discusses\" certain matters, such as those pertaining to \"pending or anticipated litigation\" and the employment, evaluation, and discipline of personnel. Nowhere does the Act state that a citizen's voice cannot be heard on personnel or other matters during the time set aside for public comment. Indeed, the public comment period is a time for Board officials to hear grievances from parents and other interested parties, whether those grievances are particular to the treatment of a student or address systemic shortcomings in a school district\u2019s policies. Of course, nothing in the Act requires a board member to respond to remarks made during the public comment session that touch on litigation or personnel matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\"> In accordance with the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-3, before filing their civil complaint in January 1998, the Beslers filed two Notices of Claim with the Board, one on May 22, 1996 and the other on July 24, 1996. Besler addressed the Board on several occasions before and after the filing of these Notices. The Board never attempted to silence Besler on the basis that he had filed these Notices.

That otherwise stellar evaluation was marred and heavily influenced by post-game derogatory comments the coach made in respect of the officiating of the game. The comments published in a local newspaper were: \"Here we are in a sectional final and they assign two bums that can\u2019t handle the game[.] What those two guys did to a group of 15 hard-working girls and a coaching staff of four people was a disgrace and I'm sick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The March 1996 evaluation nevertheless rated the coach with the highest score in eight out of eight categories in organization and management; two of two categories in self-improvement; eight of eight categories in student-staff relations; and four of six categories in personal skills. The evaluation\u2019s written comments describe him as \"a complete coach who cares about every aspect of his programf;]\u201d as one who \"attends league and state meetings [and] runs a camp in the summer and a 4-team league[;]\u201d as one who \u201cwill attend a program to focus his intensity[;]\u201d as one who \"communicate^] his goals and objectives to the players and their parents [and] conducts a pre-season meeting at which he tries to avert problems during the seasonf;]\u201d as one who produces \"a definite improvement in players from the start of the season and the end[;]\u201d as one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\"displays many positive personal skills and can be a complete coach[;]\u201d and as one who \"instructs effectively leading to improvement in basic skills and his teams are a source of pride for the school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The coach's ill-advised post-game comments concerning the championship game officiating ultimately resulted in formal charges before the Controversies Committee of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). For that reason, his evaluation noted that \"[h]e must improve relations with officials and control his intensity on the bench [and that] he will abide by the memo of understanding which is included as part of this evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In the end, however, the catalyst for the sole negative aspects of the evaluation addendum\u2014the coach's post-championship game comments concerning the officials\u2014resulted in \"the most minimal penalty available for a violation of the sportsmanship rule\u201d: the Controversies Committee of the NJSIAA ordered only that the coach \u201cbe placed on a period of probation for the 1996-97 school year, during which appropriate game reports will be filed by [the high school] administration with the NJSIAA.

In respect of the issues presented in this appeal, a school board member is obliged to \"hold confidential all matters pertaining to the schools which, if disclosed, would needlessly injure individuals or the schools.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24.1(g). It goes without saying that Besler\u2019s continuous public airing of his private grievances against the girls\u2019 basketball head coach needlessly injured both the coach and the high school, and the Board would have been required to limit it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\"> No meaningful weight can be placed on the fact that, at the January 28, 1997 Board meeting, another member of the public spoke before the president of the Board explained the limitations on the use of the public comment period immediately before Besler was recognized. The undisputed fact is that, by his repeated harangues, Besler and his pet cause were well known to the Board and, by Besler\u2019s own admission, he intended to bang once again on the same repetitive drum. Therefore, it simply makes common sense that the president of the Board would publish the speech limitations before the person who constantly abused the speech privilege started to speak; it is always best to close the bam door <em>before </em>the horse escapes, and there is no record proof that either of the persons who spoke before Besler did on January 28, 1997 had ever abused that privilege, much less to the extent and frequency Besler had.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> The majority asserts that nothing in the Open Public Meetings Act authorizes a governmental body to restrict public comment by one who has threatened to and taken steps to sue that governmental body. <em>Ante </em>at 574 n. 13, 993 A.2d at 822 n. 13. The notion that a party opponent can abuse the public comment period of a public meeting to rant about something for which he has demanded $2,000,000 in \"reimbursement\" does not merit a response and cheapens the fundamental free speech right at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b676-5\"> Under the Education Law, board of education meetings \"shall be called to commence not later than eight P.M. of the designated day but, if a quorum be not present at the time for which the meeting is called, the member or members present may recess the meeting to a time not later than nine P.M. of said day[.]\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:10-6. As the minutes of the meetings made part of this record reveal, the earliest any of the Board meetings started was 8:00 p.m., and some of them lasted until 11:50 p.m. In those circumstances, allowing one person to monopolize the public comment portion of the meeting is not just discourteous to others, it is plainly unacceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\"> Because Besler's claim of a deprivation of his constitutional rights arose only in respect of being \u201cgaveled down\" on January 28, 1997, none of the other evidence tendered in respect of any of the other interactions Besler had with the Board is causally linked to his substantive claim and, hence, is not relevant. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the contrary, because Besler testified that he reacted to <em>all </em>Board meetings\u2014not just the single one where he claims his constitutional rights were infringed\u2014in exactly the same way, the record lacks any proof whatsoever of damages causally linked to his claimed cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> It is also fundamentally relevant that Besler voluntarily and intentionally thrust himself into this debate, airing publicly\u2014time and again\u2014his minor grievances. In that context, Besler\u2019s tummy-ache or his other vague gastrointes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>final maladies cannot serve as proper damages for a freedom of speech abridgment; Besler's paltry damages claims diminish and devalue the inherent dignity of the right he asserts. <em>See, e.g., Agosto-de-Feliciano v.

In light of his constant and unbridled attacks of others\u2014including an unreasonable, unjustified and unsupported attack on the innocent spouse of Besler\u2019s principal victim\u2014Besler\u2019s overly sensitive attitude towards how he is perceived or how is he deserves to be treated stands in stark contrast.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b681-12\"> The majority\u2019s conclusion that Besler has proven a Section 1983 violation and should be entitled to prove up his damages has a collateral but far more insidious effect: as a \"prevailing party,\u201d Besler may be entitled by statute to \"a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs[.]\" 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1988(b). As the now-reversed-and-remanded judgment shows, the award of attorney's fees was more than three times the amount of base compensatory damages the majority soundly condemned as \"clearly excessive\u201d and \"a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Ironically, all of the litigation subsequent to the entry of the judgment may simply add to that total.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
