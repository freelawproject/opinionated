At trial, defendant sought to challenge the victim\u2019s credibility by offering evidence of hostilities between the victim and victim\u2019s wife and the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter, which, defendant contended, motivated the victim to make false accusations against him. The trial court excluded that evidence as impermissible prior bad acts evidence under OEC 404(3) and as irrelevant. On appeal, defendant contends that evidence that the victim\u2019s wife had called defendant\u2019s stepdaughter a name and then falsely reported to the police that his stepdaughter had pulled out a pellet gun during that encounter was relevant to the victim\u2019s credibility as' a witness and that there was no valid reason to exclude the evidence. We agree, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We take the following facts from the record. The victim and his wife; defendant and his partner; and defendant\u2019s adult stepdaughter (his partner\u2019s daughter), all had homes in the same neighborhood. Defendant had a house 11 driveways down from his stepdaughter\u2019s house, and the victim and his wife\u2019s house was diagonally across the street from the stepdaughter\u2019s house. The victim testified that, one evening, from the stepdaughter\u2019s property, defendant threw rocks and shot a pellet gun at the victim\u2019s house and called the victim and his wife names. The victim called 9-1-1. The police officer who responded to that call testified that, because of safety concerns, he could look only briefly for pellets outside the victim\u2019s house, which he did not find. He did not see a gun when he went to arrest defendant on the stepdaughter\u2019s property, and, because he perceived that it was unsafe, he did not search for one. Although the officer did not actually see defendant throw rocks, he saw rocks landing near the victim\u2019s house and saw defendant with his arm in a throwing position. According to the police officer\u2019s testimony, defendant\u2019s partner was intoxicated, agitated, and \u201chighly confrontational\u201d while the officer was attempting to speak with defendant, and defendant also appeared intoxicated. The officer did not see anyone other than defendant, his partner, and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The victim and the officer were the only witnesses for the prosecution. Defendant did not cross-examine either witness about any bias felt by the victim against defendant. Instead, defendant sought to offer his stepdaughter\u2019s testimony to show that the victim was biased. Defendant told the court that the evidence was relevant \u201cto impeach a witness,\u201d that defendant\u2019s theory was that the \u201caccusations were in part exaggerated or fabricated,\u201d and that he would use the evidence to show \u201cthat this story has been put out there with the intention of causing trouble for [defendant].\u201d The trial court instructed defendant to make an offer of proof and to identify an exception to OEC 404, concerning prior bad acts, that would allow the evidence to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In an offer of proof made after the prosecution rested, the stepdaughter testified about a prior dispute between the victim\u2019s wife and the stepdaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201cI was outside, and [the victim\u2019s wife] started calling me the C word. I can\u2019t remember why because this was a while back. And then all of a sudden there was an accusation about me pulling out a firearm, a pellet gun. And I said that I don\u2019t have one because I don\u2019t believe in having firearms. They\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Defendant\u2019s stepdaughter further testified that, when police responded, she offered to allow them to search her house for a pellet gun, but they declined to do so. Although the stepdaughter did not say when the incident occurred, she did testify that she had lived across the street from the victim for one and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Defendant\u2019s stepdaughter also testified that, during that period, she had had numerous problems with the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of name calling, bad language, threatening. He has threatened to stab me with a screwdriver. He has accosted my roommates when I first moved in to where they were scared and had to call a sheriff; just off-the-wall stuff that whenever I\u2019d drive up my driveway at night, because I work really odd hours, that I\u2019d always get accosted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The stepdaughter testified she had called the police a few times because of the victim\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The prosecution objected to the stepdaughter\u2019s testimony on the basis of OEC 404, and defendant responded that the testimony was admissible under OEC 404(3) to show the victim\u2019s motive for accusing defendant. Defendant argued that the testimony would support the defense theory that the victim was \u201cmotivated by trying to create legal trouble for [defendant] and then has some kind of plan in mind that if he makes an allegation of a gun, then the police are going to be more quick to respond and, in this case, arrest [defendant].\u201d The trial court sustained the objection. The court questioned how the evidence was relevant, stated that extrinsic evidence of a previous false accusation was not admissible, and noted that a principle underlying OEC 404 is avoiding \u201ca trial within a trial about a previous allegation. And in this case it\u2019s not even tied to the defendant[.]\u201d The court reasoned that, to be admissible under OEC 404,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">\u201c[t]he evidence has to be independently relevant for a non-character purpose. The proponent of the evidence has to offer sufficient proof that the uncharged misconduct was committed and that the defendant committed it. And the probative value of the uncharged misconduct must not be substantially outweighed by the dangers or considerations set forth in [OEC] 403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how else to go through this by saying that none of those factors would be established based on the testimony that you\u2019ve elicited thus far. It\u2019s completely absent. You haven\u2019t established sufficient proof that the uncharged misconduct was committed, that in this case you\u2019re \u2014 and again, you\u2019re offering it not for an act by the defendant but by the alleged victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cAnd then the probative value certainly is not outweighed via testimony in \u2014 and I\u2019m only speaking to the testimony here as a previous allegation that the alleged victim made against this witness, not even the defendant, involving a pellet gun. And it\u2019s not relevant yet because there\u2019s no \u2014 -there\u2019s nothing to tie defendant\u2019s knowledge of that at this point to it whatsoever as to this false \u2014 if what you\u2019re trying to \u2014 I understand your theory is that this was a false allegation involving a pellet gun. But none of those factors have been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201cSo I\u2019m sustaining the objection on relevance and also under [OEC] 404 as to all the testimony that was just elicited * * * from this witness during your offer of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Subsequently, defendant offered testimony from two witnesses, his stepdaughter and his partner. Both witnesses testified that they had been sitting with defendant and the stepdaughter\u2019s brother-in-law around the fire pit on the stepdaughter\u2019s property and that defendant and his partner had been drinking some beers. Both witnesses testified that defendant called out, \u201c[victim] is a bitch.\u201d Defendant\u2019s partner testified that defendant did so because the victim\u2019s wife said, \u201cAre you faggots throwing rocks at my house?\u201d and, in a statement unresponsive to a question on cross-examination, because defendant was trying to stick up for his stepdaughter regarding unspecified past problems between the victim and defendant\u2019s stepdaughter. According to defendant\u2019s partner, when the police arrived, he told everyone to go into the house. Defendant\u2019s stepdaughter testified that she went inside and called her grandmother about the incident. Both witnesses testified that they, the brother-in-law, and defendant did not have a pellet gun, and that they did not see defendant throw rocks at the victim\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of menacing and disorderly conduct, and the trial court entered judgment accordingly. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Defendant contends that, under OEC 404(3), the evidence was admissible \u201cto demonstrate that the victim had a motive to lie\u201d and \u201cto complete the picture of the incident.\u201d Defendant also argues that the evidence was relevant to support his theory of the case \u2014 namely, that the victim lied about whether defendant fired a pellet gun. Regarding the balancing required by OEC 403, defendant argues that the testimony had great probative value because it related to the victim\u2019s credibility and that there was little danger of unfair prejudice or confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The state argues that the testimony was inadmissible under OEC 404(3) because a \u201cperson\u201d as used in that rule does not include a witness. In support of its position, the state contends for the first time on appeal that OEC 608(2) provides that a party may not impeach a witness with extrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>evidence of prior bad acts, and so only OEC 608(2) governs the admissibility of \u201cother acts\u201d evidence about a witness. The state also argues that the evidence was not relevant, because the incident was too attenuated and uncertain. Finally, the state contends, the trial court properly excluded the evidence under OEC 403, because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">As noted, the trial court excluded the evidence on the bases of relevance and OEC 404(3). We begin with the question of relevance. We review determinations of relevance for errors of law. <em>State v. Titus, </em>328 Or 475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999). Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Here, defendant offered his stepdaughter\u2019s testimony to show the victim\u2019s bias or partiality, specifically, that the victim and his wife were biased against him and his family and therefore that the facts concerning defendant\u2019s conduct to which the victim testified were less probable. Evidence of a witness\u2019s bias generally is relevant. <em>State v. Haugen, </em>349 Or 174, 193, 243 P3d 31 (2010). Bias may arise in a variety of ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201c \u2018Bias may be evidenced by personal, family, romantic, sexual, or business relationships; by employment or termination of employment by a party; by statements or conduct indicating positive or negative feelings of the witness towards a party; by claims, litigation or settlements between the witness and a party; by prior fights or quarrels; by a party offering to give or a witness offering to receive a bribe; by payment of compensation of any nature by the party to the witness; by granting or promising to grant special advantage or favoritism; by a showing of a motive to curry favor with a party, such as showing that an agreement to grant immunity, recommend leniency, drop another charge or any other concession by a prosecutor or other law enforcement officer to a witness. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 40 at 78-80 (2d ed 1972).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">State <em>v. Brown, </em>299 Or 143, 150, 699 P2d 1122 (1985) (quoting Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>263 (1982)). \u201cTo be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>relevant, evidence introduced to impeach a witness for bias or interest need only have a mere tendency to show the bias or interest of the witness.\u201d <em>State v. Hubbard, </em>297 Or 789, 796, 688 P2d 1311 (1984). Unless there is a reason to exclude relevant evidence, it must be received. <em>Id.; see also </em>OEC 402 (providing that relevant evidence is admissible \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by the Oregon Evidence Code, by the Constitutions of the United States and Oregon, or by Oregon statutory and decisional law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">A party may impeach a witness for bias through evidence of the witness\u2019s relationship with another where the bias resulting from the relationship is a matter of reasonable inference rather than mere speculation. In <em>State v. Knobel, </em>97 Or App 559, 566-67, 777 P2d 985 (1989), <em>rev den, </em>309 Or 522 (1990), the defendant sought to cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s witness, a deputy sheriff, about his awareness that the defendant had written derogatory articles about the sheriff and that the sheriff disliked the defendant and supported pressing charges against him. We concluded that, in light of the employment relationship between the sheriff and the witness, the trial court erred by denying the defendant the opportunity to cross-examine about bias. On the other hand, in <em>State v. Phillips, </em>245 Or App 38, 46, 261 P3d 55 (2011), we concluded that the string of inferences required to support the defendant\u2019s theory of bias simply was too long. There, the defendant sought to offer a video recording of an altercation between himself and a police officer, Kaufman, to impeach the testimony of the arresting officer, Cook, who did not take part in the subsequent altercation. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201c[DJefendant offered no evidence to establish any motive on the part of Cook to he to protect Kaufman beyond the mere fact that both were police officers. Indeed, defendant\u2019s theory of bias was broader still. Defense counsel argued to the trial court that Cook\u2019s actions as shown on the video \u2018shows that the Hillsboro Police Department was out to \u2014 not to be fair to my client, was out to get him.\u2019 As we recognized in <em>State v. Harberts, </em>198 Or App 546, 561, 108 P3d 1201 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 80 (2006), when evaluating the relevance of evidence proffered to show the bias of a witness, reasonable inferences are permissible but \u2018speculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>* * * is not.\u2019 Here, the string of inferences defendant would have us unwind is simply too long.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">245 Or App at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Here, defendant offered evidence of the victim\u2019s wife\u2019s previous dispute with defendant\u2019s stepdaughter to show that the victim, at the time of the charged crimes, had a motive to make a false report about defendant. Although some inferences are required to connect that previous dispute to the victim\u2019s attitude toward defendant, the inferences are permissible. A jury could reasonably infer that, in light of the familial relationships among the persons involved \u2014 that is, between the victim and his wife and between defendant and his stepdaughter \u2014 that the victim had reason to be biased against defendant. From that, a jury could infer that the victim\u2019s account was less credible than it would have been in the absence of evidence of the earlier dispute. Defendant\u2019s proffered evidence had at least a \u201ctendency to show the bias or interest of the witness,\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 796, and thus was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We next consider whether the trial court properly excluded the evidence under OEC 404(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">We initially reject the state\u2019s argument that OEC 404(3) is limited to evidence concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s conduct. Given a permissible purpose, a criminal defendant can \u201cintroduce evidence of other crimes or wrongful acts \u2014 for example, by a victim, codefendant, or other suspect \u2014 under OEC 404(3).\u201d <em>State v. Moore/Coen, </em>349 Or 371, 390, 245 P3d 101 (2010), <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 131 S Ct 2461 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Rule 404(3), though, \u201cprecludes the admission of evidence of a person\u2019s prior \u2018crimes, wrongs or acts\u2019 to prove the character of that person to show that he or she later acted in conformity with them.\u201d <em>State v. Hale, </em>335 Or 612, 623, 75 P3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>448 (2003), <em>cert den, </em>541 US 942 (2004). In <em>Hale, </em>the defendant contended that another person, Susbauer, was the perpetrator of the charged crimes, and the defendant proffered evidence that Susbauer was stopped and ordered by police to lie face down on the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 622. The defendant argued that the evidence would help establish that Susbauer committed the crimes at issue, because the perpetrator of those crimes had ordered the male victims to lie face down on the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 622. The Supreme Court concluded that the evidence was not subject to analysis under OEC 404(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">\u201cThe fact that a police officer once ordered Susbauer to lie face down is not itself a \u2018crime\u2019 or a \u2018wrong\u2019 or an \u2018act\u2019 <em>of Susbauer\u2019s, </em>and we cannot see how it would tend to prove Susbauer\u2019s character in any event. More importantly, defendant did not attempt to establish that Susbauer acted in conformity with <em>his own prior act </em>of lying face down. The proffered evidence does not fit within any category of what is known as \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence under OEC 404(3), and that rule does not provide a basis for excluding it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 623 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Similarly, here, the proffered evidence concerned another crime, wrong, or act by the victim\u2019s wife, but it was not offered to show that the victim\u2019s wife acted in conformity with her prior act. Rather, the evidence of her prior act of falsely accusing the stepdaughter of criminal conduct and of her hostility towards the stepdaughter was offered to show the motive for the <em>victim\u2019s </em>accusation that defendant shot the victim\u2019s house with a pellet gun. Thus, OEC 404(3)\u2019s prohibition on the admission of evidence to show a general \u201cpropensity\u2019 by a person \u2014 in this case, the victim witness \u2014 to commit certain acts because of other conduct that person has committed did not provide a basis for excluding the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The state further argues that the evidence was properly excluded under OEC 403, which provides, \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did not and, under the circumstances, could not exclude the evidence under OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The trial court briefly referred to OEC 403 before it then went on to explain why it was excluding the evidence based on OEC 404(3) and relevance. The court did not state that it was excluding the evidence based on OEC 403, and the court did not place on the record any analysis of the balancing test used under OEC 403. <em>See State v. Mayfield, </em>302 Or 631, 645, 733 P2d 438 (1987) (setting out steps required in analyzing an OEC 403 objection). In any event, a trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence under OEC 403 does not extend to \u201cexclusion of an initial showing, by relevant evidence, of sufficient facts from which the bias or interest of a witness may be inferred.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Here, the victim\u2019s testimony suggested a circumstance of aggression by defendant. Defendant offered his stepdaughter\u2019s testimony to show a bias that the victim had against defendant given the level of hostility between the victim\u2019s wife and his stepdaughter, and with the exclusion of the evidence, that bias eluded the jury\u2019s attention. This is not a case in which the victim\u2019s alleged bias against defendant was apparent from the other evidence at trial. <em>Cf. State v. Fish, </em>239 Or App 1, 7-8, 243 P3d 873 (2010) (where the defendant was accused of assaulting victim during brawl and the defendant and victim were strangers to each other before brawl, evidence that the defendant later made angry comment about victim was not initial showing of bias; the defendant\u2019s and victim\u2019s adversarial positions were apparent). When the trial court excluded the stepdaughter\u2019s proffered evidence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the beginning of defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, there had been no other showing of the victim\u2019s bias.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 798, the trial court could not have excluded the evidence of the victim\u2019s bias on the basis of OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The state offers no argument that, if the trial court erred by excluding the evidence, the error was harmless, nor does our review of the record persuade us that the error was harmless. When an error results in the exclusion of bias evidence, the error is harmless if either \u201c(1) despite the exclusion, the jury nonetheless had an adequate opportunity to assess [the witness\u2019s] credibility; or (2) [the witness\u2019s] credibility was not important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Titus, </em>328 Or at 482. Given the differences between the victim\u2019s testimony and the testimony of defendant\u2019s stepdaughter and partner concerning what happened that evening and the importance of the victim\u2019s credibility to the prosecution\u2019s case; the offered testimony of defendant\u2019s stepdaughter describing a specific incident and a level of animosity between her and the victim\u2019s wife that included wife\u2019s willingness to make a false report to the police; and the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard testimony by defendant\u2019s partner, we conclude that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> On appeal, defendant does not assign error to the exclusion of his stepdaughter\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s past conduct toward her; he challenges only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>exclusion of the testimony about the victim\u2019s wife\u2019s accusation regarding the pellet gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> As noted, the state indirectly suggests for the first time that the evidence was inadmissible under OEC 608(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">\u201cSpecific instances of <em>the conduct of a witness, </em>for the purpose of attacking or supporting <em>the credibility of the witness, </em>other than conviction of crime as provided in ORS 40.355, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. Further, such specific instances of conduct may not, even if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, he inquired into on cross-examination of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">(Emphasis added.) The state does not argue that we should affirm based on the application of OEC 608(2), under the rule in <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (setting out requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>for \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d analysis). We accordingly do not decide whether OEC 608(2) applies in this instance, but we note that the Supreme Court has said that evidence of a motive to lie at trial or bias on the part of a witness is not evidence of character for truthfulness for purposes of OEC 608(1). <em>State v. Carr, </em>302 Or 20, 26-27, 725 P2d 1287 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> After the stepdaughter testified, defendant\u2019s partner testified.
