J.</author>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In 1995, Douglas County approved the establishment of an \u201cowner of record\u201d dwelling on the property of petitioners Philip and Cynthia Bowes (the Boweses). Over the next 15 years, the Boweses requested, and the county granted, 14 extensions of the original approval. In 2010, respondents, several neighboring property owners (the neighbors), appealed five of the county\u2019s extension deci<em>sions </em>\u2014 viz., the 1997,1998,1999, 2000, and 2002 decisions\u2014 to LUBA. LUBA dismissed those appeals for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that, under the plain terms of OAR 660-033-0140(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the extension decisions were not land use decisions. The neighbors seek judicial review of LUBA\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On review, the neighbors challenge the propriety of LUBA\u2019s dismissal of the appeals concerning the five extension decisions. Conversely, the Boweses move to dismiss this judicial review as it pertains to four of the five extension deci<em>sions </em>\u2014 viz., the 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 extension decisions \u2014 in light of House Bill (HB) 3166 (2011), which was enacted during the pendency of this review proceeding and retroactively imposed a 10-year statute of repose on the appeal of certain land use decisions, and contend that LUBA properly dismissed the neighbors\u2019 appeal of the fifth (2002) extension decision. Alternatively, the Boweses assert that, even if HB 3166 is inapposite, LUBA properly dismissed the neighbors\u2019 appeals of all five extension decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">For the reasons expressed in <em>Jones v. Douglas County (A148618), </em>247 Or App 56, 68, 270 P3d 264 (2011) <em>(Jones I), </em>we reject the Boweses\u2019 first argument and deny their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction as it pertains to the first four extensions. However, as amplified below, we agree with the Boweses\u2019 alternative argument. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>we affirm LUBA\u2019s dismissal of the neighbors\u2019 appeals of all five extension decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">We take the material facts from our decision in <em>Jones I. </em>The Boweses acquired their property on June 22, 1995 \u2014 the day after the county approved the prior owner\u2019s request for a \u201clot-of-record\u201d dwelling. Specifically, the county\u2019s decision stated, in pertinent part, that the lot-of-record</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201c \u2018approval will become invalid without special action if the conditions of approval have not been met within two (2) years from the date of the decision! \u2014 that is, June 21,1995], An extension of up to twelve (12) months may be granted by the Director upon request of the applicant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\"><em>Jones I, </em>247 Or App at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">During the next two years, the Boweses did not attempt to satisfy the conditions of approval because Philip Bowes was serving in the military and the Boweses were apparently away from Oregon.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cOn June 17, 1997 \u2014 four days before the June 21 expiration of the 1995 approval \u2014 the county sent the Boweses a letter indicating that the approval would soon expire and that they could request a 12-month extension on the attached form by June 27. Ultimately, the Boweses submitted a request for an extension, which was dated June 24. The county extended the approval for a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">\u201cSimilarly, each year thereafter from 1998 through 2010, the Boweses submitted a request for, and the county approved, a one-year extension. In addition to the 1997 request, the 1998,1999,2000, and 2002 requests, were submitted after the [approval\u2019s] annual June 21 expiration date. However, the Boweses timely requested an extension in 2010, which the county approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 60-61 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">On October 25,2010, the neighbors filed six separate appeals with LUBA, which LUBA consolidated by order. \u201cThe first concerned the 1995 lot-of-record approval. Each of the remaining five appeals concerned a particular extension that was requested after the approval\u2019s annual June 21 expiration <em>date </em>\u2014 viz., the 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>extensions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 61. Ultimately, as noted, LUBA dismissed those five appeals, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because, under OAR 660-033-0140(3), the predicate extension decisions were not land use decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Before recounting LUBA\u2019s rationale and the substance of the parties\u2019 contentions as to LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction, some context, providing statutory and regulatory orientation, is essential. We begin with the operative statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Under ORS 197.825(1), LUBA has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review any land use decision * * * of a local government[.]\u201d Among other things, a \u201cland use decision\u201d is \u201c[a] final decision or determination made by a local government * * * that concerns the adoption, amendment or application of\u2019 a \u201cland use regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 197.015(10)(a)(A)(iii). However, there are a variety of exclusions to that definition. ORS 197.015(10)(b) - (e). For example, a \u201cland use decision\u201d does <em>not </em>include a local government decision \u201c[t]hat is made under land use standards that do not require interpretation or the exercise of policy or legal judgment[.]\u201d ORS 197.015(10)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Against that statutory backdrop, the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) promulgated OAR 660-033-0140. That rule implements Statewide Planning Goal 3, concerning agricultural land, as well as ORS 197.015. In its entirety, OAR 660-033-0140 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201c(1) Except as provided for in section (5) of this rule, a discretionary decision, except for a land division, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>after the effective date of this division approving a proposed development on agricultural or forest land outside an urban growth boundary under ORS 215.010 to 215.293 and 215.317 to 215.438 or under county legislation or regulation adopted pursuant thereto is void two years from the date of the final decision if the development action is not initiated in that period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">\u201c(2) A county may grant one extension period of up to 12 months if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201c(a) An applicant makes a written request for an extension of the development approval period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201c(b) The request is submitted to the county prior to the expiration of the approval period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201c(c) The applicant states reasons that prevented the applicant from beginning or continuing development within the approval period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u201c(d) The county determines that the applicant was unable to begin or continue development during the approval period for reasons for which the applicant was not responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">\u201c(3) <em>Approval of an extension granted under this rule is an administrative decision, is not a land use decision as described in ORS 197.015 and is not subject to appeal as a land use decision.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">\u201c(4) Additional one-year extensions may be authorized where applicable criteria for the decision have not changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">\u201c(5)(a) If a permit is approved for a proposed residential development on agricultural or forest land outside of an urban growth boundary, the permit shall be valid for four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">\u201c(b) An extension of a permit described in subsection (5)(a) of this rule shall be valid for two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">\u201c(6) For the purposes of section (5) of this rule, \u2018residential development\u2019 only includes the dwellings provided for under ORS 215.213(l)(q), (3) and (4), 215.283(l)(p), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>215.284, 215.705(1) to (3), 215.720, 215.740, 215.750 and 215.755(1) and (3).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">(Emphasis and boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In light of that statutory and regulatory framework, we return to the parties\u2019 positions before LUBA. For their part, the neighbors contended that both the initial 1995 approval and the five challenged extensions were land use decisions within LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction. The neighbors further contended that the extensions were invalid because they failed to satisfy the requirements of OAR 660-033-0140 and, as a consequence, could not effectively extend the expiration date of the 1995 approval.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">More specifically, with respect to jurisdiction, the neighbors initially contended that the original 1995 approval and the challenged extensions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201care land use decisions over which LUBA has jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 197.825(1) because they are final decisions by a local government that concern the application of the statewide planning goals, the county comprehensive plan, and the county land use regulations and that require interpretation or exercise of policy or legal judgment, within the meaning of ORS 197.015(10).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In other words and as pertinent here, the neighbors posited that the extension decisions were not excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d because they were not \u201cmade under land use standards that do not require interpretation or the exercise of policy or legal judgment[.]\u201d ORS 197.015(10)(b)(A). Further, the neighbors noted that, although OAR 660-033-0140(3) provides that \u201can extension decision granted under LUDO 2.800 or OAR 660-033-0140 is not a land use decision and is not subject to appeal,\u201d LUBA\u2019s prior decisions indicated that permit extensions \u2014 such as the extensions in this case \u2014 are \u201cland use decisions\u201d over which LUBA has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">During the course of the LUBA proceeding, the neighbors refined their position with respect to LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction. Specifically, the neighbors explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201c[We] are willing to concede that an extension properly granted under [OAR 660-033-0140] is not a land use decision, as provided in [OAR 660-033-0140(3)]. An extension validly granted is really of no concern to the neighbors, the general public, or the county body. The approval standards for the original permit were shown to be complied with during the original proceedings (presumably; not the case here). The extension procedure, when followed, is quite ministerial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cThe problem occurs when the extension procedure of [OAR 660-033-0140] is not followed. [OAR 660-033-0140] does not authorize the county to grant an extension after the permit has expired. When the county attempts to do so, its authority does not derive from [OAR 660-033-0140]. It is acting without authority. [The Boweses] have cited no statute, rule, or case (other than LUDO 2.800 and its DLCD rule analogue) which would provide the county with extension authority; and [we] assert there is no such extension authority other than those, of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cThe county did not follow [OAR 660-033-0140] in extending the permit in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, or 2002. Because those extensions were unlawful, they did not operate to extend the permit\u2019s approval period, which therefore lapsed. Accordingly, the permit became void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>To summarize, the gravamen of the neighbors\u2019jurisdictional position before LUBA was that the county\u2019s extension decisions were not granted \u201cunder\u201d OAR 660-033-0140\u2014 and, for that reason, the jurisdictional limitation of OAR 660-033-0140(3) was inapposite. More particularly, as we understand it, the neighbors contended that, when a local government\u2019s approval of an extension satisfies the requirements of OAR 660-033-0140 \u2014 in other words, when approval is in compliance with the requirements of the rule \u2014 the extension is granted \u201cunder\u201d the rule and is \u201cnot a land use decision\u201d as OAR 660-033-0140(3) provides. Conversely, the neighbors contended that, when a local government\u2019s approval of an extension is not in compliance with the requirements of the rule \u2014 as occurred here \u2014 the extension is <em>not </em>granted \u201cunder\u201d the rule and, for that reason, OAR 660-033-0140(3) does not apply and the decision may be appealed to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In response, the Boweses asserted that LUBA lacked jurisdiction for three reasons: (1) LUDO 2.800 and OAR 660-033-0140(3) both \u201cmake clear that these extensions are not land use decisions or otherwise appealable to LUBA\u201d; (2) the neighbors failed to timely appeal the extensions; and (3) the appeals were moot. In addition, the Boweses contended that, because the appeals concerned extensions of an original approval that was more than 15 years old, LUBA was required to dismiss the appeals either under the equitable doctrine of laches or under ORS 12.140, which provides that \u201c[a]n action for any cause not otherwise provided for shall be commenced within 10 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">LUBA rejected the Boweses\u2019 contentions concerning the timeliness of the appeals, mootness, the doctrine of laches, and ORS 12.140. However, LUBA agreed with the Boweses that, under OAR 660-033-0140(3), the extension decisions were not land use decisions subject to its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In addressing the applicability of OAR 660-033-0140(3), LUBA began by distinguishing several of its prior opinions in which it had addressed the nature of an extension decision. LUBA explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\u201c[i]n each of [those] cases we either held or there was no dispute that the challenged permit extension decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>both a land use decision subject to LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction under ORS 197.015(10), and a discretionary \u2018permit\u2019 decision for purposes of ORS 215.402 and the corresponding statute applicable to cities. * * * However, it is important to note that none of [those decisions] appear[s] to involve extensions of permits for development on farm or forest land, or otherwise did not involve circumstances controlled by OAR 660-033-0140.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">\u201cOur reasoning in the above cases, if extended to permit extensions on farm or forest land under OAR 660-033-0140, would directly conflict with OAR 660-033-0140(3), which as noted provides that a permit extension under the rule is \u2018not a land use decision as described in ORS 197.015 and is not subject to appeal as a land use decision.\u2019 * * * OAR 660-033-0140(3) possibly represents LCDC\u2019s interpretation of the ORS 197.015(10) definition of\u2018land use decision\u2019 or one of the exclusions to that definition, at ORS 197.015(10)(b). Or possibly it represents the creation of an additional exclusion, independent from those set out in the statute. LCDC has general statutory authority to \u2018adopt rules that it considers necessary to carry out ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197.\u2019 ORS 197.040(l)(b). LCDC also has broad statutory authority to adopt rules regarding use of farm and forest lands. <em>See generally Lane County v. LCDC, </em>325 Or 569, 942 P2d 278 (1997). Petitioners do not argue that OAR 660-033-0140(3) exceeds LCDC\u2019s authority, or is inconsistent with any statute, and we express no opinion in that regard. Because petitioners offer no basis for concluding that OAR 660-033-0140(3) does not control the present circumstances, we apply and give effect to the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">LUBA concluded that, \u201c[u]nder the plain terms of OAR 660-033-0140(3), a decision extending a permit decision on agricultural or forest land is not a \u2018land use decision\u2019 as defined in ORS 197.015 and therefore is not subject to LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d The implicit, but necessary, predicate of LUBA\u2019s holding is that, regardless of any asserted noncompliance with OAR 660-033-0140, the extensions in this case were granted \u201cunder\u201d OAR 660-033-0140 in that that rule was the purported source of authority for the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On judicial review of the ensuing order of dismissal, the neighbors\u2019 primary contention is that, because the county did not comply with the requisites of OAR 660-033-0140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>when it made the challenged extension decisions, those decisions were not \u201cgranted under [that] rule,\u201d OAR 660-033-0140(3), and, thus, are not subject to subsection (3)\u2019s jurisdictional limitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Conversely, as we understand it, the Boweses contend that LUBA correctly concluded that the extension decisions were granted \u201cunder\u201d OAR 660-033-0140 and, as a consequence, those decisions were not land use decisions because OAR 660-033-0140(3) explicitly so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">As so framed, we understand the parties\u2019 competing contentions to reduce to a single dispositive interpretive issue: For purposes of OAR 660-033-0140(3), were the approvals of the challenged extensions granted \u201cunder\u201d OAR 660-033-0140? In resolving that question our inquiry is straightforward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cIn interpreting an administrative rule, our objective is to determine the intent of the body that promulgated the rule. <em>State v. Papineau, </em>228 Or App 308, 311, 208 P3d 500, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009). To make that determination, we examine the text of the rule, in context. <em>Id.; see Abu-Adas v. Employment Dept., </em>325 Or 480, 485, 940 P2d 1219 (1997) (in interpreting administrative rules, the court uses the same methodology as it does in interpreting statutes); <em>see also PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 612 n 4, 859 P2d 114[3] (1993); <em>ODOT v. City of Klamath Falls, </em>177 Or App 1, 8, 34 P3d 667 (2001). \u2018Context includes other provisions of the same rule, other related rules, the statute pursuant to which the rule was created, and other related statutes.\u2019 <em>Abu-Adas, </em>325 Or at 485.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\"><em>Willamette Oaks, LLC v. City of Eugene, </em>232 Or App 29, 33-34, 220 P3d 445 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We begin with the meaning of the word \u201cunder.\u201d Although, generally, the term \u201cunder\u201d means \u201cin accordance with,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2487 (unabridged ed 2002), in the legal context, the term \u201cunder\u201d is often used in lieu of the term \u201cpursuant to.\u201d <em>See </em>Bryan A. Garner, <em>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage </em>896 (2d ed 1995) (the term \u201cunder is preferable to <em>pursuant to </em>when the noun that follows refers to a rule, statute, contractual provision, or the like\u201d (boldface omitted; emphasis in original)). In turn and as pertinent here, \u201cpursuant to\u201d means either \u201c[i]n compliance with; in accordance with; under\u201d or \u201c[a]s authorized by; under.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1272 (8th ed 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">As noted, the neighbors essentially contend that, for purposes of OAR 660-033-0140(3), \u201cunder\u201d must mean \u201cin compliance with\u201d or \u201cin accordance with,\u201d while LUBA necessarily interpreted the term to mean \u201cas authorized by.\u201d For the reasons explained below, when viewed in the context of the rule as a whole, we agree with LUBA that \u201cunder,\u201d as used in OAR 660-033-0140(3), means \u201cas authorized by.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 96, 26`1 P3d 1234 (2011) (\u201cIn construing statutes, we do not simply consult dictionaries and interpret words in a vacuum. Dictionaries, after all, do not tell us what words mean, only what words <em>can </em>mean, depending on their context and the particular manner in which they are used.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Here, the parties agree that, in the overarching context of OAR 660-033-0140, subsection (3) operates as a limitation on LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction to review extension decisions; their dispute centers on the <em>scope </em>of that limitation. The difficulty with the neighbors\u2019 proposed <em>construction </em>\u2014 viz., that an extension is \u201cunder\u201d OAR 660-033-0140 only so long as the local government complies with the rule \u2014 is that it would render subsection (3) a functional nullity. That is so because, in every appeal in which an extension decision was challenged, LUBA, to determine whether it had jurisdiction over the appeal, would be required, as a practical matter, to first assess the procedural and substantive propriety of the extension decision. If the extension decision comported with the requisites of OAR 660-033-0140, then (in the neighbors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>view), LUBA would not have jurisdiction because the extension was \u201cunder\u201d the rule; conversely, if the extension decision did not comport with the requisites of the rule, then (again, in the neighbors\u2019 view), LUBA would have jurisdiction because the extension was not \u201cunder\u201d the rule. Bluntly: in every appeal, LUBA, to determine its jurisdiction, would be required to review and decide the merits of the appeal. The jurisdictional limitation would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Like LUBA, we reject that construction of subsection (3) \u2014 and the term \u201cunder\u201d specifically \u2014 as implausible. Rather, and consistently with subsection (3)\u2019s patent purpose of limiting LUBA\u2019s review of extension decisions, \u201cunder\u201d is properly understood to mean \u201cas authorized by.\u201d That is, so long as the local government has purported to allow an extension under the authority of OAR 660-033-0140, subsection (3) operates to preempt LUBA review.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Here, it is undisputed that OAR 660-033-0140 \u2014 as implemented in the county code \u2014 was the source of the county\u2019s authority to grant extensions concerning the original 1995 lot-of-record approval. That is so even though the county erroneously exercised that authority by granting untimely extension requests in contravention of the requirements of the rule. Stated differently, although the extensions resulted from the county\u2019s erroneous exercise of its authority, the extensions, nevertheless, were granted \u201cunder\u201d the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In sum, we conclude that, because the challenged extensions were granted under OAR 660-033-0140, they were not land use decisions subject to LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction. OAR 660-033-0140(3).\u00ae Accordingly, we affirm LUBA\u2019s dismissal of the appeals concerning the challenged extensions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Motion to dismiss denied.

LUBA\u2019s remand of the appeal concerning the original approval is the subject of a separate review proceed<em>ing </em>\u2014 Jones <em>v. Douglas County (A148618), </em>247 Or App 56, 270 P3d 264 (2011) <em>(Jones </em>I) \u2014 which we describe more fully below. 247 Or App at 86 n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\"> As previously indicated, 247 Or App at 84 n 2, LUBA\u2019s ultimate resolution of the appeal concerning the 1995 approval is the subject our decision in <em>Jones I. </em>In that case, we held that HB 3166 imposed a 10-year statute of repose that retroactively deprived LUBA of jurisdiction over the appeal of the 1995 approval. 247 Or App at 61. For that reason, we remanded LUBA\u2019s order with instructions that LUBA vacate the portion of that order concerning the 1995 approval and dismiss the appeal of that approval. Accordingly, because this judicial review proceeding concerns only the county\u2019s extension decisions, our discussion of the pertinent procedural history, as well as our analysis and ultimate disposition, concern only those decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\"> In turn, a \u201cland use regulation\u201d is defined as \u201cany local government zoning ordinance, land division ordinance adopted under ORS 92.044 or 92.046 or similar general ordinance establishing standards for implementing a comprehensive plan.\u201d ORS 197.015(11).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> As LUBA explained, \u201c[i]n 2001, the legislature adopted a statute, ORS 215.417, providing that extensions of approvals for residential development in resource zones, including lot-of-record dwellings, shall be valid for two years, instead of the one year extension that would otherwise apply under OAR 660-033-0140(2).\u201d That development is reflected in subsections (5) and (6), which were added to the rule in May 2002. Because the duration of each of the extensions challenged in this case is not material to our analysis and disposition, we refer to the current version of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Further, at all pertinent times, Douglas County Land Use and Development Ordinance (LUDO) 2.800 essentially mirrored OAR 660-033-0140. Apparently for that reason, LUBA referred to the administrative rule rather than the corresponding provisions of the county\u2019s development ordinance, as do the parties on review. For convenient reference, so do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b110-13\"> In particular, the neighbors asserted that (1) each extension request was untimely because it was submitted after the approval\u2019s annual June 21 expiration date, OAR 660-033-0140(2)(b); (2) each extension did not include a county determination that the Boweses were unable to begin or continue development for reasons for which they were not responsible, OAR 660-033-0140(2)(d); and (3) the 1999 extension was granted even though the applicable criteria concerning a lot-of-record dwelling approval had changed, OAR 660-033-0140(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> Alternatively, the neighbors contend that, if the extension decisions are not land use decisions under OAR 660-033-0140(3), OAR 660-033-0140 is invalid because it \u201cpurports to modify LUBA\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction by removing such cases from the review jurisdiction, namely, by defining extension decisions to be outside the statutory definition of land use decisions.\u201d However, as the Boweses and LUBA correctly noted, that contention was not preserved. Accordingly, we do not address it. <em>See Hammer v.
