J.</author>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Defendant appeals from his conviction for one count of menacing, ORS 163.190,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of second-degree disorderly conduct, ORS 166.025,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> raising two assignments of error. We reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error without discussion. In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of the victim\u2019s neighbor that she had heard the victim say that \u201cthe Mexicans are taking all the jobs.\u201d Defendant sought admission of that statement to show the victim\u2019s bias toward defendant, who is Hispanic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that defendant had failed to establish an adequate foundation showing that the statement was probative of such bias and therefore excluded the testimony. We affirm on the ground that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Because defendant was convicted after a jury trial, we state the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>342 Or 596, 598, 157 P3d 198 (2007), <em>cert den, </em>552 US 1113 (2008). However, when we evaluate whether the erroneous admission of evidence was <em>harmless, </em>we \u201creview all pertinent portions of the record, not just those portions most favorable to the state.\u201d <em>State v. Maiden, </em>222 Or App 9, 11, 191 P3d 803 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 618 (2009). Defendant and the victim lived in the same apartment complex, and, on the day that defendant committed the charged crimes, the victim had just returned home with his family when defendant confronted him in the parking lot of the complex. Defendant loudly asked the victim several times if the victim had called the defendant\u2019s son \u201ca dirty [expletive] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Mexican.\u201d The victim denied having done so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant told the victim that he was going to \u201ckick [his] ass\u201d and \u201c[expletive] kill him,\u201d and \u201cgut him like a fish.\u201d Defendant also motioned toward the victim and made lunging gestures toward him. The victim began to retreat toward his apartment; defendant followed him for a short distance and then stopped. The victim called the police, and defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Defendant was indicted for one count of menacing and one count of second-degree disorderly conduct. At trial, after the victim testified about the confrontation, defense counsel cross-examined the victim about his attitude toward Mexicans. Defense counsel asked the victim whether he had ever used racial slurs against Mexicans or was concerned about \u201cillegal immigrants taking other people\u2019s jobs.\u201d The victim denied ever using racial slurs, and he denied having any concern about illegal immigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Defendant called the victim\u2019s neighbor, Aspria, to testify about the victim\u2019s bias. Aspria testified that she had witnessed the confrontation between the victim and defendant and that, when the victim had returned to his apartment, he had slammed the door and said \u201c[expletive] Mexican.\u201d Defendant also proffered two other statements made by the victim to show his bias under OEC 609-1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Outside the presence of the jury, Aspria testified that she had observed the victim building a fence in his backyard and, when she had asked him what the fence was for, he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m putting the fence up to keep \u2014 keeping Mexicans out of my yard.\u201d Aspria also testified that she had once overheard the victim\u2019s side of a telephone conversation in which the victim had said that \u201cthe Mexicans are taking all the jobs.\u201d Aspria testified that the victim had \u201cseemed a little angry\u201d when he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that statement. The trial court asked Aspria if she had heard the other side of the telephone conversation, and she said that she had not. The trial court also asked Aspria if she thought that the victim\u2019s use of the term \u201cMexicans\u201d had been derogatory, and she said that she did think so, \u201cbecause of the tone of his voice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">The trial court admitted into evidence the statement about the fence, but it excluded the statement that \u201cthe Mexicans are taking all the jobs.\u201d As the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201c[i]n regards to the Mexicans are taking the jobs, I don\u2019t feel that the court [inaudible] enough information and since we don\u2019t have the other part of that conversation for the court to get it in a context of whether he was using that term in any kind of a negative or derogatory manner, maybe just [inaudible] stating it back that some Mexicans are [taking] jobs and that\u2019s what it is, but not necessarily in a derogatory manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Defendant was convicted by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in excluding the victim\u2019s statement, as relayed by Aspria, that \u201cthe Mexicans are taking all the jobs,\u201d because \u201cdefendant [had] laid a sufficient foundation to have the evidence go to the jury.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, any ambiguity that might have inhered in the victim\u2019s statement was clarified when evidence of the victim\u2019s other statements was admitted and, although the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the victim\u2019s statement as not necessarily derogatory was plausible, \u201cdefendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statement is even more likely.\u201d The error was not harmless, defendant argues, because \u201cthe main evidence against defendant was the account of [the victim] and his wife,\u201d and the jury\u2019s \u201cbelief in [the victim\u2019s] testimony could have been different if it had been presented with more evidence of [the victim\u2019s] bias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The state replies that the trial court did not err because defendant failed to lay an adequate foundation \u201cby eliciting from the witness (even if it was possible) more circumstances of the statement that would indicate the victim\u2019s racial bias.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, the court\u2019s exclusion of the statement was within its discretion because the statements that were admitted had been sufficient to make the \u201cinitial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>showing\u201d of the victim\u2019s bias under <em>State v. Hubbard, </em>297 Or 789, 798, 688 P2d 1311 (1984), and that, accordingly, exclusion of the statement was proper under OEC 403<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the statement would have been cumulative to the other statements relevant to the victim\u2019s bias. The state also asserts that the victim\u2019s bias was apparent from the totality of the circumstances \u2014 that is, that defendant had confronted the victim because of the victim\u2019s alleged racial slur toward defendant\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">We review the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for errors of law. <em>State v. Arellano, </em>149 Or App 86, 90, 941 P2d 1089, <em>rev dismissed, </em>327 Or 555 (1998). Evidentiary error is not presumed to be harmful, OEC 103(1), and, thus, we must affirm defendant\u2019s conviction if \u201cthere [is] little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">As an initial matter, the state\u2019s reliance <em>on Hubbard </em>is misplaced because the trial court did not exclude the victim\u2019s statement under OEC 403. As explained above, the trial court did not exclude the victim\u2019s statement because it was cumulative of the other evidence of bias that defendant elicited from Aspria; rather, the court excluded the statement on the ground that defendant had failed to lay an adequate foundation showing that the statement was relevant for bias at all. We agree with defendant that the trial court erred in that regard because, in light of the other statements to which Aspria <em>testified </em>\u2014 viz., that the victim had said \u201c[expletive] Mexican\u201d after his confrontation with defendant and that the victim had told Aspria that he was building a fence to \u201ckeep the Mexicans out of my yard\u201d \u2014 the victim\u2019s statement that \u201cthe Mexicans are taking all the jobs\u201d met OEC 609-1\u2019s requirement that the statement \u201cshow bias or interest.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding that the statement was not relevant to show the victim\u2019s bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>However, we conclude that the error was harmless. The statements that the trial court admitted, if believed, were more than sufficient to show the victim\u2019s bias. Indeed, the jury had before it Aspria\u2019s testimony about the fence <em>and </em>Aspria\u2019s testimony that, after his confrontation with defendant, the victim had said \u201c[expletive] Mexican.\u201d In light of that evidence of the victim\u2019s bias, there is little likelihood that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the statement affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\"> ORS 163.190 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of menacing if by word or conduct the person intentionally attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> ORS 166.025 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct in the second degree if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-10\">\u201c(a) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b25-11\"> The record does not indicate defendant\u2019s nationality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b26-6\"> Later, during the confrontation, defendant\u2019s son told defendant that he had lied about that statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b26-7\"> OEC 609-1 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">\u201c(1) The credibility of a witness may be attacked by evidence that the witness engaged in conduct or made statements showing bias or interest.
