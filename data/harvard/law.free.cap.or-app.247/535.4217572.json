Plaintiff, representing the auctions, sued both the vehicle dealer, defendant Guillermo E. Leon dba Leon\u2019s Auto Sales (Leon), and the surety on the dealer\u2019s bond, defendant Western Surety Company (Western). Plaintiff contended that Leon\u2019s failure to pay was a breach of contract; plaintiff also argued that it was entitled to recover on the bond because it was harmed by Leon\u2019s actions. The trial court entered a default judgment against Leon on the contract claim, which is not at issue on appeal. Plaintiff and Western then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the bond issue. The trial court granted plaintiffs motion and denied Western\u2019s, concluding that Leon had violated two provisions of the vehicle code, ORS 822.045(l)(j) and (k), entitling plaintiff to recover on the bond pursuant to ORS 822.030(2). On appeal, Western argues that plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the bond. For the following reasons, we agree. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u201cOn review of cross-motions for summary judgment, we examine whether there are any disputed issues of material fact and whether either party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Vision Realty, Inc. v. Kohler, </em>214 Or App 220, 222, 164 P3d 330 (2007). Here, the material facts are undisputed, and, as explained below, the decisive question is one of statutory construction. Plaintiff, an auto-auction company, asserts claims on behalf of itself, Brasher\u2019s Cascade Auto Auction, Inc. (Brasher\u2019s Cascade), and as assignee of another auto-auction company, Brasher\u2019s Northwest Auto Auction, Inc. (Brasher\u2019s Northwest). From June through September 2008, defendant Leon entered into what are known as \u201cfloat agreements\u201d that allowed Leon to buy vehicles on credit from both auctions. The float agreements provided that Leon would give the selling auction a signed check for each vehicle that he purchased on credit. That auction, in turn, would hold the check until (1) Leon requested the vehicle\u2019s title, (2) the float period expired, or (3) Leon subsequently sold the vehicle, whichever occurred first. The auction also would keep the vehicle\u2019s title as security until it cashed the corresponding check from Leon; the auction then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>would release the title so that Leon could timely pass title to the vehicle\u2019s purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">This appeal involves 15 vehicles that Leon purchased from Brasher\u2019s Cascade and Brasher\u2019s Northwest during the term of the relevant float agreements. Leon delivered a check for each vehicle on the date of purchase. However, when the auctions attempted to cash those checks after Leon sold the vehicles, the checks all were returned for non-sufficient funds. Brasher\u2019s Northwest nonetheless provided clean title to Leon for one vehicle. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) soon suspended Leon from operation, and Leon subsequently went out of business. The auctions then provided two other titles directly to the vehicles\u2019 ultimate purchasers and passed the remaining titles to the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Plaintiff then brought this action, asserting, with respect to Western, a right to recover damages on the bond under ORS 822.030(2). That statute grants any person a right of recovery against the surety on a vehicle dealer\u2019s bond \u201cif the person suffers any loss or damage by reason of the vehicle dealer\u2019s fraud, fraudulent representations or violation of provisions of the vehicle code * * ORS 822.030(2). Plaintiff asserted that Leon had violated the vehicle code in two ways: first, by failing to satisfy plaintiffs security interests in certain vehicles within 15 days after Leon received title to the vehicles, in violation of ORS 822.045(l)(j)(B); and second, by failing to provide title to the vehicles\u2019 ultimate purchasers, in violation of ORS 822.045(l)(k)(A). Plaintiff argued that Leon would have had to pay his debt to plaintiff in order to comply with either of those provisions. Accordingly, plaintiff concluded, it had suffered damages \u201cby reason of\u2019 Leon\u2019s noncompliance and was entitled to recover on the bond under ORS 822.030(2). The trial court agreed and entered judgment in plaintiffs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On appeal, Western first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Leon committed the offense outlined in ORS 822.045(l)(j)(B) by failing to pay plaintiff for the vehicles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 822.045(l)(j) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a vehicle dealer commits the offense of failure to provide clear title if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c(B) Within 15 days of receiving clear title to a vehicle or camper from another dealer, the purchasing dealer fails to satisfy the interest of the selling dealer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Subsection (2) of that statute creates an exception to the offense described above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cA dealer shall not be considered to have committed the offense described in subsection (l)(j) of this section if the dealer fails to satisfy an interest in a vehicle or camper that arises from an inventory financing security interest for which the dealer is the debtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Western contends that the subsection (2) exception applies in'this case. It notes that plaintiff retained security interests in the unpaid-for vehicles under the \u201cfloat agreements\u201d to which plaintiff and Leon were parties. Western asserts that those security interests were \u201cinventory financing security interest[s]\u201d as that term is used in ORS 822.045(2). Because the exception outlined in that statute applies here, Western argues, Leon cannot be considered to have committed the offense described in ORS 822.045(l)(j)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Plaintiff responds that to interpret the phrase \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d as Western suggests would be incompatible with the legislature\u2019s intent. Rather, plaintiff argues, the legislature meant ORS 822.045(2) to apply only to security interests arising out of a narrow subset of financing agreements known as either \u201cflooring agreements\u201d or \u201cflooring contracts.\u201d Because Leon\u2019s agreements with plaintiff were not \u201cflooring agreements,\u201d plaintiff concludes that those agreements did not give rise to interests that fall within the ORS 822.045(2) exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">We resolve the parties\u2019 dispute about the meaning of the statutory term \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d by examining the text and context of ORS 822.045(2), also considering the legislative history that the parties have proffered and giving that history such weight, if any, as it appears to merit. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The phrase \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d is not statutorily defined. However, we readily discern its meaning by reviewing the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of its component terms, <em>see State v. Bea, </em>318 Or 220, 225, 864 P2d 854 (1993), and by considering any pertinent definitions included in the general definitions section of the Oregon Vehicle Code, ORS chapter 801, which governs the construction of ORS 822.045(2). ORS 801.100 (\u201cExcept where the context requires otherwise, the definitions given in the vehicle code govern its construction.\u201d). The first word in the phrase\u2014 \u201cinventory\u201d \u2014 commonly is understood to mean \u201cthe quantity of goods or materials on hand : STOCK, SUPPLY.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1189 (unabridged ed 2002) (uppercase in original). When used as a verb, \u201cfinancing\u201d ordinarily means \u201cto raise or provide funds or capital for\u201d[;] \u201cto provide with necessary funds in order to achieve a desired end\u201d[;] \u201cto sell on credit: to supply on credit * * * : to secure needed funds or capital * * <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 851 (definition of the verb, \u201cfinance\u201d). Finally, the Vehicle Code defines a \u201csecurity interest\u201d as \u201can interest in a vehicle reserved or created by agreement and which secures payment or performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>an obligation as more particularly defined by ORS 71.2010(2)(ii).\u201d ORS 801.465. That referenced statute, in turn, defines \u201csecurity interest\u201d for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code. ORS 71.1020 (relating to the scope of general definitions provided in ORS 71.2010). Taken together, those definitions suggest that an \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d arises, for purposes of ORS 822.045(2), when one person finances a vehicle dealer\u2019s acquisition of vehicles for the dealer\u2019s stock (either by selling the vehicles to the dealer on credit or by otherwise funding the dealer\u2019s acquisition of them), reserving or creating an interest in those vehicles to secure the dealer\u2019s obligation to pay its associated debt to the financing person.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Nonetheless, plaintiff contends that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cinventory financing security agreement\u201d to have a more narrow meaning. Plaintiff relies on legislative history, specifically written testimony submitted by the Oregon Auto Dealers Association (OADA) that supported creating the exception now codified in ORS 822.045(2). The testimony explained that the exception would cover certain financing agreements known within the automotive industry as \u201cflooring contracts,\u201d and it described those contracts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cWith a flooring contract, a financial institution or auto maker owns vehicles in a dealer\u2019s inventory. A dealer pays interest on a vehicle until it is sold. Then, the dealer pays the principle once the financing of a purchase is completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Plaintiff asserts that it is neither an auto manufacturer nor a financial institution. It also contends that the security interests granted by Leon in this case were not equivalent to those that arise under the kind of \u201cflooring contract\u201d discussed in the OADA\u2019s testimony. From those premises, plaintiff concludes that the legislature did not intend the ORS 822.045(2) \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d exception to encompass the type of security interest at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We disagree. Although the OADA\u2019s written testimony reflects its specific interest in exempting flooring contracts from ORS 822.045(1)(j), the testimony does not suggest that OADA advocated an exception that would apply <em>only </em>to that single type of financing agreement. More significantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>nothing in the statutory text indicates that the legislature intended the term \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d to encompass only interests that are created through flooring agreements. \u201c[W]hatever the legislative history might show about the legislature\u2019s intentions, those intentions must be reflected in actual statutory wording that, when reasonably construed, is capable of carrying out such an intention.\u201d <em>State v. Patton, </em>237 Or App 46, 53, 238 P3d 439 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 131 (2011). Plaintiff does not contend that the text actually enacted by the legislature reasonably could be construed to apply only to flooring agreements, and we do not discern how that could be so. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>229 Or App 461, 468, 211 P3d 932, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 446 (2009) (noting that legislatures often enact \u201cvery broadly worded statutes\u201d intended to address more issues than those which precipitated a particular bill). Accordingly, even if we read the legislative history in the same way as plaintiff, we would not conclude that the statutory exemption applies only to flooring agreements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Here, plaintiff and Leon entered into agreements that allowed plaintiff to reserve interests in multiple vehicles as security for Leon\u2019s payment for those vehicles, which he bought on credit under the terms of the float agreements. It is clear to us that each of those float agreements gave rise to an \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d as that term is used in ORS 822.045(2). Consequently, even if Leon\u2019s acts might otherwise have violated ORS 822.045(1)(j)(B), Leon \u201cshall not be considered to have committed [that] offense.\u201d ORS 822.045(2). The trial court erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We next consider plaintiffs claim that it was entitled to recover on the bond because Leon violated ORS 822.045(1)(k). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a vehicle dealer commits the offense of failure to furnish certificate of title or application for title if, within 90 calendar days of transfer of any interest in a vehicle or camper by the dealer, the dealer has failed to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">\u201c(A) Furnish the certificate of title or other primary ownership record for the vehicle or camper and any release thereon * * * to the security interest holder next named, if any, otherwise to the lessor or, if none, to the purchaser!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Because Leon could not have timely passed title to the ultimate purchasers as required by ORS 822.045(1)(k) without first paying off plaintiffs interest in the vehicles \u2014 thus securing release of the titles from plaintiff \u2014 plaintiff argues that it suffered damages under ORS 822.045(1)(k) that are due to Leon\u2019s nonpayment. Accordingly, plaintiff concludes, it is entitled to recover on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Plaintiffs argument overlooks the statutory requirement that a person have been harmed \u201cby reason of\u2019 the vehicle dealer\u2019s \u201cviolations of provisions of the vehicle code.\u201d ORS 822.030(2). Leon\u2019s alleged violation of ORS 822.045(1)(k) arose when he did not provide certificates of title to the people who ultimately bought the cars that Le\u00f3n had purchased from plaintiff on credit. Plaintiff suffered no loss \u201cby reason of\u2019 Leon\u2019s failure to provide title to those purchasers. Rather, any loss plaintiff suffered arose from Leon\u2019s failure to pay the debt that he owed plaintiff under the financing agreements. Plaintiffs contrary protestations notwithstanding, Leon\u2019s failure to pay that debt cannot be equated to his failure to provide certificates of title to consumers. Indeed, Leon could have violated ORS 822.045(1)(k) by failing to furnish certificates of title to the vehicles\u2019 purchasers even if he had fulfilled his monetary obligation to plaintiff. Because Leon\u2019s alleged violation of ORS 822.045(1)(k) did not <em>cause </em>plaintiff to suffer any loss, plaintiff is not entitled to recover on the bond on the basis of any such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In sum, the undisputed facts in the summary judgment record establish that plaintiff did not suffer loss by reason of Leon having violated either of the vehicle code provisions upon which plaintiff relies. The trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>denying Western\u2019s summary judgment motion and in entering judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for defendant Western Surety Company.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> We note that Western\u2019s assignments of error inappropriately challenge the trial court\u2019s reasons for granting plaintiffs summary judgment motion and denying Western\u2019s, instead of challenging those rulings themselves. \u201cAssignments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>error * * * are to be directed against rulings by the trial court, not against components of the trial court\u2019s reasoning or analysis that underlie that ruling.\u201d <em>Marc Nelson Oil Products, Inc. v. Grim Logging Co., </em>199 Or App 73, 75 n 1, 110 P3d 120, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>200 Or App 239, 115 P3d 935 (2005). <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(3) (\u201cEach assignment of error shall identify precisely the legal, procedural, factual, or other ruling that is being challenged.\u201d). However, the parties\u2019 briefs make clear what rulings are at issue on appeal, and Western\u2019s noncompliance with ORAP 5.45(3) has not impeded our review of those rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> Alternatively, Western contends that, even if ORS 822.045(2) is inapplicable, a dealer can violate ORS 822.045(1)(j)(B) only after \u201creceiving clear title to a vehicle.\u201d Here, Leon received clear title to only one vehicle. Thus, Western argues, if plaintiff was entitled to any relief on the bond, that relief should not have exceeded plaintiff\u2019s losses on the single vehicle to which Leon received title. Plaintiff responds that the trial court correctly granted it relief on the bond for its losses on all 15 vehicles, because, as plaintiff interprets ORS 822.045(1)(j)(B), clear title to each vehicle was \u201creceived\u201d by Leon when plaintiff provided the titles either directly to Leon, to Leon\u2019s customers, or to the DMV on Leon\u2019s behalf. Given our dispositive conclusion that the ORS 822.045(2) exception applies, we do not reach the question of when Leon \u201creceived\u201d title to the vehicles for purposes of ORS 822.045(1)(j)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\"> We explain the parameters of \u201cflooring agreements\u201d later in this opinion, 247 Or App at 541.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> Plaintiff also argues that construing the ORS 822.045(2) exception as we do renders ORS 822.045(1)(j)(B) meaningless. We reject that argument without extended discussion, noting only that there may well be situations in which a purchasing dealer \u201cfails to satisfy the interest of [a] selling dealer\u201d within 15 days of receiving title, in violation of ORS 822.045(1)(j)(B), yet the selling dealer\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d is not an \u201cinventory financing security interest\u201d within the meaning of ORS 822.045(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
