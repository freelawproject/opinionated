J.</author>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction, following a bench trial, for two counts of contempt for violating a restraining order issued pursuant to the Family Abuse Prevention Act, ORS 107.700 to 107.735. On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) as to one of those counts. For the reasons stated below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Viewed most favorably to the state, <em>State v. Burgess, </em>240 Or App 641, 643, 251 P3d 765, <em>rev allowed, </em>351 Or 318 (2011), the record discloses the following facts. At trial, Officer Olmos testified that, in March 2010, he investigated a report that a restraining order had been violated. While Olmos was taking a statement from Weiss, the person protected by the restraining order, he answered a phone call from defendant on Weiss\u2019s phone. Olmos asked defendant whether he knew that Weiss had a restraining order against him and that he was not supposed to have any contact with her. Defendant responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Thereafter, Officer Hunt interviewed defendant, after giving him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. When Hunt asked defendant whether he remembered the previous phone contact with Weiss, defendant responded, \u201c \u2018She texted me first. I texted her back. We never talked. It was all texting.\u2019 \u201d Also, when Hunt asked defendant whether he had been served with a restraining order, defendant answered, \u201c Weah. I admit answering her text, but she texted me first.\u2019 \u201d Defendant acknowledged sending 25 text messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Other than defendant\u2019s statements to Hunt, the state offered no evidence to demonstrate that defendant had contacted Weiss by sending text messages. Specifically, Weiss did not testify at trial, and the state offered no extrinsic evidence of the text messages that defendant allegedly sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Defendant was charged with 25 counts of contempt for violating the restraining order. Counts 1 to 24 were based on defendant\u2019s alleged contacts with Weiss by text message. Count 25 was based on the phone call described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on Counts 1 to 24, contending that, when the evidence is viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to the State there\u2019s been no corroboration of the admission or confession made by [defendant].\u201d The state\u2019s only response was that the court should \u201cconsider the fact that defendant did admit to an officer that he did make those text messages to [Weiss].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The court granted defendant\u2019s motion with respect to Counts 2 to 24. However, the court denied the motion with respect to Count 1. In particular, with regard to defendant\u2019s argument concerning the lack of corroboration, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201cBy the way, I respect [defense counsel\u2019s] argument about corroboration, but I find there\u2019s sufficient corroboration * * * of the defendant\u2019s admissions in the fact that there is a restraining order and that corroborates his statements that he knew * * * that he\u2019d been served with a restraining order and the restraining order in evidence names him as the respondent and Ms. Weiss as the petitioner. So I find that sufficient corroboration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In response, defense counsel remonstrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201c[T]he existence of a restraining order is no more corroboration of a subsequent violation of it by text message than, for example, a statute against murder is corroboration of someone walking into a police station and saying I killed Jimmy Hoffa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201c* * * In this case, just the mere fact that there\u2019s a restraining order, defense\u2019s position is, it\u2019s not corroboration that someone violated it later on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Nevertheless, the court adhered to its ruling on defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant appeals the resulting judgment of conviction on Counts 1 and 25.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On appeal, defendant challenges only his conviction on Count 1, contending that the trial court erred in denying his MJOA on that count and essentially reprising the arguments that he made to the trial court. The state concedes that, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, \u201cthe evidence here \u2014 defendant\u2019s confession that he knowingly sent text messages to [Weiss] in violation of a restraining order \u2014 was not sufficiently corroborated.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 136.425(2) (providing that, except under circumstances that are inapplicable here, \u201ca confession alone is not sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed\u201d); <em>State v. Kelley, </em>239 Or App 266, 276, 243 P3d 1195 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 131 (2011) (reasoning that ORS 136.425 \u201conly requires that the state introduce independent evidence that <em>tends </em>to establish the <em>corpus delicti\u201d </em>\u2014 the commission of the crime (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in <em>Kelley)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Conviction on Count 1 reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> A conviction for contempt is not a proper disposition. <em>See State v. Campbell, </em>246 Or App 683, 267 P3d 205 (2011) (accepting state\u2019s concession that contempt is not a crime and that the court erred in entering a conviction for contempt); <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>239 Or App 313, 243 P3d 496 (2010) (accepting state\u2019s concession that trial court erred in imposing a judgment of conviction and sentence after finding the defendant in contempt). Because defendant does not contend on appeal that the court erred in entering convictions for contempt, we do not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-5\"> In so doing, we agree with defendant\u2019s assertion and the state\u2019s concession that, on this record, defendant\u2019s statements must be deemed to be a confession. <em>See State v. Muzzy, </em>190 Or App 306, 317-21, 79 P3d 324 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 422 (2004) (discussing the distinction between a \u201cconfession\u201d and an \u201cadmission\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
