J.</author>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Defendant was found in contempt of court, ORS 33.015(2)(b), for violating a restraining order under the Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA), ORS 107.700 to 107.735. She now appeals the resulting judgment, assigning error to the denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was legally insufficient to show that she engaged in conduct prohibited by the FAPA restraining order at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct did not constitute \u201cinterfering\u201d with the protected person and was not otherwise prohibited by the FAPA order. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The pertinent facts are few and undisputed. JG, defendant\u2019s former boyfriend, obtained a FAPA restraining order that prohibited defendant from, among other things, entering or attempting to enter JG\u2019s residence or \u201cintimidating, molesting, interfering with or menacing [JG], or attempting to intimidate, molest, interfere with or menace [JG] directly or through third parties.\u201d While the order was in effect, defendant went to the property of Thompson, JG\u2019s then-current girlfriend, and posted a small sign on a wooden post at the end of Thompson\u2019s driveway. The sign stated, \u201c[JG] has Genital Herpes[.] He won\u2019t tell you unless he has an outbreak!.] Ask his ex-wife[, RC;] she lives just up the street.\u201d Shortly thereafter, JG\u2019s relationship with Thompson ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">During closing arguments at trial, the state argued that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted an attempt to interfere with or menace JG through a third party, ORS 107.718(l)(e), and thus constituted a violation of the FAPA order. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel responded that, although defendant\u2019s conduct may have had the effect of interfering with JG\u2019s relationship with Thompson, \u201cit just doesn\u2019t fit within any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>restrictions of the [Restraining [ojrder.\u201d According to defendant\u2019s trial counsel, because the FAPA order did not proscribe defendant\u2019s conduct and defendant had no intent to communicate with JG, the state failed to prove that defendant willfully violated the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The trial court ultimately agreed with the state about defendant\u2019s conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cWhat you did was violate a [Restraining [o]rder beyond any doubt. You didn\u2019t walk into a public grocery store and have, by happenstance, contact with [Thompson], who you might or might not know. You went to a location where you knew she was or would be, for the specific purpose of sending her a message about [JG]. That clearly comes within the prohibition of the [Restraining [o]rder that prevents you from interfering with him. You did it purposefully. And frankly, to be mean-spirited and small.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Accordingly, the trial court found defendant in contempt for violating the FAPA order because defendant willfully disobeyed the court\u2019s order by interfering with or attempting to interfere with JG directly or through a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On appeal, defendant maintains that her conduct did not violate the FAPA order because, under the order as written, defendant was not proscribed from communicating with Thompson or going to Thompson\u2019s residence. Further, defendant contends that, in any event, ORS 107.718(l)(f) does not authorize a court to prohibit a respondent from having contact with a third party, other than a petitioner\u2019s minor child. Finally, defendant argues that her conduct is not proscribed in the order nor contemplated by the statutory scheme because such a limitation would violate her fundamental rights to free speech and association under Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The state renews the argument it made before the trial court, that defendant violated the FAPA order because the content of her communication with Thompson constituted an attempt to \u201cinterfere with\u201d JG within the meaning of ORS 107.718(l)(e). According to the state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201cit is apparent that defendant was angry with [JG] and wanted to retaliate against him through third parties, particularly those with whom he has a romantic relationship. That is the kind of behavior that a restraining order is designed to address and prevent. The information that defendant was communicating is precisely the kind of information that will or is likely to have an effect of interfering with [JG] and his relationships with others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Additionally, the state responds to defendant\u2019s constitutional argument by contending that the order prohibits defendant\u2019s speech only to the extent necessary to protect JG and therefore does not suffer from overbreadth. Further, the state contends that, in any event, because defendant did not appeal the issuance of the FAPA order, this court should not consider her constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We agree with the state that, were defendant arguing that the FAPA order itself was unconstitutional and thus that she cannot be prosecuted for violating it, that argument would not be properly before us on appeal. <em>See State v. Ryan, </em>350 Or 670, 261 P3d 1189 (2011). However, we understand defendant to be making a qualitatively different argument: that the FAPA order did not prohibit the conduct at issue and that the pertinent provision of the order is not susceptible to the broad interpretation that the trial court gave it here because such an interpretation would infringe on constitutionally protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal \u201cto determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>229 Or App 453, 456, 211 P3d 979, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 349 (2009). Here, the facts are undisputed, and the parties\u2019 contentions center on whether the trial court correctly concluded that defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes \u201cinterfering\u201d within the meaning of the FAPA statute, ORS 107.718(1)(e), thus raising a question of statutory construction. <em>See id. </em>When construing a statute, we examine its text in context and in light of any pertinent legislative history in order to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009);</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We begin with the text of the FAPA provision at issue, ORS 107.718, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201c(1) * * * Upon a showing that the petitioner has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner and that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child, the court shall, if requested by the petitioner, order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201c(e) That the respondent be restrained from intimidating, molesting, <em>interfering with </em>or menacing the petitioner, or attempting to intimidate, molest, interfere with, or menace the petitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\u201c(f) That the respondent be restrained from intimidating, molesting, interfering with or menacing any children in the custody of the petitioner, or attempting to intimidate, molest, interfere with or menace any children in the custody of the petitioner[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">(Emphasis added.) ORS 107.705(4) provides that \u201cinterfere\u201d as used in ORS 107.718 means \u201cto interpose in a manner that would reasonably be expected to hinder or impede a person in the petitioner\u2019s situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In 1995, the Oregon legislature amended ORS 107.705 to include the definition of \u201cinterfere,\u201d among other terms, and defined it as \u201cto interpose in a way that hinders or impedes.\u201d Or Laws 1995, ch 637, \u00a7 2. The 1997 legislature then modified the definition of \u201cinterfere\u201d to reflect its current definition. Or Laws 1997, ch 863, \u00a7 8. Before those amendments, this court had decided <em>State ex rel Emery v. Andisha, </em>105 Or App 473, 805 P2d 718 (1991), in which we concluded that \u201cinterfere\u201d means \u201cto interpose in a way that hinders or impedes\u201d or <em>\u201cto take part in the concern of others.\u201d Id. </em>at 476 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>631 (1990)) (emphasis added). Thus, the <em>Andisha </em>court defined \u201cinterfere\u201d much more broadly than the current statutory definition. The legislature therefore, in enacting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>definition of \u201cinterfere\u201d now found in ORS 107.705(4), chose a narrower definition than we had previously ascribed to the term. That is, the legislature did <em>not </em>include in its definition of \u201cinterfere\u201d the notion of \u201ctak[ing] part in the concern of others.\u201d Rather, it limited its definition to the \u201chinder or impede\u201d portions of the definition that we had set forth in <em>Andisha. </em>Because we presume that the legislature is aware of our case law interpreting statutes, we further presume that the legislature intended a narrower definition than we had given the term in <em>Andisha. See Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 693, 159 P3d 1151 (2007) (\u201c[W]e generally presume that the legislature enacts statutes in light of existing judicial decisions that have a bearing on those statutes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The question then becomes whether \u201cinterfere,\u201d as narrowly defined in ORS 107.705(4) can be interpreted to encompass conduct such as defendant\u2019s conduct here. As noted, \u201cinterfere\u201d is \u201cto interpose in a manner that would reasonably be expected to hinder or impede a person in the petitioner\u2019s situation.\u201d The terms \u201cinterpose,\u201d \u201chinder,\u201d and \u201cimpede,\u201d however, are not defined by statute. When a term is not statutorily defined, we presume that the legislature intended terms to have its plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. Common definitions of \u201cinterpose\u201d are \u201cto place between or in an intermediate position\u201d or \u201cto put (oneself) between.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1182 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cHinder\u201d is defined as \u201cto do harm to: impair, damage\u201d or \u201cto make slow or difficult the course or progress of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1070. And finally, \u201cimpede\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cto interfere with or get in the way of the progress of: hold up: block.\u201d Id. at 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Although the ordinary meaning of those terms suggests that the legislature intended \u201cinterfere\u201d to encompass a more physical interference than the conduct at issue here, we cannot say that it is wholly implausible that the statutory definition could not also suggest nonphysical interference. Nonetheless, the plain meanings of \u201cinterpose,\u201d \u201chinder,\u201d and \u201cimpede\u201d collectively suggest a direct interference with the person protected under a FAPA order, rather than proscribing the type of conduct at issue here, which is more akin to the legislatively rejected understanding of \u201cinterfere\u201d as \u201ctak[ing] part in the concern of others.\u201d Moreover, construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201cinterfere\u201d so broadly as to preclude a person from simply revealing personal information about another person to a third party would potentially run afoul of the avoidance canon, which holds that, \u201cwhen one plausible construction of a statute is constitutional and another plausible construction of a statute is unconstitutional, courts will assume that the legislature intended the constitutional meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Kitzman, </em>323 Or 589, 602, 920 P2d 134 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Moreover, a more limited interpretation of \u201cinterfere\u201d is supported by the context of FAPA. The purpose of a FAPA restraining order is to protect a victim of domestic abuse from further abuse. Thus, when a court orders the abuser to \u201cbe restrained from intimidating, molesting, interfering with or menacing\u201d the protected person within the context of FAPA, ORS 107.718(l)(e), \u201cinterfering\u201d within the context of the statute simply could not encompass defendant\u2019s conduct, which did not constitute more than offensive behavior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Accordingly, we hold that there was insufficient evidence to show that defendant interfered with or attempted to interfere with JG within the meaning of the FAPA order.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> At trial, although defendant did not formally move for a judgment of acquittal, in her closing arguments, defendant argued that there was legally insufficient evidence that her conduct was a violation of the FAPA order. That argument is sufficient to preserve the issue before us on appeal. <em>See State v. Gonzalez, </em>188 Or App 430, 431, 71 P3d 573 (2003) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s closing argument that the state had not adduced legally sufficient evidence to establish the required culpable mental state \u201cis the equivalent of a motion for judgment of acquittal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> The legislative history further supports our understanding of the types of behavior that the legislature intended to proscribe in ORS 107.718. During a House Judiciary Committee work session, legal counsel submitted amendments adopted in subcommittee, in which a member of the Oregon Coalition Against Domestic Violence proposed that the term \u201cbothering\u201d be omitted from the list of terms under ORS 107.718. Exhibit A, House Committee on Judiciary, SB 356A, July 9, 1981. Counsel distinguished the term \u201cbothering\u201d from \u201cmolesting\u201d or \u201cinterfering.\u201d Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, SB 356, July 9, 1981, Tape 540, Side A (statement of Linda Zuckerman). Discussion during that work session indicated that the concern was that \u201cbothering\u201d could be misconstrued by the public. Ultimately, the bill was moved to the floor with a \u201cdo pass\u201d recommendation as amended with \u201cbothering\u201d omitted. Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, July 9,1981, 426. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 285 (defining \u201cbothering\u201d as \u201cto put in a state of agitation\u201d or \u201cto annoy, anger, or upset, especially by petty provocation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
