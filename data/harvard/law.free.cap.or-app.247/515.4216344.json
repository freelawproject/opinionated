That statute provides, in part, that, \u201c[f]or every compensable injury, the insurer or the self-insured employer shall cause to be provided medical services for conditions caused in material part by the injury * * The board found that there was a sufficient causal relationship between claimant\u2019s requested medical services \u2014 here, diagnostic tests \u2014 and his compensable injury. On review, SAIF and employer argue that the diagnostic services were not related to claimant\u2019s accepted condition but, instead, were for the sole purpose of diagnosing new conditions that were not compensable. Thus, they contend that the board erred in determining that the services were compensable. We review for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">On July 20, 2007, claimant was working when he slipped and fell about five feet onto his tailbone and buttocks. He sought treatment and submitted a claim for a lumbar contusion. An MRI of claimant\u2019s spine showed abnormalities indicative of degenerative disc disease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 27, 2007, SAIF accepted the claim for a \u201clow back contusion,\u201d and claimant began treatment for that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In November 2007, claimant was evaluated by Dr. Koon, who concluded that claimant continued to suffer from a low back contusion and \u201cpossible facet injury.\u201d Although a bone scan of claimant\u2019s spine was normal, in January 2008, Koon diagnosed claimant with \u201c[p]ossible lumbar facet syndrome.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on Koon\u2019s assessment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>claimant requested that a condition of lumbar facet syndrome be added to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">After an independent medical examination by Dr. Carr, SAIF denied that claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carr concluded that there was a lack of objective evidence to support a diagnosis of lumbar facet syndrome and that the only way to determine if symptoms were coming from the facet joint would be to do facet joint injections. In any event, he opined, lumbar facet syndrome \u201cin almost all cases\u201d arises from degenerative changes. To the extent that defendant was experiencing lumbar pain, Carr explained, it was \u201cencompassed in both the diagnoses of lumbar contusion and degenerative disc disease both of which can cause lumbar pain.\u201d Carr further concluded, however, that claimant\u2019s low back contusion had resolved and that his ongoing pain was likely due to his degenerative disc disease, which was unrelated to his July 2007 work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In February 2008, claimant\u2019s low back contusion was determined to be medically stationary, and, in March, SAIF closed the claim. Claimant nonetheless continued to experience back pain, and, upon the recommendation of Koon, he sought approval for facet joint injections as a diagnostic service related to his compensable injury. Koon opined that claimant\u2019s work accident was the 60 percent cause of the need for treatment of the lumbar facet syndrome and that it would be reasonable to pursue facet joint injections. Carr disagreed, noting that, although claimant\u2019s \u201cmechanism of injury is of the type that could have produced an injury to the facets,\u201d a facet injury would have produced a different pathological presentation if it were caused by the workplace incident. Thus, Carr concluded that the lumbar facet syndrome did not result from claimant\u2019s work accident and that, even if the accident were a contributing cause, it would not be the major contributing cause of the need for treatment (the major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>cause instead being the underlying degenerative disease). SAIF declined to pay for the injections, and claimant sought review with the Medical Review Unit (MRU). The MRU transferred the claim to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Koon and Carr were deposed. Koon maintained that lumbar facet syndrome was a \u201cgood diagnosis\u201d for claimant but noted that facet joint injections would provide more definitive diagnostic information. According to Koon, the injections were directed at diagnosing and treating lumbar facet syndrome. He explained that a \u201cgood response\u201d to the injections would indicate that the joint is a pain generator, while a lack of response would indicate that there is an alternative source of pain, such as discogenic pain. Koon acknowledged that there were a number of \u201cequally plausible\u201d diagnoses for claimant\u2019s condition, including a chronic contusion, facet arthritis, or degenerative disc disease. However, \u201c[i]n [his] mind,\u201d claimant\u2019s condition was more probably lumbar facet syndrome given the mechanism of injury and the lack of symptoms before the injury. Koon farther opined that claimant\u2019s low back contusion had completely resolved and required no further treatment. He agreed that \u201c[w]hat is going on here * * * has nothing to do with the contusion\u201d and that \u201cthe results of th[e] contusion are * * * no longer contributing\u201d to claimant\u2019s low back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Carr testified that recent literature raised doubt about the diagnostic efficacy of facet joint injections, but he admitted that \u201cif [claimant] was having persistent back symptoms, it would be part of the normal [diagnostic] workup.\u201d However, Carr thought that claimant\u2019s work injury was no longer a contributing cause of any need for treatment. Rather, Carr opined, claimant\u2019s current symptoms were a result of degenerative disease unrelated to his workplace accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that no medical evidence \u201ccausally connects the proposed facet injections to the accepted lumbar contusion.\u201d Consequently, the ALJ denied the compensability of the injections. Claimant sought review of that decision with the board, arguing that his current low back condition was \u201cdirectly related to the work injury\u201d and that the injections would help diagnose that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>current condition. SAIF and employer responded that the ALJ correctly denied compensability because the injections were not necessitated in material part by the accepted condition, <em>i.e., </em>the low back contusion. Claimant rejoined that the inquiry for determining the compensability of medical services is not limited to whether the services have a material relationship to the accepted condition but, instead, is properly focused on whether there is a relationship between the claimant\u2019s current condition and the original work injury \u2014 here, broadly defined as a \u201clow back injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The board, with one dissent, reversed the ALJ, concluding that the injections were compensable medical services under ORS 656.245(l)(a) because they were \u201cnecessary, as a diagnostic tool, to explore whether claimant\u2019s current symptoms [were] caused by the accepted lumbar contusion, and to determine the extent of his compensable injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In drawing that conclusion, the board found Carr\u2019s testimony inconsistent and unpersuasive. It instead relied upon the testimony of Koon. The board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cDr. Koon stated that the July 2007 compensable injury was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s current back condition, and that there were a number of potential diagnoses that would explain that condition. Among those diagnoses were both lumbar facet syndrome and a chronic lumbar contusion. According to Dr. Koon, * * * either diagnoses was equally probable, and the proposed lumbar facet injections would assist in arriving at a more definitive diagnosis; <em>i.e., </em>the injections were necessary to determine the extent of claimant\u2019s compensable injury. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cIn other words, according to Dr. Koon, the extent of claimant\u2019s injury was unknown in the absence of the proposed lumbar facet injection, and he could not conclusively determine the extent of the compensable injury without the proposed diagnostic service. Based on this well-explained opinion, we find that the proposed lumbar facet injections were \u2018necessary to determine the * * * extent of [claimant\u2019s] compensable injury.\u2019 [SAIF <em>v. Martinez, </em>219 Or App 182, 188, 182 P3d 873 (2008).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201c* * * [T]he evidence establishes that Dr. Koon believed that claimant\u2019s ongoing symptoms could be caused by the accepted contusion, and that the contusion could have become \u2018chronic.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">\u201cDr. Koon\u2019s separate observation concerning whether the contusion had resolved should not be read in isolation, but in the broader context of his other responses. The whole of Dr. Koon\u2019s opinion, read in context, establishes that the proposed lumbar facet injections were necessary to determine the source of claimant\u2019s symptoms and the extent of the compensable injury. In other words, we read Dr. Koon\u2019s opinion to say that, although it was likely that the lumbar contusion had resolved, it was equally likely that the contusion had become chronic. Thus, Dr. Koon asserted that the proposed lumbar facet injections were a reasonable diagnostic tool for purposes of the accepted contusion, and that, without the injections, he could not conclusively determine the extent of claimant\u2019s compensable injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cBased on the persuasiveness of Dr. Koon\u2019s opinion, we find a sufficient causal relationship between the proposed lumbar facet injections and claimant\u2019s compensable injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On review, SAIF and employer (collectively, petitioners) argue that the board erred in two respects. First, petitioners argue that the board misapplied the legal standard for compensability of medical services under ORS 656.245(l)(a). Specifically, they contend that the board\u2019s conclusion is based on one of two legally erroneous premises: either (1) the board \u201cdefine[d] the compensable injury as the industrial accident,\u201d rather than the accepted low back contusion, leading it to conclude that there was a causal connection between the compensable injury and claimant\u2019s current condition; or (2) it reasoned that the injections would, by process of elimination, help to ascertain whether a chronic contusion was a likely diagnosis and, in so doing, would determine the \u201cextent\u201d of the accepted low back contusion. Second, petitioners argue that, even if the board applied the correct legal standard in determining the compensability of the injections, its findings were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Claimant responds that medical services need not be related to the previously accepted condition in order to be compensable but, instead, need only relate to \u201cthe work injury,\u201d which claimant does not define but seems to regard as any condition resulting from the workplace accident: \u201cAs the ALJ, Board and the case law all discuss[ ], a diagnostic exam is [compensable if used] to establish the cause or extent of the work injury, not [merely] the narrowly defined condition that was already accepted.\u201d Claimant argues that Koon\u2019s testimony provides substantial evidence that claimant\u2019s condition \u2014 whether a chronic contusion or lumbar facet syndrome \u2014 arose out of the work injury. We also understand claimant to argue that, in any event, there was substantial evidence that the diagnostic services were necessary to determine the extent of the accepted low back contusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">As an initial matter, the parties\u2019 contentions require us to address the meaning of the term \u201ccompensable injury\u201d as used in ORS 656.245(l)(a). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\"><em>\u201cFor every compensable injury, the insurer </em>or the self-insured employer <em>shall cause to be provided medical services for conditions caused in material part by the injury </em>for such period as the nature of the injury or the process of the recovery requires, subject to the limitations in ORS 656.225, including such medical services as may be required after a determination of permanent disability. In addition, for consequential and combined conditions described in ORS 656.005(7), the insurer or the self-insured employer shall cause to be provided only those medical services directed to medical conditions caused in major part by the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">ORS 656.005(7) defines \u201ccompensable injur/\u2019 as \u201can accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death\u201d and as subject to various limitations and exclusions. We have previously concluded that the meaning of \u201ccompensable injury\u201d in the context of ORS 656.245(l)(a) is the claimant\u2019s medical condition that is accepted for coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>by the insurer or employer. <em>See Sprague v. United States Bakery, </em>199 Or App 435, 112 P3d 362, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>200 Or App 569, 116 P3d 251 (2005) <em>(Sprague I), rev den, </em>340 Or 157 (2006); <em>SAIF v. Martinez, </em>219 Or App 182, 188, 182 P3d 873 (2008). In <em>Sprague I, </em>the claimant compensably tore his left meniscus in 1976. 200 Or App at 571. As a result of that injury, the claimant developed arthritis in his knee. More than 20 years later, his knee condition required total knee replacement surgery. However, in order for knee surgery to be effective, the claimant needed to lose a significant amount of weight. His doctor recommended gastric bypass surgery. The claimant submitted a medical services claim for gastric bypass surgery, asserting that the surgery was compensable under ORS 656.245(1)(a). The insurer denied the claim, and the board upheld the denial, reasoning that the claimant\u2019s knee condition was a \u201cconsequential condition\u201d and that it was not \u201ccaused in major part by the [compensable] injury\u201d under the second sentence of ORS 656.245(1)(a). <em>Id. </em>at 572. On review, we ultimately remanded for a consideration of whether the services were compensable under the first sentence of ORS 656.245(l)(a). In so doing, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201cThe first sentence in ORS 656.245(l)(a) begins with the phrase, \u2018For every compensable injury.\u2019 For purposes of application to claimant\u2019s circumstances, that phrase refers to the torn meniscus that claimant suffered while working for SAIF\u2019s insured. The next clause in the first sentence of the statute places the responsibility on employers and insurers to pay for medical services for \u2018conditions\u2019 caused in material part by the \u2018injury.\u2019 With regard to claimant\u2019s claim, the word \u2018conditions\u2019 in the phrase refers to claimant\u2019s knee condition, <em>i.e., </em>the need for a total knee replacement. * * * The word \u2018injury in that phrase refers again to claimant\u2019s torn meniscus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Id. </em>After remand, the board allowed the claim for gastric bypass surgery, and SAIF and the employer sought review. We affirmed the board, <em>SAIF v. Sprague, </em>221 Or App 413, 190 P3d 443 (2008) <em>(Sprague II), </em>and the Supreme Court ultimately affirmed our decision, <em>SAIF v. Sprague, </em>346 Or 661, 217 P3d 644 (2009) <em>(Sprague III), </em>albeit on different grounds. <em>See Sprague III, </em>346 Or at 672-75 (determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>claimant\u2019s arthritic knee condition was a \u201cconsequential condition,\u201d that it was caused in major part by the 1976 meniscus tear, and that the gastric bypass surgery was directed to that condition, thus satisfying the second sentence of ORS 656.245(1)(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In <em>Martinez, </em>which was decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sprague III, </em>we followed our analysis of the first sentence of ORS 656.245(l)(a) as we described it in <em>Sprague I. Martinez, </em>219 Or App at 190-91. The claimant in <em>Martinez </em>injured his left knee, and SAIF accepted a claim for a meniscus tear and a sprain of the medial collateral ligament. <em>Id. </em>at 184. The claimant received treatment, and, after his condition was determined to be medically stationary, his claim was closed. However, the claimant\u2019s knee continued to be a source of pain, and subsequent imaging studies revealed osteonecrosis in his knee. <em>Id. </em>at 184-85. The claimant\u2019s doctor recommended arthroscopic surgery, but SAIF refused to authorize payment for that service. <em>Id. </em>at 186. The board determined that the surgery was compensable under ORS 656.245. <em>Id. </em>at 187-88. On review, we affirmed, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cSignificantly for purposes of this case, we said in <em>Sprague </em>that the word \u2018conditions\u2019 as used in ORS 656.245(1)(a) refers to the claimant\u2019s <em>current </em>conditions for which treatment is sought, and not, as SAIF contends, to the accepted conditions. Also significantly for this case, we said that \u2018injury,\u2019 as used in ORS 656.245(1)(a) refers to the \u2018compensable injury,\u2019 which, in <em>Sprague, </em>we described as the condition that had been accepted by SAIF in the original claim \u2014 the torn meniscus. Thus, to establish the compensability of a medical treatment under ORS 656.245(1)(a), the condition for which treatment is sought need not be the accepted condition; however, the treatment must be necessitated in material part by the \u2018compensable injury,\u2019 which, we said in <em>Sprague, </em>is the condition previously accepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 191 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Here, the parties do not ask us to overrule or otherwise qualify our previous interpretation of \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d Nor do the parties argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sprague III </em>implicitly rejected our interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of that term.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, although the parties apparently differ in their interpretation of \u201ccompensable injury,\u201d they have not developed any argument addressing our prior interpretation or advancing a different construction of ORS 656.245(l)(a). In the absence of such an argument, we decline to revisit that interpretation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The board\u2019s order, although somewhat ambiguous, did purport to apply the standard we articulated in <em>Sprague I </em>and <em>Martinez </em>(\u201c[T]he evidence establishes that Dr. Koon believed that claimant\u2019s ongoing symptoms could be caused by the accepted contusion[.]\u201d). Applying that standard, this case reduces to the question of whether there is substantial evidence that the requested medical services \u2014 the facet joint injections \u2014 were \u201cfor conditions caused in material part by the injury\u201d under ORS 656.245(l)(a). As we explained in <em>Martinez, </em>the \u201cconditions\u201d are the current conditions for which treatment is sought \u2014 here, claimant\u2019s ongoing low back pain. The \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201ccompensable injury\u201d is the previously accepted condition \u2014 here, a low back contusion. Properly reframed, then, the issues are (1) whether the low back contusion is the material cause of claimant\u2019s ongoing low back pain and (2) whether the injections are \u201cfor\u201d that ongoing low back pain. <em>See Sprague III, </em>346 Or at 673 (setting forth a similar analysis under the second sentence of ORS 656.245(1)(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">There is substantial evidence in the record, based on Koon\u2019s testimony, that the injections are \u201cfor\u201d claimant\u2019s low back pain, and petitioners do not contend otherwise. Whether there is substantial evidence that the low back contusion is a material cause of claimant\u2019s low back pain is a closer question. A \u201cmaterial cause\u201d is a fact of consequence. <em>See Mize v. Comcast Corp-AT &amp; T Broadband, </em>208 Or App 563, 569-71, 145 P3d 315 (2006) (interpreting \u201cin material part\u201d in ORS 656.245(1)(a)). Thus, the compensable injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>could constitute a material cause if it makes <em>\u201cany </em>contribution\u201d to claimant\u2019s current condition. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Here, both doctors testified unequivocally that claimant\u2019s low back contusion had resolved. Koon agreed that \u201c[w]hat is going on here * * * has nothing to do with the contusion\u201d and that \u201cthe results of th[e] contusion are * * * no longer contributing\u201d to claimant\u2019s back pain. That testimony suggests that the contusion was not contributing <em>in any way </em>to claimant\u2019s continued low back pain; in other words, the contusion was not a material cause of claimant\u2019s current condition. Moreover, the record contains no evidence to the contrary. Koon\u2019s testimony that claimant might suffer from, among other things, a \u201cchronic contusion\u201d does not support an inference that claimant\u2019s accepted low back contusion was a material cause of his ongoing back pain. Rather, that testimony, viewed in context, merely indicates that Koon recognized that a chronic contusion was a theoretical possibility; he never indicated that, in his opinion, claimant\u2019s current back pain was caused in any way by a chronic contusion. Indeed, Koon believed that claimant\u2019s current symptoms were generated by the facet joints rather than the soft tissue, where the contusion injury was located. Thus, viewing the record as a whole, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding that the requisite causal connection had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The board also found, as a basis for determining that the injections were compensable, that the \u201cthe injections were necessary to determine the extent of claimant\u2019s compensable injury.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 656.245(l)(c)(H) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, medical services after the worker\u2019s condition is medically stationary are not compensable except for the following: * * * Services that are necessary to diagnose the worker\u2019s condition.\u201d); <em>Counts v. International Paper Co., </em>146 Or App 768, 771, 934 P2d 526 (1997) (\u201c[I]f diagnostic services are necessary to determine the cause or extent of a compensable injury, the tests are compensable whether or not the condition that is discovered as a result of them is compensable.\u201d); <em>Martinez, </em>219 Or App at 191 (same). Here, because the compensable injury had completely resolved and no longer contributed to any ongoing conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the injections were not necessary to determine the extent of that injury. Thus, the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> The imaging revealed a small right paracentral disc protrusion with an associated annular tear, mildly narrowed bilateral neural foramina, and early facet degeneration at L4-5.

At L3-4, there was moderate disc space narrowing and disc desiccation hut no central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\"> Koon later testified that lumbar facet syndrome is pain from the facet joints due to inflammation in the synovial lining of the j oint.
