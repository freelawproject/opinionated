Applying our recent decision in <em>Knox v. Nooth, </em>244 Or App 57, 260 P3d 562 (2011), we conclude that the trial court erred in denying petitioner\u2019s request for substitute counsel and requiring petitioner to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The relevant facts are few and undisputed. After being convicted of eight counts of encouraging child sex abuse in the second degree, ORS 163.686, petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>See </em>ORS 138.510 - 138.680 (establishing procedures for post-conviction relief claims). The trial court appointed an attorney, Mahony, to represent petitioner. Mahony filed a formal petition for post-conviction relief, alleging three claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Petitioner believed that Mahony needed to amend the petition to include additional claims. On February 18, 2010, after Mahony refused to amend the petition, petitioner filed a motion, as required by <em>Church v. Gladden, </em>244 Or 308, 417 P2d 993 (1966), asking the trial court to replace Mahony or instruct Mahony to amend the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">At a hearing on March 8, 2010, petitioner told the trial court that he \u201creally [did not] want to have Mr. Mahony any longer.\u201d The trial court informed petitioner that, if Mahony did not represent him, petitioner\u2019s \u201cother option\u201d was to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Regarding petitioner\u2019s request that he amend the petition, Mahony told the trial court that he had not amended the petition because petitioner had not provided him with requested information. Mahony explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cI wrote [petitioner] * * * and I said please explain with particularity why each of the 21 claims is a legitimate claim to be included in a formal petition. And I went through each one of the 21 claims and asked [petitioner] why; and I asked [petitioner] to send me a copy of each and every statement that [petitioner] believe[d] would\u2019ve been suppressed had a motion been filed, and copies of discovery that was not provided by [trial counsel]; and why [petitioner] believed the plea was not knowing, voluntary, or intelligently made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Mahony told the trial court that petitioner had \u201crefused to answer those questions.\u201d Mahony also told the trial court that he was \u201ctrying to figure out what the basis would be of these claims and why they\u2019re legitimate; and [petitioner] so far won\u2019t say why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In response, petitioner told the trial court, \u201cI have * * * explained every one of these claims [to Mahoney.] [H]e\u2019s asking me multiple times to give him the same explanation that I\u2019ve already given him.\u201d Petitioner also told the trial court, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go through this with somebody that I [have] to continually argue with over everything; over issues and exhibits that I might want put in and other things like that[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The trial court responded that it would \u201callow Mr. Mahony to withdraw * * * and indicate that [petitioner would] be <em>pro se.\u201d </em>At that point, trial was scheduled to be held more than four months later, in July 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Subsequently, on March 19, 2010, Mahony filed a motion to withdraw from petitioner\u2019s case. In the motion, Mahony stated that there had been a \u201ccomplete breakdown in the attorney/client relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">At an April 2, 2010, hearing, the trial court allowed petitioner to file his amended <em>pro se </em>petition. At the end of the hearing, the trial court asked petitioner whether there were any other matters that needed to be addressed, and petitioner told the trial court that he had filed a motion for new counsel. Petitioner explained that, although he had amended his petition, he wanted to make sure that he \u201cgot everything correct\u201d and that he had \u201cany assistance [he] might need to get * * * other exhibits in and what not[.]\u201d In response, the trial court told petitioner, \u201cWell, this is what [another judge] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>always says, if you want Mr. Mahony back, you can have him back but I\u2019m not going to give you different counsel. So it\u2019s your choice.\u201d Petitioner replied, \u201cI\u2019ll go by myself, I guess.\u201d The trial court subsequently issued an order granting Mahony\u2019s motion to withdraw on the ground that it was supported by \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On July 27,2010, the case went to trial. At the beginning of the trial, petitioner renewed his request for substitute counsel and his objection to having to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The trial court noted petitioner\u2019s objection for the record. After trial, the trial court denied post-conviction relief, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On appeal, petitioner argues that the trial court erred by denying his request for substitute counsel and requiring him to proceed <em>pro se. </em>For the reasons explained below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Under ORS 138.590, a petitioner in a post-conviction relief case has a right to appointed counsel. That right \u201cserves an essential role in the fair and efficient resolution of post-conviction cases.\u201d <em>Knox, </em>244 Or App at 65. A post-conviction court may deny a motion for substitute counsel and require a petitioner to proceed <em>pro se </em>\u201cwhen the need for an orderly and efficient judicial process compels the court to do that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. We review a post-conviction court\u2019s decision denying substitute counsel and requiring a petitioner to proceed <em>pro se </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In <em>Knox, </em>we considered whether the post-conviction court abused its discretion by denying the petitioner\u2019s request for substitute counsel and requiring the petitioner to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The facts of <em>Knox </em>are strikingly similar to those of this case. In <em>Knox, </em>the petitioner believed that his appointed counsel had not included all necessary claims in his post-conviction petition and filed a motion, as required by <em>Church, </em>asking the trial court to either replace his counsel or direct his counsel to amend the petition. The petitioner\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw on the ground that there had been an \u201c \u2018irreparable breakdown of the attorney/client relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62. The trial court granted the motion to withdraw and required the petitioner to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, asking the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to appoint substitute counsel or reappoint his former counsel, stating that he needed \u201c \u2018the assistance and advice of counsel regardless of how perfunctory that attorney is.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration and, after trial, denied post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The petitioner appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his request for substitute counsel and requiring him to proceed <em>pro se. </em>We reversed, concluding that the trial court had abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. In reaching that conclusion, we noted that the petitioner\u2019s request for substitute counsel concerned his first appointed counsel and was made about a month before the scheduled trial date (and the trial court later continued the trial for an additional four months). We also noted that the trial court appeared to have acted based on a \u201cgeneral policy\u201d of denying requests for substituted counsel \u201cwithout giving due consideration to the facts presented in each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. We held that the trial court \u201ccould not reasonably conclude that granting [the petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s] motion to withdraw and ordering [the] petitioner to proceed <em>pro se, </em>rather than substituting another appointed counsel * * *, was necessary to achieve a fair, orderly, and efficient resolution of petitioner\u2019s post-conviction case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Applying <em>Knox, </em>we conclude that the trial court in this case abused its discretion by denying petitioner\u2019s request for substitute counsel and requiring petitioner to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Mahony was petitioner\u2019s first appointed counsel and petitioner\u2019s request for substitute counsel was made more than four months before trial was scheduled. The trial court did not identify, and the record does not reveal, any circumstances from which the trial court could reasonably conclude that requiring petitioner to proceed <em>pro se </em>was \u201cnecessary to achieve a fair, orderly, and efficient resolution of petitioner\u2019s post-conviction case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, it appears that, as in <em>Knox, </em>the trial court\u2019s decision was based on a general policy of requiring petitioners to proceed either with their first appointed counsel or <em>pro se. </em>As described above, the trial court told petitioner that, if he did not proceed with Mahony, his \u201cother option\u201d was to proceed <em>pro se, </em>and that, in keeping with what another judge \u201calways\u201d said, petitioner could have Mahony back, but could not have substitute counsel. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>State v. Farmer, </em>210 Or App 625, 640, 152 P3d 904, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 645 (2007) (stating that \u201cabuse of discretion may occur * * * when a court fails to exercise its discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because petitioner\u2019s request for substitute counsel was based on petitioner\u2019s desire to amend the petition, which the trial court allowed him to do, and that, after petitioner amended the petition, he could have proceeded with Mahony but instead chose to proceed <em>pro se. </em>According to the state, \u201c[u]nder the circumstances, it cannot be said that the [trial court] abused its discretion.\u201d We disagree. The record demonstrates that petitioner sought substitute counsel in order to help him properly plead and prove the allegations in his post-conviction petition, even after he had amended the petition himself. Specifically, at the April 2 hearing \u2014 after petitioner amended the petition \u2014 petitioner told the trial court that he wanted \u201chelp\u201d and \u201cany assistance [he] might need,\u201d to make sure that he \u201cgot everything correct\u201d and \u201cto get other exhibits in and what not[.]\u201d At no point did petitioner abandon his request for substitute counsel. He first made the request in his motion filed on February 18, and he reiterated it at the hearings held on March 8 and April 2 and again at the trial held on July 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The trial court\u2019s offer to reappoint Mahony was not an adequate response to petitioner\u2019s continuing requests for counsel. Mahony had moved to withdraw from petitioner\u2019s case based on a \u201ccomplete breakdown in the attorney/client relationshipt,]\u201d and the trial court had granted that motion. Absent any evidence that the relationship had changed, the trial court erred by responding to petitioner\u2019s request for replacement counsel by offering to reappoint the same counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> Because we reverse and remand based on petitioner\u2019s assignment of error regarding the trial court\u2019s denial of his right to counsel, we do not reach his other assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"> Under <em>Church, </em>a post-conviction relief petitioner who believes that his counsel has \u201cfailed to follow any legitimate request\u201d cannot \u201csit idly by and later complain\u201d but instead \u201cmust inform the court at first opportunity of his attorney\u2019s failure and ask to have him replaced, or ask to have him instructed by the court to carry out petitioner\u2019s request.\u201d 244 Or at 311-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
