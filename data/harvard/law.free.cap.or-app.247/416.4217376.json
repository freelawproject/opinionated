He contends that, in the absence of supporting physical evidence, the trial court erred in admitting a physician\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cconcerning\u201d for sexual abuse. <em>See State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). Although defendant acknowledges that he did not raise that issue before the trial court, he argues that admission of that diagnosis was plain error under <em>Southard. See </em>ORAP 5.45(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with defendant that the trial court committed plain error in admitting the diagnosis and that it is proper for us to affirmatively exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). Therefore, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Defendant was a friend of the victim\u2019s family and co-owned a piece of property with the victim\u2019s father. The victim\u2019s family lived in a house on the property, and defendant also lived on the property in a travel trailer. The victim, a five-year-old boy, told his babysitter that defendant had licked his \u201cpee-pee\u201d and that \u201che had to touch [defendant\u2019s] pee-pee.\u201d He repeated those statements the next day to his mother, who soon thereafter called the child abuse hotline, and eventually scheduled an appointment for the victim at CARES Northwest and also talked with a detective about the victim\u2019s statements. At CARES, the victim was examined by Dr. Dan Leonhart and interviewed by a child abuse interviewer. The examination revealed no physical evidence of abuse. However, based on the victim\u2019s spontaneous disclosure of abuse to his babysitter as well as his statements to his mother, Leonhart made a diagnosis of \u201cconcerning\u201d for sexual abuse. Leonhart testified about that diagnosis during the trial with no objection from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In his testimony, Leonhart explained that \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201chighly concerning\u201d are in the \u201csame ballpark\u201d and that he often uses the terms \u201cinterchangeably.\u201d He testified that his diagnostic terminology is to address whether he does not \u201cthink there\u2019s anything to suggest [the abuse] happened\u201d or whether he is \u201cconcerned that something happened, or [is] actually diagnosing that something [happened] \u2014 * * * child maltreatment, in this case it would be sexual abuse.\u201d According to Leonhart, in this case, the most concerning thing was the victim\u2019s \u201caccidental\u201d disclosure to the babysitter, and he noted that \u201cthe child isn\u2019t intending to say something that\u2019s really going to get this process going, they are just saying something in [the] context of interacting with someone[.]\u201d There was also testimony presented at trial regarding the CARES treatment recommendations following the examination. Those recommendations included that the victim have no contact with defendant and receive individual counseling, as well as a support group for the victim\u2019s parents, and that the victim\u2019s parents not question the victim further about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">As noted, defendant argues on appeal that the admission of Leonhart\u2019s diagnosis, in the absence of physical evidence of abuse, was plain error and that we should exercise our discretion to correct the error. The state responds that because the doctor\u2019s diagnosis was \u201cconcerning\u201d for sexual abuse rather than a straight sexual abuse diagnosis, there is no plain error under <em>Southard. </em>Furthermore, the state contends that there are \u201ccompeting inferences about whether defendant wanted Leonhart\u2019s \u2018diagnosis\u2019 admitted into evidence.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Since <em>Southard, </em>this court had repeatedly held that, in the absence of physical evidence of abuse, a trial court\u2019s admission of a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse is plain error. <em>See, e.g., State v. Potts, </em>242 Or App 352, 353, 255 P3d 614 (2011); <em>State v. Clay, </em>235 Or App 26, 30, 230 P3d 72 (2010) (\u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s admission, following <em>Southard, </em>of a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence satisfies the requisites for \u2018plain error\u2019 under ORAP 5.45(1)[.]\u201d); <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 508-12, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (it is plain error to admit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence). We have so held even in circumstances where the diagnosis was \u201chighly concerning\u201d for sexual abuse. <em>See State v. Arriaza, </em>236 Or App 456, 457-58, 237 P3d 222 (2010) (the trial court\u2019s admission of a doctor\u2019s diagnosis of \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d was error apparent on the face of the record); <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 517, 228 P3d 666 (2010) (the trial court committed plain error in admitting, in the absence of physical evidence, a diagnosis of \u201chighly concerning of sexual abuse\u201d). Most recently, in <em>State v. Volynets-Vasylchenko, </em>246 Or App 632, 267 P3d 206 (2011), a case where the diagnosis itself was not admitted into evidence, we held that the trial court committed plain error under <em>Southard </em>in admitting, in the absence of physical findings, treatment recommendations that implied that a diagnosis had been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In <em>Merrimon, </em>the state attempted to distinguish the circumstances from those presented in <em>Southard, </em>pointing to the fact that the diagnosis was not a \u201cdefinitive diagnosis\u201d like that at issue in <em>Southard. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App at 520. We explained that, \u201c[l]ike the definitive diagnosis at issue in <em>Southard </em>\u2014 indeed, perhaps more so \u2014 a diagnosis of \u2018highly concerning of sexual abuse\u2019 without confirming physical evidence has marginal probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520-21. Furthermore, \u201csuch a diagnosis carries with it \u2018the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the [alleged] victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521 (quoting <em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 141) (brackets in <em>Merrimon). </em>Similarly here, the fact that the doctor made a diagnosis of \u201cconcerning\u201d for sexual abuse is not a basis on which to distinguish this case from the many cases in which we have concluded that the admission of a diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence is plain error. The doctor in this case explained that he uses the terms \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201chighly concerning\u201d for child sexual abuse interchangeably. As in <em>Merrimon, </em>such a diagnosis has marginal probative value and carries with it the implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s report is credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Nor do we find convincing the state\u2019s assertion that there are competing inferences regarding whether defendant wanted the diagnosis admitted. In support of its contention, the state points to defendant\u2019s discussion of the diagnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>during opening and closing arguments, which emphasized that the doctor was only \u201cconcerned\u201d about sexual abuse. According to the state, \u201cit is inferable that defense counsel intended to allow Dr. Leonhart\u2019s \u2018diagnosis\u2019 and testimony to create reasonable doubt as to whether [the victim] had been sexually abused.\u201d We rejected a similar argument in <em>Lovern. </em>In that case, the state contended that \u201cthe defense may have made a tactical choice not to properly object to [the medical expert\u2019s] diagnosis so that it could use that evidence to its own advantage!.]\u201d 234 Or App at 511. Based on the circumstances, we concluded that the inference that the state proposed was implausible. Similarly here, we are unpersuaded that there is a plausible inference that defendant did not object to the evidence because he wanted to use it to support his case. At the time of the trial in this case, which occurred before <em>Southard </em>was decided, this type of diagnosis evidence was understood to be admissible. <em>See State v. Wilson, </em>121 Or App 460, 465-66, 855 P2d 657, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 61 (1993) (the trial court did not err in admitting, in the absence of physical evidence, expert testimony that diagnosed a child as a victim of sexual abuse). Given that state of the law, the only inference that we draw from defendant\u2019s failure to object is that counsel understood that an objection would be futile and, instead, attempted, as much as possible, to combat any adverse effect the expert evidence would have on the jury\u2019s view of the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In sum, as we have concluded in \u201cdozens of cases involving unpreserved claims of error under <em>Southard,\u201d Volynets-Vasylchenko, </em>246 Or App at 638, we conclude that the trial court committed plain error in admitting the evidence in question. Furthermore, for the reasons set forth in <em>Lovern </em>and <em>Merrimon, </em>we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\"> Pursuant to ORAP 5.45(1), \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> Because we reverse and remand based on the admission of the diagnosis, we do not address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> For the same reasons, we are unpersuaded by the state\u2019s assertion that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case because \u201cthe record supports the inference that defendant made a conscious tactical decision not to object to Dr. Leonhart\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
