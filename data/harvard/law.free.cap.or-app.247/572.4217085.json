In this forcible entry and detainer (FED) action, defendants appealed a judgment for plaintiff, the property owner\u2019s management company. Defendants assigned error to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of ORS 90.385, the anti-retaliation statute. We concluded that the trial court correctly interpreted ORS 90.385, and affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In their motion for reconsideration, defendants now argue that (1) we incorrectly imported an \u201cintent to harm\u201d requirement into ORS 90.385, and (2) the opinion contains <em>dicta </em>that will have sweeping, dangerous, and presumably unintended consequences for tenants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We grant the petition for reconsideration and affirm the prior opinion as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">As described in our original decision, we take the facts from the trial court\u2019s findings and from unrebutted testimony, except as noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cDefendants rented a house owned by DeBoer and managed by plaintiff Elk Creek. Sometime before mid-May 2009 \u2014 the exact date is undetermined \u2014 defendant Gilbert, in a telephone call to DeBoer, complained about the electrical system on the property. Subsequently, DeBoer and the manager\u2019s employee, Gluch, did a \u2018walk-through\u2019 of the house. The walk-through occurred on May 19,2009. At that time, defendant Strittmatter complained again about the electrical system. A month later, DeBoer and Gluch did a follow-up walk-through with a licensed electrician. At that time, the electrician told DeBoer that the electrical wiring needed extensive work. The afternoon following the walk-through, defendants received a phone call from Gluch informing them that DeBoer had decided to end the month-to-month lease. The following day, defendants received a 30-day no-cause eviction notice accompanied by a note from Gluch that read, T am sorry that I have to give you the thirty days notice. [DeBoer] has several repairs including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>updating the electrical. If there is anything I can do please let me know.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201cDefendants did not leave the premises after the 30 days had expired, and plaintiff filed this eviction action. In their answer, defendants alleged that the 30-day no-cause notice was given because of their complaints and was, therefore, retaliatory under ORS 90.385, quoted below, and therefore impermissible. The case was tried before the court. Gluch testified that she did not know why DeBoer had decided to terminate the lease. DeBoer did not attend the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cThe trial court concluded that the termination was not for retaliatory reasons. Specifically, the court concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201c \u2018The concept of <em>retaliation (lex </em>talionis) has ancient foundations and in common language is easily understood in metaphors such as \u201can eye for an eye\u201d or \u201ca tooth for a tooth.\u201d The essence of the concept is that when one suffers a real or perceived wrong, a like injury will be inflicted upon the one who did the initial real or perceived harm. [Defendants] inflicted no wrong upon DeBoer when they noted some problems involving the electrical system. Nor did DeBoer attempt to respond in a wrongful manner by attempting to harm [defendants] by terminating their tenancy when such complaint(s) were made. In fact, it appears that during the tenancy DeBoer has spent considerable sums attempting to maintain the premises in a habitable condition during the tenancy, and took no action against [defendants] when they were previously in default on their rent. In fact, the conduct and circumstances involved in this case on the part of both the defendants and plaintiff are rather innocuous in this Court\u2019s opinion. The facts of this case do not in this Court\u2019s opinion establish that the tenancy termination constituted <em>retaliation </em>by DeBoer against [defendants] because they expressed at some point prior to the termination that they had some electrical concerns regarding the premises.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201c(Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.) Consequently, the trial court found in favor of plaintiff, and this appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201cORS 90.385 provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">\u201c \u2018(1) Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services, by serving a notice to terminate the tenancy or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession after:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201c \u2018(b) The tenant has made any complaint to the landlord that is in good faith and related to the tenancy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201c \u2018(3) If the landlord acts in violation of subsection (1) of this section the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in ORS 90.375 and has a defense in any retaliatory action against the tenant for possession.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">\u201cIn their brief, defendants focus on the meaning of the word \u2018retaliate.\u2019 They assert, \u2018The error here is not with the court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the absence of bad motives, but rather with the court\u2019s legal conclusion that some type of bad motive is necessary on the part of both a complaining tenant and a responding landlord.\u2019 The correct interpretation, they maintain, is a \u2018but for\u2019 test. However, in describing the \u201cbut for\u2019 test, they argue, as they did at trial, that, under a correct interpretation of ORS 90.385, a tenant establishes a rebuttable presumption of retaliation by showing the temporal proximity of the complaint and the eviction, thereby shifting the burden to the landlord, who can rebut the presumption by demonstrating a nonretaliatory reason for the termination. Plaintiff, in its brief, attempts to argue that, the trial court\u2019s finding of fact to the contrary notwithstanding, defendants never complained. In the alternative, plaintiff argues that we should apply the dictionary definition of \u2018retaliate,\u2019 which requires an intention to do harm. At oral argument, defendants once again argued for the burden-shifting analysis and for a definition of \u2018retaliate\u2019 that did not require intent to harm, while plaintiff, somewhat surprisingly, conceded that, if there was a complaint, and if the termination would not have happened \u2018but for\u2019 that complaint, then the termination <em>was </em>retaliatory. To further complicate the matter, the trial court found as fact that there <em>was </em>a but for connection between the complaint and the termination (\u2019From these facts it is a reasonable inference that Gilbert\u2019s conversation(s) with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>DeBoer as well as Gluch\u2019s concern with the [electrical] service mast caused DeBoer to want to do the initial walk-through * * *.\u2019) and also that there was <em>not </em>a but for connection (\u2018Defendants\u2019 contention appears to be that this Court should infer that tenancy termination would never had occurred but for Gilbert\u2019s complaints. Such an inference is not possible from the evidence in this case.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><em>Elk Creek Management Co., </em>244 Or \u00c1pp at 384-87 (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On appeal, defendants argued that the trial court erred in ruling that, to be retaliatory, an eviction has to be driven by an intent to harm. In defendants\u2019 view, the court should have applied a \u201cbut for\u201d test: Would the eviction have occurred if defendants had not complained? Once tenants established \u201cbut for\u201d causation, defendants asserted, the burden shifted to the landlord to establish that the eviction was not in retaliation for the tenants\u2019 complaint. A \u201cbut for\u201d standard, defendants argued, was more consistent with the legislative intent behind the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act (ORLTA). <em>Id. </em>at 386-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">After reviewing ORS 90.385, we disagreed with defendants. We found that the statute is silent regarding the definition of retaliation or burden-shifting. In addition, the legislative history showed that petitioner\u2019s position was untenable. We noted that there was anti-retaliation language in the original ORLTA, adopted in 1973, and that the original statute did create a rebuttable presumption: If the landlord filed an eviction notice within six months of the tenants\u2019 complaint, there was a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted in retaliation for the complaint. However, a 1979 amendment eliminated a rebuttable presumption of retaliation. We concluded that, under the current version of ORS 90.385, a tenant can no longer rely on a chronology of a tenant\u2019s complaint followed by a landlord\u2019s notice of eviction to establish a presumption of retaliation that a landlord must rebut. Now, the tenant must affirmatively establish retaliation. Therefore, we set out to define the term \u201cretaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We stated that, when construing a statute, we give words of common usage their plain and ordinary meaning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>According to <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1938 (unabridged ed 2002), to \u201cretaliate\u201d means to \u201crepay or requite in kind (as an injury),\u201d or \u201cto put or inflict in return.\u201d We noted that defendants neither suggested that retaliate was a term of legal art nor cited any usage or definition of the term that did not involve an intent to compensate for harm by inflicting harm in return. We were not persuaded by defendants\u2019 argument that the context and purpose of the ORLTA required a broader meaning for \u201cretaliate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389-90. We therefore concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">\u201cThe concept of retaliation as the term is used in ORS 90.385 involves an intention on the part of the landlord to cause some sort of disadvantage to the tenant, motivated by an injury (or perceived injury) that the tenant has caused the landlord.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On reconsideration, defendants assert that we erred by addressing the effect of the 1979 amendment on the meaning of ORS 90.385(3) concerning creation of a tenant\u2019s defense based on a landlord\u2019s retaliation. Defendants argue that we should have focused on the proper legal standard to apply to achieve the legislature\u2019s purpose and intent in enacting ORS 90.385. However, as we stated in the opinion, our task was to interpret the statute correctly, regardless of the parties\u2019 interpretations and concessions. <em>Id. </em>at 387; <em>see Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997). Moreover, we addressed precisely the issue that defendants raised on appeal, namely \u201cthe [trial] court\u2019s legal conclusion that some type of bad motive is necessary on the part of both a complaining tenant and a responding landlord.\u201d <em>Elk Creek Management Co., </em>244 Or App at 386. We will not revisit that same issue of statutory construction on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Defendants also contend that our opinion contains <em>dicta </em>that may be seriously harmful to tenants. Defendants are concerned about two passages. The first is a sentence at 244 Or App at 389 that states that the 1979 legislative history is illuminating and that, \u201cunder the current version of ORS 90.385, <em>a tenant cannot rely on chronology </em>\u2014 a complaint soon followed by a notice of eviction \u2014 to establish a presumption of retaliation that the landlord must then rebut.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Defendants are concerned that the language used to describe the legislative history means that chronology can never be used to establish retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The second passage defendants are concerned about is the paragraph at 244 Or App at 390, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\u201cWe agree that requiring a retaliatory motive might decrease a tenant\u2019s confidence that his or her complaint will not lead to eviction. A tenant may realize that an opportunistic landlord could, with no intent to inflict a retributory injury whatsoever, evict the tenant because the landlord could not afford to make the repairs or decided to take the property off the market completely. Such a landlord has not violated ORS 90.385 simply because the eviction follows on the heels of a tenant\u2019s complaint, at least as the statute is now written \u2014 the product, as the legislative history cited above demonstrates, of political compromise between interests representing landlords and tenants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>Dictum </em>is not binding on the court, and <em>we </em>do not apply <em>dictum </em>that provides no useful guidance. <em>See Godfrey v. Fred Meyer Stores, </em>202 Or App 673, 680, 124 P3d 621 (2005) (\u201cOrdinarily, <em>dictum </em>\u2014 even Oregon Supreme Court dictum\u2014 about the construction of a statute has no particular precedential force.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Specifically, defendants express concern that our <em>dictum </em>expands the scope of exceptions under ORS 90.385(4) to excuse otherwise unlawful evictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary to petitioner\u2019s assertion, the cited statements do not create new exceptions under ORS 90.385(4); rather, they underscore our holding that a tenant alleging retaliation by the landlord under ORS 90.385(1) has the burden of proof to show an improper intent by the landlord. We lack the authority to create a new statutory exception, because we can neither insert into a statute language the legislature has omitted nor omit from a statute language that the legislature has inserted. ORS 174.010. Nonetheless, for clarity, we now retract the paragraph at 244 Or App at 390 quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Defendants also contend that our <em>dictum </em>will require revision of standard court forms and self-help brochures that indicate tenants cannot be evicted by their landlords for complaining about needed repairs. However, the Uniform Civil Jury Instruction No. 80.02 (Retaliation for Complaint to Landlord \u2014 As Defense to No-Cause Eviction) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\">\u201cThe tenant must prove the landlord retaliated against the tenant for a complaint made by the tenant or by someone acting on the tenant\u2019s behalf, or to evade a legal duty owed to the tenant that the landlord is required to fill. <em>If the landlord\u2019s motivation is not retaliatory, the tenant has not proved the defense.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the uniform jury instruction is consistent with our conclusion that a landlord\u2019s motivation <em>(i.e., </em>state of mind) matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Finally, defendants seek guidance on how tenants can meet the legal standard to establish intent in future cases. Defendants propose that the timing of events is relevant to whether a tenant has a retaliation claim or defense under ORS 90.385 and urge us to adopt the proposition that a reasonable trier of fact, in light of the facts in a given case, may draw a permissible inference that the landlord\u2019s act was motivated by the tenant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">This suggestion is not inconsistent with our opinion. We recognized that, by eliminating the burden-shifting scheme, the legislature discarded temporal proximity as sufficient for a tenant to establish a <em>prima facie </em>rebuttable presumption of retaliation that would shift the burden to the landlord to demonstrate the eviction was nonretaliatory. <em>Elk Creek Management </em>Co., 244 Or App at 389. Whether the trier of fact can consider timing alone or in connection with any other facts a tenant may adduce to draw an inference about the landlord\u2019s improper motive is a different issue. We are limited to evaluating the facts and circumstances before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issues facing us in this case require us to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>meaning of \u201cretaliate\u201d in ORS 90.385 and not to advise parties on how to meet the legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In sum, we adhere to our original opinion, with the modification of deleting the paragraph at 244 Or App at 390, quoted above, and this clarification as to the <em>dictum </em>about <em>chronology. </em>We were discussing legislative history only and concluded, based on that legislative history, that a tenant cannot rely solely on chronology to establish a presumption of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> In 2011, the legislature amended ORS 90.385.
