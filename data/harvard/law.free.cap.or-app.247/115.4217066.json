We conclude that the board did not err in overturning the penalty based on that conduct; however, the case must nonetheless be remanded so that the board can determine in the first instance the amount of penalty to which claimant is entitled as a result of ComPro\u2019s unreasonable delay in paying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The facts are undisputed. In January 2008, claimant, a camera operator, suffered a compensable injury while working for Fox Sports NW/Entertainment Partners/ GEP BTL, LLC (Fox Sports) when a car backed over his foot. At the time of his injury, claimant was employed as a camera operator by other employers as well, including Pacific Coast Cameras (Pacific Coast) and the Portland Trail Blazers. Claimant lost wages from all of his employments as a result of his injury. AIG, on behalf of Fox Sports, accepted a claim for left foot contusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">ORS 656.210(2)(a)(B) provides that, when a worker is employed in more than one job at the time of injury, the worker\u2019s weekly wage is to be ascertained \u201cby adding all earnings the worker was receiving from all subject employment.\u201d Thus, because claimant worked for more than one employer at the time of his injury, claimant\u2019s wage loss replacement benefits were to be calculated based on the wages from all employment and not just the wages from the job at which the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">OAR 436-060-0035 sets forth the processing requirements for wage loss replacement benefits when a worker has multiple employers at the time of injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rule characterizes wage loss replacement benefits for secondary jobs as \u201csupplemental disability.\u201d OAR 436-060-0035(l)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>To be entitled to supplemental disability benefits, within 30 days of receipt of an initial claim, the worker must notify the insurer that he or she was employed by more than one employer at the time of the injury. ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A). Then, pursuant to OAR 436-060-0035(3), within five business days of receiving notice or knowledge of employment in addition to the worker\u2019s primary job, the insurer must send the worker an initial notice informing the worker of the type of information that the insurer or the assigned processing administrator must receive to determine the worker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>eligibility for supplemental disability. The insurer must also clearly advise the worker, in the initial notice, that the insurer must receive verifiable documentation within 60 days of the mailing date of the notice or the worker will be found ineligible for supplemental disability. OAR 436-060-0035(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The worker\u2019s verifiable documentation must be received within 60 days of the insurer\u2019s mailing of its request for documentation. ORS 656.210(2)(b)(B). The department has determined by administrative rule that \u201cverifiable documentation\u201d is notice to the insurer of the multiple employments, the time periods of those employments, and adequate information to allow the insurer to calculate the worker\u2019s average weekly wage at those employments under OAR 436-060-0025. OAR 436-060-0035(l)(f). The insurer is required to determine eligibility for supplemental disability within 14 days of receiving the worker\u2019s verifiable documentation. OAR 436-060-0035(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">AIG, which was Fox Sports\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, sent a letter to claimant advising him that he might be eligible for supplemental disability benefits. Because AIG had elected not to process a claim for supplemental disability benefits, <em>see </em>ORS 656.210(5)(b); OAR 436-060-0035(l)(a), AIG referred claimant to ComPro, which administers supplemental disability benefits on behalf of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division when an insurer elects not to process and pay such benefits. As the assigned processing administrator, ComPro took over the processing of claimant\u2019s claim on March 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In a letter to claimant dated April 3, 2008, ComPro notified claimant of the steps that would be necessary for bim to receive supplemental disability benefits, including providing verifiable documentation sufficient to determine claimant\u2019s average weekly wage at all subject employment and his wages lost as a result of the injury. ComPro specifically advised claimant that he would need to provide sufficient information from which ComPro could determine claimant\u2019s combined average weekly wage from all Oregon subject employments. ComPro included a form for claimant to send to all of his secondary employers that could be completed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>provide all of the necessary information. ComPro\u2019s letter advised claimant to \u201c[a]sk your secondary employer(s) to complete this form (copy is acceptable) then return it to our offices with adequate information to calculate your average weekly wage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">On April 16, 2008, ComPro received a letter from claimant\u2019s attorney forwarding letters from two of claimant\u2019s secondary employers: an April 4 letter from the Trail Blazers\u2019s vice-president of broadcasting explaining that claimant was \u201cone of Blazers Broadcasting\u2019s freelance camera operators\u201d and including a list of the work dates missed because of the injury and stating claimant\u2019s rate of pay; and an April 7 letter from Pacific Coast listing the dates on which claimant had been unable to work because of his injury and claimant\u2019s rate of pay for the missed shows. Neither employer had completed and returned the form that ComPro had enclosed in its April 3 letter to claimant, and neither letter stated explicitly that claimant was an employee as of the date of his injury or provided claimant\u2019s preinjury wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On the same date that it received the letters from claimant\u2019s attorney, ComPro sent claimant a letter, with a copy to his attorney, advising that the information that had been provided was insufficient to determine claimant\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability benefits. The letter specifically requested payroll records from claimant\u2019s other employers showing claimant\u2019s gross wages at the time of injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201cOn 04/16/2008, we received your response to our initial contact letter. You provided insufficient information for us to determine your eligibility for Supplemental Disability Benefits. We need payroll records from your other employers that show your gross wages at the time of (i.e.: up to, but not after) your injury. Please refer to the enclosed <em>Initial Eligibility Determination </em>form for the specific information needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cWe will determine if you are eligible to be paid supplemental disability benefits once we receive the requested information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">(Italics and boldface in original.) ComPro included with the letter the same form that it had provided to claimant with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>April 3 letter. ComPro heard nothing further from claimant and did not make any further investigation of claimant\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">On June 2, 2008, the sixtieth day from the date of mailing of its request for verification, ComPro notified claimant that he was ineligible for supplemental disability benefits for the reason that claimant\u2019s \u201csecondary employment with Pacific Coast Camera * * * and/or Trail Blazers Inc, was NOT as a subject worker of an Oregon subject employer.\u201d ComPro advised that its determination was subject to review if claimant were to provide \u201cverifiable documentation\u201d and information substantiating that he was \u201ca subject worker of an Oregon subject employer at the time of injury.\u201d The letter noted that \u201cverifiable documentation\u201d means \u201cinformation which provides: identification of the Oregon subject employer(s) and the time period that establishes the worker held the secondary job, in addition to the primary job, at the time of injury; and adequate information to calculate the average weekly wage in accordance with OAR 436-060-0025.\u201d Claimant requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In August 2008, claimant\u2019s attorney received wage information from the Trail Blazers and Pacific Coast, and on August 21, he forwarded that information to ComPro\u2019s counsel. On September 2, ComPro\u2019s attorney notified claimant\u2019s attorney that, although some information was still missing, ComPro had the information necessary to determine whether claimant was eligible for supplemental disability benefits. On September 9, ComPro notified claimant and his counsel that claimant was eligible for benefits. The matter proceeded to hearing on September 10 on the issue of penalties and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Simmons, ComPro\u2019s claims adjuster, testified at the hearing that, in determining that claimant was ineligible for supplemental disability, ComPro was primarily concerned with the statement in the letter from the Trail Blazers that claimant was a \u201cfreelance\u201d camera operator, suggesting to ComPro that claimant was an independent contractor. He also testified that the letter from Pacific Coast did not describe the nature of claimant\u2019s employment relationship. He testified that, on the advice of the Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Division of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, ComPro does not directly contact a claimant\u2019s other employers to verify employment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">An ALJ determined that, based on its obligation to process claims under ORS 656.262(1), once it had been informed by claimant that he had multiple employers, ComPro was required, and had failed, to conduct an independent investigation of claimant\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability benefits before issuing a determination of ineligibility. The ALJ assessed a penalty of 25 percent and attorney fees of $2,000, pursuant to ORS 656.262(ll)(a), for the unreasonable notice of ineligibility. Because ComPro conceded that it had all the information necessary to pay supplemental disability benefits to claimant as of August 21, 2008, but had not yet paid them as of the date of the hearing, the ALJ awarded an additional assessed attorney fee of $1,000 for the late payment of benefits \u2014 that is, ComPro\u2019s failure to pay claimant\u2019s supplemental disability benefits within 14 days of its determination that it had verifiable documentation of claimant\u2019s eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">ComPro appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to the board, challenging only the assessment of a penalty and attorney fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) for unreasonable issuance of the ineligibility determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The initial question that the board addressed was whether ComPro had an affirmative duty under the applicable statutes to investigate a claimant\u2019s entitlement to supplemental disability benefits once it received information from a claimant that the claimant had multiple employers. Claimant asserted that, after claimant had provided the initial information of his multiple employments, ComPro was reasonably required to investigate in order to verify the information that it had received from claimant and that a determination of ineligibility was unreasonable without such investigation. ComPro asserted that claimant had a responsibility to provide \u201cverifiable documentation\u201d of his eligibility and that, here, claimant did not do so before August 21, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The board determined that it is the claimant\u2019s duty under ORS 656.210(2)(b) and OAR 436-060-0035(l)(f) to submit \u201cverifiable documentation\u201d in order to obtain supplemental disability benefits and that the statutes do not place on the insurer any obligation to independently obtain information necessary to confirm the worker\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability benefits. Thus, the board concluded that it is the worker\u2019s responsibility to provide the documentation necessary to trigger the insurer\u2019s obligation to process and pay supplemental benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">ORS 656.262(ll)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cIf the insurer or self-insured employer unreasonably delays or unreasonably refuses to pay compensation, * * * the insurer or self-insured employer shall be liable for an additional amount up to 25 percent of the amounts then due plus any attorney fees assessed under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">As the board correctly notes, the standard for determining whether an insurer has unreasonably delayed or resisted payment of compensation is whether, in light of the information available to the insurer at the time, the insurer had a legitimate doubt as to its liability. <em>International Paper Co. v. Huntley, </em>106 Or App 107, 110, 806 P2d 188 (1991); <em>Brown v. Argonaut Insurance Company, </em>93 Or App 588, 591, 763 P2d 408 (1988). The board found that the information that ComPro had at the time of its notice of ineligibility did not provide verification of claimant\u2019s status as a subject worker employed by a subject employer at the time of his injury or provide any preinjury wage information necessary to calculate claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. The board determined that, in light of the information that it had from claimant at the time that it issued its determination of ineligibility, ComPro had a legitimate doubt as to its liability with respect to both the Trail Blazers and Pacific Coast. Thus, the board concluded that ComPro\u2019s action in issuing the June 2, 2008, determination of ineligibility was reasonable, and it reversed the ALJ\u2019s assessment of a penalty and related attorney fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">On judicial review, claimant asserts that the board erred in overturning the ALJ\u2019s award of a penalty and attorney fee under ORS 656.262(ll)(a), contending that ComPro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>had no legitimate doubt as to claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits. Claimant\u2019s underlying legal contention in support of his assertion is that, contrary to the board\u2019s conclusion, before issuing its notice of ineligibility, ComPro had a legal obligation to conduct an independent investigation of claimant\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability benefits. Claimant also contends that, in evaluating the reasonableness of ComPro\u2019s actions, the inquiry must be limited to whether ComPro had a legitimate doubt about claimant\u2019s eligibility to receive supplemental disability benefits based on the justification that ComPro provided in its letter to claimant \u2014 that claimant\u2019s employment was not as a subject worker. Finally, claimant contends that the board\u2019s conclusion in this case is inconsistent with the board\u2019s own case law, <em>In the Matter of Nada Lovre, </em>56 Van Natta 598 (2004), in which the board held that the processing of a claim for supplemental disability benefits \u201cis the responsibility of the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Initially we note that there can be no reasonable dispute that, on this record, claimant did not provide ComPro with \u201cverifiable documentation,\u201d as defined by OAR 436-060-0035, within 60 days of ComPro\u2019s request. Within that 60-day period, claimant had not provided information from which ComPro could determine that claimant had been employed by the Trail Blazers or Pacific Coast on the date of his injury. Nor did the letters provide documentation from which ComPro could determine claimant\u2019s average weekly wage under OAR 436-060-0025.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, pursuant to ORS 656.210(2)(b) and OAR 436-060-0035(3)(b), ComPro was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>required to determine that claimant was ineligible for supplemental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Claimant asserts in any event that, as the ALJ determined, ComPro\u2019s conduct in issuing the determination of ineligibility was unreasonable because, after claimant initially notified ComPro of his multiple employments, ComPro failed to make an independent investigation of claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits. Specifically, claimant contends that if, as Simmons testified, ComPro\u2019s primary concern was that claimant was not employed as a subject worker (but was, rather, an independent contractor), then ComPro could have resolved that concern with a simple telephone call. Thus, in claimant\u2019s view, the issuance of the ineligibility determination without making that inquiry was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The simple answer, as the board held, is that the statutes and administrative rule imposed no such investigative obligation on ComPro. ORS 656.210(2)(b) makes clear that, as a prerequisite to eligibility for supplemental disability, it is the claimant\u2019s obligation to provide verifiable documentation of secondary employment. OAR 436-060-0035 sets out the information that a claimant is required to submit to establish verifiable documentation. Thus, we conclude that ComPro had no independent obligation to seek out information necessary to determine claimant\u2019s weekly wage or to determine that claimant was a subject worker on the date of his injury. Nor did it have an obligation to confirm whether claimant was an employee or an independent contractor. It was claimant\u2019s obligation to provide that information. <em>Cf. </em>ORS 656.262(1) (processing claims and providing compensation is responsibility of insurer or self-insured employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Claimant contends nonetheless that the information that ComPro had on June 3, 2008, concerning claimant\u2019s employment with the Trail Blazers and Pacific Coast gave it no reason to conclude that claimant was other than an employee and that it therefore could have had no legitimate doubt as to claimant\u2019s status as a subject worker; thus, claimant contends, the basis for ComPro\u2019s determination of ineligibility was unreasonable. However, as noted, the letter from the Trail Blazers described claimant as a \u201cfreelance\u201d camera <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>operator; based on that description, ComPro could reasonably question whether claimant was an employee or an independent contractor for the Trail Blazers. Further, regardless of whether ComPro had a basis to question whether claimant was an employee of Pacific Coast, claimant\u2019s eligibility depended on more than his status as a subject worker. In light of our conclusions that claimant had not provided ComPro with verifiable documentation of his eligibility within 60 days of ComPro\u2019s request, as required by ORS 656.210(2)(b) and OAR 436-060-0035, and, further, that ComPro had no independent obligation to seek out verifiable documentation of claimant\u2019s eligibility, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s determination that ComPro acted reasonably in issuing a determination of ineligibility. <em>Brown, </em>93 Or App at 591 (setting forth substantial evidence standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In addition to determining that ComPro had unreasonably determined that claimant was ineligible for supplemental disability benefits, the ALJ determined that ComPro had unreasonably delayed payment of benefits once it had sufficient information to determine that claimant was eligible. The ALJ correctly determined, however, that only one penalty could be assessed on the amount then due under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) and did not assess a separate penalty for the unreasonable claim processing. In light of our conclusion that the board did not err in overturning the penalty based on the issuance of the ineligibility determination, we conclude that the case must be remanded to the board for it to determine in the first instance the amount of penalty to be assessed for ComPro\u2019s delay in paying compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Remanded for reconsideration of amount of penalty for untimely payment of compensation; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> OAR 436-060-0035 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A20\">\u201c(1) For the purpose of this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201c(a) \u2018Assigned processing administrator\u2019 is the company or business that the director has selected and authorized to process and pay supplemental disability benefits on behalf of the director, when the insurer has elected not to process and pay these benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">\u201c(b) \u2018Primary job\u2019 means the job at which the injury occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201c(c) \u2018Secondary job\u2019 means any other job(s) held by the worker in Oregon subject employment at the time of injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201c(d) \u2018Temporary disability\u2019 means wage loss replacement for the primary job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201c(e) \u2018Supplemental disability<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> means wage loss replacement for the secondary job(s) that exceeds the temporary disability, up to, but not exceeding, the maximum established by ORS 656.210.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">\u201c(f) \u2018Verifiable documentation\u2019 means information that provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">\u201c(A) Identification of the Oregon subject employer(s) and the time period that establishes the worker held the secondary job, in addition to the primary job, at the time of injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">\u201c(B) Adequate information to calculate the average weekly wage in accordance with OAR 436-060-0025.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">\u201c(3) Within five business days of receiving notice or knowledge of employment in addition to the primary job on a claim on which the temporary disability rate for the primary job does not meet or exceed the maximum rate, the insurer must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">\u201c(a) Send the worker an initial notice informing the worker what type of information the insurer or the assigned processing administrator must receive to determine the worker\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-16\">\u201c(b) Clearly advise the worker, in the initial notice, that the insurer must receive verifiable documentation within 60 days of the mailing date of the notice or the worker shall be found ineligible for supplemental disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-18\">\u201c(4) The initial notice in section (3) must inform the worker that if the verifiable documentation is not received, the insurer will determine the worker\u2019s temporary disability rate based only on the job at which the injury occurred.
