ORS 426.130(l)(b)(C); ORS 426.005(l)(e)(B). Appellant seeks reversal of the judgment, asserting: (1) the trial court violated ORS 426.100(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires trial courts to provide allegedly mentally ill persons with certain information before civil commitment hearings; (2) the violation constitutes plain error, <em>see </em>ORAP 5.45(1); and (3) we should exercise our discretion to review the error. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415 (2007),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we agree and, therefore, reverse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The relevant facts are few. Appellant, who has a history of mental illness, was involuntarily hospitalized on a physician\u2019s hold. ORS 426.232. After a mental health investigator determined that there was probable cause to believe that appellant was subject to civil commitment, the trial court held a civil commitment hearing. ORS 426.070. Appellant was not present for the hearing. At the beginning of the hearing, the trial court and appellant\u2019s counsel engaged in the following colloquy .regarding appellant\u2019s absence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: * * * [T]his is Case No. 5772. And [appellant] is represented at this hearing by her attorney * * * who was appointed to represent her. She is not present. And according to [appellant\u2019s counsel], that is at her own \u2014 with her consent. Is that correct * * *?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor. Basically, we were left with two choices \u2014 either continue it, or proceed without her because of her currently being restrained. And after discussing the options with her, and the impacts of both, she decided that we \u2018might as well have it today,\u2019 in her words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Alright. So, that obviously means we can dispense with the explanation to her of her procedural and due process rights. And so, we\u2019ll go straight to the State\u2019s case. [State\u2019s counsel], you can call your first witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Because appellant was not present, the trial court did not provide her with the information required by ORS 426.100(1). Nor did the court determine whether appellant had waived her right to be advised of that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">As we have held, to comply with ORS 426.100(1), \u201ca trial court in a civil commitment proceeding must either advise the allegedly mentally ill person directly regarding those rights or conduct an examination on the record to determine whether a valid waiver of the right to be advised has been knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>State v. Ritzman, </em>192 Or App 296, 298, 84 P3d 1129 (2004) (citing <em>State v. May, </em>131 Or App 570, 571, 888 P2d 14 (1994)). A trial court\u2019s failure to advise a person as required or to determine whether the person has waived his or her right to be so advised, \u201cis not only error, but it is plain error that we exercise our discretion to consider despite an appellant\u2019s failure to raise and preserve the issue at the hearing.\u201d <em>Ritzman, </em>192 Or App at 298 (citing <em>State v. Tardanico, </em>132 Or App 230, 231, 888 P2d 15 (1994)). Accordingly, we have exercised our discretion to review trial court violations of ORS 426.100(1) as plain error in numerous cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. M. T., </em>244 Or App 299, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>304, 258 P2d 1288 (2011); <em>State v. Murphy, </em>146 Or App 772, 773, 934 P2d 210 (1997); <em>Tardanico, </em>132 Or App at 231; <em>State v. Allison, </em>129 Or App 47, 50, 877 P2d 660 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">In <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991), the Supreme Court stated that, \u201cin deciding whether to exercise its discretion to consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record,\u201d a court may consider, among other factors,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way, <em>i.e., </em>whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Considering those factors, plain error review of violations of ORS 426.100(1) is justified by the nature of civil commitment proceedings, the relative interests of the parties in those proceedings, the gravity of the violation, and the ends of justice. As we have observed, a civil commitment has serious consequences. <em>See, e.g., State v. D. R., </em>239 Or App 576, 582, 244 P3d 916 (2010) (a \u201cserious deprivation of liberty and social stigma * * * are attendant to a civil commitment\u201d); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>G. <em>L., </em>238 Or App 546, 558, 243 P3d 469 (2010) (civil commitment \u201cdeprives a person of his or her constitutionally protected liberty interest, and carries deleterious collateral effects, including a social stigma which affects the person\u2019s reputation and earning potential\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). The purpose of ORS 426.100(1) is to ensure that, before an allegedly mentally ill person suffers those consequences, he or she receives \u201cthe benefit of a full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>129 Or App at 50. If a court does not provide a person with all of the information required by ORS 426.100(1), the person does \u201cnot receive that benefit.\u201d <em>State v. Grellert, </em>144 Or App 201, 203, 925 P2d 161 (1996). Thus, as we have held, failure to provide a person with that information constitutes an \u201cegregious\u201d error that justifies plain error review. <em>Tardanico, </em>132 Or App at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In this case, the state concedes that the trial court violated ORS 426.100(1) and acknowledges that we have held that a violation of ORS 426.100(1) \u201cis not only error, but it is plain error that we exercise our discretion to consider[.]\u201d <em>Ritzman, </em>192 Or App at 298. Nevertheless, the state argues that we should not exercise our discretion to review the error in this case because, according to the state, appellant\u2019s counsel advised appellant of the information required by ORS 426.100(1). The state asserts, \u201cIt is clear that [appellant] was advised of [her procedural and due process rights] by her attorney.\u201d As we understand it, the state\u2019s argument is that, because appellant\u2019s counsel actually advised appellant of the information required by ORS 426.100(1), the trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The state\u2019s argument is not supported by the record. The state bases its assertion that appellant\u2019s counsel advised appellant of the information required by ORS 426.100(1) on the above-quoted colloquy between the trial court and appellant\u2019s counsel. In that colloquy, appellant\u2019s counsel referred to \u201ctwo choices\u201d that he discussed with appellant: \u201ceither to continue [the hearing], or proceed without her because of her currently being restrained.\u201d He reported that, \u201cafter discussing the options with her, and the impacts of both, she decided that we \u2018might as well have it today[.]\u2019 \u201d Thus, the record establishes that appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s discussion with appellant regarding her \u201cchoices\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d related to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to continue the hearing to another day or proceed with the hearing in her absence; that discussion provides no basis for finding that appellant\u2019s counsel provided appellant with all of the information required by ORS 426.100(1). There is, for example, no basis for finding that appellant\u2019s counsel advised appellant of her right to subpoena witnesses. ORS 426.100(l)(d). Given the lack of detail in the record regarding appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s discussion with appellant, we cannot accept the state\u2019s assertion that appellant\u2019s counsel actually advised appellant of all of the information required by ORS 426.100(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">That is important because, when determining whether a trial court\u2019s failure to provide an allegedly mentally ill person with the information required by ORS 426.100(1) is harmless, we focus on whether the appellant received all of the information from another source. Two cases illustrate our analytical approach: <em>Ritzman, </em>192 Or App at 296, and <em>State v. Scharf, </em>201 Or App 71, 116 P3d 949 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In <em>Ritzman, </em>we held that the trial court\u2019s failure to advise the appellant of the information required by ORS 426.100(1) was harmless because the appellant had received a written notice that contained all of the required information, the notice had been read to her, and she had signed and dated it. 192 Or App at 301-02. In contrast, in <em>Scharf, </em>we held that the trial court\u2019s failure to advise the appellant of the information required by ORS 426.100(1) was not harmless because, although the appellant had been given a written citation that contained information similar to the required information, he had not signed or dated the citation. 201 Or App at 74. We explained that, \u201cwithout an acknowledgement from appellant that he actually read the citation, we cannot conclude that he was adequately advised of his rights as we did in <em>Ritzman.\u201d Scharf, </em>201 Or App at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">As discussed, the record in this case provides no basis for finding that appellant received \u2014 from her counsel or any other source \u2014 the information required by ORS 426.100(1). Therefore, as in <em>Scharf, </em>\u201cwe cannot conclude that [appellant] was adequately advised of [her] rights,\u201d 201 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>App at 74, and the state\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) was harmless is unavailing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> ORS 426.100 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201c(1) At the time the allegedly mentally ill person is brought before the court, the court shall advise the person of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">\u201c(a) The reason for being brought before the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">\u201c(b) The nature of the proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">\u201c(c) The possible results of the proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">\u201c(d) The right to subpoena witnesses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">\u201c(e) The person\u2019s rights regarding representation by or appointment of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-13\"> ORS 19.415 was amended by Senate Bill 262 (2009). Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3. The amendments apply to appeals in which the notice of appeal was filed on or after June 4,2009. Because the notice of appeal in this case was filed before that date, the amendments do not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-14\"> In addition to asserting that the trial court erred by violating ORS 426.100(1), appellant asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that the state had presented sufficient evidence that she was unable to provide for her basic personal needs. Because we accept appellant\u2019s argument regarding the trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1), we do not address her argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Indeed, we have reviewed a violation of ORS 426.100 as plain error even when the appellant did not assign error to the violation but the state acknowledged it. <em>State v. Russ, </em>161 Or App 660, 661, 987 P2d 529 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We have also held that failure to object to a trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) does not constitute a waiver that would preclude reversal. <em>See, e.g., May, </em>131 Or App at 571. In <em>May, </em>the appellant challenged the trial court\u2019s failure to provide the information required by ORS 426.100(1); the state conceded that the trial court\u2019s failure was plain error, but argued that any error was waived by the appellant\u2019s trial counsel. We rejected that argument, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201cWe hold that a lawyer\u2019s failure to object, standing alone, does not constitute a waiver of the right to be advised of the rights pertaining to the conduct of a civil mental commitment hearing. Those are mandatory advisements specifically designed to ensure that the alleged mentally ill person receives the benefits of a full and fair hearing. The court must either advise the alleged mentally ill person directly regarding those rights or conduct an examination on the record to determine whether a valid waiver of the right to be advised has been knowingly and voluntarily made. Here, the court neither advised appellant nor conducted any such examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 571; <em>see also State v. Burge, </em>167 Or App 312, 316, 1 P3d 490 (2000) (counsel\u2019s ostensible waiver of allegedly mentally ill person\u2019s right to be advised of the information required by ORS 426.100(1) did not relieve the trial court of its obligation to either provide the required information or conduct an examination on the record to determine whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> The dissent contends that the trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) was harmless because \u201cappellant received some of the advice required by ORS 426.100(1).\u201d 247 Or App at 330 (Wollheim, J., dissenting). The dissent\u2019s test for harmlessness is inconsistent with <em>Scharf, </em>in which we held that, although the appellant had received some of the information required by ORS 426.100(1), the trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The dissent also suggests that we should not review the trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) as plain error because counsel \u201cencouraged\u201d the error. 247 Or App at 331 (Wollheim, J., dissenting). The dissent\u2019s view is not supported by the record. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not encourage the trial court to violate ORS 426.100(1); he did not urge or even suggest that the trial court violate the statute. He simply failed to object when the trial court announced its intended course of conduct, and a failure to object is a predicate to \u2014 not a bar to \u2014 plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The dissent erroneously equates appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object with encouraging or inviting error. That equation is incompatible with our authority to review plain errors. If, as the dissent suggests, failing to object constitutes encouraging or inviting an error, then we could decline to review all plain errors on the ground that, by remaining silent in the face of the error, the appellant invited or encouraged the error. That is incorrect. Indeed, we have reviewed a trial court\u2019s violation of ORS 426.100(1) when, in the trial court, the appellant was represented by counsel who said nothing when the trial court proceeded without advising the appellant of the required information or determining whether the appellant waived his right to be so advised. <em>Allison, </em>129 Or App at 50; see <em>also Burge, </em>167 Or App at 312; <em>May, </em>131 Or App at 571.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b350-5\">WOLLHEIM, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Alm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Whether to exercise our discretion to review an unpreserved, but plain, error is the reason I dissent from the well-reasoned majority opinion. All too often, the Supreme Court has reminded this court that we should exercise our discretion with utmost caution. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case for the court to exercise its discretion. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in conducting the hearing without providing her the advice of rights mandated by ORS 426.100(1). Appellant acknowledges that her claim of error is not preserved. Generally, we do not reach error that was not \u201cpreserved in the lower court and * * * assigned as error in the opening brief.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). An exception applies when the error is plain or, in the terms of ORAP 5.45(1), \u201capparent on the record.\u201d The state concedes plain error but urges that this is not an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>case for us to exercise our discretion to correct the error because appellant has not shown how she was prejudiced by the error. In other words, the state argues that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Assuming that the state\u2019s concession of plain error is appropriate, this court still must determine whether this is an appropriate case to exercise its discretion to correct the claimed error. <em>See State v. M. T., </em>244 Or App 299, 303, 258 P3d 1288 (2011) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s failure to advise an allegedly mentally ill person as required by ORS 426.100(1) \u2018is not only error, but it is plain error that we <em>may </em>exercise our discretion to consider despite an appellant\u2019s failure to raise and preserve the issue at the hearing.\u2019 <em>[State </em>u.] <em>Ritzman, </em>192 Or App [296, 298, 84 P3d 1129 (2004)].\u201d (brackets omitted; emphasis added)); <em>see also State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007) (assuming plain error and assessing only whether this court properly exercised its discretion to reach the claimed error). If the court considers an unpreserved claim of error, it must provide an express statement of the basis for the discretionary choice to consider the claim of error. Failure to do so is itself erroneous. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">One factor we have considered in determining whether to exercise our discretion to reach an unpreserved claim of error regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to provide the warnings required by ORS 426.100(1) is \u201c \u2018whether the error was harmless.\u2019 \u201d <em>M. T., </em>244 Or App at 303 (quoting <em>Ritzman, </em>192 Or App at 299); <em>see also State v. Scharf, </em>201 Or App 71, 74, 116 P3d 949 (2005) (exercising discretion to reach unpreserved claim of error after concluding that the error was not harmless). Here, the harmlessness factor is of limited help.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant has not argued prejudice nor explained how she was actually harmed by the failure of the trial court to advise appellant of her rights contained in ORS 426.100(1). Indeed, appellant\u2019s trial counsel claimed that appellant was aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the \u201coptions\u201d and \u201cimpacts\u201d of continuing the case or proceeding. The discussion between appellant\u2019s counsel and the trial court indicates that appellant received some of the advice required by ORS 426.100(1). The discussion between trial counsel and the trial court led the trial court to conclude that \u201cthat obviously means we can dispense with the explanation to her of her procedural and due process rights.\u201d Trial counsel did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">But our decision whether to exercise our discretion is not dependent on whether appellant received all the advice of rights required by ORS 426.100(1). In determining whether to exercise our discretion to consider an unpreserved claim of error, this court must take a multifactorial approach. For example, in <em>Ailes, </em>the Supreme Court instructed this court of some of the nonexclusive factors this court must consider in deciding whether to exercise our discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way, i.e., whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">312 Or at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">More recently, the Supreme Court has discussed additional relevant factors that this court must consider before exercising our discretion to correct unpreserved plain error. For example, in <em>Fults, </em>343 Or at 523, the court held that we had abused our discretion in reaching the defendant\u2019s claim of unpreserved error. We had concluded that the trial court plainly erred and exercised our discretion to correct that error, explaining that \u201c \u2018[t]he state has no valid interest in requiring defendant to serve an unlawful sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521 (quoting <em>State v. Fults, </em>210 Or App 150, 149 P3d 1248 (2006) (emphasis omitted)). Concluding that we had abused our discretion in reaching the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim of error, the Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cother factors also must be considered and may outweigh that one. Among the factors that may apply in this case are: (1) defendant\u2019s apparent encouragement of the judge\u2019s choice; (2) the role of the concurrent, permissible 36-month probationary sentence; (3) the possibility that [the] defendant made a strategic choice not to object to the sentence; and (4) the interest of the judicial system in avoiding unnecessary repetitive sentencing proceedings, as well as its interest in requiring preservation of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Fults, </em>343 Or at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Although this case does not involve the same strategic choice that occurred in <em>Fults, </em>we note that, during oral argument on appeal, appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that appellant\u2019s trial counsel came extremely close to inviting the trial court\u2019s alleged error. Because the record in this case does not necessarily involve invited error, but rather \u201cpermits the conclusion that [appellant\u2019s] failure to object was a conscious choice,\u201d <em>id., </em>one of the factors described in <em>Fults </em>is helpful, <em>viz., </em>appellant\u2019s apparent encouragement of the judge\u2019s choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Other factors from <em>Ailes </em>include the competing interests of the parties, the gravity of the error, and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in this case in another way. 312 Or at 382 n 6. Considering those additional factors, the record demonstrates that appellant\u2019s counsel encouraged the court to proceed with the hearing. The trial court understood that encouragement to mean that \u201cwe can dispense with the explanation to [appellant] of her procedural and due process rights.\u201d In this case, the encouragement by appellant\u2019s counsel of the trial court\u2019s choice militates against exercising our discretion to consider this unpreserved plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Moreover, consideration of the interests of the parties counsels against exercising our discretion. The indications in the record that appellant was, in fact, advised of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>some of her rights suggest that the gravity of the unpreserved claim of error is slight. <em>Cf. Ritzman, </em>192 Or App at 300-01 (court\u2019s failure to advise allegedly mentally ill person of rights under ORS 426.100(1) was harmless where documentary evidence established that she was read those rights). Indeed, appellant does not argue that she was actually prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">One purpose of the preservation requirement is to allow the trial court to correct its error in the first instance. <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008). That purpose would be undermined if we were to reach appellant\u2019s claim of error here, after appellant encouraged the trial court to take the course of conduct that it did. Accordingly, I would decline to exercise the court\u2019s discretion to reach appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, which was not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The majority relies on <em>Ritzman, </em>192 Or App 296, and <em>State v. Allison, </em>129 Or App 47, 877 P2d 660 (1994). In <em>Ritzman, </em>we held that it was error when the trial court failed to advise the appellant of her rights, but we concluded that the error was harmless because the record included a written document that the appellant signed when the recommitment proceeding was initiated. 192 Or App at 299-301. In <em>Allison, </em>we reversed the trial court where the appellant\u2019s trial counsel stipulated to the commitment and there was no discussion of the appellant\u2019s advice of rights under ORS 426.100(1). 129 Or App at 50. However, <em>Ritzman </em>and <em>Allison </em>fail to contain <em>any </em>discussion of why we exercised our discretion to review the unpreserved challenge. Under these circumstances, those cases do not control here. Before reaching the unpreserved plain error, we must decide to exercise our discretion, and we must explain why we are exercising that discretion. Under the circumstances in this case, it is not appropriate for the court to exercise its discretion and reach the unpreserved plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Because I would conclude that this court should not exercise its discretion to review the unpreserved error, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-4\">Nakamoto, J., joins in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> Some of our cases imply that the failure to provide the appellant with the advice of rights is <em>per se </em>harmful. Nonetheless, this court must explain why it exercises its discretion to reach unpreserved plain error. If an appellant demonstrates why the failure to provide the required advice of rights harms the appellant, that would be a factor the court could consider in deciding to exercise its discretion to review the unpreserved plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> One of the reasons not to reach unpreserved error is that it is important to allow the trial court the opportunity to correct any error. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Here, the trial court would be surprised by appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, and it would have been easy for the court to correct this error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> Because I would affirm on appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, I would also reach her second assignment of error: that the state did not carry its burden to show she is mentally ill because she is unable to meet her basic needs under ORS 426.005(1)(e)(B). Based on the evidence in the record, I would conclude that the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was unable to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>her basic personal needs due to a mental disorder. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>190 Or App 202, 210, 78 P3d 125 (2003) (the state has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person \u201cwould likely not survive in the near future because that person is unable to provide for [her] basic needs due to a mental disorder and that person is not otherwise receiving the care necessary for health and safety\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
