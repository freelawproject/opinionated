The trial court ordered him to pay restitution to the victim in the amount of $18,000, which the trial court found represented the replacement cost of the victim\u2019s stolen pair of diamond earrings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing restitution in that amount because there was insufficient evidence regarding the value of the diamond earrings. On review for errors of law, <em>State v. Ferrara, </em>218 Or App 57, 67-68, 178 P3d 250, <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 539 (2008), and for whether the \u201ctrial court\u2019s factual findings are * * * supported by evidence in the record,\u201d ORS 138.222(5)(a), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant burglarized several houses, including the victim\u2019s house, and a pair of the victim\u2019s diamond earrings were lost and never recovered. Defendant was convicted of four counts of first-degree burglary. At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the state sought a restitution award in the amount of $20,000, which, it asserted, represented the value of the victim\u2019s earrings. Defendant disputed the state\u2019s asserted value of the earrings and requested a restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">At that hearing, the victim was the state\u2019s only witness. The victim testified that each of the earrings consisted of a large center diamond surrounded by 10 to 12 smaller \u201cbaguette\u201d diamonds. The victim further testified that the earrings originally had belonged to her mother, who had received them as a gift from the victim\u2019s father. Although she did not know the original purchase price of the earrings, she testified that her father was \u201cvery wealthy,\u201d that her mother wore good quality jewelry, including a three-carat diamond ring, and that the earrings were so heavy that her earlobes would sag when she wore them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The victim acknowledged that she had no pictures of the earrings and that she could not personally speak to the color, grade, and carat weight of the diamonds. However, the victim explained that, after the burglary, she had visited a jeweler, Jordan, in order to get an estimate of the replacement cost of the earrings. She testified that she had described the size and cut of the diamonds to Jordan, orally and with a hand-drawn picture, which was admitted into evidence. Additionally, she testified that she had shown Jordan a pair of smaller diamond earrings for comparison and had told him, \u201cI know the center [diamond] was larger than these in circumference.\u201d Based on the victim\u2019s description, Jordan opined that the nature of the diamonds was as follows: 2 carat total weight center diamonds with 2 [carat total weight] baguette diamonds[;] white gold.\u201d Additionally, Jordan estimated the replacement cost of the earrings to be between $18,000 and $22,000. Jordan recorded his description and estimate on a business card, which the court admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Defendant did not present evidence at the restitution hearing, but he argued that the evidence presented by the state was insufficient to support the imposition of more than $2,000 in restitution for the earrings. The trial court disagreed and ordered defendant to pay restitution for the earrings in the amount of $18,000:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201cWell, I will state the obvious and that is the court doesn\u2019t have very good information in terms of valuation. It largely is speculation based upon history and estimates. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">\u201cWhat we know is that more likely than not it was a good quality item. I can\u2019t say with certainty that it was the top quality. I can\u2019t say with certainty that it was not a bottom quality, but more likely than not, based upon the history of her father giving her mother good quality jewelry, her mother feeling it was good quality, and having the substance to purchase that more likely than not it was \u2014 it was at least average [if] not better than average.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cSo then we are looking now at Mr. Jordan\u2019s apparent estimate, as rough as it is. His estimate of replacement value is $18,000 to $22,000.1 have no idea, in terms of all of the information that was given to him in terms of formulating that opinion. I would love to have a wealth of diamonds so that I would be able to say I am an expert in terms of market value of diamonds. I don\u2019t have that. And that kind of information is not here in front of us on this record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">\u201c[The victim] testified that it was good quality diamonds, that generally good quality jewelry. I would expect that the conversation that she had with Mr. Jordan was as detailed as she could be. I\u2019m sure she was wanting to get a fair value. She seems, from my observation, to be pretty factual, not being really misled. And so I would expect that she expressed to Mr. Jordan that her mother wore relatively good quality jewelry. So I would assume that that is reflected in the valuation given here. I don\u2019t think that Mr. Jordan really had any more information than what we have and what is before the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cLooking at the opinion of Mr. Jordan, he says that it\u2019s $18,000 to $22,000, and I have to presume that that would be for good quality merchandise. And so I will set the valuation then at the $18,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s award of restitution in the amount of $18,000. Defendant does not dispute that the victim was entitled to <em>some </em>restitution; he challenges only the <em>amount </em>of restitution, contending that the trial court based its award on speculation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant argues that the state failed to \u201cprove some quantifiable and ascertainable damages\u201d as is required under Ferrara, 218 Or App 57. The state responds that the evidence was sufficient to support the restitution award of $18,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">ORS 137.106(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall include one of the following in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\u201c(a) A requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201c(b) A requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution, and that the specific amount of restitution will be established by a supplemental judgment based upon a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment. In the supplemental judgment, the court shall establish a specific amount of restitution that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court. The court may extend the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Under that statute, the state had the burden of producing \u201cevidence of the nature and amount\u201d of the victim\u2019s economic damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 137.106(1). Additionally, the parties agree that the state had the burden to prove those damages by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See State v. Mendez, </em>211 Or App 311, 322-23 n 12, 155 P3d 54, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 160 (2007) (discussing applicable standard of proof for the imposition of restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Under ORS 137.106(1), if the trial court finds that a victim has suffered \u201ceconomic damages,\u201d the trial court must order restitution in an amount that equals the amount of the victim\u2019s \u201ceconomic damages.\u201d According to ORS 31.710(2)(a), \u201ceconomic damages\u201d are \u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have previously explained that the term \u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses\u201d means losses that are \u201ccapable of verification through objective facts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>DeVaux v. Presby, </em>136 Or App 456, 463, 902 P2d 593 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>To the extent that defendant argues that the replacement cost of the victim\u2019s diamond earrings was not objectively verifiable and, therefore, that the victim\u2019s damages were not economic in nature, we reject that argument. Damages representing the cost of replacing stolen jewelry, including diamond earrings, are \u201ccapable of verification through objective facts\u201d and, accordingly, are economic in nature. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he legislature defined \u2018economic\u2019 damages not as \u2018objectively <em>verified\u2019 </em>monetary losses, but as \u2018objectively verifia&amp;Ze\u2019 monetary losses. Thus, * * * the key is the extent to which damages are <em>capable </em>of verification by objective facts, not the extent to which they are verified at trial.\u201d (Emphases in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">However, we must still consider defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence presented by the state at the restitution hearing was insufficient to support the amount of restitution ordered by the trial court. We have \u201cconsistently remanded for resentencing in circumstances in which the sentencing court erred by imposing restitution in the absence of <em>any </em>evidence of economic damages.\u201d <em>State v. Tippetts, </em>239 Or App 429, 432, 244 P3d 891 (2010) (emphasis added) (citing representative cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In <em>Ferrara, </em>after the defendant was convicted of murder, the trial court awarded $20,000 in restitution to the child of the victim for the loss of his mother\u2019s support. 218 Or App at 67. The defendant argued that the \u201cstate failed to prove [the child\u2019s] pecuniary damages and that inherent in the state\u2019s failure was its failure to specify, with sufficient particularity, the value of those damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72-73. We agreed, concluding that \u201cthe state was required to prove some quantifiable and ascertainable damages\u201d and that the state\u2019s failure \u201cto offer <em>any </em>evidence in that regard\u201d made the imposition of restitution improper. <em>Id. </em>at 73 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>State v. Harrington, </em>229 Or App 473, 211 P3d 972, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 365 (2009), we concluded that the trial court plainly erred in imposing restitution for the loss of a ring, watch, and wallet where the state identified <em>\u201cno </em>evidence of value in the record\u201d and <em>\u201cno </em>basis for drawing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>inference\u201d regarding the value of the items. <em>Id. </em>at 477 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The present case is distinguishable from those cases in which the record lacked <em>any </em>evidence of either the victim\u2019s economic damages or the amount of those damages. Here, the state did present evidence of the amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages, and that evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s restitution award of $18,000. <em>See </em>ORS 138.222(5)(a) (standard of review of sentencing decisions is whether the \u201ctrial court\u2019s factual findings are * * * supported by evidence in the record\u201d); <em>State v. Edson, </em>329 Or 127, 136-38, 985 P2d 1253 (1999) (the scope of appellate review of a sentence of restitution is governed by ORS 138.222). Most notably, the state presented evidence that a jeweler, relying on the victim\u2019s description of the diamond earrings, had estimated the replacement cost of the earrings to be between $18,000 and $22,000. On this record, the trial court was entitled to infer that the jeweler felt that the victim\u2019s description was sufficiently adequate such that he could make an appropriate estimate as to the replacement cost of the earrings. Additionally, the state presented evidence that supported the estimate: namely, the victim\u2019s testimony regarding her father\u2019s wealth, her mother\u2019s habit of wearing good quality jewelry, and her drawing and description of the earrings.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s statements that \u201cthe court doesn\u2019t have very good information in terms of valuation\u201d and that \u201c[i]t largely is speculation based upon history and estimates\u201d demonstrate that there was insufficient evidence to support the restitution award. We disagree. The court\u2019s actual decision is more telling. Read as a whole, the record shows that the trial court considered the evidence \u2014 the victim\u2019s description of her family history and the jeweler\u2019s estimate \u2014 sufficient to support its ultimate decision of imposing restitution in the amount of $18,000. The trial court, as factfinder, was entitled to weigh the evidence presented and to reach that conclusion. <em>Cf. State v. Gruver, </em>247 Or App 8, 268 P3d 760 (2011) (no plain error in awarding restitution when some evidence of the nature and amount of the damages introduced at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> Additionally, the trial court ordered defendant to pay $1,500 in restitution to the victim for the loss of her freshwater pearl ring. Defendant does not argue on appeal that the trial court erred in imposing restitution of that amount for that particular item.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-10\"> Defendant acknowledges that he is bound by his concession below that the replacement cost of the earrings was at least $2,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> Defendant does not argue that the state\u2019s presentation of evidence regarding the nature and amount of the victim\u2019s damages was untimely. <em>See State v. McLaughlin, </em>243 Or App 214, 258 P3d 1241, <em>modified on recons, </em>244 Or App 691, 260 P3d 814 (2011) (ORS 137.106(1) requires the state to present evidence of the nature and amount of damages prior to sentencing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\"><em> </em>ORS 137.103(2)(a) provides that, for the purposes of restitution, the term \u201ceconomic damages\u201d has the meaning given to that term in ORS 31.710, except that it does not include future impairment of earning capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\"> In contrast, noneconomic damages are \u201csubjective, nonmonetary losses, including but not limited to pain, mental suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>to reputation, loss of care, comfort, companionship and society, loss of consortium, inconvenience and interference with normal and usual activities apart from gainful employment.\u201d OES 31.710(2)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
