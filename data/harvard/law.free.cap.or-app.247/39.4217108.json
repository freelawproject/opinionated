J.</author>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The state appeals an order suppressing evidence resulting from the warrantless testing of defendant\u2019s blood and urine. ORS 138.060(l)(c). The trial court, consistently with the reasoning in our decision in <em>State v. Machuca, </em>231 Or App 232, 218 P3d 145 (2009) <em>(Machuca I), rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>347 Or 644, 227 P3d 729 (2010) <em>(Machuca II), </em>concluded that defendant\u2019s consent to that testing was involuntary because it was obtained after he had received statutory implied consent warnings about the economic harm and loss of privileges that would result if he refused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the state essentially contends that we should abandon our analysis concerning consent in <em>Machuca I. </em>For the reasons explained below, we adhere to, and readopt, our reasoning in <em>Machuca I </em>\u2014 viz., that a defendant\u2019s consent that is obtained after the defendant has received statutory implied consent warnings is involuntary. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We take the uncontroverted facts from the testimony of Farrar, the state police trooper who witnessed and investigated the accident that led to the charges against defendant and who was the only witness to testify at the suppression hearing. On the afternoon of September 12, 2008, Farrar witnessed a two-vehicle accident on Highway 101 in Tillamook County. According to Farrar, defendant was driving a northbound vehicle that crossed the center line and collided with a southbound vehicle. The accident injured defendant and caused a fatality.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">According to Farrar, when he first saw defendant, \u201cit * * * appear[ed] that he was pinned in the vehicle against the steering wheel and the seat.\u201d At some point thereafter, while defendant was lying on a backboard on the shoulder of the road, Farrar spoke with him and noticed that, although \u201cpeople [who] are involved in crashes are a little more amped up,\u201d defendant \u201cwas dazed and his speech was slow.\u201d However, Farrar did not notice the smell of alcohol when he spoke with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Approximately an hour or two later, after defendant had apparently received pain medication,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Farrar talked with defendant again in the emergency room of the local hospital to which defendant had been transported. According to Farrar, defendant \u201cwas very drowsy, his speech was slurred and thick, [and] he was in a considerable amount of pain due to the injuries of the crash[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">After that conversation, Farrar determined that there was probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the crime of driving under the influence of intoxicants. Farrar advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and defendant indicated that he understood them. After asking defendant questions from a standard \u201calcohol influence interview report,\u201d Farrar \u201cread [defendant] the implied consent form and asked him if he\u2019d be willing to give blood and urine samples.\u201d Defendant agreed to provide the samples. Defendant was subsequently indicted for criminally negligent homicide. ORS 163.145.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress \u201call evidence that resulted from the seizure of the defendant\u2019s person, blood[,] and urine, and the results of the tests performed on the samples.\u201d At the suppression hearing \u2014 which was held approximately one week after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Machuca II </em>\u2014 the state contended that the motion should be denied because either (1) probable cause and exigent circumstances existed to obtain the evidence without a warrant or (2) defendant had voluntarily consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Conversely, defendant contended that the state had not established the existence of exigent circumstances and probable cause. Further, defendant contended that, under our decision in <em>Machuca I, </em>his consent was involuntary because it was \u201conly obtained after [he] was given the [statutorily required implied consent] warnings * * * about the consequences of a refusal to allow a blood or urine test,\u201d which \u201cthreaten an economic harm and loss of privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The trial court suppressed the evidence because (1) although probable cause existed, the state had failed to satisfy its burden to demonstrate the existence of exigent circumstances and (2) defendant\u2019s consent was involuntary. In that regard, the trial court stated that, in <em>Machuca I, </em>we had \u201cheld that the implied consent warnings were inherently coercive\u201d and that our resolution of that issue survived the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal in <em>Machuca II. </em>Ultimately, noting that the facts of this case were materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Machuca, </em>the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence \u201cbased upon * * * <em>Machuca </em>[Z].\u201d The state appeals the trial court\u2019s resulting order.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">On appeal, the state does not challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that exigent circumstances had not been established \u2014 and, thus, that the \u201cprobable cause and exigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement is inapposite. Instead, the state\u2019s fundamental contention is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201c[t]he circuit court erred when it suppressed evidence of blood and urine samples that the trooper obtained from defendant pursuant to his express consent. Defendant\u2019s consent was not rendered constitutionally invalid merely because the trooper who obtained that consent had correctly advised him of the rights and adverse consequences in accordance with the implied-consent provisions in ORS 813.100(1) and ORS 813.131(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In support of that contention, the state raises essentially the same arguments that were addressed by this court in <em>Machuca </em>I \u2014 many of which were articulated in the dissenting opinion in that case. <em>See Machuca </em>1, 231 Or App at 247-51 (Haselton, J., dissenting). In other words, the state is requesting that we revisit our reasoning in <em>Machuca I </em>concerning the involuntariness of a defendant\u2019s consent after the defendant had been advised of the statutorily prescribed implied consent warnings. For the reasons explained below, we decline the state\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In <em>Machuca I, </em>we concluded that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress because (1) the state had failed to meet its burden to prove that exigent circumstances existed and (2) the defendant\u2019s consent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>involuntary for purposes of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, with regard to the issue of consent, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">\u201cIn reviewing the voluntariness of a person\u2019s consent to a search, \u2018[w]e are not bound by the trial court\u2019s ultimate holding as to voluntariness, * * * [but] assess anew whether the facts suffice to meet constitutional standards.\u2019 <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 135, 806 P2d 92 (1991). The proper test for voluntariness is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was given by an act of free will or was the result of coercion, express or implied. <em>State v. Dimeo, </em>304 Or 469, 474, 747 P2d 353 (1987); <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>295 Or 567, 572, 669 P2d 320 (1983). The state bears the burden of proving voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Paulson, </em>313 Or 346, 351-52, 833 P2d 1278 (1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201cThe relevant factors to be considered in determining the voluntariness of consent include (1) whether physical force was used or threatened; (2) whether weapons were displayed; (3) whether the consent was obtained in public; (4) whether the person who gives consent was the subject of an investigation; (5) the number of officers present; (6) whether the atmosphere surrounding the consent was antagonistic or oppressive; and (7) whether drug or alcohol use has impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to make a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent choice. <em>State v. Larson, </em>141 Or App 186, 198, 917 P2d 519, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 229 (1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201cSome of those factors suggest that defendant\u2019s consent was not voluntary. Defendant gave consent after he was placed under arrest, shortly after being injured in an automobile accident, and while under the influence of alcohol. On the other hand, defendant\u2019s assent did not result from the use of physical force or the display of weapons. What is determinative in this context, however, is that the consent was procured through a threat of economic harm and loss of privileges. It was obtained only after defendant was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the warnings required by ORS 813.130(2) about the consequences of a refusal to allow a blood test. Under <em>State v. Newton, </em>291 Or 788, 801, 636 P2d 393 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 750 P2d 147 (1988), a consent to search obtained in that fashion is coerced by the fear of adverse consequences and is ineffective to excuse the requirement to obtain a search warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><em>Machuca I, </em>231 Or App at 239-40 (omission and brackets in <em>Machuca I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In <em>Machuca II, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the state had demonstrated the existence of exigent circumstances and that our analysis to the contrary was erroneous. The Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in that regard obviated the need for the court to address our analysis concerning the defendant\u2019s consent \u2014 and the court explicitly said as much. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated, \u201c[W]e need not determine whether defendant\u2019s consent was valid under Article I, section 9, nor do we need to determine whether the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted and relied on the plurality opinion in <em>Newton.\u201d Machuca II, </em>347 Or at 657. In sum, although the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Machuca I, </em>the court did not call into question, much less abrogate, our analysis concerning the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">As noted, the state now urges us to revisit that analysis. However, important prudential and institutional principles \u2014 many of which find their origin in the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>\u2014 compellingly militate otherwise. As the Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Farmers Ins. Co. v. Mowry, </em>350 Or 686, 697-98, 261 P3d 1 (2011),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\"><em>\u201cstare decisis </em>is a prudential doctrine that is defined by the competing needs for stability and flexibility in Oregon law. Stability and predictability are important values in the law; individuals and institutions act in reliance on this court\u2019s decisions, and to frustrate reasonable expectations based on prior decisions creates the potential for uncertainty and unfairness. Moreover, lower courts depend on consistency in this court\u2019s decisions in deciding the myriad cases that come before them. New legal principles are so central to our tradition as the concept that courts should treat like cases alike, and <em>stare decisis </em>is one means of advancing that goal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>For those reasons, we begin with the assumption that issues considered in our prior cases are correctly decided, and the party seeking to change a precedent must assume responsibility for affirmatively persuading us that we should abandon that precedent. We will not depart from established precedent simply because the personal policy preferences of the members of the court may differ from those of our predecessors who decided the earlier case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">(Internal quotation marks, brackets, citations, and footnote omitted.) To be sure, because <em>Machuca I </em>was subsequently reversed, albeit on different grounds, our decision there is not literally controlling precedent. Nevertheless, the prudential principles emphasized in <em>Farmers Ins. Co. </em>compellingly militate in favor of our continued adherence to the core reasoning of <em>Machuca I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We are especially mindful that, as an institutional matter, we are not well served to revisit an analysis recently adopted by a majority of the full court. That is so, particularly, where, as here, the state does not contend that there has been an intervening change in the law or that our reasoning was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d <em>See Newell v. Weston, </em>156 Or App 371, 380, 965 P2d 1039 (1998) (reasoning that this court would adhere to its precedent unless it is plainly wrong). To revisit and repudiate <em>Machuca I, </em>especially given the intervening changes in the court\u2019s composition, could engender a perception that we have done so merely \u201cbecause the personal policy preferences of the members of the court * * * differ from those of our predecessors who decided the earlier case.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. Co., </em>350 Or at 698 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). That, in turn, could subvert public confidence in the integrity of our processes \u2014 the ultimate source of any court\u2019s authority. <em>See generally </em>Alexander Bickel, <em>The Least Dangerous Branch </em>(1962). Accordingly, we adhere to our reasoning in <em>Machuca I </em>concerning the issue of consent and readopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Applying that reasoning to the facts of this case, which are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Machuca I, </em>we conclude that defendant\u2019s consent was involuntary. Here, defendant consented after receiving the implied consent warnings. As we reasoned in <em>Machuca I, </em>\u201ca consent to search obtained in that fashion is coerced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>fear of adverse consequences and is ineffective to excuse the requirement to obtain a search warrant.\u201d 231 Or App at 240. Thus, the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\"> <em>See generally </em>ORS 813.100(1) (concerning implied consent for breath or blood tests); ORS 813.131(1) (concerning implied consent for urine test); ORS 813.130 (concerning information about implied consent rights and consequences).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\"> Farrar testified that, while at the hospital, he overheard the hospital staff asking defendant \u201cif the medication was making him feel any better.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\"> Article I, section 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-5\"> Our disposition obviates the need to consider defendant\u2019s alternative bases for <em>affirmance </em>\u2014 viz., (1) that \u201cORS 813.100 does not apply because the officer\u2019s belief that he had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence of a controlled substance was not objectively reasonable\u201d and (2) that \u201c[djefendant did not voluntarily consent to the search because he had received pain medication prior to being asked to give consent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
