J.</author>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">This case comes to us on remand from the Supreme Court with instructions to reconsider our first decision, <em>State v. Anthony, </em>234 Or App 659, 228 P3d 1222 (2010), in light of <em>State v. Cazares-Mendez /Reyes-Sanchez, </em>350 Or 491, 256 P3d 104 (2011). In <em>Anthony, </em>we relied on our decision in <em>State v. Cazares-Mendez, </em>233 Or App 310, 227 P3d 172 (2010) <em>(Cazares-Mendez I); </em>the Supreme Comb subsequently took review of <em>Cazares-Mendez I </em>and, although it affirmed our decision in that case, it employed different reasoning. Our task, then, is to apply that reasoning here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In 2007, defendant was charged with the aggravated murders of an elderly couple in Lake Oswego. The murders had occurred 27 years earlier, in 1980. At a pretrial hearing, the court ruled that the defense could not introduce testimony from a man named Jackson to the effect that a third man, Smith, had told him (Jackson) that he (Smith) was the perpetrator of the murders for which defendant was on trial. Jackson and Smith had been cellmates. Defendant was subsequently convicted. On appeal, he assigned error to the court\u2019s ruling prohibiting the hearsay evidence of Smith\u2019s confessions. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201c[DJefendant argues that the court erred in excluding a hearsay statement from a third party allegedly confessing to the crime for which defendant was convicted. Defendant relies on OEC 804(3)(c). That provision allows admission of such statements if (1) the declarant is unavailable, (2) the statement is so inculpatory that a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would not have made the statement unless it was true, <em>and </em>(3) corroborating circumstances clearly establish that the statement is trustworthy. <em>State v. Schutte, </em>146 Or App 97, 101, 932 P2d 77 (1997). We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s argument that, because the witness\u2019s testimony was evasive, he was unavailable for purposes of OEC 804(3)(c). [Thus, ordinarily, the hearsay statement would be inadmissible, because the declarant was available.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201cNonetheless, in a recent case, we held that, where \u2018the corroboration/trustworthiness\u2019 requirement for admission of statements against penal interest\u2019 is met, exclusion as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>hearsay evidence of a confession merely because the confessing witness is not \u2018unavailable\u2019 can, in some circumstances, violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>[Cazares-Mendez I, </em>233 Or App at 323]. * * * Although we held in <em>Cazares-Mendez </em>[7] that the circumstances there were sufficiently clear to establish the trustworthiness of the hearsay confession so as to justify a due process inquiry, we reach a different conclusion here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201cIn brief, the corroboration in <em>Cazares-Mendez </em>[7] consisted of <em>multiple </em>witnesses who had heard <em>detailed </em>confessions that \u2018related <em>particulars </em>that were <em>peculiar </em>to\u2019 the crime that defendant allegedly committed. <em>Id. </em>at 326 (emphasis added). Here, the \u2018corroboration\u2019 consisted of the following details: an uninvolved witness saw an unidentified man in the doorway of the victims\u2019 house on the night after the murder; the same witness saw two motorcycles outside the victims\u2019 home, and the witness who confessed owned a motorcycle; and a different witness saw \u2018two ominous-looking men\u2019 walking toward the victims\u2019 home on the night of the murder. That evidence is a far cry from what the defendant presented in <em>Cazares-Mendez </em>[7]. In light of the circumstances presented, the trial court did not err in excluding the hearsay confession in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Anthony, </em>234 Or App at 663-64 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In its opinion in <em>Cazares-Mendez, </em>the Supreme Court clarified certain aspects of the rule that a statement against penal interest is admissible, even if the declarant is available, if \u201ccorroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d 350 Or at 506 (quoting OEC 804(3)(c)). The proper focus of the trustworthiness inquiry, the court held, is not the trustworthiness of the witness, but of the declarant. <em>Id. </em>at 506-11. Thus, our focus in our original opinion in <em>Anthony </em>on the circumstances that defendant introduced in order to demonstrate that the witness\u2019s hearsay testimony was trustworthy was misplaced; the proper focus was on the declarant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The declarant was singularly untrustworthy. He was a self-confessed serial killer, serving five consecutive life sentences, whose testimony was, in the words of defendant\u2019s own appellate counsel, \u201cdisjointed and evasive.\u201d When asked how many murders he had been convicted of, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>difficult for me to testify, not having records before me to recall that[.]\u201d He testified in court that he had no involvement in the Lake Oswego murders for which defendant was on trial. His supposed \u201cconfession\u201d to Jackson \u2014 \u201cMe and [another person, not defendant] did that one,\u201d \u2014 was far from detailed, and was itself contradicted by his subsequent denials to, among others, Jackson. Further, as we noted in our first opinion, nothing in the circumstantial evidence that defendant cites to bolster the theory that Smith was the perpetrator, and hence that Smith\u2019s confession\u201d was trustworthy, prove anything of the sort. In sum, applying the analysis that the Supreme Court mandates in <em>CazaresMendez, </em>we reach the same conclusion we reached in our first opinion. The court did not deny defendant due process of law by excluding hearsay evidence of Smith\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
