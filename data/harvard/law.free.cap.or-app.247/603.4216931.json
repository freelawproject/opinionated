J.</author>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">As part of a continuing dissolution proceeding, husband appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision to continue a restraining order against him based on the Family Abuse Prevention Act, ORS 107.700 to 107.735 (FAPA). ORS 107.718(10) (allowing hearing to contest <em>ex parte </em>FAPA order). Because husband was denied the opportunity to cross-examine wife\u2019s witness, we vacate the order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Under ORS 107.718(1), a court may issue a FAPA restraining order upon a showing that the petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201c[H]as been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner and that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\u201cAbuse,\u201d in turn, is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201c(b) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">ORS 107.705(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The proceedings that led to the issuance of the restraining order in this case are apparently part of what was then an ongoing dispute between the parties over the terms of the child custody provisions of their dissolution. After an incident in which husband had allegedly abused wife\u2019s child from a former relationship, wife petitioned for, and obtained, a FAPA restraining order based, not on the incident itself, but on other alleged contacts that had occurred within 180 days preceding her filing of the petition. According to wife, husband abused her within the statutory time limit by, first, threatening during a telephone conversation to kill her and, second, by charging at her and striking the hood of her car as she was driving out of his driveway after dropping off the parties\u2019 child. Husband asserted that, although several telephone conversations occurred in the relevant time frame, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>never threatened wife\u2019s life. Regarding the car-charging incident, he testified that he was simply trying to get wife\u2019s attention because he believed that she was driving away with a key to his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">During the hearing on the FAPA, Boyd, a Department of Human Services (DHS) social worker who was in the process of investigating wife\u2019s claim that husband had physically abused her child, obtained permission to address the court. He informed the court that \u201cthere is an active DHS investigation with respect to physical abuse by [husband] toward the older child[.] * * * I\u2019m here to inform the court that I have concerns about [husband] having any additional contact with these children.\u201d Husband, who was not represented by counsel at the hearing, asked the court for permission to question Boyd. The court responded that Boyd had not been sworn in. Husband then asked that Boyd be sworn in, and he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At that point, the court invited Boyd to \u201cadd something.\u201d Boyd stated, \u201cThe reason that we have not filed for custody of these children is because we have a protective parent. Should [wife] have allowed the children to visit or see [husband], I would have filed a juvenile petition in court[.] I have that much concern.\u201d He later also told the court that he believed that husband had a \u201cneed for services such as anger management.\u201d The court then asked husband if he had any questions for Boyd. Husband replied that the proceedings were \u201chappening out of order.\u201d The court then apparently agreed to proceed in a more orderly fashion, and told him that he would have the opportunity to \u201cask [Boyd] questions\u201d when Boyd returned to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Ultimately, the court believed wife\u2019s version of the incidents and ordered, as part of the restraining order, that \u201cwhile the DHS investigation is pending there will not be any contact unless DHS arranges for some supervised contact with either child.\u201d The court also ruled, \u201cSo I am continuing the restraining order[,] and I am ordering for the brief time of the DHS investigation, no contact with the children[,] unless DHS arranges for supervised.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Husband then interjected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Tm not allowed to question the DHS person[,] even though he was supposedly called as a witness?\u201d to which the court replied: \u201cYou know what, we ran out of time, can\u2019t do it.\u201d The court subsequently issued an order continuing the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">On appeal, husband asserts two assignments of error. In the first, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it did not permit him to cross-examine wife\u2019s witness, Boyd. We agree. In <em>Howell-Hooyman and Hooyman, </em>113 Or App 548, 550-51, 833 P2d 328 (1992), the trial court curtailed proceedings in a domestic relations case before the husband, appearing <em>pro se, </em>had the opportunity to complete cross-examining the wife and putting on his case. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cA trial court, in the exercise of sound discretion, has the authority reasonably to control the presentation of evidence and the examination of witnesses. OEC 611(1). The exercise of that authority is reasonable only if it is fundamentally fair and allows opportunities for a reasonably complete presentation of evidence and argument. <em>See State ex rel Fulton v. Fulton, </em>31 Or App 669, 672, 571 P2d 179 (1977). Absent a ruling that the evidence was (or would be) irrelevant or redundant, OEC 402, it was error for the trial court to deny husband the opportunity to complete his cross-examination and to present his case-in-chief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Although husband in the present case did have the opportunity to tell the court his version of the relevant events, he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Boyd in order to explore Boyd\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d about husband\u2019s relationship with wife\u2019s child and husband\u2019s need for \u201canger management.\u201d These statements appear to have affected the court\u2019s decision to fashion the order so as to prevent husband from associating with wife\u2019s child and the couple\u2019s child without DHS supervision, not to mention the court\u2019s credibility finding in favor of wife. The lack of a \u201cfundamentally fair\u201d hearing allowing husband \u201ca reasonably complete presentation of evidence and argument\u201d is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Our conclusion that husband was not permitted completely to attempt to undercut wife\u2019s evidence renders it impossible for us to address his second assignment of error, in which he urges us to review the proceeding <em>de novo </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>argues that the evidence did not support the court\u2019s order. We therefore vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\"> The record does not disclose whether, or when, the DHS investigation ended or what its result was. After a police investigation, all of the charges against father for the alleged abuse of wife\u2019s child were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
