The board also determined that claimant\u2019s coccydynia is compensable as a new or omitted medical condition and that SAIF unreasonably delayed processing of the claim. The board assessed attorney fees as well as a penalty. SAIF seeks review of the board\u2019s order. We conclude that the board erred in ordering SAIF to accept coccydynia and in assessing a penalty and attorney fees, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Claimant, who worked for employer as a caregiver, suffered an injury on June 13, 2007, when she fell at work and landed on her tailbone. On July 20, SAIF accepted a claim for a lumbar contusion and lumbar strain. On July 31, claimant began to receive treatment from Dr. Kelly, who noted that claimant had pain at the junction of the lower sacrum and coccyx, and along the length of the coccyx. Kelly identified \u201ccoccydynia,\u201d which she subsequently defined as \u201cpain in the coccyx.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">SAIF closed the claim in December 2007 with accepted conditions of lumbar strain and lumbar contusion and no award of permanent partial disability. Claimant sought reconsideration of the notice of closure, which the Appellate Review Unit ultimately upheld based on a report by a medical arbiter. That report opined that all of claimant\u2019s current symptoms were due to a preexisting degeneration in the lumbar spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Claimant continued to experience pain in the area of her tailbone. Kelly referred claimant to Dr. North, a neurologist, who examined her in January 2008. North ordered a CT scan, which was negative for a fracture but consistent with \u201ca focal bone bruise of the coccyx or injury to the anococcygeal ligament.\u201d On January 31, 2008, claimant requested acceptance of a new or omitted medical condition, \u201ccoccydynia.\u201d In February 2008, SAIF sent Kelly an inquiry with a number of questions concerning \u201ccoccydynia.\u201d Among them, SAIF elicited responses to the following questions (the doctor\u2019s responses are described in italics):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201c1. Please define coccydynia and explain the etiology of this condition. <em>Kelly underlined \u2018define\u2019 and wrote: Pain in the coxxyx; Kelly underlined \u2018etiology\u2019 and wrote: Trauma.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">\u201c2. Is coccydynia a diagnosis, or a symptom of some other condition? If so, what is the condition? <em>Kelly underlined \u2018diagnosis.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">On March 28, 2008, SAIF issued a modified notice of acceptance indicating that it was accepting a coccyx bone bruise. The claim was reopened for processing of the newly accepted condition and then closed on March 31, 2008, without an award of additional disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Claimant requested a hearing, seeking attorney fees and a penalty for an alleged <em>de facto </em>denial of coccydynia. Before the administrative law judge (ALJ) and the board, claimant asserted that, in failing to either accept or deny her claim for coccydynia, SAIF had denied <em>de facto </em>the claim. SAIF subsequently corresponded with Kelly in aid of litigation and asked whether \u201ccoccyx bone bruise,\u201d the condition that SAIF had accepted, could be considered the underlying condition that was causing claimant\u2019s coccydynia or \u201cpain in the coccyx.\u201d Kelly responded by checking a box indicating \u201cyes.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">SAIF argued before the ALJ and the board that its March 28, 2008, amended notice of acceptance, which included acceptance of a coccyx bone bruise, was a legally sufficient response to claimant\u2019s new or omitted condition claim for coccydynia, because coccydynia was a symptom rather than a condition and the medical evidence showed that the underlying cause of the symptom was a coccyx bone bruise.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The board, in affirming the ALJ, concluded that SAIF\u2019s response to claimant\u2019s request for acceptance of coccydynia by including \u201ccoccyx bone bruise\u201d in its amended notice of acceptance did not comply with ORS 656.262(7)(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>or ORS 656.267(1), which require acceptance or denial of a new or omitted medical condition claim within 60 days after the insurer receives notice of the claim. In an order on reconsideration, the board rejected SAIF\u2019s contention that SAIF\u2019s modification of its notice of acceptance to include \u201ccoccyx bone bruise\u201d satisfied the requirements of the statutes because it reasonably apprised claimant of the nature of her compensable condition. The board explained that, in response to claimant\u2019s new or omitted medical condition claim, it was incumbent on SAIF to either accept or deny the claimed condition, \u201ccoccydynia.\u201d If, as SAIF asserted, it believed that coccydynia was a symptom rather than a condition, the board said that it would have been permissible for SAIF to deny the claim on the basis that it was a symptom, not a condition. Instead, the board concluded, SAIF impermissibly disregarded claimant\u2019s formal request for acceptance of coccydynia and accepted a different and unclaimed condition, \u201ccoccyx bone bruise.\u201d Accordingly, the board held that SAIF had failed to adequately respond to the claim for \u201ccoccydynia\u201d and that the failure to respond was a <em>de facto </em>denial. The board assessed attorney fees under ORS 656.386(l)(b)(B) for claimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s services at the hearing, on review, and on reconsideration in obtaining acceptance of the claim for \u201ccoccydynia.\u201d It also assessed a penalty and penalty-related attorney fees under ORS 656.262(11), having concluded that SAIF\u2019s failure to either accept or deny the claim was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">On judicial review, we address first SAIF\u2019s contention that its inclusion of \u201ccoccyx bone bruise\u201d in its amended notice of acceptance complied with ORS 656.262(7)(a) and ORS 656.267(1) and that the board therefore erred in determining that it had denied <em>de facto </em>the claim. SAIF\u2019s primary rationale is that, because both statutes speak in terms of new or omitted medical \u201cconditions,\u201d and because the medical evidence shows that the claimed condition, \u201ccoccydynia,\u201d is a symptom and not a condition, there was no obligation under ORS 656.262 or ORS 656.267 to either accept or deny the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Setting aside for the moment the question whether the claim was, medically, a condition or a symptom, we conclude that the board reached the correct result in its analysis of SAIF\u2019s processing obligation. Even if SAIF had correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>concluded that coccydynia was a symptom, it still had the obligation to either accept or deny the claim. As we recently explained in <em>Crawford v. SAIF, </em>241 Or App 470, 250 P3d 965 (2011), if a claimant files a new or omitted medical condition claim pursuant to ORS 656.267 by clearly requesting formal written acceptance, the insurer\u2019s response must be by written notice of acceptance or denial within 60 days. In that circumstance, a mere letter of clarification or amendment of the notice of acceptance does not suffice. <em>Crawford, </em>241 Or App at 480. The failure of an insurer to respond to an omitted condition claim by either accepting or denying it within 60 days is a procedural deficiency that gives rise to a denied claim. <em>Id. </em>at 481. Because claimant complied with the provisions of ORS 656.267 by expressly requesting acceptance of \u201ccoccydynia,\u201d SAIF had an obligation to process that claim by either accepting or denying coccydynia, and the board correctly concluded that its failure to do so was a <em>de facto </em>denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We now turn to SAIF\u2019s contention that, despite any processing deficiency, the medical evidence shows that claimant\u2019s coccydynia is not a separate condition but is, rather, a symptom and that the board therefore erred in setting aside SAIF\u2019s <em>de facto </em>denial and ordering SAIF to accept coccydynia.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">SAIF focuses on Kelly\u2019s responses to its inquiries, in particular, her definition of coccydynia as \u201cpain in the coccyx,\u201d which would appear to be descriptive of a symptom. SAIF also cites Kelly\u2019s affirmative response to its further inquiry as to whether \u201cthe coccyx bone bruise [accepted by SAIF]\u201d can \u201cbe considered the underlying condition that is causing claimant\u2019s coccydynia, or \u2018pain in the coccyx.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The board was aware of that evidence but found, nonetheless, that claimant\u2019s coccydynia is a \u201ccondition\u201d and not a symptom. The board was particularly persuaded by Kelly\u2019s response that coccydynia was a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d and not a symptom of \u201canother condition.\u201d Considering that response, as well as the totality of Kelly\u2019s responses, the board said that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the coccydynia diagnosis represents nothing more than symptoms of a bruise. Instead, we conclude that the diagnosis represents a physical status of claimant\u2019s body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>SAIF contends that the board\u2019s conclusion is not consistent with our opinion in <em>Young v. Hermiston Good Samaritan, </em>223 Or App 99, 104, 194 P3d 857 (2008). In <em>Young, </em>we approved the board\u2019s definition of \u201ccondition\u201d as \u201cthe physical status of the body as a whole or one of its parts.\u201d We concluded that the board had properly determined, based on the medical evidence, that the claimant\u2019s radiculopathy, which had been defined by the medical evidence as \u201cpain that radiates along the course of a nerve root that exits from the spine,\u201d was a symptom and not a condition. SAIF asserts that, similarly here, claimant\u2019s coccydynia, which the medical evidence has defined as \u201cpain in the coccyx,\u201d is not a physical status of the body but a mere symptom of a physical status.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">In determining whether the board\u2019s finding that coccydynia is a condition is supported by substantial evidence, it is not this court\u2019s function to substitute its judgment for that of the board. The question is whether a reasonable person could find, based on the record as a whole, that the coccydyinia was a \u201ccondition.\u201d ORS 183.482(8); <em>Deatherage v. Pernsteiner, </em>239 Or App 161, 172, 243 P3d 865 (2010). It is undisputed that the issue turns on the medical evidence and that an interpretation of Kelly\u2019s opinion is central to a resolution of the dispute. We have examined the record, and we conclude that, when it is considered in its entirety, and especially in light of Kelly\u2019s definition of the term coccydynia and her statement that a coccyx bone bruise can be considered as the underlying condition causing the coccydynia, the only reasonable interpretation of Kelly\u2019s opinion is that claimant\u2019s condition is a coccyx bone bruise and that coccydynia describes a symptom rather than a condition. We therefore conclude that substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s finding that coccydynia is a condition and not a symptom. Accordingly, we conclude that the board erred in ordering SAIF to accept coccydynia as a new or omitted medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Having concluded that SAIF was not required to separately accept coccydynia, it follows that claimant was not entitled to insurer-paid attorney fees under ORS 656.386(l)(b)(B). The remaining question is whether, in light of SAIF\u2019s <em>de facto </em>denial, the penalty and attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>assessed by the board under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) should be upheld based on SAIF\u2019s unreasonable failure to accept or deny the claim. Under the circumstances, in particular the confused state of the law concerning an insurer\u2019s obligation to respond to a new or omitted medical condition claim, <em>see Crawford, </em>241 Or App at 479, we conclude that SAIF\u2019s failure to respond by accepting or denying the new or omitted medical condition claim was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> SAIF wrote to Kelly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">\u201c[Claimant\u2019s] claim was recently accepted for a coccyx bone bruise.
