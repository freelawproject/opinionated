He assigns error to the denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal on each of those counts; we reject those assignments without discussion. Defendant also challenges the imposition of community service as a condition of probation, arguing that the court lacked authority to impose that condition without his consent. ORS 137.128(1) provides, in part: \u201cA judge may sentence an offender to community service either as an alternative to incarceration or fine or probation, or as a condition of probation. Prior to such order of community service the offender must consent to donate labor for the welfare of the public.\u201d The state concedes that defendant did not consent to donate labor for the welfare of the public and that the court therefore erred in imposing that condition of probation. We accept the state\u2019s concession and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
