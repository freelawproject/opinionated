The answer to that question determines whether claimant is entitled to benefits for \u201cwork disability\u201d based on consideration of social, vocational, and adaptability factors. <em>See </em>ORS 656.726(4)(f)(E); OAR 436-035-0008(2)(b); <em>SAIF v. VanBibber, </em>234 Or App 68, 71, 227 P3d 1224 (2010) (award of permanent partial disability to a worker who has not been released to regular work includes benefits for work disability). The board held that claimant had not been released to regular work at the job at injury and that he was therefore entitled to benefits for work disability, and SAIF petitions for judicial review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SAIF also challenges the board\u2019s determination that, in evaluating claimant\u2019s level of impairment, it could not consider two medical reports submitted by employer in support of the attending physician\u2019s impairment findings. We conclude that the board did not err in excluding the disputed evidence and that the board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence; accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The facts are largely undisputed. Claimant was first injured at work in 2002. At that time, claimant was working at employer\u2019s mill, \u201cpulling green chain.\u201d Employer accepted a claim for disabling cervical and thoracic strain and a fracture at Tl. The claim was closed in January 2003, with an award of two percent unscheduled permanent partial disability for the thoracic spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In April 2003, employer accepted an aggravation claim for the cervical and thoracic strain conditions. In 2004, employer terminated claimant\u2019s employment for reasons unrelated to his injury, and claimant began working as a carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In May 2005, employer modified its notice of acceptance to include, as a new or omitted medical condition, a disc bulge at C6-7; in July 2006, claimant had a discectomy and fusions at C5-6 and C6-7 to address that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>In August 2007, employer accepted pseudoarthrosis as a new or omitted condition, and claimant had surgery to address that condition in September 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In April 2008, claimant\u2019s surgeon, Dr. Gallo, declared claimant to be medically stationary. Gallo described claimant\u2019s \u201cjob-at-injury\u201d as \u201cjourneyman carpenter\u201d and released him to regular work. Claimant\u2019s care then shifted to Dr. Weller, his attending physician, who examined claimant on May 9,2008, and concluded that he could return to his regular work.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On June 12, 2008, employer corresponded with Weller, noting that Weller had reported different cervical ranges of motion than had Gallo. Employer asked Weller to \u201cclarify [claimant\u2019s] medically stationary status, release for regular work date and which [range of motion] findings are valid and should be used for the purpose of rating his disability. Please note that information below.\u201d On July 13,2008, in the space provided, Weller wrote: \u201cPt did have <em>o </em>ROM on my eval. At this time I am treating this as a waxing + waning of symptoms, but am concerned that this may indeed be an aggravation that has evolved since the closing evaluation/ PCE[.]\u201d Employer further asked Weller: \u201c[W]ith regard to his release to work status, [claimant] was pulling Greenchain when he was injured. We need to confirm that \u2018regular release\u2019 means he could return to his job at injury. Dr. Gallo released him to lift over 100 [pounds]. Do you agree?\u201d In the space provided, Weller wrote: \u201cYes \u2014 as I have not determined that there has been an aggravation to his injury yet, he continues to be released to regular work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Based on Gallo\u2019s and Weller\u2019s reports, employer closed the claim for aggravation and new or omitted medical conditions, with a total award of 28 percent unscheduled permanent partial disability for the cervical and thoracic spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Claimant requested reconsideration of the notice of closure, and Dr. Melson, a neurologist, was appointed as a medical arbiter. Melson examined claimant on September 29, 2008, and noted a marked increase in claimant\u2019s symptoms since claimant had been released for work by Gallo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>in April 2008. Melson noted reduced ranges of cervical and thoracic motion, significant limitations in repetitive use of the cervical and thoracic spine, weakness and reduced digital dexterity in the left upper extremity, and weakness and altered gait in the left lower extremity. In Melson\u2019s view, claimant\u2019s symptoms indicated spinal cord involvement, and Melson opined that claimant\u2019s fusion had failed. Melson said that claimant should be restricted to sedentary work and that he was precluded from stooping, climbing, crouching, balancing, crawling, reaching, kneeling, twisting, and pushing/pulling.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The Appellate Review Unit (ARU) described Melson\u2019s report as thorough and persuasive and concluded that a preponderance of the medical evidence did not establish a different level of impairment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ARU determined that claimant was eligible for work disability because he had not been released for work for his job at injury \u2014 pulling green chain\u2014 but rather had been released for work as a carpenter: \u201cThe worker had a regular release for a different job than the job at injury and the worker\u2019s regular work duties were not available at closure. Accordingly, we find adaptability factoring under OAR 436-035-0012 is appropriate in this review.\u201d Based on Melson\u2019s report, the ARU issued an order on reconsideration that increased claimant\u2019s award to 42 percent unscheduled disability, including a value of eight for \u201cwork disability.\u201d The ARU also awarded a scheduled disability of 14 percent for the left arm and 48 percent for the left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Employer requested a hearing, challenging, among other things, the ARU\u2019s determination that claimant had not been released to his job pulling green chain. The administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the ARU\u2019s determination. Like the ARU, the ALJ credited Melson\u2019s report, describing it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>impressive for its thoroughness and completeness.\u201d The ALJ noted that a worker\u2019s disability is to be determined as of the date of the reconsideration order. In part because of the changes in claimant\u2019s condition subsequent to his examinations by Gallo and Weller, the ALJ found that Melson\u2019s opinion as to claimant\u2019s disability was more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The ALJ considered and rejected employer\u2019s contention that the ARU had erred in concluding that claimant had been released to work as a carpenter rather than to his job at injury pulling green chain. In employer\u2019s view, Weller\u2019s July 13, 2008, concurrence in Gallo\u2019s release to regular work indicated agreement with Gallo\u2019s recommendation that claimant was released to his regular work at the job at injury. The ALJ rejected that contention, reasoning that, when the record is considered in its entirety, it is clear that Weller\u2019s release of claimant was not to work pulling green chain but to work as a carpenter. In any event, the ALJ noted that Melson had suggested a release to sedentary work. The ALJ affirmed the order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In upholding the ALJ\u2019s order, the board addressed, among other issues, whether claimant had been released for regular work for the job at injury. The board found as a preliminary matter that claimant\u2019s job at injury was the job that he held when he was first injured in 2002, pulling green chain, a fact that employer does not dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The board then addressed whether claimant had in fact been released to his job at injury \u2014 pulling green chain. As claimant\u2019s attending physician at the time of closure, Weller was the physician who was authorized to release him for regular work. ORS 656.214(2); ORS 656.726(4)(f)(E). The board noted that, in releasing claimant to work without restrictions, Gallo had mistakenly identified claimant\u2019s job at injury as journeyman carpenter. In light of that, the board concluded that Gallo had not released claimant to his job at injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The board then noted that, when employer solicited a work release from Weller, it correctly identified claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>job at injury as pulling green chain. However, in rejecting employer\u2019s contention that Weller\u2019s handwritten response to employer\u2019s inquiry constituted a release for that type of work, the board explained that Weller had not affirmatively stated that claimant could return to work pulling green chain or indicate that she had evaluated whether claimant could do that work. The board thus interpreted Weller\u2019s statement as a continuance of her concurrence in Gallo\u2019s work release, not as an independent determination that claimant was released for work pulling green chain. Thus, the board found that claimant had not been released to the job of pulling green chain and was therefore entitled to consideration of social/ vocational adaptability factors in the determination of permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Having concluded that claimant had not been released to his job at injury, the board then evaluated the evidence concerning claimant\u2019s level of impairment. As noted, Melson had concluded that claimant\u2019s symptoms indicated spinal cord involvement, and from those symptoms, Melson concluded that claimant\u2019s fusion had failed. In contending that a preponderance of the evidence showed that Weller\u2019s, and not Melson\u2019s, opinion of impairment was correct, employer cited two medical opinions, one from Gallo prepared in August 2008, and one from Dr. Lockfelt, prepared in September 2008, before the medical arbiter\u2019s examination. Employer asserted that those reports brought into question Melson\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s compensable fusion had failed and thereby undermined his opinion that claimant\u2019s new symptoms are related to the compensable condition. The board declined to consider the two additional medical reports for any purpose relating to the evaluation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>claimant\u2019s impairment, explaining that, pursuant to ORS 656.245(2)(b)(C),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 656.268(7),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and OAR 436-035-0007,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when a case is taken on reconsideration, only the reports of the medical arbiter and the attending physician at the time of closure may be considered in determining the claimant\u2019s impairment. The board noted an exception for findings made by other medical providers before the issuance of the medical arbiter\u2019s report in which the attending physician concurs. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>OAR 436-035-0007(6);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Tektronix, Inc. v. Watson, </em>132 Or App 483, 485-86, 888 P2d 1094 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The board explained, however, that because Weller, claimant\u2019s attending physician at the time of closure, had not concurred in the two additional reports, they could not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The dissenting board member disagreed, expressing the view that the two additional medical opinions could be considered, because they were not findings of impairment but, rather, supported the impairment findings that had been made by Weller.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On judicial review, employer continues to assert that the record requires the determination that claimant was released to his job at injury, <em>viz., </em>pulling green chain. We have reviewed the medical record in its entirety. In the context of the entire record \u2014 and especially in view of the facts that claimant had not worked pulling green chain since 2004, and Weller\u2019s earliest records dating from 2006 reflected that claimant worked as a carpenter \u2014 we conclude that Weller\u2019s handwritten response to employer\u2019s inquiry can reasonably be understood to simply reflect a continuance of Gallo\u2019s release, which was release to work as a journeyman carpenter. In particular, we note that the inquiry posed to Weller was, again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201c[W]ith regard to his release to work status, [claimant] was pulling Greenchain when he was injured. We need to confirm that \u2018regular release\u2019 means he could return to his job at injury. Dr. Gallo released him to lift over 100 [pounds]. Do you agree?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Weller\u2019s affirmative reply could thus reasonably be understood to respond to the second part of that inquiry \u2014 that is, that Weller agreed with Gallo\u2019s release of claimant \u201cto lift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>over 100 [pounds],\u201d and, as the board explained, not an indication] that she had independently evaluated claimant\u2019s ability to perform [pulling green chain] work.\u201d On this record, the board reasonably could conclude, as it did, that \u201cDr. Weller merely \u00a3continue[d] Dr. Gallo\u2019s work release.\u2019 \u201d We conclude, therefore, that the board reasonably interpreted Weller\u2019s handwritten responses not to be a release for work pulling green chain. Thus, the board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See VanBibber, </em>234 Or App at 78; <em>Hicks v. SAIF, </em>196 Or App 146, 100 P3d 1129 (2004). We therefore affirm the board\u2019s determination that claimant was not released for regular work to his job at injury and is entitled to consideration of \u201cwork disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">We turn to the question whether the board erred in excluding from the record two medical reports submitted by employer. Employer does not dispute that, under ORS 656.245 and ORS 656.268(7), and <em>Koitzsch v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>125 Or App 666, 670, 866 P2d 514 (1994), only the impairment findings of the medical arbiter and the attending physician may be considered in determining a claimant\u2019s impairment. Employer continues to assert, however, that the board erred in concluding that the two additional medical opinions could not be used to show that there were flaws in Melson\u2019s impairment findings and that those findings were not supported by a preponderance of the medical evidence. Employer contends that, contrary to the board\u2019s understanding, <em>Koitzsch </em>does not preclude consideration of any additional medical evidence for that purpose; rather, employer contends, <em>Koitzsch </em>\u2014 which was about the admissibility of an independent medical examination \u2014 only precludes consideration of independent medical examinations to impeach impairment findings of the attending physician or the medical arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Employer contends farther that where, as here, the issue in dispute is not the <em>rating </em>of impairment, but the conditions to be rated, the additional evidence is admissible for the purpose of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that claimant\u2019s symptoms are not attributable to a failed fusion and that, therefore, any impairment resulting from claimant\u2019s new symptoms is not related to the compensable condition and is not ratable.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Claimant responds that the board correctly limited the record on reconsideration to the medical arbiter\u2019s report and the attending physician\u2019s report, and that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that the arbiter\u2019s report is more persuasive because it is more thorough and was issued closer to the date of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Thus, the issue before us is the scope of the restriction or limitation on the use of medical evidence relating to impairment. Do the statutes and administrative rules merely restrict who may submit impairment findings, as employer contends, or do they also prohibit consideration of outside medical evidence other than the medical arbiter and the attending physician in the weighing of evidence and determination of impairment? Specifically, pursuant to OAR 436-035-0007(5), can physicians\u2019 reports other than those of the medical arbiter or those made or adopted by the attending physician be considered for the purpose of determining whether \u201ca preponderance of the medical evidence demonstrates that different [impairment] findings by the attending physician\u201d are more persuasive?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We certainly have suggested in <em>dicta </em>in several opinions that medical evidence of the type at issue here cannot be considered. In <em>Koitzsch, </em>the claimant sought to be compensated for a loss of sensation that she asserted was caused by her compensable carpal tunnel syndrome. The claimant\u2019s attending physician found that the claimant suffered from a total loss of sensation. The employer\u2019s physician, Dr. Nathan, found that the claimant\u2019s disability was only partial. The board, in affirming the ALJ, held that, although Nathan\u2019s opinion could not be relied upon as a basis for the disability award because he was not the claimant\u2019s attending physician, his impairment findings could nonetheless be used to impeach or support the findings of the attending physician. 125 Or App at 669. Citing legislative history, we rejected the contention, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cThose [legislative history] references indicate that the legislature intended to eliminate Board reliance on independent medical examinations as a basis for its evaluation of a worker\u2019s disability. The objective of the statute was to save employers the cost of such examinations and to require the Board to consider only the attending physician\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>impairment findings in evaluating a disability. The Board\u2019s interpretation defeats that objective, because it invites employers to pay for independent medical examinations that might develop findings that employers could use to impeach the attending physician\u2019s findings. The legislature intended to eliminate the incentive to incur those costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">\u201cWe recognize the distinction between offering an independent medical examiner\u2019s impairment findings for impeachment, rather than as proof of employer\u2019s factual contention regarding the extent of impairment. However, the statute does not make that distinction. An independent medical examiner\u2019s impairment findings that the employer offers for impeachment are, nonetheless, findings regarding the worker\u2019s impairment that evaluate the disability. The legislature intended to permit only the attending physician to make such findings. The Board violated ORS 656.245(3)(b)(B) by receiving and considering the impairment findings of an independent medical examiner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 670.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Koitzsch, </em>we concluded that evidence of impairment findings from an independent medical examiner could not be considered at all, not even for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">It is true, as employer contends, that <em>Koitzsch </em>only addressed independent medical examinations. However, since <em>Koitzsch, </em>we have considered several times the scope of the record on reconsideration in the rating of impairment and have applied Koitzsch\u2019s principles to other contexts. In <em>Hicks v. SAIF, </em>194 Or App 655, 659, 96 P3d 856, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>196 Or App 146, 100 P3d 1129 (2004), we held that the board is not free to reject a medical arbiter\u2019s opinion of impairment if it is the only opinion of impairment and unambiguously attributes the claimant\u2019s permanent impairment to the compensable condition. We explained that, under ORS 656.268(7), when a case is on reconsideration, the board must accept the opinion of the medical arbiter, unless the other medical opinion\u201d establishes a different level of impairment. 194 Or App at 659. Citing ORS 656.245(2)(b)(B) <em>tm&amp;Koitzsch, </em>we said that \u201cother medical opinion\u201d \u201cmay come from findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of the attending physician or physicians with whom the attending physician concurs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In <em>Sisters of Providence v. McGuire, </em>183 Or App 503, 508, 52 P3d 1113 (2002), in rejecting the employer\u2019s contention that the board erred in failing to consider two \u201ccompelled medical examinations\u201d when determining the claimant\u2019s disability, we said that, on reconsideration of claim closure, \u201cthe only admissible medical opinions regarding impairment are those made or adopted by the attending physician and those made by an appointed medical arbiter or arbiters.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In <em>Tektronix, Inc., </em>132 Or App at 486, we explained that, when a medical arbiter is appointed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cthe record correctly before the referee, the Board and the court * * * includes the reports that claimant\u2019s attending physician issued before the medical arbiter\u2019s report, the medical arbiter\u2019s report, and any report related to impairment that is ratified by the attending physician before the medical arbiter\u2019s report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\"><em>See also Libbett, </em>130 Or App at 52 (citing <em>Koitzsch </em>in support of statement that purpose of statutory restriction that \u201conly the attending physician at the time of claim closure may make findings regarding the worker\u2019s impairment\u201d is to eliminate board\u2019s reliance on independent medical examinations <em>for any purpose </em>in its evaluation of a worker\u2019s disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Thus, we have on many occasions said that, in the context of a reconsideration of a claimant\u2019s impairment, the limitation on the scope of the record to the opinions of the medical arbiter and the attending physician applies not only to direct findings of impairment but to other medical evidence offered in the context of an evaluation of a worker\u2019s disability. We adhere to those previous interpretations of the statutes and administrative rules. Considered together, ORS 656.245(2)(b)(C), ORS 656.268(7), and OAR 436-035-0007(5) and (6), go beyond a mere limitation on whose impairment findings may be considered, but also limit the medical evidence that may be considered in determining a claimant\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Employer points out that ORS 656.726(4)(f)(B), which provides that \u201c[impairment is established by a preponderance of medical evidence based on objective findings,\u201d does not place any restriction on the type of medical evidence that may be considered in evaluating a preponderance of the evidence. In employer\u2019s view, a rational distinction can and should be made between the type of evidence permitted for findings of impairment and the type of evidence that may be considered for the purpose of determining whether those findings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. We agree with employer that, in the abstract, ORS 656.726(4)(f)(B) does not limit the type of medical evidence that may be evaluated as a preponderance of the medical evidence, but we conclude nonetheless that that standard must be viewed in the context of ORS 656.245(2)(b)(C), ORS 656.268(7), and OAR 436-035-0007(5) and (6), and our prior case law as described above. In applying the \u201cpreponderance of medical evidence\u201d standard to determine a claimant\u2019s impairment rating, the entire universe of medical evidence that may be considered consists of the medical arbiter\u2019s report, ORS 656.268(7); OAR 436-035-0007(5), the opinion of the attending physician, ORS 656.245(2)(b)(C), and any physicians\u2019 report in which the attending physician concurs, OAR 436-035-0007(6). As we said in <em>Koitzsch, </em>employer\u2019s interpretation would defeat the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting ORS 656.245(2)(b)(C) to eliminate incentives for insurers to incur costs for medical examinations aimed at undermining the opinion of the attending physician or, in this case, the medical arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We reject without discussion SAIF\u2019s contention in its first assignment of error that the board erred in awarding additional permanent partial disability based on a redetermination of disability because the record lacks medical evidence of an actual worsening of claimant\u2019s condition at the time of claim closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\"> We note that SAIF did not become involved in this case until after the board had issued its order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> OAR 436-035-0007(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201cImpairment is established based on objective findings of the attending physician under ORS 656.245(2)(b)(C) and OAR 436-010-0280.
