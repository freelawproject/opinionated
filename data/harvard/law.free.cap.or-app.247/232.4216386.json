ORS 656.202(1). Employer awarded claimant \u201cpermanent partial disability.\u201d ORS 656.214. The award included a payment for \u201cimpairment,\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(a), but not for \u201cwork disability,\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(e). Claimant sought administrative review, asserting that she was entitled to a payment for work disability because she had not returned to or been released to \u201cregular work.\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(a), (b). Specifically, claimant asserted that she had not returned to or been released to \u201cregular work\u201d because she had not returned to or been released to work the overtime hours that she had worked on a regular basis before her injury. On review, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (Board) accepted claimant\u2019s assertion, reasoning that, for the purposes of ORS 656.214(2), claimant\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d included the overtime hours that she had worked on a regular basis before her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Employer petitions for judicial review, asserting that the board erred in concluding that claimant\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d included her overtime hours.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Employer does not dispute that claimant worked overtime, nor does employer assign error to the Board\u2019s finding regarding the frequency of claimant\u2019s overtime. Instead, employer contends that, because there was no evidence that claimant was required to work the overtime hours, the overtime hours were not part of her \u201cregular work.\u201d In other words, employer argues that, for the purposes of ORS 656.214(2), \u201cregular work\u201d includes only the work that a worker is required to do, and not additional work that a worker elects to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that, for the purposes of ORS 656.214(2), a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d includes overtime that the worker works on a regular basis, regardless of whether the worker is required to work the overtime. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>We begin by explaining the relevant statutory context. A worker who suffers a permanent partial disability as a result of a work-related injury is entitled to a permanent partial disability award. ORS 656.214. At a minimum, a permanent partial disability award includes a payment for \u201cimpairment.\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(a). \u201cImpairment\u201d is \u201cthe loss of use or function of a body part or system due to the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease * * *, expressed as a percentage of the whole person.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(a). The amount of a payment for impairment is determined by multiplying the impairment percentage by \u201c100 times the average weekly wage.\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(a). A worker is entitled to a payment for impairment regardless of whether the impairment actually affects the worker\u2019s ability to perform his or her \u201cregular work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In addition to a payment for impairment, a worker who suffers a permanent partial disability as a result of a work-related injury is entitled to a payment for \u201cwork disability\u201d if \u201cthe worker has not been released to regular work * * * or has not returned to regular work at the job held at the time of injury[.]\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(b). \u201cWork disability\u201d is \u201cimpairment modified by age, education and adaptability to perform a given job.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(e). The amount of a work-disability payment is determined by \u201cmultiplying the impairment value, as modified by the factors of age, education and adaptability to perform a given job, times 150 times the worker\u2019s weekly wage for the job at injury.\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">With that statutory context in mind, we turn to the facts of this case, as found by the board. Claimant worked in employer\u2019s warehouse as an \u201corder puller.\u201d Claimant\u2019s job description did not state how many hours the position required. On average, claimant worked 43 hours per week, including overtime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In April 2008, claimant suffered a work-related back injury. In September 2008, claimant\u2019s doctor filled out a form stating that claimant was released to \u201cregular work,\u201d but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201cnot to do any overtime.\u201d The doctor indicated that the limitation on overtime was permanent. The record contains no evidence that claimant worked any overtime after the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The issue in this case is whether claimant returned to, or was released to, \u201cregular work at the job held at the time of injury.\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(a), (b). That is a question of statutory interpretation, and our task is to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent by employing the methodology prescribed in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Accordingly, we look first to the text of the statute in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">When interpreting a statute, we give words of common usage their \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary meaning[s].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). \u201cRegular\u201d is defined, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c3 a : steady or uniform in course, practice, or occurrence : not subject to unexplained or irrational variation : steadily pursued : ORDERLY, METHODICAL * * <em>* </em>b (1) : returning, recurring, or received at stated, fixed, or uniform intervals * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1913 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cWork\u201d is defined, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c1 * * * b : the labor, task, or duty that affords one his accustomed means of livelihood * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 2634. And, \u201cjob\u201d is defined, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">\u201c5 a: a regular remunerative employment : POSITION, SITUATION * * * b: a specific duty, role, or function : work customarily performed * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Those definitions indicate that a person\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d work is the work that the person does on a \u201csteady\u201d or \u201crecurring\u201d basis, <em>id. </em>at 1913, and that a person\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d consists of the \u201clabor, task, or duty that affords [the person his or her] accustomed means of livelihood,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2634. Similarly, a person\u2019s \u201cjob\u201d is the person\u2019s \u201cregular remunerative employment,\u201d that is, the \u201cduty, role, or function\u201d that the person \u201ccustomarily perform[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217. All of those definitions indicate that a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d consists of the paid labor, task, duty, role, or function that the worker performs for an employer on a recurring or customary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Notably, the definitions of \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cjob\u201d refer broadly to the labor, tasks, duty, role, and function of a worker; nothing indicates, as employer suggests, that their meanings are limited to what is expressly required by the employer, such as what is contained in the worker\u2019s job description. Although a worker\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d no doubt encompasses those express requirements, the definitions also contemplate that the work that a worker actually carries out\u2014 that is, his or her actual labor, task, role, and function \u2014 is included in the meaning of \u201cregular work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Nevertheless, employer focuses only on the term \u201cduty\u201d and makes two arguments. First, employer argues that a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d includes only the worker\u2019s duties and not his or her hours. Second, employer argues that, even if a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d includes the worker\u2019s hours, it does not include the worker\u2019s overtime hours. We address those arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">More specifically, employer\u2019s first argument is that a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d depends \u201con the duties performed, not the hours worked.\u201d To the extent that employer is arguing that a worker\u2019s \u201cduties\u201d are only the actions that a worker performs, and are independent of how long the worker must perform them, that argument fails. Indeed, as employer acknowledged at oral argument, a full-time worker who, as a result of an injury, can only return to work part time has not returned to \u201cregular work.\u201d That is true even if the worker is able to perform the same actions as before, just not for as long. Thus, if a warehouse worker had worked 40 hours per week pulling orders before an injury and were only able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>return to work 20 hours a week after the injury, the worker would not have returned to \u201cregular work,\u201d even though the worker was still able to pull orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In arguing that a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d does not depend on a worker\u2019s hours, employer posits that, if the legislature had intended a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d to include a worker\u2019s hours, then the statutory factors for calculating the amount of a work-disability award would refer to a reduction in a claimant\u2019s working hours. <em>See </em>ORS 656.214(l)(e) (\u201c \u201cWork disability\u2019 means impairment modified by [three factors:] age, education and adaptability to perform a given job.\u201d). The legislature listed those factors, but it did not define them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The statute, however, does not preclude consideration of a claimant\u2019s hours in the determination of the amount of a work-disability award. The adaptability factor \u2014 \u201cadaptability to perform a given job,\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(e) \u2014 could account for the diminution in the number of hours that a claimant can work. If a claimant cannot work as many hours as she worked before the injury, she is less adaptable than she was before the injury. In fact, the administrative rule for calculating the adaptability factor <em>does </em>take into account the length of time for which a claimant can work. <em>See </em>OAR 436-035-0012(8X1). Thus, employer\u2019s first argument \u2014 that a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d depends \u201con the duties performed, not the hours worked\u201d \u2014 is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Employer\u2019s second argument is that, even if the board could consider claimant\u2019s hours in determining whether she had returned to, or been released to return to, \u201cregular work,\u201d it could only consider her nonovertime hours. Again, employer focuses on the term \u201cduty\u201d and argues that only the hours that a worker is required to work are relevant to a determination of whether a worker should receive a payment for work disability. That argument also fails. As set out above, the definitions for \u201cregular,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d and \u201cjob,\u201d all indicate that the legislature was concerned about the work that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>worker did on a steady or customary basis. That concern supports including overtime as part of a worker\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d when it is performed on a steady or customary basis. Doing so helps ensure that a worker is compensated not only for the general effects of a disability, but also for the particular effects of the disability on the worker\u2019s ability to perform his or her job at injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">In sum, we conclude that \u201cregular work\u201d includes the work that a worker actually performs on a steady or customary basis, including overtime. Thus, the board did not err in interpreting claimant\u2019s \u201cregular work\u201d to include the overtime that she worked on a steady and customary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> Employer also argues that the board erred in awarding claimant attorney fees for the same reasons that it erred in ruling in claimant\u2019s favor. Our disposition of the case obviates the need to discuss that assignment of error separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> The board found that \u201cclaimant worked 17 weeks of overtime within the six months preceding the injury, 10 within the preceding three months, and five within a month.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-13\"> The legislature defined \u201cregular work\u201d as \u201cthe job the worker held at injury.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(d). One of the statutory provisions at issue states that, if a worker \u201chas been released to regular work * * * or has returned to regular work at the job held at the time of injury,\u201d permanent partial disability is awarded only for \u201cimpairment.\u201d ORS 656.214(2)(a). The other, ORS 656.214(2)(b), contains similar language. If we read the definition of \u201cregular work\u201d in context, then, it becomes redundant: If a worker \u201chas returned to [the job the worker held at injury] at the job held at the time of injury,\u201d permanent partial disability is awarded only for \u201cimpairment.\u201d As a result of that redundancy, we conclude that the ordinary meanings of the words \u201cregular,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d and \u201cjob\u201d are all relevant to the meaning of the phrase \u201cregular work\u201d despite the statutory definition of the phrase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> The legislature delegated the definition of the factors to the director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. ORS 656.726(4)(f)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> In arguing that \u201cregular work\u201d for the purposes of ORS 656.214(2)(a) and (b) does not include overtime, employer relies on OAR 436-035-0012(8X1). That provision defines \u201crestrictions\u201d for the purpose of calculating the adaptability factor of a work-disability award. By contrast, the \u201cregular work\u201d inquiry determines whether a claimant qualifies for work disability at all. Even assuming that the rule provides relevant context for the interpretation of ORS 656.214, nothing in OAR 436-035-0012 or in ORS 656.214 suggests that OAR 436-035-0012(8X1) has any bearing on a claimant\u2019s eligibility for a work-disability award. In light of the lack of any direct connection between the rule\u2019s definition of \u201crestrictions\u201d and the statutory phrase \u201cregular work,\u201d employer\u2019s argument is not persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
