The court imposed a total term of incarceration of 96 months of imprisonment with three years of post-prison supervision, including a presumptive sentence of 14 months of imprisonment on Count 2. Defendant seeks reversal of the judgment of conviction and sentence on Count 2 only, assigning error to the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that the state failed to prove he was \u201caided\u201d by another person actually present, because verbal encouragement to the person committing the assault does not constitute aiding within the meaning of ORS 163.165(l)(e). The state responds that a defendant is \u201caided\u201d if the person was \u201cat hand, or within reach, sight or call during\u201d the assault and \u201cpresented an added threat to the victim\u2019s safety.\u201d We agree with the state and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We review motions for judgment of acquittal to determine whether, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The victim was walking in a crosswalk across a busy intersection when the occupants of a car that was stopped at the traffic light began to verbally harass him. Defendant then leaned out of the car\u2019s rear window, and said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s me, Big D.\u201d The victim did not recognize defendant or the other three occupants of the car and continued walking through the crosswalk and down the street without responding to the harassment. The driver turned the car around and pulled up next to the victim. Three people, including defendant, got out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and approached the victim on the sidewalk. Defendant started beating the victim \u2014 delivering approximately 30 blows to his head and body, tackling him, and hitting his head against a concrete wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">One of defendant\u2019s companions, Cruz, stood behind defendant and encouraged him to continue the assault by saying, \u201cThat\u2019s right, bitch\u201d and similar remarks. Another companion, Turner, stood behind defendant and encouraged him to stop the assault. The victim did not fight back. The victim said that he did not want to fight defendant, asked defendant to stop beating him, and tried to get away. However, defendant replied, \u201cHell, no,\u201d and continued the beating. After the assault, the victim tried to retrieve his hat, which had fallen onto the ground, but Cruz put the hat on his own head and refused to return it. The defendant and his companions returned to the car, laughing and yelling obscenities at the victim, and then drove away. The victim went to the hospital, where it took four staples to repair a laceration of his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As noted, defendant was charged with assault in the third degree. When the state rested, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state failed to prove that defendant was \u201caided\u201d by another person actually present. The state contended that the victim testified to all elements of the crime, and the jury could believe him. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion based on the finding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cin the light most favorable to the State[,] we have an individual that is totally unprovoked. And if you believe the victim, a totally unprovoked assault, and individuals getting out of the car. And at least one other individual in \u2014 in close proximity encouraging [defendant] to continue with the assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cAnd the victim is on the ground, and a number of other reasons that there are more than sufficient evidence to send it to the trier of fact for Assault in the Third Degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The jury found defendant guilty on that count and other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">On appeal, defendant renews his argument that verbally encouraging a person committing an assault does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>constitute aid by another person actually present for purposes of ORS 163.165(l)(e). The state argues that, when another person present encouraged defendant to beat the victim, defendant was \u201caided\u201d by that person. These arguments raise a question of statutory interpretation. We discern legislative intent by considering the text, context, and any helpful legislative history of the statute. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The parties essentially agree on the applicable definition of \u201caid,\u201d the context in which \u201caided by another person actually present\u201d is used in ORS 163.165(1)(e), and the relevant portions of the statute\u2019s legislative history. However, they disagree on how those sources inform legislative intent regarding the sole issue in this case, whether verbally encouraging the person committing the assault constitutes aid within the meaning of ORS 163.165(l)(e). We now consider each source in turn to determine legislative intent on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">We have previously characterized aid within the meaning of ORS 163.165(l)(e) as a legal term of art, meaning \u201c \u2018[t]o support, help, assist or strengthen[;] [a]ct in cooperation with; supplement the efforts of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pine, </em>181 Or App 105, 110, 45 P3d 151 (2002), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>336 Or 194, 82 P3d 130 (2003) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>68 (6th ed 1990)). The parties also agree that <em>Webster\u2019s </em>dictionary definition aids in determining the meaning of ORS 163.165(1)(e): \u201cTo \u2018aid\u2019 means to help * * * to give help or support * * * to further, facilitate, assist * * * contribute to * * * to give assistance to * * * be of use.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>44 (unabridged ed 2002). Defendant argues that that definition does not encompass mere verbal encouragement. The state responds that verbal encouragement by defendant\u2019s companion satisfied that definition because that verbal encouragement gave support to and furthered or facilitated defendant\u2019s attack. We agree with the state that the legislature\u2019s use of \u201caided,\u201d when accompanied by the companion\u2019s proximity, encompasses verbal encouragement. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that verbal encouragement of the assault is functionally the same as offering to help if needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Next, we consider the context. The parties agree that ORS 161.155(2)(b), accomplice liability, and ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>164.405(1)(b), robbery in the second degree, provide useful context to interpret the meaning of \u201caided\u201d as used in ORS 163.165(1)(e). ORS 161.155(2)(b) establishes that a person is criminally liable for the conduct of another person constituting a crime if, \u201c[w]ith the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime[,] the person * * * [a]ids or abets or agrees or attempts to aid or abet such other person in planning or committing the crime[.]\u201d The term \u201caids or abets,\u201d as used in that statute, means \u201c \u2018advises, counsels, procures, or encourages another to commit a crime.\u2019 \u201d Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 13,13 (July 1970) (quoting <em>State v. Rosser, </em>162 Or 293, 344, 91 P2d 295 (1939)). ORS 163.165(1)(e) does not require a subjective intent by the aider to promote or facilitate the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">ORS 164.405(1)(b) establishes that a person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree if the person commits the crime of robbery in the third degree and is \u201caided by another person actually present.\u201d Both parties rely on our interpretation of that phrase in <em>State v. Miller, </em>14 Or App 608, 513 P2d 1199 (1973), and <em>State v. Jackson, </em>212 Or App 51, 157 P3d 239, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 206 (2007). In <em>Miller, </em>we held that an \u201caider\u201d within the meaning of ORS 164.405 includes a person who was \u201cat hand, or within reach, sight or call\u201d of the principal during the commission of the crime, and who \u201cpresent[ed] an added threat to the victim\u2019s safety.\u201d 14 Or App at 611 (citing Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7\u00a7 148-150,154-57 (1970)). We concluded that the state had satisfied its burden to prove that a purse snatcher was \u201caided by another person actually present\u201d with evidence that the defendant\u2019s companion stood 25 feet away during the offense and then ran from the scene with the defendant, because a jury could legitimately infer that the companion was within easy access to aid the purse snatcher if necessary. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction of robbery in the second degree when the getaway driver was actually present, within sight, and able to aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Similarly in <em>Jackson, </em>we held there was sufficient evidence for a jury to infer that a purse snatcher was \u201caided by another person actually present\u201d when the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>companion was sitting in a getaway car 25 feet away. 212 Or App at 53. The defendant in <em>Jackson </em>argued that \u201ca jury should not be permitted to infer the requisite capability of intervention merely from the physical proximity of another person acting as a getaway driver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. We considered the totality of the circumstances and held that a jury could find that the getaway driver \u201caided\u201d the purse snatcher because the robbery occurred in the companion\u2019s plain view (\u201cwithin reach, sight or call\u201d) and while the companion was sitting in a car with its engine running, which presented \u201ca very real and immediate \u2018added threat to the victim\u2019s safety.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miller, </em>14 Or App at 611).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Defendant contends that <em>Miller </em>and <em>Jackson </em>addressed only the meaning of \u201cactually present\u201d and not what constitutes aiding. We disagree. In <em>Jackson, </em>the defendant argued that the state must prove aiding independently from proximity. 212 Or App at 53. We expressly rejected that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cIn particular, defendant argues that the state\u2019s evidence proved only that his codefendant, Rennells, was present in order to facilitate the defendant\u2019s getaway from the robbery and that that was insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish that, in committing a third-degree robbery, defendant was \u2018aided by another person actually present\u2019 within the meaning of ORS 164.405(l)(b). The state responds that, under ORS 164.405(l)(b), the state was required only to establish that Rennells was in such physical proximity to the robbery <em>as to be readily capable of assisting defendant in exerting force upon the victim. </em>We agree with the state\u2019s understanding of the statute and determine that <em>the evidence regarding Rennells\u2019s participation was legally sufficient.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, a jury can legitimately infer aiding from the proximity of another person to the defendant and that person\u2019s capability to assist the defendant in exerting force upon the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The facts in this case are analogous to those in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Jackson. </em>Defendant\u2019s companion, Cruz, was standing on the sidewalk behind defendant and, therefore, was \u201cat hand, or within reach, sight, or call.\u201d The jury could infer that Cruz\u2019s verbal encouragement prolonged or intensified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>assault and therefore \u201cpresented an added threat to victim\u2019s safety.\u201d Thus, we conclude based on the facts of this case that physical presence along with verbal encouragement constitutes \u201caid\u201d under ORS 163.165(l)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">This interpretation is also consistent with the legislative history of ORS 163.165(l)(e). Although that history shows that the bill was directed primarily at gang assaults, the bill\u2019s proponents also made clear that the act of encouraging an assault while being physically present constitutes aiding. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, HB 2018, Mar 19, 1991, Tape 56, Side A (statement of Terry Leggert); Testimony, House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, HB 2018, Mar 19, 1991, Ex B (statement of Terry Leggert).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a jury could reasonably find that another person standing by encouraged defendant and therefore aided defendant in the assault of the victim. Under the totality of circumstances, the state provided sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was \u201caided by another person actually present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\"> OES 163.165(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assault in the third degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201c(e) While being aided by another person actually present, intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\"> We discuss only defendant\u2019s conviction for assault in the third degree, because that is the sole issue defendant raises on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
