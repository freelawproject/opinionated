Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">This case was commenced as an original proceeding in this Court on November 30, 1977 when plaintiff attorney Allan Falk filed a pleading entitled \"Petition for Special Relief\u2019 which named the State Bar of Michigan as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s petition is a three-page document which sets forth a series of factual allegations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>legal assertions expressing his First Amendment objections to various activities and expenditures of the State Bar of Michigan, to which he must belong and pay dues. While Mr. Falk brings an unusual, and relatively complex, claim to this Court, we find that his petition bears at best only a remote resemblance to a complaint under our court rules, GCR 1963, 101, 111. The petition certainly contains allegations that various activities and expenditures of the State Bar violate the plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we are unable to discern the statement of any other claim or cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the demand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>judgment or relief (see GCR 1963, 111.1[3]) requests only that the \"petition for special relief be granted\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We treat the petition as a complaint for a writ of superintending control over the State Bar of Michigan, within our original jurisdiction pursuant to GCR 1963, 851(6); MCL 600.215, 600.219; MSA 27A.215, 27A.219. We further interpret the petition as seeking an order from this Court relieving the plaintiff of the obligation of paying the pro rata portion of his State Bar dues which relates to alleged \"unlawful and unconstitutional activities\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Our role under these unusual circumstances is comparable to that of a trial court, responsible for making the appropriate factual determinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and applicable conclusions of law in reaching a judgment resolving the claims presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Subsequent to the filing of Mr. Falk\u2019s petition, this Court entered an order appointing former Judge Maurice E. Schoenberger to conduct a hearing and make findings of fact on the issues presented in this case. 402 Mich 960 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On June 5 and 6, 1978, the hearing was held, and both parties presented testimony relating to the various activities and functions of the State Bar. A transcript of the hearing is part of the present record. On September 29, 1978 Judge Schoenberger submitted his report to this Court. The report summarizes the presentations of the State Bar and Mr. Falk, lists the exhibits received into evidence at the hearing, and concludes that there are no controverted factual matters which require resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Thereafter, plaintiff Falk filed a brief, a reply brief, and a supplemental reply brief. The defendant State Bar filed a brief in opposition and a motion to file an answer to plaintiff\u2019s supplemental reply brief which contained the answering brief. All of this material has been considered by this Court. Finally, pursuant to our order of April 6, 1979 oral arguments were heard on June 5, 1979. 406 Mich 1117 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">A review of the record establishes certain salient facts relating to plaintiff Falk\u2019s claim. One of those uncontroverted facts is that the State of Michigan, through the combined actions of this Court, the Legislature, and the State Bar, compels all licensed attorneys to associate in and provide financial support for the integrated State Bar. Another uncontroverted fact is that the State Bar engages in various lobbying efforts in the Legislature, and that such efforts are financed, at least in part, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the compulsorily exacted dues of the bar\u2019s members. It is likewise undisputed that compulsory bar dues are used to finance other activities which plaintiff contends are non-regulatory in nature, such as the Prepaid Legal Services programs, Lawyer Referral Service programs, the Lawyer Placement Service, and the Client Security Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The integrated State Bar of Michigan was legislatively authorized by 1935 PA 58.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, this Court, in cognizance of the legislation and pursuant to its own inherent power to regulate the practice of law in this state,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> entered an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>organizing, and promulgating rules concerning, the integrated bar.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Section 1 of the first Supreme Court Rules Concerning the State Bar provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\"The State bar of Michigan is the association of the members of the bar of this State, organized pursuant to powers of the Supreme Court over the bar of the State. The association shall, under these rules, aid in the promotion of improvements in the administration of justice and the advancement of the science of jurisprudence, in the improvement of the relations between the profession and the public, and in the promotion of the interests of the legal profession in this State.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">This original declaration of the purposes of the integrated bar has not been materially altered by any restatement in the subsequent 44 years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">At all times since the formation of our integrated State Bar, all actively practicing lawyers in this state have been required to be members of,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and pay dues to,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>There can be no question that since 1935 the privilege of practicing law in this state has been conditioned upon association with, and financial support of, the integrated State Bar of Michigan compelled by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">II. Relevant United States Supreme Court Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Our analysis of Mr. Falk\u2019s claim under the First Amendment is controlled, of course, by the applicable decisions of the United States Supreme Court. We therefore here undertake the task of presenting our understanding of certain United States Supreme Court decisions which are implicated by Mr. Falk\u2019s claims and the State Bar\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\n<em>A. Hanson, Street, and Lathrop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In <em>Railway Employes\u2019 Dep\u2019t v Hanson, </em>351 US 225; 76 S Ct 714; 100 L Ed 1112 (1956), non-union employees of a railroad brought suit in a Nebraska state court against the railroad and various unions representing the railroad\u2019s employees seeking to enjoin anticipated enforcement of a union shop<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> agreement entered into between the railroad and the unions. The contract required that all employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ees of the railroad become members of the specified union as a condition of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The union shop agreement was permissively authorized by the Federal Railway Labor Act. That act authorized union shop agreements \"notwithstanding the law of 'any State\u2019 \u201d. 351 US 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The Nebraska state constitution contained a \"right to work\u201d provision which outlawed union shop agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The Nebraska trial court enjoined enforcement of the agreement. The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the union shop agreement violated the First Amendment in that it deprived employees of their freedom of association, and violated the Fifth Amendment,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in that it required members of the union to pay for activities above and apart from the costs relating to collective bargaining. The Nebraska Supreme Court concluded that the relevant provisions of the Railway Labor Act were unconstitutional under the Federal constitution, and therefore did not supersede the Nebraska state constitution\u2019s right to work provision. 160 Neb 669; 71 NW2d 526 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The United States Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Justice Douglas, reversed. While the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hanson </em>has been accorded varying interpretations in later cases, we believe that <em>Hanson </em>narrowly held: (1) that Congress\u2019 bare authorization of union shops was within the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tutional realm of legislative policy making under the Commerce Clause,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in pursuit of labor peace; and (2) that the <em>Hanson </em>record did not present any concrete, justiciable First Amendment issues relating to the union shop agreement\u2019s potential impairment of freedom of expression or forcing of ideological conformity, since the action had been commenced before the effective date of the agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 351 US 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v Street, </em>367 US 740; 81 S Ct 1784; 6 L Ed 2d 1141 (1961), a union shop agreement entered into under the Railway Labor Act was challenged by objecting railroad employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The employees brought an action in a Georgia state court alleging that substantial portions of their compulsory union dues were being used to finance the campaigns of political candidates, and to advance the propagation of political and economic doctrines to which the plaintiffs were opposed. The agreement in <em>Street </em>was in effect at the time the action was brought and a concrete record was therefore presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The state trial court entered a judgment for the plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of the agreement to the extent that it permitted the use of dues for political purposes and the propagation of ideologies which the plaintiffs opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. 215 Ga 27; 108 SE2d 796 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>On appeal, the United States Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Brennan signed by four Justices, with two additional Justices concurring in the decisional analysis, reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion considered the <em>Hanson </em>decision at length. The inadequacy of the <em>Hanson </em>record with respect to the justiciability of the possible First Amendment issues was emphasized. <em>Hanson </em>was read as only reaching the facial constitutionality of the Railway Labor Act\u2019s authorization of union shop agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\"In their brief in this Court the appellees in <em>Hanson </em>argued that First Amendment rights would be infringed by the enforcement of an agreement which would enable compulsorily collected funds to be used for political purposes. But there was nothing concrete in the record to show the extent to which the unions were actually spending money for political purposes and what these purposes were, nothing to show the extent to which union funds collected from members were being used to meet the costs of political activity and the mechanism by which this was done, and nothing to show that the employees there involved opposed the use of their money for any particular political objective. In contrast, the present record contains detailed information on all these points, and specific findings were made in the courts below as to all of them. When it is recalled that the action in <em>Hanson </em>was brought before the union-shop agreement became effective and that the appellees never thereafter showed that the unions were actually engaged in furthering political causes with which they disagreed and that their money would be used to support such activities, it becomes obvious that this Court passed merely on the constitutional validity of \u00a7 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act on its face, and not as applied to infringe the particularized constitutional rights of any individual. On such a record, the Court could not have done more, consistently with the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>straints that govern us in the adjudication of constitutional questions and warn against their premature decision. We therefore reserved decision of the constitutional questions which the appellees present in this case. We said: \"It is argued that compulsory membership will be used to impair freedom of expression. But that problem is not presented by this record * * * if the exaction of dues, initiation fees, or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First Amendment, this judgment will not prejudice the decision in that case. For we pass narrowly on \u00a7 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act. <em>We only hold that the requirement for \u00f1nancial support of the collective-bargaining agency by all who receive the bene\u00f1ts of its work is within the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause and does not violate either the First or the Fifth Amendments.\u201d Id. </em>351 US 238. See, also, 351 US 242 (concurring opinion). <em>Thus all that was held in Hanson was that \u00a7 2, Eleventh was constitutional in its bare authorization of union-shop contracts requiring workers to give \u00f1nancial support\u2019 to unions legally authorized to act as their collective bargaining agents. </em>We sustained this requirement \u2014 and only this requirement \u2014 embodied in the statutory authorization of agreements under which 'all employees shall become members of the labor organization representing their craft or class.\u2019 <em>Clearly we passed neither upon forced association in any other aspect nor upon the issue of the use of exacted money for political causes which were opposed by the employees.\u201d </em>(Footnote omitted, emphasis supplied.) 367 US 747-749.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Finding the <em>Street </em>record sufficiently concrete to present the issues not decided in <em>Hanson, </em>the Court went through an exhaustive analysis of the legislative histories of various Federal railroad labor acts, and then delivered the following construction of the Railway Labor Act\u2019s union shop provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\"We give \u00a7 2, Eleventh the construction which achieves both congressional purposes when we hold, as we do, that \u00a7 2, Eleventh is to be construed to deny the unions, over an employee\u2019s objection, the power to use his exacted funds to support political causes which he opposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\"We express no view as to other union expenditures objected to by an employee and not made to meet the costs of negotiation and administration of collective agreements, or the adjustment and settlement of grievances and disputes. We do not understand, in view of the findings of the Georgia courts and the question decided by the Georgia Supreme Court, that there is before us the matter of expenditures for activities in the area between the costs which led directly to the complaint as to 'free riders,\u2019 and the expenditures to support union political activities. We are satisfied, however, that \u00a7 2, Eleventh is to be interpreted to deny the unions the power claimed in this case. The appellant unions, in insisting that \u00a7 2, Eleventh contemplates their use of exacted funds to support political causes objected to by the employee, would have us hold that Congress sanctioned an expansion of historical practices in the political area by the rail unions. This we decline to do. Both by tradition and, from 1934 to 1951, by force of law, the rail unions did not rely upon the compulsion of union security agreements to exact money to support the political activities in which they engage. Our construction therefore involves no curtailment of the traditional political activities of the railroad unions. It means only that those unions must not support those activities, against the expressed wishes of a dissenting employee, with his exacted money.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 367 US 768-770.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The <em>Street </em>opinion emphasized that the objecting employees\u2019 cause of action arose under the Railway Labor Act, and not the First Amendment, because the exactions complained of were not authorized by that statute. 367 US 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The foregoing interpretations of <em>Hanson </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Street </em>clearly indicate that neither case was decided on First Amendment grounds, although the delimiting language of that provision arguably implicitly compelled the results reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In <em>Lathrop v Donohue, </em>367 US 820; 81 S Ct 1826; 6 L Ed 2d 1191 (1961), a companion case to <em>Street, </em>Wisconsin attorney Lathrop brought an action in a state trial court to recover compulsorily exacted dues paid by him to the integrated Wisconsin State Bar, alleging the requirement to pay such dues to be unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the United States Constitution. The treasurer of the Wisconsin State Bar was named as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The defendant demurred to the complaint on three grounds, one of which was that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer on all three grounds, and then entered an order dismissing the complaint without leave to amend, for the reason that no amendment could cure the defects in the merits of the plaintiffs case. See 367 US 868-869 (Black, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">On appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. 10 Wis 2d 230; 102 NW2d 404 (1960). The Court held that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs complaint, but went on to treat the complaint as if it had been originally filed in the reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>We read the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion as determining that the state had a sufficient interest in the achievement of the stated objectives of the integrated bar to justify the minimal compulsion of individuals effected by the requirement of association in, and payment of dues to, the integrated Wisconsin bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The United States Supreme Court, on appeal, divided sharply and entered a plurality judgment affirming the Wisconsin Supreme Court. That affirmance was later explained in <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 US 209, 233, fn 29; 97 S Ct 1782; 52 L Ed 2d 261 (1977), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\"In <em>Lathrop v Donohue, </em>367 US 820, a companion case to <em>Street, </em>a lawyer sued for the refund of dues paid (under protest) to the integrated Wisconsin State Bar. The dues were required as a condition of practicing law in Wisconsin. The plaintiff contended that the requirement violated his constitutionally protected freedom of association because the dues were used by the State Bar to formulate and to support legislative proposals concerning the legal profession to which the plaintiff objected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\"A plurality of four Justices found that the requirement was not on its face unconstitutional, relying on the analogy to <em>Hanson. </em>And the plurality ruled, as had the Court in <em>Hanson, </em>that the constitutional questions tendered were not ripe, for the Court was nowhere 'clearly apprised as to the views of the appellant on any particular legislative issues on which the State Bar has taken a position, or as to the way in which and the degree to which funds compulsorily exacted from its members are used to support the organization\u2019s political activities.\u2019 367 US at 845-846. The other five Members of the Court disagreed with the plurality and thought that the constitutional questions ought to be reached. Three Justices would have upheld the constitutionality of using compulsory dues to finance the State Bar\u2019s legislative activities even where opposed by dissenting members. See <em>id., </em>at 848 (Harlan, J., concurring in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>judgment); <em>id., </em>at 865 (Whittaker, J., concurring in result). The other two Justices would have held such activities to be unconstitutional. See <em>ibid. </em>(Black, J., dissenting); <em>id., </em>at 877 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\"The only proposition about which a majority of the Court in <em>Lathrop </em>agreed was that the constitutional issues should be reached. However, due to the disparate views of those five Justices on the merits and the failure of the other four Members of the Court to discuss the constitutional questions, <em>Lathrop </em>does not provide a clear holding to guide us in adjudicating the constitutional questions here presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">It is clear from the foregoing that the United States Supreme Court did not resolve the merits of the constitutional issues raised by the plaintiffs arguments in <em>Lathrop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Although none of the three decisions discussed above was decided on First Amendment grounds, some analysis of them is necessary in order to fully understand the <em>Abood </em>decision, upon which Mr. Falk places considerable reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>B. Abood</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">In <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, supra, </em>the defendant board entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Detroit Federation of Teachers, the certified exclusive representative of teachers employed by the board. The agreement implemented an agency shop<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> arrangement whereby all board-employed teachers were required to pay a service fee to the union as a condition of their employment, although they were not required to actually join the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Certain objecting teachers filed an action against the board, the union, and others, in circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>alleging that the agency shop contract violated their First Amendment rights, in that the plaintiffs were opposed to collective bargaining in the public sector generally; and that the union was using the agency service fees to support ideological and political causes which were unrelated to collective bargaining activities and which were opposed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The circuit court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> finding the agency shop arrangement inoffensive to the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">During the pendency of the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent appeal from the summary judgment, this Court decided <em>Smigel v Southgate Community School Dist, </em>388 Mich 531; 202 NW2d 305 (1972), which held that the Michigan public employment relations act (PERA), as then written, did not authorize or permit agency shop contracts in the public employment sphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The <em>Abood </em>application for leave to appeal then reached this Court. On the authority of <em>Smigel </em>the circuit court\u2019s summary judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to that court \"for further proceedings consonant herewith\u201d, <em>sub nom Warczak v Detroit Board of Education, </em>389 Mich 755 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The Legislature then amended PERA to expressly authorize agency shop contracts in the public sector. 1973 PA 25; MCL 423.210(1); MSA 17.455(10)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">On remand to the circuit court, the defendants filed a new motion for summary judgment based on the premise that the PERA amendment autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>rizing agency shops should be given retroactive effect (thereby effectively reversing <em>Smigel). </em>The circuit court granted the new summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">On appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court was reversed. <em>Abood v Detroit Board of </em>Education, 60 Mich App 92; 230 NW2d 322 (1975). The Court of Appeals held that the legislative amendment to PERA concerning agency shop agreements was prospective only. This holding would have been dispositive of the <em>Abood </em>case, since <em>Abood </em>involved a pre-PERA amendment agency shop agreement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">However, the Court of Appeals went on to frame the following issue at 60 Mich App 98:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\"Does the agency shop clause violate plaintiffs\u2019 First and Fourteenth Amendment rights securing freedom of speech and freedom of association?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The Court of Appeals then discussed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street </em>and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\"We have before us then, two powerful countervailing public policies. We are asked, on the one hand, to preserve freedom of expression, and, on the other, to promote labor stability. But freedom of expression is a constitutional right so basic to our form of government that it must be jealously guarded. This is particularly true where, as here, employees are compelled by the government to support the collective bargaining activities of an organization which they prefer not to join. Justice Douglas expressed this concern well in his concurring opinion in <em>Street:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">\"'If an association is compelled, the individual should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>not be forced to surrender any matters of conscience, belief, or expression.

To take but one example, there has been considerable debate about the desirability of prohibiting public employee unions from striking, a step that the State of Michigan itself has taken [MCL 423.202], But although Michigan has not adopted the federal model of labor relations in every respect, it has determined that labor stability will be served by a system of exclusive representation and the permissive use of an agency shop in public employment. As already stated, there can be no principled basis for according that decision less weight in the constitutional balance than was given in <em>Hanson </em>to the congressional judgment reflected in the Railway Labor Act. The only remaining constitutional inquiry evoked by the appellants\u2019 argument, therefore, is whether a public, employee has a weightier First Amendment interest than a private employee in not being compelled to contribute to the costs of exclusive union representation. We think he does not.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 431 US 229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Shortly thereafter the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\"The differences between public- and private-sector collective bargaining simply do not translate into differences in First Amendment rights.

No special dimension results from the fact that a union represents public rather than private employees.\u2019 Wellington &amp; Winter, The Unions and the Cities (1971), pp 95-96. We conclude that the Michigan Court of Appeals was correct in viewing this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street </em>as controlling in the present case insofar as the service charges are applied to collective-bargaining, contract administration, and grievance-adjustment purposes.\u201d 431 US 232.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">After the Court determined that the <em>Abood </em>record did not permit avoidance of the First Amendment issues raised, the following analysis and conclusion were stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\"Our decisions establish with unmistakable clarity that the freedom of an individual to associate for the purpose of advancing beliefs and ideas is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>E.g., Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 347, 355-357 [96 S Ct 2673; 49 L Ed 2d 547 (1976)] (plurality opinion); <em>Cousins v Wigoda, </em>419 US 477, 487 [95 S Ct 541; 42 L Ed 2d 595 (1975)]; <em>Kusper v Pontikes, </em>414 US 51, 56-57 [94 S Ct 303; 38 L Ed 2d 260 (1973)]; <em>NAACP v Alabama ex rel Patterson, </em>357 US 449, 460-461 [78 S Ct 1163; 2 L Ed 2d 1488 (1958)]. Equally clear is the proposition that a government may not require an individual to relinquish rights guaranteed him by the First Amendment as a condition of public employment. <em>E.g., Elrod v Burns, supra, </em>at 357-360, and cases cited; <em>Perry v Sindermann, </em>408 US 593 [92 S Ct 2694; 33 L Ed 2d 570 (1972)]; <em>Keyishian v Board of Regents, </em>385 US 589 [87 S Ct 675; 17 L Ed 2d 629 (1967)]. The appellants argue that they fall within the protection of these cases because they have been prohibited, not from actively associating, but rather from refusing to associate. They specifically argue that they may constitutionally prevent the Union\u2019s spending a part of their required service fees to contribute to political candidates and to express political views unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>lated to its duties as exclusive bargaining representative. We have concluded that this argument is a meritorious one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\"One of the principles underlying the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US 1 [96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976)], was that contributing to an organization for the purpose of spreading a political message is protected by the First Amendment. Because '[m]aking a contribution * * * enables like-minded persons to pool their resources in furtherance of common political goals,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 22, the Court reasoned that limitations upon the freedom to contribute 'implicate fundamental First Amendment interests,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 23.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\"The fact that the appellants are compelled to make, rather than prohibited from making, contributions for political purposes works no less an infringement of their constitutional rights. For at the heart of the First Amendment is the notion that an individual should be free to believe as he will, and that in a free society one\u2019s beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience rather than coerced by the State. See <em>Elrod v Burns, supra, </em>at 356-357; <em>Stanley v Georgia, </em>394 US 557, 565 [89 S Ct 1243; 22 L Ed 2d 541 (1969)]; <em>Cantwell v Connecticut, </em>310 US 296, 303-304 [60 S Ct 900; 84 L Ed 1213; 128 ALR 1352 (1940)].

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A9F\">\n<em>A. Controlling Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">While the decision in <em>Abood </em>is of primary significance to the instant case, it does not offer a clear statement of the controlling framework for analysis of First Amendment issues of the kind here presented. We therefore turn to the earlier United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 347; 96 S Ct 2673; 49 L Ed 2d 547 (1976), which does.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In <em>Elrod, </em>non-civil service employees of the Cook County, Illinois, Sheriffs Department challenged the constitutionality of the longstanding patronage system in that county. Under that system, employees were required to become affiliated with or sponsored by the political party in control of the office of Sheriff, or face the likelihood of being discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Justice Brennan\u2019s lead opinion in the plurality decision neatly summarized the controlling First Amendment principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\"Although the practice of patronage dismissals clearly infringes First Amendment interests, our inquiry is not at an end, for the prohibition on encroachment of First Amendment protections is not an absolute. Restraints are permitted for appropriate reasons. <em>Keyishian </em>and <em>Perry, </em>however, not only serve to establish a presumptive prohibition on infringement, but also serve to dispose of one suggested by petitioners\u2019 reference to this Court\u2019s affirmance by an equally di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>vided court in <em>Bailey v Richardson, </em>341 US 918 [71 S Ct 669; 95 L Ed 1352] (1951), <em>aff\u2019g </em>86 US App DC 248; 182 F2d 46 (1950). That is the notion that because there is no right to a government benefit, such as public employment, the benefit may be denied for any reason. <em>Perry, </em>however, emphasized that '[f]or at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a person has no \"right\u201d to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.\u2019 408 US, at 597. <em>Perry </em>and <em>Keyishian </em>properly recognize one such impermissible reason: The denial of a public benefit may not be used by the government for the purpose of creating an incentive enabling it to achieve what it may not command directly. ' \"[T]he theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u201d \u2019 <em>Keyishian v Board of Regents, </em>385 US, at 605-606. 'It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.\u2019 <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398, 404 [83 S Ct 1790; 10 L Ed 2d 965] (1963). ' \"[T]his Court now has rejected the concept that constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental benefit is characterized as a 'right\u2019 or as a 'privilege\u2019.\u201d \u2019 <em>Sugarman v Dougall, </em>413 US 634, 644 [93 S Ct 2842; 37 L Ed 2d 853 (1973)] (quoting <em>Graham v Richardson, </em>403 US 365, 374 [91 S Ct 1848; 29 L Ed 2d 534 (1971)]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\"While the right-privilege distinction furnishes no ground on which to justify patronage, petitioners raise several other justifications requiring consideration. Before examining those justifications, however, it is necessary to have in mind the standards according to which their sufficiency is to be measured. It is firmly established that a significant impairment of First Amendment rights must survive exacting scrutiny. <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US, at 64-65; <em>NAACP v Alabama [ex rel Patterson], 357 </em>US [449, 460-461; 78 S Ct 1163; 2 L Ed 2d 1488 (1958)]. 'This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises, not through direct government ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tion, but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the government\u2019s conduct. * * *\u2019 <em>Buckley v Valeo, supra, </em>at 65. Thus encroachment 'cannot be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest.\u2019 <em>Kusper v Pontikes, </em>414 US, at 58. The interest advanced must be paramount, one of vital importance, and the burden is on the government to show the existence of such an interest. <em>Buckley v Valeo, supra, </em>at 94; <em>Williams v Rhodes, </em>393 US [23, 31-33; 89 S Ct 5; 21 L Ed 2d 24 (1968)]; <em>NAACP v Button, </em>371 US 415, 438, 444 [83 S Ct 328; 9 L Ed 2d 405 (1963)]; <em>Bates v Little Rock, </em>361 US 516, 524 [80 S Ct 412; 4 L Ed 2d 480 (1960)]; <em>NAACP v Alabama [ex rel Patterson], supra, </em>464-466; <em>Thomas v Collins, </em>323 US 516, 530 [65 S Ct 315; 89 L Ed 430 (1945)]. In the instant case, care must be taken not to confuse the interest of partisan organizations with governmental interests. Only the latter will suffice. Moreover, it is not enough that the means chosen in furtherance of the interest be rationally related to that end. <em>Sherbert v Verner, supra, </em>[374 US] at 406. The gain to the subordinating interest provided by the means must outweigh the incurred loss of protected rights, see <em>United Public Workers v Mitchell, </em>330 US [75, 96; 67 S Ct 556; 91 L Ed 754 (1947)], and the government must 'emplo[y] means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment. * * *\u2019 <em>Buckley v Valeo, supra, </em>at 25. '[A] State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty. \"Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.\u201d If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties.\u2019 <em>Kusper v Pontikes, supra, </em>at 59 (citations omitted). See <em>United States v Robel, </em>389 US 258 [88 S Ct 419; 19 L Ed 2d 508 (1967)]; <em>Shelton v Tucker, </em>364 US 479 [81 S Ct 247; 5 L Ed 2d 231 (1960)]. In short, if conditioning the retention of public employment on the employee\u2019s support of the in-party is to survive constitutional challenge, it must further some vital government end by a means that is least restrictive of freedom of belief and association in achieving that end, and the benefit gained must outweigh the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 360-363. See, also, <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 US 259-261 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As the above quoted passage states, First Amendment protections are not absolute. The compelling interests of government may justify restrictions on the First Amendment freedoms of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">It remains to be determined how, if at all, the arguments of the parties before us are to be resolved by application of the above-stated constitutional principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\n<em>B. Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The essence of Mr. Falk\u2019s First Amendment argument is that <em>Abood </em>mandates a ruling in this case that he cannot be compelled to pay dues which are used for non-regulatory activities of the State Bar, particularly lobbying and other political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The State Bar responds that <em>Abood </em>is foremost a labor law case, and is not applicable in the present action. The State Bar is not a labor organization, but is rather a \"public body corporate\u201d that operates as a public or state agency. Further, the State Bar argues that the grant of permission to practice law is a privilege and not a right. The state may burden this privilege with conditions. Finally, the State Bar contends that assuming <em>arguendo </em>the applicability of <em>Abood </em>here, all that case requires is that dues be \"imposed for purposes germane to the organization and existence of the State Bar\u201d, which includes those purposes stated in State Bar Rule 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">As shall be hereinafter developed, we find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s arguments and authorities to be the more convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<em>C. Holding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Certainly <em>Abood </em>and the case before us can be distinguished. However, neutral analysis reveals that the factual differences in the two cases lead to the conclusion that the First Amendment principles announced and applied to the facts in <em>Abood </em>impact with even greater force upon the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In <em>Abood, </em>the United States Supreme Court found certain attributes of an agency shop agreement, permissively authorized by state law, potentially violative of the objecting teachers\u2019 First Amendment rights. While all teachers must be state-certified in Michigan,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> they are not required to join any state-controlled organization. Indeed, the teachers in <em>Abood </em>could have avoided the violation of their First Amendment rights by seeking employment with an unorganized Michigan school district, or with unorganized private or parochial Michigan schools. While the state had authorized school districts and teacher organizations to voluntarily enter agency shop contracts, the state has never required individual teachers to associate with and pay dues to a teacher\u2019s association as a condition of obtaining and maintaining certification as a teacher in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">On the other hand, we are here concerned with the propriety of state-compelled association in, and financial support of, a \"public body corporate\u201d as a condition precedent to the pursuit of one\u2019s liveli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>hood as an attorney in this state, in any active legal capacity. No alternatives, even unpalatable ones, exist for the objecting individual attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Mr. Falk\u2019s petition does not specify which of his First Amendment rights are offended. However, we are satisfied that his pleading raises issues involving his rights to freedom of association<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and freedom of belief.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The State of Michigan\u2019s requirement of association with, and financial support of, the integrated State Bar clearly has a significant impact on these rights. See <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 US 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">First Amendment guarantees are made applicable to the several states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Gitlow v New York, </em>268 US 652, 666; 45 S Ct 625; 69 L Ed 1138 (1925); <em>De Jonge v Oregon, </em>299 US 353, 364-365; 57 S Ct 255; 81 L Ed 278 (1937). It is well established that state action which infringes on First Amendment rights can only be tolerated where such infringement is unavoidably required in order to further a \"compelling\u201d,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \"paramount\u201d,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or \"vital\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> state interest. Unquestionably, the state has very strong, even compelling, interests in the regulation of, and maintenance of high standards in, the legal profession, \"since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been 'officers of the courts\u2019 \u201d. See <em>Ohralik v Ohio State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>436 US 447, 460; 98 S Ct 1912; 56 L Ed 2d 417 (1978) (citation omitted). Nonetheless, and although the permission to practice law may rightly be regarded as a privilege, the state\u2019s intrusion on First Amendment rights of all individuals, including attorneys, must be consciously and scrupulously minimized.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We therefore conclude that, in light of the controlling First Amendment principles as herein-above discussed, the State of Michigan, through the combined actions of this Court, the Legislature, and the State Bar, may compulsorily exact dues, and require association, to support only those duties and functions of the State Bar which serve compelling state interests and which cannot be accomplished by means less intrusive upon the First Amendment rights of objecting individual attorneys. See <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, supra; Elrod v Burns, supra, </em>at 360-363 (Brennan, J., plurality opinion); see also cases cited in fns 24, 25 and 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">IV. Findings, Conclusions, and Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Having considered the pleadings, the briefs, the oral arguments of the parties, the report of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>fact-finder, and other relevant material and authorities, we make the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">1. That the original pleading in this action, entitled \"Petition for Special Relief\u2019, is in the nature of a complaint for a writ of superintending control, and is within this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction pursuant to GCR 1963, 851(6); MCL 600.215, 600.219; MSA 27A.215, 27A.219;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">2. That plaintiff Allan Falk is, and has been, like all active attorneys in this state, required as a matter of law to be a member of the State Bar of Michigan and is, and has been, required to pay dues in support of that organization;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">3. That Mr. Falk has been excused of the obligation to pay any dues to the State Bar of Michigan during the pendency of this action;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">4. That the State Bar of Michigan engages in many activities which the plaintiffs dues have been, and would now be, used to support, and with which the plaintiff must associate by virtue of his compulsory membership in the State Bar;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">5. That Mr. Falk\u2019s Petition for Special Relief and his briefs in support thereof express his objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>tions, on First Amendment grounds and otherwise, to various activities of the State Bar of Michigan, and that such petition states a claim upon which relief can be granted under the First Amendment;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">6. That the controlling United States Supreme Court decisions relevant to Mr. Falk\u2019s claim mandate that the State of Michigan, through its various branches of government and its agencies, cannot require association with, or payment of dues in support of, the State Bar of Michigan for other than those duties and functions of the State Bar which serve compelling state interests and which cannot be achieved by means less intrusive upon the First Amendment rights of objecting attorneys;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">7. That under the controlling United States constitutional principles, once an individual has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted under the First Amendment, the burden is on the state or its agency to show the existence of a compelling interest which cannot be achieved with less intrusion upon the affected individual\u2019s First Amendment rights;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">8. That the regulation of the practice of law, the maintenance of high standards in the legal profession, and the discharge of the profession\u2019s duty to protect and inform the public are, in the context of the present challenge, purposes in which the State of Michigan has a compelling interest which will justify unavoidable intrusions on the First Amendment rights of objecting attorneys;</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">9. That the record in this case establishes that the defendant State Bar of Michigan has shown a compelling state interest in the following functions of the State Bar, and that such functions cannot be accomplished by means less intrusive on the First Amendment rights of an objecting attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">A. All regulatory activities, including attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>disciplinary proceedings as provided in GCR 1963, 950 <em>et seq., </em>to the extent that such activities are funded out of compulsorily exacted State Bar dues; all licensing-related activities such as those provided for in State Bar Rule 15;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">B. All continuing legal education activities presently engaged in by the State Bar which are directed to the maintenance of high professional standards among Michigan attorneys;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">C. The publication of the Michigan Bar Journal insofar as that publication is primarily devoted to informing the members of the State Bar on current matters relating to regulation of the profession and the improvement of professional standards;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">D. The Client Security Fund insofar as it represents a discharge of a duty to protect the public from recreant members of the profession. The cost of this fund is properly distributed among all members of the profession regardless of individual predilections toward or opportunity for wrongdoing. Support of the Client Security Fund is but a logical and necessary extension of our admittedly imperfect regulatory and licensing standards and is a duty necessarily imposed on a profession committed to the public interest;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">E. Those activities designed to educate the general public concerning the use of legal services and the relationship between individuals and the legal system generally. This should not be read to include those outreach programs designed to educate the public concerning specific legislation or promoting specific viewpoints. Permissible activities in this area include the publication and distribution. of such booklets as \"You and the Law\u201d, and the \"Juror\u2019s Manual\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">F. Activities designed to make legal services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>more accessible, including the Lawyer Referral Service and support for those legal aid organizations serving the indigent. These activities represent a part of the service every attorney owes the public and hence compelling support for them cannot be deemed constitutionally obnoxious.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">10. That the political and legislative activities of the bar, which constitute a function wholly separable from its other activities, violate petitioner Falk\u2019s First Amendment rights of association and expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The record clearly discloses the extent of the State Bar\u2019s legislative and lobbying activities. These include but are not limited to: rendering technical advice to the Legislature; testifying before the State Officers Compensation Commission; adopting and publishing official positions on proposed legislation; and retaining a professional lobbyist. To the extent these efforts are funded by mandatory dues, the State Bar impermissibly infringes on the First Amendment freedoms of its individual members.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The ultimate objective of these political and legislative activities is to influence public decision-making. Even if specific legislative-political goals can be justified as advancing the public interest or improving the administration of justice, compelled support and association to further these activities is not constitutionally acceptable. The \"public interest\u201d and the \"advancement of jurisprudence\u201d are not unitary concepts subject to a single interpretation. Disagreements regarding legislative or other policy choices arise not only because they result in differing practical effects on individuals, but more importantly because they reflect differing ideological approaches to the subject matter. Such ideological beliefs, and association to promote or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>oppose such beliefs, lie at \"the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment\u201d. <em>Elrod v Burns, supra, </em>356.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">That petitioner Falk is entitled to express his disagreement within the organizational framework does not wholly diminish the fact that he is being forced to associate for purposes contrary to his beliefs. The focus is not upon freedom of expression within the organization, but rather upon whether the state can justify the forced association in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We do not believe that for First Amendment purposes a distinction can be drawn between legislation aimed at issues loosely termed procedural, such as court reorganization and rules of evidence in product liability actions and the like, and those termed substantive. In either category of legislation, the choice of one approach over another is necessarily premise-based and thus subject to contrary opinion or belief. Compelling a dissenter to finance the encouragement of such First Amendment related legislation and associate with its advancement, whether or not he or she opposes it, cannot be justified in the absence of an overriding state need and then only by means narrowly drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In light of alternative methods available to the Legislature to obtain expert legal advice as to both \"substantive\u201d and \"procedural\u201d legislation, we see no compelling interest to justify the State Bar\u2019s legislative activities supported by compulsory dues. Specifically, the Legislature possesses subpoena power, MCL 4.101; MSA 2.181, and has access to the Legislative Service Bureau, the Attorney General, and House and Senate counsel, as well as committee counsel. Additionally, there are a number of voluntary and self-supporting sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>within the State Bar from whom the Legislature can seek input on legal questions. Further, while they cannot be compelled to do so, individual members may be given the opportunity and may choose to voluntarily support legislative and lobbying activities undertaken by the State Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">11. That similarly the broad category of State Bar activities designed to further the commercial and economic interests of the members cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny. Unlike the union members in <em>Abood, </em>attorneys cannot be categorized as a group with homogeneous economic interests. In fact, the economic interests of different attorneys often are in direct conflict. Such conflicts, and the requirement that members contribute to an association which may, therefore, undercut their self-interests, cannot be brushed aside as something that will be ameliorated by the \"democratic process\u201d within the bar. Further, and more important, furtherance of the commercial interests of attorneys, just as those of doctors or accountants, can hardly be found to constitute a compelling governmental interest. Since the end itself cannot be justified, the means designed to serve that end, such as the Lawyer Placement Service, must fall in the face of a First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">12. That as to all other State Bar of Michigan activities, the present record fails to demonstrate a compelling state interest which cannot be served by means less intrusive on the First Amendment rights of an objecting individual attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">However, apart from those permissible activities discussed in paragraph 9, the State Bar\u2019s legislative and lobbying activities, and those activities solely designed to further the commercial interests of its membership, we acknowledge that determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>nation of the state interest in the remainder of the challenged State Bar activities and whether that interest, if compelling, is served by narrowly drawn means is made difficult, indeed impossible, by a most inadequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Consequently, we would order:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">A. That the State Bar of Michigan be enjoined from disbursing compulsorily exacted dues for any functions or purposes other than those described in paragraphs 9A-9F effective as of October 1, 1981, the end of the State Bar of Michigan\u2019s fiscal year and that, in the interim, the bar poll its members to identify those willing to support such other activities on a voluntary basis and permit solicitation of contributions from those members for these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The bar would be permitted, in the interim, to present further facts to this Court, through a master, only as to those activities for which we have concluded the record is inadequate for the purpose of demonstrating an as yet unrevealed compelling interest unavoidably served by mandatory dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">B. That the State Bar of Michigan determine the proportion of dues paid by each member which does not relate to the above-declared constitutional purposes and functions, and that the amount of dues as of and after October 1, 1981 be reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">C. That plaintiff Allan Falk be advised of the portion of his excused bar dues which relates to the purposes of the State Bar described in paragraphs 9A-9F, and that he pay to the State Bar that amount within 30 days after he is so notified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-9\">Fitzgerald and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b240-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">The principal issue in this case is whether an \"integrated\u201d state bar with mandatory membership of all attorneys in the state can perform specified activities, financed in part by compulsory dues, without violating First Amendment rights of those dues paying member attorneys not in accord with such activities. The complained-of activities specified are the following: (1) lobbying and other political activity, (2) compulsory membership in Young Lawyers Section, (3) promoting prepaid legal services, (4) lawyer referral, (5) lawyer placement, (6) Client Security Fund, (7) public education about legal services, (8) funding of Lawyers Wives of Michigan and Children\u2019s Charter of Michigan activities, (9) giving and paying for social functions, including those where the Supreme Court Justices are guests of honor, (10) appearing before the State Officers Compensation Commission in support of higher Supreme Court and other judicial salaries, and (11) sale of use of State Bar mailing roster.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">After careful consideration of the authority delegated to the Michigan State Bar and the compelling state interest on the one hand, and the possible infringement of petitioner\u2019s First Amendment rights in the 11 specific instances on the other hand, this Court holds that there is no showing of an unconstitutional violation of petitioner\u2019s First Amendment rights with respect to the above items, excepting item 11 where we find an invasion of petitioner\u2019s right to privacy. We note there was no record reference to political activities, such as support of, or opposition to, partisan candidates and partisan issues, which would be offensive to both the State Bar Rules and the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Petitioner is required by state law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by court rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to belong to and pay dues to the Michigan State Bar. It is petitioner\u2019s basic contention, culled from both his broad \"Petition for Special Relief\u2019 and his tripartite pleadings (brief, reply brief and supplemental reply brief), that the use of his compulsory dues monies for the aforementioned State Bar sponsored activities occasions an unconstitutional infringement of his First Amendment rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>because those activities are not in furtherance of the \"regulation\u201d of the bar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner would therefore have us rule<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the only State Bar activities which constitutionally \"regulate\u201d the profession and thus sanction the use of his dues monies therefor, are those which relate to \"regulation and discipline of the profession, continuing legal education, and related licensing functions\u201d, as well as \"associated administrative and other overhead expenses\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">II. General Background</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Petitioner\u2019s complaint is based essentially on the following line of reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">(1) Authority over the integrated state bar derives from 1935 PA 58;</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">(2) Authority over the integrated state bar is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>confined to \"regulation\u201d of the legal profession; \"regulation\u201d is limited to the \"regulation and discipline of the profession, continuing legal education, and related licensing functions\u201d, as well as \"associated administrative and other overhead expenses\u201d, which do not include the 11 specified activities to which petitioner objects;</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">(3) Petitioner\u2019s First Amendment rights are infringed when the integrated state bar pursues activities other than \"regulation\u201d because the petitioner\u2019s dues payments may then help finance activities to which petitioner may be ideologically opposed or from which petitioner derives no direct pecuniary benefit;</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">(4) <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 US 209; 97 S Ct 1782; 52 L Ed 2d 261 (1977), supports petitioner\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">As a consequence, this Court\u2019s inquiry necessarily must consider the following questions among others:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">(1) Is the Supreme Court\u2019s authority over the integrated state bar derived exclusively from 1935 PA 58, or is it also derived from this Court\u2019s inherent power in the administration of justice?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">(2) Is authority over the integrated state bar confined to \"regulation\u201d of the legal profession in the sense petitioner uses regulation or is the Supreme Court\u2019s power broader so as to cover some or all of the 11 specified activities pursued by the State Bar?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">(3) What is the legal interplay between petitioner\u2019s asserted First Amendment rights and the state\u2019s compelling interest in this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">(4) What guidance is there for the present matter, where the state\u2019s compelling interest is in the improvement of the administration of justice and advancement in jurisprudence, from <em>Abood </em>where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the state\u2019s compelling interest was in labor peace through collective bargaining?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">III. Inherent Power of the Supreme Court and State Bar Rule 1</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The keystone of petitioner\u2019s argument is his interpretation of the word \"regulation\u201d found in 1935 PA 58, the act which, in its own words, \"created\u201d the integrated State Bar in Michigan. According to petitioner, it is this \"procreative engendering legislation\u201d from which this Court derives its power to impose dues, and which limits the State Bar to \"regulatory\u201d purposes in expending dues monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In view of petitioner\u2019s assertions concerning both what he perceives to be the definitional perimeters of the word \"regulation\u201d, and this Court\u2019s power respecting the legal profession of this state, we feel it would be advantageous, preliminary to our inquiry into petitioner\u2019s First Amendment claims, to examine the existent schema of legislative and judicial action regarding the integration of Michigan\u2019s Bar. In so doing we hope to shed some light on the proper scope of the State Bar\u2019s authority over the attorneys of this state, as well as set the stage for our consideration of the constitutional issues raised by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The first action toward integration of the Michigan Bar was taken by the Legislature through enactment of 1935 PA 58. This act, by its terms, \"created\u201d an integrated State Bar in Michigan, <em>i.e., </em>a bar organization in which membership and payment of dues is required as a condition of practicing law in the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This act also authorized this Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\"to provide for the <em>organization and regulation </em>of the state bar of Michigan; to provide <em>rules and regulations concerning the conduct and activities of the association and its members; </em>the schedule of membership dues therein, * * * non-payment of which shall be ground for suspension, the ethical standards to be observed in the practice of law, and the discipline, suspension or disbarment of association members.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">That same year this Court promulgated a set of rules for the organization of the State Bar, stating in \u00a7 16 of those rules that it did so \"pursuant to the powers of the court over the bar of the State and the members thereof\u2019, 273 Mich xlv (1935). Section 1 of those rules outlined in broad terms the purposes of the State Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\"The association [State Bar of Michigan] shall, under these rules, aid in the promotion of improvements in the administration of justice and the advancement of the science of jurisprudence, in the improvement of the relations between the profession and the public, and in the promotion of the interests of the legal profession in this State.\u201d 273 Mich xxxv (1935).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>At this point we must recognize that petitioner has expressly disclaimed any assertion that the challenged activities are in violation of the State Bar\u2019s \"internal constitution\u201d (which we take to mean \u00a7 1 of the Rules Concerning the State Bar of Michigan, hereinafter sometimes called State Bar Rule 1 or Rule 1) and, apparently, would not contest the right of the State Bar to engage in these activities on behalf of voluntary contributors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner having chosen, instead, to base his challenge to the objected-to activities on the First Amendment, it becomes unnecessary for us to dissect each of those activities in order to interpret precisely what falls within and what without the bounds of Rule 1. We therefore, for purposes of this case, will assume that the State Bar has authority under the lawfully delegated power of Rule 1 to perform the acts herein complained of. Nevertheless, since none of the complained-of State Bar activities were expressly provided for by either the Legislature in 1935 PA 58, or subsequent amendments to that section, or the judiciary in its rules concerning the State Bar, petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge requires us to determine if these activities are constitutionally legitimate activities of the State Bar under the broad purposes enunciated in Rule 1. Of course, before we can undertake our First Amendment scrutiny, we must determine whether State Bar Rule 1 and the interests it advances are valid. It is to this consideration that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In order to determine the validity of State Bar Rule 1, we must, to some extent, consider the respective powers of the Legislature and this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>over attorneys of this state. In so doing, however, it would serve no useful purpose toward the resolution of this issue to become enmeshed in an abstract discussion of the precise measure of respective control that the Legislature and this Court could constitutionally exercise in this regard. It is sufficient for the purposes of our present discussion to recognize that courts have traditionally sought to harmonize their legitimate concerns with those of the Legislature. Thus while on the one hand courts are willing to acknowledge that the Legislature has a legitimate interest in the members of the bar because of its concern on behalf of the public interest and welfare, see <em>e.g., Button v Day, </em>204 Va 547, 554; 132 SE2d 292, 297 (1963); <em>Detroit Bar Ass\u2019n v Union Guardian Trust Co, </em>282 Mich 707, 712; 281 NW 432 (1938), quoting from <em>In re Cannon, </em>206 Wis 374, 397; 240 NW 441 (1932), the courts have been emphatic in recognizing their own peculiar and special interest in the conduct of attorneys since, as officers of the court by virtue of the practice of their profession (see GCR 1963, 908; MCL 600.901; MSA 27A.901), attorneys are \" 'indispensable to the administration of justice and [are] intimate and peculiar in [their] relation to, and vital to the well-being of, the court\u2019 \u201d. <em>Sams v Olah, </em>225 Ga 497, 504; 169 SE2d 790, 798 (1969). See also <em>Button, supra, </em>553-554; <em>In re Petition for Integration of the Bar of Minnesota, </em>216 Minn 195, 199; 12 NW2d 515, 518 (1943). Thus courts have recognized in themselves an inherent power to regulate the practice of law and to supervise those engaged therein to the extent necessary for their proper functioning and generally find legislative regulation unconstitutional only when it tends to interfere with or impair the proper administration of judicial functions. <em>Guardian Trust Co, supra, </em>713; <em>Olah, supra, </em>501-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Thus in passing on the present conjunction of legislative and judicial action relating to the integration of the State Bar in Michigan, this Court has tempered its willingness to accord legislative enactments the proper degree of deference due a co-equal branch of government with a persistent insistence on its own inherent powers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Ayres v </em>Hadaway, 303 Mich 589, 597-598; 6 NW2d 905 (1942), this Court stressed its own inherent power over attorneys of this state, while at the same time upholding the constitutionality of 1935 PA 58 against the contention that it violated due process since the court rules concerning the State Bar provided that inactive members of the bar were prohibited from practicing law. After citing several foreign jurisdictions on the subject of the inherent power of a court to regulate attorneys, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">\"In our opinion there is inherent power in the Supreme Court to regulate the qualifications of persons who may be permitted to practice law in this state. That the legislature has seen fit to adopt legislation [1935 PA 58] to this end does not make the act unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">This Court reiterated, in more detail, essentially the same position almost two decades later when it held the State Bar\u2019s property in Lansing to be tax exempt public property in <em>State Bar of Michigan v Lansing, </em>361 Mich 185, 194; 105 NW2d 131 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\"The provisions of this act [1935 PA 58] are such as to clearly indicate that it was the intent of the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ture to provide for the organization of an agency that should function pursuant to rules and regulations prescribed by the Supreme Court for the purpose of performing, and assisting in the performance of <em>functions that, in the final analysis, pertain to the judiciary. </em>Clearly if such was not the intention there would have been no attempt to invest this Court with the powers of organization and regulations obviously contemplated by the language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\"These are matters [matters pertaining to the discipline, suspension, or disbarment of members of the profession and the fixing of ethical standards to be observed in the practice of law] that relate to the public welfare and protection. <em>Likewise, they are matters within the scope of the inherent power of the judiciary. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Because there has been legislative action on the subject, there is no necessity for this Court to now assert inherent power to integrate the Bar independent of or contrary to legislative action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Button v Day, supra, </em>554.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">As to whether State Bar Rule 1 \u2014 with its broad injunction to \"aid in promoting improvements in the administration of justice\u201d etc. (as opposed to petitioner\u2019s narrowly construed \"regulation\u201d) \u2014 is valid or not, we rule in the affirmative for two reasons. First, we believe that State Bar Rule 1 is consistent with the legislative purpose, expressed in 1935 PA 58, that this Court provide for the \"regulation\u201d of the State Bar and adopt \"rules and regulations concerning the conduct and activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>of the association and its members\u201d. This Court stated as much in <em>Lansing, supra, </em>194:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">\"The rules and regulations that have been adopted are consistent with the legislative purposes, as disclosed by the act [1935 PA 58].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Indeed, we know of no rule of statutory construction which would counsel this Court to interpret \"regulation\u201d in the narrow and confining sense petitioner advocates (remembering that we are not at this point addressing any constitutional implications of State Bar Rule 1). To provide the flexibility necessary to help this Court insure that the State Bar can achieve such worthy results as, to quote one state supreme court, \" 'restoring] public confidence in the bar, enlarging] professional consciousness, energizing] the bar\u2019s responsibility to the public, * * * improving] the administration of justice and [being] the only means presented whereby every member of the bar can share in its public and professional responsibility\u2019 \u201d, <em>In re Unification of the New Hampshire Bar, </em>109 NH 260, 267; 248 A2d 709, 714 (1968), quoting from <em>Petition of Florida State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>40 So 2d 902, 909 (Fla, 1949), we believe the Legislature intended \"regulation\u201d to be defined expansively. <em>Cf. </em>the broad reading given the word \"regulate\u201d found in the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, US Const, art I, \u00a7 8, cl 3. See <em>Virginia R Co v System Federation No 40, </em>84 F2d 641, 650-651 (CA 4, 1936); <em>Chicago, M, SP &amp; P R Co v Public Service Comm, </em>332 Mich 291, 296; 50 NW2d 884 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Second, and independent of the above construction of the word \"regulation\u201d, we do not doubt that this Court possessed the inherent power to include in its rules and regulations for the integra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tion of the Bar the provisions of State Bar Rule 1. In fact, the provisions of State Bar Rule 1 represent a garden variety statement of the legitimate purposes of an integrated bar which other state supreme courts have either considered when making the decision to judicially integrate a bar, see <em>In re Unification of the New Hampshire Bar, supra, </em>263-264, or which the courts themselves have adopted through the exercise of their inherent powers. See <em>Button, supra, </em>555; <em>Application of the President of the Montana Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>163 Mont 523, 526-527; 518 P2d 32, 34 (1974); <em>Lathrop v Donohue, </em>367 US 820, 828-829; 81 S Ct 1826; 6 L Ed 2d 1191 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">IV. Constitutional Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Having examined the authority and scope of the State Bar Rules, we now turn to petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenges. Petitioner maintains that his First Amendment rights are being violated by the State Bar\u2019s expenditure of mandatory dues for activities unrelated to the licensing, education and regulation of the legal profession. Although conceding that the state may require attorneys to belong to an integrated bar association, petitioner argues that the State Bar may not constitutionally expend funds on activities which \"may [support] positions inconsistent with mine\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In order to analyze the constitutional validity of petitioner\u2019s claim, we must determine:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">a) whether First Amendment rights are absolute;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">b) what type of state interest justifies intrusion on First Amendment rights;</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">c) what means may the state employ to promote the permissible state interest;</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>d) does Bar Rule 1 embody a permissible state interest; and</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">e) are the 11 complained-of State Bar activities permissible means to promote the permissible state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We find that the First Amendment is not absolute but will give way to certain state activities which are germane to a compelling state interest. The state has a compelling interest in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancing the science of jurisprudence in order to fulfill its function of protecting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. The state may employ activities which are germane to this compelling state interest. We find that insofar as State Bar Rule 1 authorizes the Bar to \"aid in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancements in jurisprudence\u201d it embodies a permissible state interest. After carefully reviewing petitioner\u2019s 11 challenges, we also find that all but the last activity, regarding the use of the State Bar mailing list for commercial solicitations, are germane to the state\u2019s compelling interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>A. Are First Amendment Rights Absolute?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The First Amendment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The Supreme Court has long recognized that \"[fjreedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights which are safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d. <em>De </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Jonge v Oregon, </em>299 US 353, 364; 57 S Ct 255; 81 L Ed 278 (1937). See <em>Near v Minnesota ex rel Olson, </em>283 US 697, 707; 51 S Ct 625; 75 L Ed 1357 (1931); <em>Gitlow v New York, </em>268 US 652, 666; 45 S Ct 625; 69 L Ed 1138 (1925). In contrast to the rights of freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly, the right to freedom of association is not expressly listed in the First Amendment. Nevertheless, \"[i]t is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the 'liberty\u2019 assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d. <em>NAACP v Alabama ex rel Patterson, </em>357 US 449, 460; 78 S Ct 1163; 2 L Ed 2d 1488 (1958). It is thus clear that freedom of speech and of association are both protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">However, the rights to free speech and association are not absolute. In <em>Konigsberg v State Bar of California, </em>366 US 36, 49; 81 S Ct 997; 6 L Ed 2d 105 (1961), the Court \"reject[ed] the view that freedom of speech and association * * * are 'absolutes\u2019 \u201d and held that the denial of petitioner\u2019s application to the California Bar for failure to answer any questions pertaining to his membership in the Communist Party did not violate the First Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court reaffirmed this concept 12 years later in <em>United States Civil Service Comm v National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, </em>413 US 548, 567; 93 S Ct 2880; 37 L Ed 2d 796 (1973). In upholding the prohibition of federal employees from taking an active part in political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>management or in political campaigns in accordance with \u00a7 9 of the Hatch act, 5 USC 7324(a)(2), Justice White acknowledged: \"[n]either the right to associate nor the right to participate in political activities is absolute\u201d. That there are limits to the First Amendment\u2019s protection was recognized in <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US 1; 96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976), where the Court declared that \"[e]ven a ' \"significant interference\u201d with protected rights of political association\u2019 may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus it is clear that the rights of freedom of speech and association, while fundamental to our Constitution and society, are not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>B. What Type of State Interest Justifies First Amendment Intrusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Although the First Amendment is not absolute the state must demonstrate a particular type of interest to justify constitutional intrusions. The question which we must resolve is what type of state interest is necessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\"To characterize the quality of the governmental interest which must appear, the Court has employed a variety of descriptive terms: compelling; substantial; subordinating; paramount; cogent; strong.\u201d <em>United States v O\u2019Brien, </em>391 US 367, 376-377; 88 S Ct 1673; 20 L Ed 2d 672 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">For example, in affirming an order that injunctive relief be given to state government employees threatened with being discharged solely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\"It is firmly established that a significant impairment of First Amendment rights must survive exacting scrutiny. <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US, at 64-65; <em>NAACP v Alabama, </em>357 US 449, 460-461 (1958). * * * Thus encroachment 'cannot be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest.\u2019 <em>Kusper v Pontikes, </em>[414 US 51, 58; 94 S Ct 303; 38 L Ed 2d 260 (1973)]. The interest advanced must be paramount, one of vital importance, and the burden is on the government to show the existence of such an interest.\u201d <em>Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 347, 362; 96 S Ct 2673; 49 L Ed 2d 547 (1976) (plurality).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Similarly when analyzing whether Illinois\u2019 state interest in protecting the effective right to participate in political primaries justified a state court injunction prohibiting a group of party members from acting as convention delegates the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\"Even though <em>legitimate, </em>the ' \"subordinating interest of the State must be <em>compelling\u201d * * *\u2019 </em>to justify the injunction\u2019s abridgment of the exercise by petitioners and the National Democratic Party of their constitutionally protected rights of association. <em>NAACP v Alabama, </em>357 US 449, 463 (1958).\u201d <em>Cousins v Wigoda, </em>419 US 477, 489; 95 S Ct 541; 42 L Ed 2d 595 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Thus the First Amendment must yield to state intrusion when there is a compelling state interest present.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\n<em>C. The Means Employed to Promote the Permissible State Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Having found that the state must show a compelling interest to justify First Amendment intrusion we must look to the appropriate <em>means </em>which the state may employ to achieve its compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>interest. Where the intrusive limitation on association <em>directly </em>affects the First Amendment right of expression (here political expression), as where a statute precludes voting in one party\u2019s primary within 23 months after voting in another party\u2019s primary, <em>Kusper v Pontikes, </em>414 US 51, 58-59; 94 S Ct 303; 38 L Ed 2d 260 (1973), or where not belonging to a particular political party results in discharge from a government job, <em>Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 347, 363; 96 S Ct 2673; 49 L Ed 2d 547 (1976) (plurality), the Court has adopted the strict, \"least intrusive means\u201d test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In contrast, where the intrusive limitation on association <em>indirectly </em>affects the First Amendment right of expression, as where employees, though free to express their own views without limitation, are required to belong, and pay dues, to a union which may hold views different from the employees, <em>Abood v Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 US 209, 225-226; 97 S Ct 1782; 52 L Ed 2d 261 (1977), the Supreme Court has applied the less restrictive \"germane\u201d test.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The most recent case in which the Supreme Court has taken a constitutional stand on the right of association is <em>Abood. </em>The Court upheld against First Amendment attack MCL 423.211; MSA 17.455(11) authorizing the use of agency shop clauses in collective bargaining agreements covering government employees, <em>Abood, supra, </em>222, but overturned the use of mandatory dues for political purposes and for advancing ideological causes unrelated to collective bargaining. <em>Abood, supra, </em>235-236. We note that the Court did not use the strict \"least intrusive means\u201d test in analyzing Abood\u2019s associational rights in either instance. Rather, the Court used the \"germane\u201d test and found that the Michigan Legislature had an \"important governmental interest\u201d in avoiding confusion which could arise from conflicting demands of rival teacher\u2019s unions; promoting labor peace; and preventing \"free riders\u201d from obtaining labor contract benefits without supporting bargaining expenses. <em>Abood, supra, </em>224-225. The Court similarly found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>expenditure of <em>mandatory union dues </em>\"for the expression of political views, on behalf of political candidates, or toward the advancement of other ideological causes <em>not germane </em>to its duties as collective bargaining representative\u201d violated the First Amendment right of union members who do not support such views, candidates or ideologies. Thus the Court\u2019s test in <em>Abood </em>was whether the expenditures were \"germane to [the union\u2019s] duties as collective-bargaining representative\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore we believe that the appropriate test to analyze petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenges is whether the state has a compelling interest involved, and if so, whether the Bar\u2019s complained-of activities are germane to that interest.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>D. Does Rule 1 Embody a Compelling State Interest?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The underlying question we must now address is whether \"promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancements in jurisprudence\u201d is a compelling state interest? We find that it is. The United States Supreme Court implicitly recognized the state\u2019s compelling interest in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancements in jurisprudence in <em>Lathrop, supra, </em>843, where Justice Brennan wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\"We think that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in order to further the State\u2019s <em>legitimate interests </em>in raising the quality of professional services, may constitutionally require that the costs of improving the profession in this fashion should be shared by the subjects and beneficiaries of the regulatory program, the law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>yers, even though the organization created to attain the objective also engages in some legislative activity. Given the character of the integrated bar shown on this record, in the light of the limitation of the membership requirement to the compulsory payment of reasonable annual dues, we are unable to find any impingement upon protected rights of association.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In <em>Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, </em>421 US 773, 792-793; 95 S Ct 2004; 44 L Ed 2d 572 (1975), the Court explicitly recognized this legitimate state interest to be compelling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\"We recognize that the States have a <em>compelling interest </em>in the practice of professions within their boundaries, and that as part of their power to protect the public health, safety, and other valid interests they have broad power to establish standards for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions. * * * <em>The interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been \u2019officers of the courts.\u2019 </em>See <em>Sperry v Florida ex rel Florida Bar, </em>373 US 379, 383 [83 S Ct 1322; 10 L Ed 2d 428] (1963); <em>Cohen v Hurley, </em>366 US 117, 123-124 [81 S Ct 954; 6 L Ed 2d 156] (1961); <em>Law Students Research Council v Wadmond, </em>401 US 154, 157 [91 S Ct 720; 27 L Ed 2d 749] (1971).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The fair and efficient use of the state legal system is paramount to the state\u2019s very existence. Without a legal system to make, interpret and enforce laws, without some mechanism to weigh and resolve conflicting claims, there is anarchy.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">As officers of the court, lawyers play an indispensable role in the administration of justice. The state must not only protect its legal machinery from abuse through such safeguards as the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ney grievance procedure but must also be mindful of the competence of attorneys, who are in a position to best assist, or most impede, the general public in securing justice. Authorizing the State Bar to aid the state in promoting improvements in the administration of justice is essential for the state\u2019s continued existence. Therefore we find that the state has a compelling interest in instructing that \"[t]he state bar of Michigan shall, under these rules, aid in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancements in jurisprudence\u201d. We do not separately consider whether the state\u2019s interest \"in improving relations between the legal profession and the public, and in promoting the interests of the legal profession in the State\u201d, State Bar Rule 1, are compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">With this determination in mind we now will examine petitioner\u2019s individual challenges to determine if the Bar activities are germane to the state\u2019s compelling interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\n<em>E. Are the Bar Actions in the 11 Points Germane?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Petitioner attacks the following State Bar activities as violating his constitutional rights: (1) engaging in legislative and judicial lobbying and participating in other political activities (presumably supporting political candidates or state referendums); (2) requiring compulsory membership in the Young Lawyers Section; (3) promoting prepaid legal services; (4) supporting lawyer referral services; (5) aiding in lawyer placement; (6) maintaining a Client Security Fund; (7) promoting legal services and educating the public through pamphlets, magazines, radio and television advertisements of the availability and need of legal services; (8) funding Lawyers Wives of Michigan and Children\u2019s Charter of Michigan; (9) giving and paying for social functions, including receptions where the Supreme Court Justices are guests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>honor; (10) appearing before the State Officers Compensation Commission in support of higher Supreme Court, and other judicial, salaries; and (11) selling the use of the State Bar mailing roster to commercial interests. He bases the majority of his claims on the First Amendment right to freedom of association, with an occasional reference to the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of speech, religion and privacy;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Commerce Clause;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>provisions of the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>(1) Lobbying and Other Political Activity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The major complaint of petitioner is that the State Bar annually expends in violation of his First Amendment rights large sums of money for two related programs: (1) \"for the purpose of influencing the legislation pending before the Michigan Legislature\u201d and (2) \"to fund study projects by its constituent committees which result in recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>dations of policies to be adopted publicly by officials and agencies of the State of Michigan through executive or legislative or administrative action\u201d. Expenditures for the various committees reviewing the Michigan Land Title Standards and Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, for the committee considering this Court\u2019s proposed Rules of Evidence, and to support the Bar\u2019s prison paralegal project are cited by petitioner as examples of improper use of Bar dues monies. There is nothing on the record to indicate Bar participation in partisan politics. But see fn 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Petitioner maintains that the Bar may only disburse its funds for \"regulation\u201d purposes. As aforementioned, part I, <em>supra, </em>petitioner limits \"regulation\u201d to \"bar grievance activities, the expenses of the character and conduct committee, and subsidies paid to the Institute for <em>[sic: </em>of] Continuing Legal Education (ICLE), plus associated administrative and other overhead expenses\u201d. Petitioner argues that any other expenditure of mandatory Bar dues monies violates the First Amendment\u2019s right to freedom of association since membership in the Michigan State Bar Association is a prerequisite to the practice of law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Petitioner supports his position by claiming: <em>\"Abood </em>controls the instant case and mandates a ruling in petitioner\u2019s favor.\u201d His argument is: \"Conceptually, the State Bar of Michigan is a union shop.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] This fact was implicitly recognized in <em>Abood\u201d. </em>He then states: \"The specific holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Abood </em>is that the employees of an agency shop[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] who object to the use of agency shop fees for political activity are entitled to a pro rata reduction in their fee assessment equal to the proportion <em>ideological expenditures </em>bear to the total union budget\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The exact words of the Court in <em>Abood, </em>in pertinent part, follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\"We do not hold that a union cannot constitutionally spend funds for the expression of political views, on behalf of political candidates, or toward <em>the advancement of other ideological causes not germane to its duties as collective-bargaining representative. </em>Rather, the Constitution requires only that such expenditures be financed from charges, dues, or assessments paid by employees who do not object to advancing those ideas and who are not coerced into doing so against their will by the threat of loss of governmental employment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Abood, supra, </em>235-236. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The significant language in the quotation from the Court\u2019s opinion is in italics, because it indicates the difference between what the Court held and what petitioner asserts. The Court proscribed expenditures of dues money for <em>\"the advancement of other ideological causes not germane to its duties as collective-bargaining representative\u201d, </em>whereas petitioner speaks of <em>\"ideological expenditures\u201d </em>without any limitation. The difference, of course, is whether the ideological expenditure was or was not \"germane\u201d to the state\u2019s compelling interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The significance of this distinction is emphasized by a quotation from the <em>Abood </em>Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\"An employee may very well have ideological objections to a wide variety of activities undertaken by the union in its role as exclusive representative. * * * To be required to help finance the union as a collective-bargaining agent might well be thought, therefore, to interfere in some way with an employee\u2019s freedom to associate for the advancement of ideas, or to refrain from doing so, as he sees fit. But * * * such interference as exists is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress.\u201d <em>Abood, supra, </em>222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">It is obvious from our analysis thus far that all ideological expenditures are not necessarily in derogation of compulsory membership First Amendment rights and that the Court\u2019s critical test is whether the ideological expenditure is or is not \"germane\u201d to the state interest. This leaves the ultimate inquiries first, what is the compelling state interest, and second, whether the ideological expenditure is \"germane\u201d to that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We have already considered and developed the state\u2019s interest in the administration of justice and in the advancement of jurisprudence. As a consequence we have a clear concept of what the state\u2019s compelling interest is in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Our next inquiry therefore is whether or not the complained-of action here is \"germane\u201d to the administration of justice and the advancement of jurisprudence. \"Lawyers, as members of an ancient and honorable profession, have a duty to utilize their training and experience in rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>service to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The state has a valid interest in drawing upon this training and experience in order to promote improvements in the administration of justice and to advance jurisprudence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The better attuned the legal machinery is to the public\u2019s needs of health, safety and welfare, the better the state will be able to perform its job of protecting and serving the public. The input and feedback on proposed legislation and court rules is invaluable to the state in fine-tuning its legislative and judicial systems.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The State Bar\u2019s 44 standing committees and 12 special committees ensure that the collective experience of legal ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>perts in many fields will be voiced in the legislative and judicial process to promote improvements in the administration of justice and the advancement of jurisprudence.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In this manner the Legislature and Court can better arrive at a fair, effective and efficient result. Thus the state\u2019s need in receiving input and feedback from the Bar on appropriate proposed legislation and court rules is germane to its compelling interest in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and the advancement of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Without more we hold that the State Bar\u2019s use of money, including some of petitioner\u2019s, to influence legislation and to fund committee study projects looking to that result is \"germane\u201d to the state\u2019s legitimate and compelling interest in the administration of justice and the advancement of jurisprudence with the result that such activity survives First Amendment attack and that there is nothing in <em>Abood </em>to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In passing, however, some comment might be in order on petitioner\u2019s misunderstanding of <em>Abood. Abood, </em>like its predecessors,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> involved a labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>union. The case at bar, like <em>Lathrop v Donohue,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>deals with an integrated bar association.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">While there are superficial similarities between an integrated state bar and a labor union, that is not the question. The question is whether the compelling state interest justifying intrusion on First Amendment rights is the same in both cases. The answer is an emphatic negative. In <em>Abood </em>the compelling state interest is achieving labor peace through collective bargaining. In an integrated bar the compelling state interest is the administration of justice. Obviously what might be germane to collective bargaining could be quite different from what is germane to the administration of justice. A labor union, for example, would at the most have indirect interest in improvement of court rules, whereas an integrated state bar could have intense interest in such rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Further, we note that petitioner in his original brief does not maintain that he holds political or ideological views contrary to those of the State Bar. Petitioner broadens his argument somewhat in his Reply Brief, p 40, when he states: \"Public interest is not a unitary concept * * *; the State Bar officers have their view and plaintiff has his. Plaintiff cannot be required to underwrite the expense of the former in promulgating their views\u201d. However, petitioner failed to specify even one conflicting view but noted instead: \"plaintiff does not seek to prohibit the State Bar from lobbying, [but] merely from spending plaintiff\u2019s money to do so\u201d. Therefore petitioner\u2019s challenges appear to be monetary rather than ideological.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">However, even assuming petitioner has strong ideological objections to certain State Bar positions, he \"is still free to voice his own views on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>any subject in any manner he wishes\u201d. <em>In re Unification of the New Hampshire Bar, </em>109 NH 260, 266; 248 A2d 709, 713 (1968); accord, <em>Lathrop, supra, </em>861 (Harlan, J., concurring in result).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He is not being forced to proclaim any ideological or political view. As Justice Harlan noted in his concurrence in <em>Lathrop, supra, </em>859, \"Surely the Wisconsin Supreme Court is right when it says that petitioner can be expected to realize that 'everyone understands or should understand\u2019 that the views expressed are those 'of the State Bar as an entity separate and distinct from each individual.\u2019 <em>[In re Integration of the Bar, 5 </em>Wis 2d 618, 623; 93 NW2d 601, 603 (1958)].\u201d More importantly, petitioner has many avenues open to him to express his ideas either through the Bar or outside of it. Petitioner may or may not wish to run for election to the Board of Commissioners or the Representative Assembly (see State Bar Rules 5 and 6), but in any event he may attend their meetings, since unless specifically voted to be closed all meetings are open to Bar members. In this way he can have direct input on the two governing bodies of the Bar. Similarly if petitioner has an interest in the Michigan Rules of Evidence, Criminal Code, Land Title Standards or other legislation and rules which the Bar reviews, he may attend the committee meetings and make known his feelings. Petitioner is also free to write letters to the editor of the Michigan Bar Journal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>expressing his views and seeking support. If he chooses not to take part in the channels of communication within the Bar and is dissatisfied with the majority position petitioner may express and promote his views through external means such as the communications media.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In sum we find that the State Bar expenditures of dues revenues to fund committees for the purpose of examining proposed legislation and court rules is germane to the state\u2019s compelling interest in promoting the administration of justice and advancement in the science of jurisprudence. When taking a position on a proposed bill, rule, or order, the State Bar, however, must confine itself to those subjects directly affecting the administration of justice or the advancement of jurisprudence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Since petitioner has failed to show and we cannot find in the record any specific expenditure of Bar funds to critique or lobby for any legislative or judicial action unrelated to the administration of justice we find that petitioner\u2019s rights are not unconstitutionally infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>(2) The Young Lawyers Section and the Right of Association</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Petitioner also challenges the constitutionality of the automatic membership of newly admitted attorneys in the Young Lawyers Section (YLS). He contends that such \"compulsory\u201d membership violates his First Amendment right to freedom of association since he is being forced to join an organization without his consent and since a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of his mandatory Bar dues supports the YLS. The State Bar argues that \"[n]obody is forcing petitioner to participate in the Young Lawyers Section nor to associate with other young lawyers\u201d. The Bar relies on <em>Lathrop, </em>supra, 827-828, where the majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court agreed that the Wisconsin State Bar did not, on its face, violate the right to freedom of association, noting: \" '[H]is compulsory enrollment imposes only the duty to pay dues\u2019 \u201d (367 US 827-828, quoting 10 Wis 2d 237 with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We agree with the State Bar that \"there is a definite professional/justice system interest in the integrating of young and new lawyers into the practice of law, and in dealing with the very special problems of these new professionals. Such a structure benefits not only the new attorney, but safeguards the public interest in the maintenance of the highest standards in the practice of law\u201d. Petitioner argues that newly admitted lawyers know more general, substantive law and are better \"attuned to the most modern currents of thought in the law\u201d than experienced practitioners. It is obvious, however, that most new attorneys necessarily have a substantial gap of practical knowledge and experience. Despite the trend to expose law students to various clinical experiences, law schools still emphasize traditional textbook courses, reasoning that the student will acquire the necessary practical and procedural knowledge after being admitted to the Bar. We take judicial notice that a person is not automatically transformed from a struggling student to a skilled legal practitioner upon completion of the Bar admissions ceremony. The Young Lawyers Section can help the new attorney bridge the gap between law school and the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Helping young attorneys find their way through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the maze of rules, regulations and laws in turn helps the legal system run effectively and provides for a better distribution of legal services to the public. If petitioner feels that he does not require this valuable aid he is free to disassociate himself from the section: automatic membership does not mean that it is compulsory.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Petitioner, therefore, cannot constitutionally complain that the State Bar uses a portion of its general fund to support a section which is composed of young lawyers who voluntarily give their time and energy to sponsor seminars and programs to train the new attorney. Thus we find that ensuring that the legal system runs smoothly and efficiently is germane to the state\u2019s compelling interest of promoting improvements in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>(3) Prepaid Legal Services (4) Lawyer Referral</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8a\">\n<em>(5) Lawyer Placement (6) Client Security</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The use of mandatory dues revenues for sponsoring Lawyer Referral, Prepaid Legal Services, Lawyer Placement and the Client Security Fund is also challenged by petitioner. His primary argument against such expenditures is that they do not constitute a public purpose and have not been authorized in accordance with the provisions of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 30.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Petitioner insists that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\"[t]he use of State Bar dues monies to enhance the income producing opportunities, employability, and to guarantee trustworthiness of practitioners (via Client Security Fund), is thus invalid as not for a public purpose\u201d.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A secondary argument raised by petitioner is the all-inclusive charge that the First Amendment right of association prohibits any use of mandatory Bar dues revenue for non-\"regulation\u201d purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">As to the first argument that the expenditure of Bar funds for the challenged activities is not for a public purpose we note that petitioner\u2019s analysis of the purpose of the Bar program is inadequate. Except perhaps for the Lawyer Placement Service, none of the programs were instituted nor are presently conducted primarily for the benefit of attorneys even though, admittedly, some attorneys may benefit incidentally. Lawyer Referral and Prepaid Legal Services<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> were created in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>make legal services more accessible to \"that segment of the population, which studies have shown runs roughly around 70 percent, who do not consult lawyers for one reason or another, partly out of fear of the unknown and of how much lawyers would charge\u201d (testimony of Michael Franck, Executive Director of the Michigan State Bar). See <em>Bates v State Bar of </em>Arizona, 433 US 350, 370, fn 22; 97 S Ct 2691; 53 L Ed 2d 810 (1977). Similarly the purpose of the Client Security Fund is not to insure attorneys for malpractice but to protect the public by reimbursing victims' of a defalcation either by clients of lawyers or by a lawyer acting in a fiduciary capacity.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Therefore Lawyer Referral, Prepaid Legal Services and the Client Security Fund clearly constitute a permissible public service, rather than a private or local service, within the meaning of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">As to petitioner\u2019s First Amendment argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>relative to these services, since they either provide legal assistance to those who would otherwise be without it or protect those who do employ lawyers, the relationship to the administration of justice is clear and hence germane to a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The Lawyer Placement Service presents a closer issue. For a fee of $5 any attorney, newly admitted or an experienced practitioner, may register with the Placement Service for up to 12 months, or until employment is secured. Employers searching for attorneys with certain qualifications are charged a $10 registration fee. The Placement Service acts as an information clearinghouse, gathering application forms and job descriptions and passing the collected information on to the registrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Petitioner objects to the State Bar subsidizing the postage, printing, staff and building space of the Placement Service. He perceives this service as being a private purpose within the meaning of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 30 since at any one time it only benefits a relatively few attorneys. Petitioner claims that Lawyer Placement is just another unnecessary service of the Bar which he is being unconstitutionally compelled to support in violation of his First Amendment right of freedom of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Lawyer Placement provides a necessary and useful service for the legal profession and the general public. By providing a focal point for the gathering and dispersal of employment information, the Bar program aids attorneys and society in efficiently utilizing legal skills and services. Placing attorneys where legal services are required aids in the administration of justice. As a consequence, Lawyer Placement, which facilitates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>locating attorneys where needed, is germane to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>(7) Informing the Public of their Legal Rights and Responsibilities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>(8) Lawyers Wives and Children\u2019s Charter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Petitioner also objects to the use of Bar funds to promote legal services and to inform the public of the availability and need of legal services. He similarly objects to the use of Bar revenues to fund Lawyers Wives<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and Children\u2019s Charter.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Petitioner claims that the use of mandatory Bar dues monies to promote the above activities violates his First Amendment right of association. For example, petitioner, as an unmarried attorney, has no interest in Lawyers Wives whatsoever. Being an attorney, petitioner would also have no need to be informed of the availability of legal services. Nevertheless we hold that the services performed by Lawyers Wives, Children\u2019s Charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and the Bar public education communications are germane to the state\u2019s interest in improving the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">A legal system, no matter how fair or just, is of little value if no one knows of its existence or how to effectively use it. By providing the public with pamphlets explaining various areas of the law in easily understandable language the State Bar is helping Michigan citizens gain effective access to the legal system. Similarly when Lawyers Wives volunteer their time and effort to distribute brochures to school children, conduct Law Day essay contests and serve probate and juvenile courts they are aiding the state legal system. We therefore find that the expenditure of State Bar dues revenue on public communication, Lawyers Wives and Children\u2019s Charter is germane to the state\u2019s compelling interest in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancements in the science of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>(9) State Bar Social Functions and Judicial Attendance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Petitioner claims the State Bar violates his First Amendment rights of association by expending some of his mandatory dues on offering food and beverages on particular occasions such as the State of the Judiciary Address and Law Day. He also complains that justices and other judges improperly are present at some of these occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">To begin with, there is no original jurisdiction in this Court to consider the alleged judicial improprieties, and petitioner is advised to seek the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The problem of juxtaposing the majesty of the First Amendment with a minor complaint such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>petitioner\u2019s about the offering of food and beverages is that there is a danger of focusing on whether the minor activity rises to the dignity of being a compelling state interest, which, of course, it is not. The pertinent question, however, is whether the minor activity is germane to a more significant activity which fulfills a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Obviously one can easily imagine dining occasions which have no relationship to the administration of justice or the advancement of jurisprudence whatsoever. Expenditure of funds for these would be offensive not only to the First Amendment but Rule 1. On the other hand, there are other dining occasions that support activities germane to the State Bar\u2019s performance of its duties in the improvement of the administration of justice and the advancement of jurisprudence. With that in mind let us focus, for example, on one of petitioner\u2019s objections, dining functions in connection with Law Day.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We can take judicial notice that in connection with Law Day there is an essay contest about law-related subjects for young students. The statewide winners, their parents and teachers are brought to Lansing to a Bar-sponsored luncheon attended by prominent attorneys and judges. The highlight of the occasion, of course, is the presentation of awards to the young winners.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Is the use of mandatory bar dues monies for such an occasion germane to the administration of justice? We have already determined that educational programs acquainting the public with the operation and availability of the justice system is germane to the administration of justice. A luncheon of the kind just described is certainly a legitimate expense in the fulfillment of such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>objective and therefore germane to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We therefore hold that expenditure of mandatory bar dues for the holding of social functions by the State Bar is not per se an invasion of petitioner\u2019s First Amendment rights. Such expenditures may be constitutionally permissible if in support of a social function which is a legitimate part of a Bar activity germane to the administration of justice or the advancement of jurisprudence. For example, those in connection with the State of the Judiciary Address and Law Day, if otherwise proper, do not offend petitioner\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>(10) Support of Judicial Salaries Before SOCC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Petitioner argues that the appearance by State Bar representatives before the State Officers Compensation Commission (SOCC) to support higher judicial salaries, including salaries of members of this Court, is unlawful and improper. Petitioner claims that the expenditure of Bar resources to send a person to the SOCC is unnecessary to the Bar\u2019s \"regulatory\u201d function and therefore violates his First Amendment rights of association and speech. He also argues that permitting the State Bar to lobby for higher wages for judges is improper since it violates Canon 2(A) of the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> as constituting an appearance of impropriety. As to this last objection, we have already indicated that the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>is an inappropriate forum in which to initiate such a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Employment of competent jurists is essential for the effective administration of justice. We take judicial notice that several years ago this country was concerned with the number of eminent federal judges who were resigning due to inadequate salaries. Congress has repeatedly found it necessary to raise the salary of federal judges in order to not only attract, but retain, the top minds of the legal profession who would otherwise engage in private practice. The Michigan Legislature established the SOCC to ensure that top positions in the public sector, such as judges, would be able to compete with the private sector for well qualified and dedicated men and women. By paying competitive salaries the SOCC ensures that the state is not handicapped in drawing and maintaining able jurists. We see nothing improper in the State Bar aiding the state in determining what salaries are necessary to have an effective judiciary, \"for the labourer is worthy of his hire\u201d. Luke 10:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Permitting the State Bar to express its position concerning increases in judicial salaries, whether in favor or opposed, is germane to the state\u2019s compelling interest in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>(11) Use of State Bar\u2019s Mailing List for Commercial Purposes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Finally, petitioner contests the use by the State Bar of its mailing list for commercial purposes. He maintains that he is an unwilling recipient of \"junk mail\u201d resulting from State Bar commercial mailings in violation of his right to privacy. The Bar admits that it mails insurance and travel company solicitations to Bar members but claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that it carefully screens the use of the list and takes various safeguards, such as never allowing the list to leave its possession, to ensure that only commercial offers of interest to the general membership will be mailed. Respondent also insists that \"both the individual attorney and the State Bar receive a benefit from the programs\u201d since the Bar is totally reimbursed for its mailing service while \"individual attorneys receive the benefit of group rates which would otherwise be unavailable\u201d. Finally the Bar maintains that there is no right not to receive mail, claiming that the right to privacy does not apply here in any event: \"[A]ny intrusion is minimal inasmuch as anyone not wishing to receive such mail may certainly discard it without opening it, since the nature of the communication is clearly indicated on the outside of the envelope\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We disagree. <em>Rowan v United States Post Office Dep\u2019t, </em>397 US 728; 90 S Ct 1484; 25 L Ed 2d 736 (1970), which upheld Title III of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967, 39 USC 4009, now recodified as 39 USC 3008,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> against constitutional attack, provides guidance on this issue. Although the challenged statute was enacted in order to give recipients of obscene mail the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>to remove their names from such mailing lists, <em>Rowan, supra, </em>731-734, the Supreme Court took a broader approach. Chief Justice Burger, writing the opinion for the unanimous Court, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\"Without doubt the public postal system is an indispensable adjunct of every civilized society and communication is imperative to a healthy social order. But the right of every person 'to be let alone\u2019 must be placed in the scales with the right of others to communicate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">\"In today\u2019s complex society we are inescapably captive audiences for many purposes, but a sufficient measure of individual autonomy must survive to permit every householder to exercise control over unwanted mail. To make the householder the exclusive and final judge of what will cross his threshold undoubtedly has the effect of impeding the flow of ideas, information, and arguments that, ideally, he should receive and consider. Today\u2019s merchandising methods, the plethora of mass mailings subsidized by low postal rates, and the growth of the sale of large mailing lists as an industry in itself have changed the mailman from a carrier of primarily private communications, as he was in a more leisurely day, and have made him an adjunct of the mass mailer who sends unsolicited and often unwanted mail into every home. It places no strain on the doctrine of judicial notice to observe that whether measured by pieces or pounds, Everyman\u2019s mail today is made up overwhelmingly of material he did not seek from persons he does not know. And all too often it is matter he finds offensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\"[T]he mailer\u2019s right to communicate is circumscribed only by an affirmative act of the addressee giving notice that he wishes no further mailings from that mailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\"To hold less would tend to license a form of trespass and would make hardly more sense than to say that a radio or television viewer may not twist the dial to cut off an offensive or boring communication and thus bar its entering his home. Nothing in the Constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cation, whatever its merit; we see no basis for according the printed word or pictures a different or more preferred status because they are sent by mail. The ancient concept that 'a man\u2019s home is his castle\u2019 into which 'not even the king may enter\u2019 has lost none of its vitality, and none of the recognized exceptions includes any right to communicate offensively with another. See <em>Camara v Municipal Court, </em>387 US 523 [87 S Ct 1727; 18 L Ed 2d 930] (1967).\u201d <em>Rowan, supra, </em>736-737.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Petitioner\u2019s right to privacy, \"to be let alone\u201d, inherently includes the power to have some discretion in what enters his home through the mail. Congress recognized this in passing 39 USC 3008, thereby giving the addressee the authority to stop mailings to his home which he, \"in his sole discretion believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative\u201d. The Supreme Court expanded this power, if only by dicta, to allow the addressee to strike his name from any mailing list. To require the Bar to honor petitioner\u2019s request to remove his name from the commercial mailing list would require the burden and added expense of keeping two mailing lists. Depending on how many attorneys opt for removal of their names the Bar may, or may not, be able to maintain the group rat\u00e9s it now provides for its members. Even though petitioner can easily identify the soliciting mailing by its clearly marked envelopes, thereby lessening the intrusion into his privacy, he has the right to demand that his name be excluded from mass merchandising mailing lists since the state cannot be said to be promoting the administration of justice or advancing the science of jurisprudence through this type of mailing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Petitioner has failed to prove a case for relief in any of the specific categories set forth in his complaint and briefs except for item 11 relating to the sale of the use of the State Bar mailing roster. (But see fn 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Therefore the State Bar shall, on petitioner\u2019s request, remove his name from the roster sold for commercial use. With respect to all other challenges petitioner\u2019s request for relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-7\">Coleman, C.J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b285-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABM\">The issues, facts and history of this proceeding are set forth in Justice Ryan\u2019s and Justice Williams\u2019 opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">We have concluded that while the record is sufficiently developed to resolve some of the issues, it is insufficiently developed to resolve others, and therefore the cause should be remanded for a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The record in this case is sufficiently developed to resolve the challenges to all bar activities save the activities of the Young Lawyers Section and of the Lawyers Wives beyond those directly educating members of the bar and the public about the law and the legal system, the Lawyer Placement Service, the commercial sale of the bar\u2019s mailing list, and activities addressed to influencing legislation. Activities addressed to influencing legislation include not only lobbying activities but also the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>adoption of formal bar positions on proposed legislation and social functions in furtherance of legislative activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In ordinary litigation, a party\u2019s failure to develop an adequate record would, according to the appropriate allocation of the burden of proof, control the disposition of the case. This case is not, however, an ordinary litigation in which a party is limited to the relief to which he has proven himself entitled. Falk\u2019s petition calls for the discretionary exercise of this Court\u2019s extraordinary superintending control. We must consider, therefore, not merely the relative rights of the parties before us but, rather, the proper organization and actions of the bar in light of the rights of all its members and the interests of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">When this Court exercises its power of superintending control, the Court has the responsibility of ensuring that it is fully informed. To allow inadequacies in the record to shape the order affecting the rights of persons other than the parties would be to cede a measure of our discretion to the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that a more complete factual record is needed to determine the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>order as to the bar\u2019s legislative activities, the activities of the Young Lawyers Section and of the Lawyers Wives beyond those directly educating members of the bar about the law and the legal system, the Lawyer Placement Service, and the commercial sale of the bar\u2019s mailing list, and therefore remand for the purpose of developing such record.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The controlling decisions of the United States Supreme Court on the First Amendment issues in this case, <em>Hanson,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Street,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Lathrop,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and particularly <em>Abood,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are fully discussed in Justice Ryan\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Some may read <em>Abood </em>as concluding that any compelled association and support, whether for collective bargaining purposes or otherwise, so intrudes upon the First Amendment rights of individual members as to be permissible only for purposes germane to those activities of the unified organization which serve compelling state interests and which cannot be accomplished by means less intrusive upon the First Amendment rights of objecting members.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Others may read <em>Abood </em>as providing that while the state interest served by required association and financial support must be a compelling interest, any activity germane to that interest, rather than only those least intrusive upon members\u2019 First Amendment rights, is permissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Alternatively, still others may read <em>Abood </em>as applying different standards of judicial scrutiny according to the nature of the activity: dues collected to support collective-bargaining activities may be considered as assessments imposing the cost of obtaining an economic benefit on the beneficiaries, subject to the lower standard of scrutiny outlined in <em>Hanson </em>and Street,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> while mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>dues collected for purposes other than promoting the economic self-interests of members are subject to the higher standard applied in <em>Abood </em>to activities not germane to the collective-bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Application of the. principles announced in <em>Abood </em>to the instant case is further hampered by the indefiniteness, on this record, of the purposes and state interests served by the bar. Section 1 of the State Bar Rules, promulgated by this Court pursuant to the Court\u2019s powers over the bar and its members, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\"The state bar of Michigan shall, under these rules, aid in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and advancements in jurisprudence, in improving relations between the legal profession and the public, and in promoting the interests of the legal profession in this State.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This broad statement of purpose is susceptible to both expansive and restrictive interpretations. On the one hand, the bar represents the collective experience of legal experts in many fields, and its views on legislation as substantive as revisions of the criminal code, changes to the divorce laws, and no-fault insurance may serve compelling state interests. On the other hand, the threatened and actual intrusions upon individual members\u2019 First Amendment' rights occasioned by compelled support of substantive issues to which they are opposed may make it proper or even constitutionally necessary to limit this broad statement of purpose to the promotion of issues which are directly related to the practice of law and administration of justice as defined in their narrowest senses, such as court reform, lawyers\u2019 education, and requirements for the practice of law, or to eliminate entirely bar legislative activities funded by compulsory dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The question is made more complex by the unique relationship between lawyers and the law. Laws are the tools of the lawyer\u2019s trade; to improve those tools generally requires legislative activity. Laws are the substance of the lawyer\u2019s business; changes in the law will often affect the economic interests of the profession. Further, both by training and daily experience, lawyers possess an expertise in the practical functioning of laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>and the justice system which may make their views on legislation of unique value.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Yet it is clear that a line must be drawn. The lawyer\u2019s relation to the law could rationally support the bar\u2019s taking a stand on even the most basic of public policy issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At some point, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>interests of the bar and the state in collective legislative activity by the bar must yield to the constitutional freedoms of the individual lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It is unnecessary at this time to determine the appropriate standard of judicial scrutiny or to definitively articulate the bar\u2019s purpose, since such of Falk\u2019s challenges to bar activities as can be resolved on this record are clearly permissible even under the strictest standard of review and the narrowest construction of the bar\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Few would argue, and Falk himself is not one of them, that maintaining high standards of competence and honesty in the legal profession does not serve a compelling state interest. The bar\u2019s regulatory and licensing activities narrowly drawn to that end can be justified even if they impinge on members\u2019 First Amendment rights. Included among these activities are: continuing legal education, the Michigan Bar Journal to the extent it serves an informational function, advisory opinions on ethical questions, and disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Whatever may be the proper use by the Court of members of the bar to improve the administration of justice, it includes, at the very least, activities primarily to educate the public about the law and legal services, to provide legal services to the indigent, to help the public to select legal counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>through the Lawyer Referral Service, and to provide forums for discussion of problems facing the courts and the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">That the state has a compelling interest in improving the administration of justice through activities such as these needs no explication. Compulsory dues are a necessary means both to provide adequate funds and to equitably share the burden among those subject to the duty. Limiting the compulsory element to a reasonable level of dues is the least intrusive means available. No actual participation by Falk is required beyond the financial obligation. This Court and the majority of the profession may rely on the volunteering of time and energy by members of the bar and other groups; without, at a minimum, the financial support to meet the expenses of these activities, they might end or be severely restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Some of the non-legislative bar activities challenged by Falk fall comfortably within the permissible range of this category of activities. Without attempting to be exhaustive, activities such as the preparation and distribution by the Young Lawyers of the Juror\u2019s Manual, the distribution to junior high school students of the \"You and the Law\u201d booklet by the Lawyers Wives of Michigan, and funding of the Children\u2019s Charter, which provides a forum for discussing problems of juvenile delinquency requiring participation of third parties, are examples of clearly permissible activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Other activities of the bar challenged by Falk, including activities of the Young Lawyers Section and Lawyers Wives other than those described above, the Lawyer Placement Service, the commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>cial sale of the bar\u2019s mailing list, and particularly bar activities addressed to influencing legislation, require development of a fuller and more particularized record before their permissibility can be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On remand, the burden will be on Falk to show specific activities which allegedly infringe upon his First Amendment rights. The burden will be on the State Bar to establish the requisite state interest, the appropriate connection between particular activities and the state interest (or, if a valid criterion for First Amendment purposes, the economic self-interest of the bar\u2019s members), and the unavailability or impracticability of alternative means of realizing the asserted state interest. Particular attention should be given to specific evidence of what the bar is doing; how it came to be doing it; how and under what standards it chooses issues on which to take an official stand and which stand to take; whether any ground rules exist for declining to take an official position, with details of instances when the bar has so declined; whether any procedure exists for encouraging, receiving and presenting dissenting opinions; what alternatives are possible to accommodate the First Amendment rights of dissenting members; what impact alternatives will have on the effectiveness of the bar\u2019s assistance to its members, the public and this Court; and the proposed times and procedures for implementing alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We emphasize that the Court is not now deciding, nor intimating an opinion on, either the appropriate standard of judicial scrutiny or a definition of the state interests served by the bar. These issues have been discussed to indicate the kind of record which should be developed on remand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>to provide focus for briefing and argument after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">After remand, the Court will also consider, and the parties should address, whether a fair analysis of the purposes served by those bar activities presenting close questions of constitutional conflict and of alternatives thereto indicate that a better course would be to exercise the superintending authority of this Court by court rule to limit the activities of the bar to a greater degree than is absolutely compelled by the Constitution, and thereby eliminate the potential for constitutional conflict. Such an approach may not only serve the important goal of avoiding unnecessary decision of constitutional questions, but may also provide a desirable measure of flexibility in an area that will almost certainly change with time. Further, a proper respect for the \"breathing room\u201d necessary for full enjoyment of First Amendment rights suggests that this Court should be reluctant to allow bar activities to press upon the border of constitutional prohibition, absent a clearly demonstrated need therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">An appropriate order will enter.

See GCR 1963, 111.1, 117.2(1). Adequate proofs were not presented to the fact-finder on such a claim. Further, at oral arguments, Mr. Falk acknowledged that he had never requested the State Bar to refrain from so distributing his name and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Since we find that no claim was pled for invasion of privacy, no relief requested, and inadequate proofs offered, we will not reach the issue, and we intimate no opinion as to its merit, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Similarly, Mr. Falk\u2019s brief discusses an asserted violation of his First Amendment rights to religious freedom under the following heading:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u201cThe use of State Bar dues monies to purchase alcoholic beverages, pork and shellfish for consumption at social functions, particularly when not all State Bar members are invited to such functions or offered alternatives of equal value for dues paid, and which are unnecessary to the accomplishment of any goal central to the viability of the State Bar as a regulatory body, violates the rights of petitioner and other State Bar members under the free exercise and establishment of religion clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Mr. Falk characterizes the referenced State Bar social functions as \"bacchanalian revelries\u201d which are unnecessary to the furtherance of the constitutionally permitted objectives of the State Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">Here again, the petition neglects to state any claim, or seek any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>relief, for violation of the plaintiffs First Amendment religious freedoms. For that reason, and also because we are satisfied that our disposition of this case renders moot the freedom of religion issues intimated by Mr. Falk, we do not reach the merits of those asserted First Amendment infringements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-10\"><em> </em>Mr. Falk\u2019s briefs, but not his petition, also request that all members of the State Bar be notified, through the State Bar Journal, of their right to \"opt into\u201d this lawsuit and obtain like relief. The pendency of this action has been reported in the Michigan State Bar Journal. See 57 Mich State Bar J 224-225 (March, 1978). As of the date of the issuance of this opinion, no other member of the State Bar has \"opted into\u201d this suit. See GCR 1963, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Mr. Falk, again in his briefs, and not his pleading, further requests that he be granted an attorney\u2019s charging lien on all of the dues that might be refunded in this action. It appears from the record that Mr. Falk has been excused of his obligation to pay any bar dues during the pendency of this action. This fact, coupled with the absence of any intervening plaintiffs, combine to result in the generation of no pool of bar dues refunds upon which such a lien could be imposed. Instead, our decision today requires Mr. Falk to pay that portion of his excused bar dues which relates to the constitutional purposes of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">It should also be noted that this action was filed by Mr. Falk solely on his own behalf. He has expressed his belief that a Michigan Court of Appeals decision, <em>Ball v Detroit, </em>84 Mich App 383, 398; 269 NW2d 607 (1978), authoritatively precluded the filing of an original class action in this Court in this case. Because of Mr. Falk\u2019s decision to not so proceed, we are not presented with any issue relating to the applicability of the Court of Appeals <em>Ball </em>decision in this action, and we therefore intimate no opinion as to the correctness of the plaintiffs understanding of <em>Ball.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> That act provided, in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\"An act to create the state bar of Michigan; and to authorize the supreme court to provide for the organization, regulation and rules of government thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\n<em>\"The People of the State of Michigan enact:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\"Sec. 1.

MCL 600.4401; MSA 27A.4401. This Court has elected to treat Falk\u2019s petition as a request to exercise the Court\u2019s statutory power to regulate the conduct and activities of the bar.

An employee may very well have ideological objections to a wide variety of activities undertaken by the union in its role as exclusive representative. His moral or religious views about the desirability of abortion may not square with the union\u2019s policy in negotiating a medical benefits plan. One individual might disagree with a union policy of negotiating limits on the right to strike, believing that to be the road to serfdom for the working class, while another might have economic or political objections to unionism itself. An employee might object to the union\u2019s wage policy because it violates guidelines designed to limit inflation, or might object to the union\u2019s seeking a clause in the collective-bargaining agreement proscribing racial discrimination. The examples could be multiplied. To be required to help finance the union as a collective-bargaining agent might well be thought, therefore, to interfere in some way with an employee\u2019s freedom to associate for the advancement of ideas, or to refrain from doing so, as he sees fit. But the judgment clearly made in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street </em>is that such interference as exists is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress.\u201d <em>Abood, supra, </em>p 222.</p>\n<p id=\"ABn\">The Court further observed, as to dues collected for purposes other than collective bargaining:</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\"Our decisions establish with unmistakable clarity that the freedom of an individual to associate for the purpose of advancing beliefs and ideas is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. * * * Equally clear is the proposition that a government may not require an individual to relinquish rights guaranteed him by the First Amendment as a condition of public employment. * * * The appellants argue that they fall within the protection of these cases because they have been prohibited, not from actively associating, but rather from refusing to associate. They specifically argue that they may constitutionally prevent the Union\u2019s spending a part of their required service fees to contribute to political candidates and to express political views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining representative. We have concluded that this argument is a meritorious one.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u201cOne of the principles underlying the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US 1 [96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976)], was that contributing to an organization for the purpose of spreading a political message is protected by the First Amendment. Because '[m]aking a contribution * * * enables like-minded persons to pool their resources in furtherance of common political goals,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 22, the Court reasoned that limitations upon the freedom to contribute 'implicate fundamental First Amendment interests,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"AKG\">\"The fact that the appellants are compelled to make, rather than prohibited from making, contributions for political purposes works no less an infringement of their constitutional rights. For at the heart of the First Amendment is the notion that an individual should be free to believe as he will, and that in a free society one\u2019s beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience rather than coerced by the State. * * * And the freedom of belief is no incidental or secondary aspect of the First Amendment\u2019s protections:</p>\n<p id=\"Ack\">\" 'If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u2019 <em>West Virginia Bd of Ed v Barnette, </em>319 US 624, 642 [63 S Ct 1178; 87 L Ed 1628 (1943)].</p>\n<p id=\"Ada\">\"These principles prohibit a State from compelling any individual to affirm his belief in God, * * * or to associate with a political party * * * as a condition of retaining public employment. They are no less applicable to the case at bar, and they thus prohibit the appellees from requiring any of the appellants to contribute to the support of an ideological cause he may oppose as a condition of holding a job as a public school teacher.\u201d <em>Abood, supra, </em>pp 233-235.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> The Court in <em>Abood </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u201cWe do not hold that a union cannot constitutionally spend funds for the expression of political views, on behalf of political candidates, or toward <em>the advancement of other ideological causes not germane to its duties as collective-bargaining representative. </em>Rather, the Constitution requires only that such expenditures be financed from charges, dues or assessments paid by employees who do not object to advancing those ideas and who are not coerced into doing so against their will by the threat of loss of governmental employment.\u201d <em>Abood, supra, </em>235-236. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Where the intrusive limitation on association <em>directly </em>affects the First Amendment right of expression (here political expression), as where a statute precludes voting in one party\u2019s primary within 23 months after voting in another party\u2019s primary, <em>Kusper v Pontikes, </em>414 US 51, 58-59; 94 S Ct 303; 38 L Ed 2d 260 (1973), or where not belonging to a particular political party results in discharge from a government job, <em>Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 347, 363; 96 S Ct 2673; 49 L Ed 2d 547 (1976) (plurality), the Court has adopted the strict, \"least intrusive means\u201d test. For example, in concluding that the Illinois Election Code violated the First Amendment by prohibiting a person from voting in a primary election of a political party if that person had voted in another party\u2019s primary within the previous 23 months, Justice Stewart described when and how the least intrusive means test applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\"[A] significant encroachment upon associational freedom cannot be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest. * * * For even when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty. * * * If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties.\u201d <em>Kusper, supra, </em>pp 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"Afd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In contrast, where the intrusive limitation on association <em>indirectly </em>affects the First Amendment right of expression, as where employees, though free to express their own views without limitation, are required to pay dues to a union which may hold views different from the employees, <em>Abood, supra, </em>pp 225-226, the Supreme Court may have adopted the less restrictive \"germane\u201d test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\"> While the Court in <em>Abood </em>recognized that compulsory support of collective bargaining activities had an \"impact\u201d on First Amendment \"interests\u201d, and that such support \"might well be thought * * * to interfere in some way with an employee\u2019s freedom to associate\u201d, <em>Abood, supra, </em>p 222, the opinion may be read by some as concluding that strict scrutiny was not appropriate to assess that interference. The Court relied on the analysis in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street, </em>saying \"the judgment clearly made in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street </em>is that such interference as exists is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Both <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street </em>dealt summarily with the First Amendment issues posed by mandatory dues, initiation fees and assessments for collective bargaining activities. Finding that the congressional provision for union shops was a permissible exercise of the power to regulate interstate commerce, the Court in both cases found that requiring \" 'support of the collective-bargaining agency by all who receive the benefits of its work * * * does not violate either the First or the Fifth Amendments\u2019 \u201d, As expressed by Justice Douglas, the author of <em>Hanson, </em>concurring in <em>Street:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">\"We * * * concluded in * * * <em>Hanson </em>* * * that it was permissible for the legislature to require all who gain from collective bargaining to contribute to its cost. That is the narrow and precise holding of the <em>Hanson </em>case * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Collective bargaining is an effort primarily aimed at furthering the economic or commercial interests of a union\u2019s membership. The commercial nature of conduct claimed to be constitutionally protected has sometime led the Court to adopt a lower standard of protection than is accorded non-commercial activities. Similarly, compelled association and support in furtherance of commercial activities, as distinguished from ideological activities, might be considered by the United States Supreme Court to be less intrusive on First Amendment rights. See, <em>e.g., In re Primus, </em>436 US 412, 437-438, and fn 32; 98 S Ct 1893; 56 L Ed 2d 417 (1978), distinguishing <em>Ohralik v Ohio State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>436 US 447; 98 S Ct 1912; 56 L Ed 2d 444 (1978), and the solicitation of clients for expressive as opposed to commercial purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"Amr\">\"Normally the purpose or motive of the speaker is not central to First Amendment protection, but it does bear on the distinction between conduct that is 'an associational aspect of \"expression\u201d \u2019 * ** * and other activity subject to plenary regulation by government. * * * As shown above, appellant\u2019s speech \u2014 as part of associational activity \u2014 was expression intended to advance 'beliefs and ideas.\u2019 In <em>Ohralik </em>* * *, the lawyer was not engaged in associational activity for the advancement of beliefs and ideas; his purpose was the advancement of his own commercial interests. The line, based in part on the motive of the speaker and the character of the expressive activity, will not always be easy to draw * * *, but that is no reason for avoiding the undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">It should be noted, however, that the Court in <em>Abood </em>said that \"[njothing in the First Amendment or our cases discussing its meaning makes the question whether the adjective 'political\u2019 can properly be attached to those beliefs the critical constitutional inquiry\u201d. <em>Abood, supra, </em>p 232.</p>\n<p id=\"Akc\">Assuming that the State Bar may, without contravening First Amendment rights, engage in activity designed to promote the economic interests of its members, it should be noted that any group similar in size and variety of membership to that of the bar may be expected to face difficult questions when allocating resources. Activities enhancing the economic opportunities of litigators may not similarly benefit corporate lawyers, for example. Indeed, activities such as lobbying for defeat of motor vehicle no-fault insurance legislation might work to further the interests of personal injury litigators at the expense of other types of litigators by committing limited judicial resources to motor vehicle tort actions, thereby increasing delays and other disincentives to the bringing of other types of actions. Such conflicts, and the requirement that members contribute to an association which may, therefore, undercut their self-interests, may not be adequately ameliorated by the democratic process within the bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> 340 Mich xxxviii (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> Selections from the record illustrate the bar\u2019s tendency to blur the interests of attorneys <em>qua </em>attorneys with the general public interest. Unless noted, all questions were posed by counsel for the bar; all answers are those of the Executive Director of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">As to the lobbying activity of the bar:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>Mr. Franck, is it not fair to say that given the complexities of society today, given the increasing participation of governmental agencies in the life of our society, that for any group, let alone a formally organized group of lawyers, to function, that there must be constant contact with government at every level by that organization?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes. And then of course it\u2019s particularly true, in my judgment, of the legal profession since its function and contribution to society is to deal with the law and the law, obviously, is the function of the three branches of government. So it is almost by definition that the profession can carry out those functions assigned to it by society only by involving itself in the governmental process which creates the law with which the profession deals.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\"><em>\"Q. </em>Ergo the bar must lobby?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">As to the distinction between bar lobbyists and other lobbyists:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\"><em>\"Q.

That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\"><em>\"Q. [Mr. Falk]: </em>Is what constitutes service to the public judgmental or objective?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\"><em>\"A. </em>Well, I suppose that what you think is service to the public may be different than what I think, but it is the collective judgment of the State Bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">As to the political activities, in general, of the bar:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Why are those activities related to the life of the organized bar?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\"><em>\"A. </em>Because the life of the profession is to work through law, whether that law is specific statute, court rule, municipal regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>and that is where the profession works; that is where its expertise and where its ability to contribute to the public\u2019s understanding and development and welfare lies. So those are the areas in which the profession works and the organization of the profession works in those areas as an organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">As to the types of legislation of interest to the bar:</p>\n<p id=\"Aba\"><em>\"A. </em>[W]e are now increasingly both choosing to involve ourselves with non-lawyer organizations in the consideration of issues involving substantial elements of public policy and by contrast from the other side major representatives of non-lawyer organizations, consumer organizations, union organizations and organizations of that kind are seeking out the State Bar in the consideration of problems of major public concern and seeking development of appropriate solutions to those problems.</p>\n<p id=\"AqN\"><em>\"Q. </em>Are these issues germane to the life of the State Bar?</p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir. They involve facets of the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>In your opinion, Mr. Franck, are they germane to the life of the profession of law in this state?</p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"Avf\"><em>\"Q. </em>Why?</p>\n<p id=\"AV3\"><em>\"A. </em>Because they all affect the contribution of the profession to the evolution and existence of the society in which we live and those unique aspects of societal problems that the law and profession of the law concern themselves with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATi\"><em>\"A. </em>* * * The entire public skepticism about institutions, about laws, about the obligations of government, has, as we all know, increased dramatically. That has had tremendous ramifications in terms of proposed legislation, areas that are now fair game for legislative intervention so that that has to be considered, for the courts\u2019 rule-making powers have increased tremendously and the bar is almost a unique institution, for example, in terms of legislative process, whereas almost every other organization which has a membership component is interested in a very limited number of bills each session. For example,, namely only those that affect membership. Most legislation does not directly affect lawyers as members of the State Bar of Michigan, but it does affect lawyers and their clients and their lives, and therefore, compared to other organizations we have an interest in almost every bill that is introduced over in the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"APX\"><em>\"Q. </em>Now, is that interest in behalf of the profession or is that interest on behalf of the public, in fulfillment of the profession\u2019s judiciary responsibilities or a combination of both?</p>\n<p id=\"Aub\"><em>\"A. </em>It is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"A95\"><em>\"Q. </em>Characterize it.</p>\n<p id=\"A7u\"><em>\"A. </em>It is really a combination of both. The viewpoint of the lawyers on public questions is very much shaped, obviously, by whom they represent, but in that reflection is the views and the concerns and indeed the experience of their clientele and those persons in the public that they represent. And of course another thing that is unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>about the profession is that there are lawyers on every issue who reflect every shade of opinion, every portion of the public that would be affected by proposed legislation, indeed has an interest or viewpoint on proposed legislation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
