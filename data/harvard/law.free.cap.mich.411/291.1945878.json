Each crime is punishable by any term of imprisonment up to life. The complainant charged that defendants forced her into their automobile, knocked her unconscious, drove some 15 to 18 miles into the country and there raped her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\"Defendant Barker was convicted by a jury of kidnapping and third-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520d; MSA 28.788(4), and was sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of 18 months. Defendant Slay-ton was convicted of kidnapping, but acquitted of any criminal sexual conduct, and was sentenced to five years of probation, six months of which were to be spent in prison.\u201d <em>People v Barker, </em>90 Mich App 151; 282 NW2d 266 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Defendant Slayton appealed as of right. Defendant Barker was granted a delayed appeal. Their appeals were consolidated for review by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the kidnapping convictions of both defendants, holding that the trial court committed reversible error by instructing the jury that they could satisfy the required asportation element of kidnapping by finding the existence of movement that is merely incidental to the offense of criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The Court opined that the rule set forth in <em>People v Adams, </em>389 Mich 222, 236; 205 NW2d 415 (1973),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not limited solely to the prevention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the distortion of lesser offenses into those more serious, but to further prevent one crime from being transformed into two <em>(e.g., </em>kidnapping and rape), and that those decisions holding <em>Adams </em>applicable to coequal offenses represent the better reasoned approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">II. <em>People v Lynn</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\"On June 22, 1977, defendant was found guilty of one count of kidnapping, MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581, and one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b; MSA 28.788(2). On July 7, 1977, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment. Defendant now appeals as of right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">\"At trial, Tammy Trombley, the 10-1/2-year-old complainant, testified that on the night of February 24, 1977, she was home with her 13-year-old brother. At approximately 8:30 p.m., a man, later identified as defendant, came to their apartment and asked to use the phone. After obtaining admittance to the premises he brandished a knife and took some money from the complainant\u2019s brother. The complainant\u2019s preliminary examination testimony, which was read at trial, also established that the defendant had also taken a ring from the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">\"The complainant testified that after the robbery defendant carried her to a nearby apartment. At this time he forced her to engage in fellatio and unsuccessfully attempted to engage in sexual intercourse with her.\u201d <em>People v Lynn, </em>91 Mich App 117; 283 NW2d 664 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction of kidnapping and remanded for a new trial because the trial court erroneously charged the jury that the asportation needed to establish the kidnapping charge could be incidental to the commission of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AtN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We note disagreement among Court of Appeals panels on the issue of whether the asportation element required for kidnapping may be incidental to another offense when the punishment for that offense is equal to that for kidnapping.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In <em>People v Adams, </em>389 Mich 222; 205 NW2d 415 (1973), we upheld the constitutionality of the Michigan kidnapping statute, MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581. The problem we confronted was expressed in Judge Levin\u2019s analysis in <em>People v Otis Adams, </em>34 Mich App 546, 560-561; 192 NW2d 19 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\"It is obvious that virtually any assault, any battery, any rape, or any robbery involves some 'intentional confinement\u2019 of the person of the victim. To read the kidnapping statute literally is to convert a misdemeanor, for example, assault and battery, into a capital offense. A literal reading of the kidnapping statute would permit a prosecutor to aggravate the charges against any assailant, robber, or rapist by charging the literal violation of the kidnapping statute which must inevitably accompany each of those offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\"Just as it is obvious that the Legislature did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>intend the kidnapping statute to expose virtually every other crime against the person to capital sanctions, so too it is obvious that the language of the statute provides no standards for determining who shall be punished for its violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The solution to cure the overbreadth of the statute was to interpolate the requirement of asportation. As to this requirement, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\"[T]he movement element must not be merely incidental to the commission of a lesser underlying crime, <em>i.e., </em>it must be incidental to the commission of the kidnapping.\u201d 389 Mich 222, 236.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Our decision in <em>Adams </em>served to prevent the escalation of charges from a lesser offense to a greater capital offense by requiring the jury to find asportation or its equivalent in order to find the accused guilty of the separate crime of kidnapping. A similar concern exists when the underlying crime is coequal as to its punishment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\"><em>Adams </em>established the rule that movement, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>be sufficient to meet the asportation requirement for kidnapping, must not be \"merely incidental\u201d to an underlying lesser offense, \"it must be incidental to the commission of the kidnapping\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">When it is necessary to find asportation in order to find guilt of kidnapping, it must be shown to be movement having significance independent of any accompanying offense. A course of movement incidental to both a kidnapping and another offense could be of such quality and character as to supply the asportation element of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In <em>Adams </em>we recognized that finding movement sufficient to satisfy the asportation element is a complex determination. To aid the factfinder in making this determination we set forth factors to be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In cases where a defendant has chosen to be tried by a jury, the following declaration expressed in <em>Adams </em>applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\" 'Jurors are the sole judges of the facts and neither the trial court nor this court can interfere with their exercise of that right.\u2019 <em>People v Miller, </em>301 Mich 93, 100 [3 NW2d 23] (1942). And in <em>People v Putnam, </em>323 Mich 374, 379 [35 NW2d 279] (1948), Justice Boyles stated, 'It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>is not the province of the Court to usurp the proper functions of the jury in determining issues of fact. It is not for the Court to say that the jury would have so found, if the issue had been submitted to it.\u2019 \u201d 389 Mich 222, 238-239.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The jury instructions given in these cases allowed the jury to infer the required asportation element for kidnapping from movement which is merely incidental to the underlying crime. Essentially, the instructions directed that if the jury found there was movement <em>either </em>for the purpose of kidnapping of the victim <em>or </em>to commit the crime of criminal sexual conduct, this would be sufficient for the asportation element of kidnapping. This instruction did not inform the jury that asportation for the purpose of kidnapping was essential, and served to usurp from their province the necessity of finding that crucial element.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We hold that it was reversible error for the trial courts in these cases to instruct the jury that the asportation element of kidnapping would be satisfied if the jury found the movement of the victim to be incidental to the commission of the underlying <em>coequal </em>offense of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. In all cases where the charge is kidnapping, except as noted in <em>Adams, </em>in order to find defendant guilty, the factfinder must be satisfied that there was movement sufficient to satisfy the asportation requirement or its equivalent. Where applicable, the asportation element is crucial, regardless of the length of punishment mandated by the Legislature. To hold otherwise would be to assert that the overbreadth problem we confronted in <em>Adams </em>is immaterial in cases where another serious crime is committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Our holding does not preclude the possibility of the concurrent commission of first-degree criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>sexual conduct and kidnapping. A properly instructed jury could find under the facts of a particular case, for example, that movement of the rape victim was sufficient to satisfy the requisite asportation element for a kidnapping conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">We affirm the Court of Appeals in both of these cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b422-5\">Coleman, C.J., and Williams and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Fitzgerald, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-13\"> <em>Coequal </em>is in reference to the length of punishment mandated by the Legislature for the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\"> Movement \"merely incidental to the commission of\u2019 an underlying lesser offense is insufficient to satisfy the asportation element of kidnapping.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\"> In <em>People v Worden, </em>71 Mich App 507, 513-514; 248 NW2d 597 (1976), where the charges were kidnapping and armed robbery, coequal offenses, the Court of Appeals held <em>Adams </em>applicable:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\"While it is true that the <em>Adams </em>Court was concerned with the conversion of a simple crime into a capital offense, the logic of the opinion goes further and is directed to prohibiting any conversion of a single offense into two offenses. Thus it matters not whether the single offense is a minor misdemeanor such as simple assault or a capital felony such as armed robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">To the contrary is <em>People v Hardesty, </em>67 Mich App 376; 241 NW2d 214 (1976), which relied on the Court\u2019s quotation from <em>People v Miles, </em>23 NY2d 527, 540; 245 NE2d 688, 695 (1969), that the <em>Adams </em>rule \" 'was designed to prevent gross distortion of lesser crimes into a much more serious crime by excess of prosecutorial zeal\u2019 389 Mich 232. The panel in <em>Hardesty </em>held that <em>Adams </em>was limited in application to situations where the underlying or other offense constituted a \"lesser crime\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\"> As noted by the Court of Appeals panel in <em>People v Barker, </em>90 Mich App 151, 156-157; 282 NW2d 266 (1979):</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\"We are of the opinion that the thrust of <em>Adams </em>is not limited solely to the prevention of the distortion of lesser offenses into those more serious, but to further prevent one crime from being transformed into two <em>(e.g., </em>kidnapping and rape), and that those decisions holding <em>Adams </em>applicable to coequal offenses represent the better reasoned approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">\"It may be argued that a danger perceived by <em>Adams, </em>that of excessive prosecutorial zeal, is not as prevalent where two capital offenses are involved, inasmuch as the result would be two concurrent sentences of up to life instead of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\"While it is certainly true that multiple sentences in Michigan run concurrently, it is also true that the conversion of a single capital offense into two capital offenses by charging incidental movement of the victim results in not only perhaps an additional concurrent sentence up to life, but also in two chances for conviction instead of only one. It is entirely possible for the jury to acquit on the charge underlying the kidnapping but convict on the latter. For this reason, the danger of 'excessive prosecutorial zeal\u2019 is equally present.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\"> \"2. The movement element is not sufficient if it is 'merely incidental\u2019 to the commission of another underlying lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\"3. If the underlying crime involves murder, extortion or taking a hostage, movement incidental thereto is generally sufficient to establish a valid statutory kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">\"4. If the movement adds either a greater danger or threat thereof, that is a factor in considering whether the movement adquately constitutes the necessary legal asportation, but there could be asportation without this element of additional danger so long as the movement was incidental to a kidnapping and not a lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">\"5. Where appropriate, secret confinement or some other non-movement factor may supply a necessary alternative to asportation to complete statutory kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">\"6. Whether or not a particular movement constitutes statutory asportation or whether there is an appropriate alternative element must be determined from all the circumstances under the standards set out above and is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d 389 Mich 222, 238.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b422-12\"> This holding is limited to pending and future cases where the issue has been preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b422-6\">Levin and Ryan, JJ.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax0\">We concur in the reasoning and the result of Justice Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion except for the footnote 6 provision limiting its application to pending and future cases and would defer decision on that point until a case is presented in which the issue is raised.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b422-7\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AED\"><em>(concurring in the result). </em>I agree that the defendants\u2019 convictions of kidnapping should be set aside and the decision of the Court of Appeals affirmed but disagree with the reason for so doing stated in the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The element of asportation was read into our statute in <em>People v </em>Adams, 389 Mich 222; 205 NW2d 415 (1973), for the stated purpose of saving the statute from a perceived overbreadth. I am now of the opinion that it was not only unnecessary but erroneous to do so, for the statute is not overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Conviction of kidnapping under this statute properly read requires proof of:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">1) Forcibly carrying or sending a person out of the state, or</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">2) Confining such person within the state for the ultimate purpose of:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>a) Extorting money or otfyer valuable thing thereby, or</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">b) Causing such person to be secretly confined or imprisoned within this state against his will, or</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">c) Causing such person to be held to service against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">I am now persuaded that unless the charged kidnapping involves carrying or sending a person across the state line no element of asportation is implicated in our statute. The overbreadth we feared in <em>Adams </em>is avoided by insisting on proof of the intent specified in the statute as the <em>ultimate purpose </em>of the criminal act. So interpreted the statute would not elevate a misdemeanor to a felony as we feared in <em>Adams. </em>See 389 Mich 222, 232-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Our concentration on asportation in <em>Adams </em>now strikes me as misplaced. The holding of the hostages there for the purpose of extorting a hearing on grievances should have determined whether this statute was violated. I now think it was and that we wrongly decided <em>Adams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In the instant cases while the defendants in fact confined the complainants, the ultimate purpose of such confinement was shown to be criminal sexual conduct. Confinement for that purpose is not covered by our kidnapping statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
