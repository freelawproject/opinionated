We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-16\">Edgar Schaedig was driving a truck owned by Zaiger Beverage Company when he collided with defendant Donald Tuttle\u2019s cow, which was running <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>loose on the highway. The truck jackknifed and ran into a ditch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Citizens Insurance Company of America, the insurer of the truck, paid Zaiger Beverage for the cost of repairing extensive damage to the truck and became subrogated to its claims against Tuttle. Citizens Insurance filed this action against Tuttle to recover the amounts paid, on the ground that Tuttle was at fault in failing to keep the cow properly fenced in. This appeal involves only the question of Tuttle\u2019s liability for the damage to the truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The trial court granted Tuttle\u2019s motion for summary judgment, on the ground that any tort liability arising out of the accident had been abolished by the no-fault motor vehicle liability act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, affirmed. We reverse and remand for trial. The tort liability abolished by the no-fault act is only such liability as arises out of the defendant\u2019s ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, not liability which arises out of other conduct, such as the negligent keeping of cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Section 3135, which provides for the abolition of tort liability, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\"(1) A person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\"(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use within this state of a motor vehicle with respect to which the security required by section 3101(3) and (4) was in effect is abolished except as to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\"(a) Intentionally caused harm to persons or property. Even though a person knows that harm to persons or property is substantially certain to be caused by his or her act or omission, the person does not cause or suffer such harm intentionally if he or she acts or refrains from acting for the purpose of averting injury to any person, including himself or herself, or for the purpose of averting damage to tangible property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\"(b) Damages for noneconomic loss as provided and limited in subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\"(c) Damages for allowable expenses, work loss, and survivor\u2019s loss as defined in sections 3107 to 3110 in excess of the daily, monthly, and 3-year limitations contained in those sections. The party liable for damages is entitled to an exemption reducing his or her liability by the amount of taxes that would have been payable on account of income the injured person would have received if he or she had not been injured.\u201d MCL 500.3135; MSA 24.13135.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The Court of Appeals noted that, in contrast to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>subsection (1) of \u00a7 3135, subsection (2) fails to specify whether only tort liability arising out of a <em>defendant\u2019s </em>ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle was abolished or whether the tort liability which was abolished includes liability arising out of an accident involving only a <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle and caused by tortious conduct of a non-motorist defendant. The Court concluded, in light of the act\u2019s purpose to eliminate fault determinations, that \"aside from the enumerated exceptions, tort liability is to be precluded whenever an automobile is involved in any way\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We conclude, however, that the no-fault act was not intended to work a comprehensive abolition of all tort liability incident to a motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Subsection (2) abolishes \"tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use within this state of a motor vehicle\u201d. Injuries to persons or property arising from a motor vehicle collision do not give rise to tort liability unless the injury is caused by a wrongful act of commission or omission. Absent a wrongful act, the collision is simply an accident for the consequences of which no one is liable in tort. Tort liability thus arises, in the normal sense of those words, from some wrongful act of the liable party._</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In the instant case, the wrongful act asserted is Tuttle\u2019s improper keeping of his cow. Such a wrongful act does not relate to the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. Tuttle\u2019s tort liability, if any, arose only from his alleged wrongful keeping of the cow, not from the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Tuttle would, have been subject to tort liability for his wrongful keeping of a cow whether it collided with a motor vehicle, trampled a rose garden, or walked through a plate glass window. His tort liability in the instant case no more \"arose from\u201d the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle than it would have \"arisen from\u201d the ownership, maintenance or use of a rose garden or a plate glass window. It arose solely from the wrongful keeping of a cow.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The no-fault act is a system of compensating injuries and damages incurred in accidents <em>caused by </em>motor vehicles. Compensation is due without regard to fault, and the tort system for adjudicating fault was partially abolished. In the context of the no-fault act, therefore, the abolition of \"tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use * * * of a motor vehicle\u201d carries the implicit sense of tort liability for injuries or damage <em>caused by </em>the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Only persons who own, maintain or use motor vehicles can be subject to tort liability for injuries or damage caused by the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. The non-motorist tortfeasor cannot be subject to tort liability for injuries or damage caused by the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. The abolition of tort liability for injuries or damage caused by (arising from) the ownership, maintenance or use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of a motor vehicle, therefore, does not abolish the tort liability of the non-motorist tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The foregoing construction of subsection (2), based on the language used and the no-fault concept, is in accord with the meaning which the drafters of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act (\"UMVARA\u201d), one of the model acts utilized as source material in the drafting of the no-fault act, intended to convey by the use of identical language in the model act. Section 5(a) of UMVARA provides, with exceptions not at issue here, that \"[t]ort liability with respect to accidents occurring in this state and arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle is abolished\u201d. 14 ULA, Civil Procedural and Remedial Laws, p 63. The comment to \u00a7 5 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\"[T]he only tort actions which are abolished are those which arise from the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. Among the potential tort actions thus retained by an automobile accident victim would be those against an automobile manufacturer for products liability or against a railroad in the case of an automobile-train collision.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 65 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">It is probable that the Legislature, in using the language of the model act, intended the meaning ascribed to that language by the drafters of the model act, particularly where that meaning is the most natural sense of the language used.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Moreover, subsection (2) abolishes tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use only of vehicles for which the required no-fault insurance or other security has been obtained. The policy apparently expressed in so conditioning the abolition of tort liability upon the obtaining of no-fault coverage is that a person is to be relieved of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>tort liability only upon participating, through the payment of premiums, in a system for spreading the costs of compensating vehicular injuries without regard to fault.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To extend the abolition of tort liability to non-motorist tortfeasors would be to incorporate into the no-fault system the costs of providing personal protection insurance benefits to motorists, passengers and pedestrians injured by non-motorist tortfeasors without incorporating offsetting premiums from non-motorist tortfeasors, since non-motorist tortfeasors are not required to purchase no-fault insurance with respect to their conduct as non-motorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Such extension would give a broader effect to \u00a7 3135\u2019s abolition of tort liability than would be given its requirement that no-fault insurance be in effect. To the extent that the abolition of tort liability is broader than the requirement of no-fault coverage, the policy of limiting tort immunity to those who have participated in the spreading of the costs of motor vehicle accident compensation would be defeated. The non-motorist tortfeasor is the equivalent of the uninsured motorist and should be treated similarly. Both are outside the basic no-fault system of allocating the costs of accidents and both remain subject to tort liability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">This construction of the abolition of tort liability intended by subsection (2), in addition to appearing directly from the language and antecedents of the section, also appears indirectly from the unreasonableness of a contrary construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">To construe subsection (2) as abolishing tort liability arising from either a plaintiffs or a defendant\u2019s ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle would create a serious conflict with the policy expressed in subsection (1). Subsection (1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">\"A person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss <em>caused by his or her </em>ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d MCL 500.3135(1); MSA 24.13135(1) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Subsection (1) is an exception to the general abolition of tort liability provided in subsection (2). The apparent intent of subsection (1) is to abolish tort liability for noneconomic loss resulting from below-threshold injuries \u2014 injuries not causing death, serious impairment of a body function, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>permanent serious disfigurement \u2014 and to not affect tort liability for noneconomic loss resulting from above-threshold injuries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">By its terms, however, subsection (1) addresses only the tort liability of the motorist defendant for noneconomic loss \u2014 tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. If subsection (2) is construed, as we have concluded it should be, as abolishing only tort liability arising from the defendant\u2019s ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, then the two subsections work together. Subsection (2) abolishes the tort liability of a motorist generally, and subsection (1) limits that abolition in respect to noneconomic loss to below-threshold noneconomic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">If subsection (2) is given the non-parallel construction of abolishing the tort liability of the non-motorist as well as the motorist defendant, then subsection (2) will have a broader effect than subsection (1). The non-motorist alone will be immune from tort liability for above-threshold noneconomic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Such a construction would be contrary to the apparent intent of subsection (1) to have no effect on tort liability for above-threshold noneconomic loss. It would also require finding that the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ture intended by subsection (1) to distinguish between motorist and non-motorist tortfeasors in relation to their respective tort liability for above-threshold noneconomic loss and that the Legislature intended to retain <em>only the </em>motorist defendant\u2019s tort liability for noneconomic loss. We are unable to find anything in the no-fault act, its policy or the model acts to support such a distinction or intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">To give such a non-parallel construction to subsection (2) would be to find that the Legislature, by the indirect means of an at best ambiguous provision and in apparent conflict with its intent to have no effect upon a plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for severe noneconomic loss, nonetheless intended to abolish the right to recover all noneconomic loss resulting from injuries in motor vehicle accidents caused, for example, by negligent, reckless or even intentional defects in the manufacture of a motor vehicle, or by the negligent, reckless or even intentional failure of a mechanic to properly repair a motor vehicle, or by the \"unlawful selling, giving or furnishing to any [visibly intoxicated person] any intoxicating liquor\u201d. MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Such derogation of both statutory and common-law rights to recover noneconomic loss should not be inferred from the ambiguous language of subsection (2), especially since an at least as reasonable and apparently more reasonable construction would retain the rights, since a model act on which the no-fault act was based- used identical language with the intent of retaining the rights, and since the subsection immediately preceding subsection (2) expresses a policy to retain such rights where the injury is severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Moreover, if the tort liability abolished by subsection (2) were construed to include all tort liabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ity for injuries or damage incurred in accidents involving vehicles with respect to which no-fault coverage is in effect, then the tort liability of an uninsured motorist would be abolished whenever he is involved in an accident with an insured motorist. Such a result would be contrary to the clear intent of the act to retain the tort liability of the uninsured motorist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In order to preserve the policy of retaining the tort liability of the uninsured motorist, it would be necessary to engraft a singular exception on subsection (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We conclude that subsection (2) was intended to abolish only tort liability arising from a defendant\u2019s ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. Tuttle thus remains subject to tort liability arising from his alleged lack of care in the keeping of his cow. We express no opinion regarding the ultimate resolution at trial of the factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Several sections of the no-fault act are intended to reduce the cost of insurance by eliminating duplicative recoveries for losses incurred in motor vehicle, accidents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Section 3116 provides the no-fault insurer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>right of subtraction from or reimbursement for personal protection insurance benefits to the extent an insured\u2019s tort recovery duplicates those benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">\"A subtraction from or reimbursement for personal protection insurance benefits paid or payable under this chapter shall be made only if recovery is realized upon a tort claim arising from an accident occurring outside this state, a tort claim brought within this state against the owner or operator of a motor vehicle with respect to which the security required by section 3101(3) and (4) was not in effect, or a tort claim brought within this state based on intentionally caused harm to persons or property, and shall be made only to the extent that the recovery realized by the claimant is for damages for which the claimant has received or would otherwise be entitled to receive personal protection insurance benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The no-fault insurer\u2019s right to subtraction or reimbursement is limited by \u00a7 3116(2) to recoveries from <em>motorist </em>tortfeasors or for intentional torts. There is no right to subtraction or reimbursement with respect to a tort recovery from a non-motorist defendant which duplicates personal protection insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">It could be argued that the specification of tort recoveries with respect to which subtraction or reimbursement is provided should be read as expressing the legislative view of what tort recoveries were retained under the act, and that the Legislature intended by \u00a7 3116(2) to provide a right of subtraction for or reimbursement from any tort recovery still permitted under the act. It would follow that \u00a7 3135 should be read so that the scope of the tort liability retained is coextensive with an insurer\u2019s right of subtraction or reimbursement under \u00a7 3116(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>At the time \u00a7 3135 was enacted, however, \u00a7 3116 provided the insurer with a right of subtraction for or reimbursement from <em>any </em>tort recovery to the extent it duplicated personal protection insurance benefits, without specification of the types of tort recoveries to which the right applied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, at the time \u00a7 3135 was originally enacted, the reimbursement provision of the no-fault act carried no implication of a limitation upon the tort recoveries retained by \u00a7 3135.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The amendment to \u00a7 3116 specifying the types of tort recovery for which subtraction or reimbursement was permitted should not be read as amending by implication the original meaning of \u00a7 3135 unless a clear intent to do so can be ascertained. The 1978 amendment to \u00a7 3116 was intended to clarify the limitations upon the insurer\u2019s right of subtraction for and reimbursement out of a third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>party tort recovery, and was enacted at a time when litigation involving that issue was pending in this Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no indication of an intent to alter the scope of \u00a7 3135\u2019s abolition of tort liability, and none may be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded for trial.

A recovery by an injured person or his estate for loss suffered by him shall not be subtracted in calculating benefits due a dependent after the death and a recovery by a dependent for loss suffered by the dependent after the death shall not be subtracted in calculating benefits due the injured person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">See <em>Workman v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exchange, supra, </em>p 510:</p>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">\"[W]e construe \u00a7 3116 to mean that an insurance carrier paying personal injury protection benefits is entitled to reimbursement from the tort recovery of a person injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident only if, and to the extent that, the tort recovery includes damages for losses for which personal injury protection benefits were paid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b674-12\"> <em>Workman v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exchange, supra, </em>pp 521-523 (Levin, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b674-8\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8m\">I concur because of part I.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b674-9\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV4\"><em>(concurring). </em>The possibility of duplication of personal protection insurance benefits by a tort recovery from a non-motorist tortfeasor is a further indication of the desirability of a comprehensive legislative review of the no-fault act as we approach its first decade of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">It may also be appropriate to consider whether the enactment of the no-fault act, with its policy of eliminating duplicative recoveries, should alter the common-law collateral source rule normally applicable to tort actions to reduce a plaintiff\u2019s tort recovery to the extent it duplicates personal protection benefits paid or payable under mandatory no-fault insurance coverage.</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-11\">Williams, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
