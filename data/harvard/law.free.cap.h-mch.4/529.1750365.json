The words of reference must not only create an estate in <em>tail </em>to <em>Philip, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>but also to cany <em>over an </em>estate in <em>tail </em>to <em>Thomas. </em>To whom is the limitation over? It cannot be by way of cross remainders, because to three persons. Must the reference Male to the devise, and the limitation to <em>Thomas </em>or <em>William? </em>They differ, are uncertain, therefore cannot refer to either.
