Words are actionable which charge aperson with any offence which would \u00a1subject him to corporal punishment.</p><p id=\"b555-12\">2d. Words are actionable spoken of a person in his trade or profession, which would not be so if .spoken of other persons, from a jealousy the law entertains, founded on public utility, in their favour.</p><p id=\"b555-13\">3d. Words are actionable, which otherwise would not he so, if they have occasioned any special or particular damage to the party.</p><p id=\"b555-14\"><em>Rogue </em>or <em>villain </em>are so indefinite, ambiguous and in-certain, that they are always deemed words of heat, and not subjecting the person to any particular penalty; no action will lie. <em>Cheat </em>is equally so; for like rogue, a man may cheat in a thousand different ways without being subject to any action \u2014 as by charging goods at a greater price than agreed on \u2014 turning tobacco into money, and so again in tobacco \u2014 -not allowing one man the general current prices for his tobacco, which are allowed to others. All these are cheats, and yet not punishable by corporal penalty.</p><p id=\"b555-15\">Judgment entered <em>nisi </em>for the plaintiff, upon the verdict.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
