(28 <em>Car. </em>JJ.J The courts of justice, and statutes, are approaching to that perfection so as to give complete satisfaction oft judgments. If the statute of <em>James </em>does not apply here, oft a person dying in execution, no new execution would lie against his effects. The creditor has a right to the body of the debtor during his life, and if he dies in execution, he has a remedy against his goods. If he escapes before he dies, there is no satisfaction, and the executioa is not complete, therefore it is within the reason of the ease of his death. In the case in <em>Robert </em>the point was not before the court, and the case in <em>Roll. Jib. </em>states thafc <em>Rolle </em>himself was counsel in the case. The case in <em>Modern </em>says the point had lately been settled, which was adjudged ten years after <em>Rolle. </em>There is nothing in the books afterwards on the subject. The statute of <em>JFilliam </em>extends to all gaols ip England. 1 <em>Bac. </em>Jib. 240, shews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that the statute meant to take away the discmeiiou between voluntary and permissive escapes.
