The plaintiff, at the trial, gave in evidence to the jury, a grant dated the 16th of February 1698, to <em>James Todd, </em>for the land called <em>Todd\u2019s Range, </em>of which the land in the declaration mentioned is parcel. He also proved,the location of the same tract, in the manner laid down on the plots thereof returned in this cause. He further produced, and shewed in evidence, a deed from the said <em>James Todd, </em>the patentee, to <em>Charles </em>Carroll, Esquire, for the said tract of land. He further proved in evidence, that the present <em>Charles Carroll, </em>Esquire, son and heir at law of the bargainee, being seised of the said tract of land, and actually possessed thereof, did on the 21st of May 1747, by deed of bargain and sale, duly acknowledged and recorded, bargain, sell and convey, for the consideration in the said deed mentioned, to the plaintiff, <em>Thomas Harrison, </em>and his heirs, part of the said tract of land called <em>Todd\u2019s Range, </em>by the description in the said deed\u00bb He also proved in evidence, the location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of the said parcel of land in the said deed mentioned, agreeably to the plots thereof in this cause, beginning at \u00a3jie Jesters AA and running thence the black lines on the said plots, to the letter M. and from thence with the water to the letters AA aforesaid. He also offered in evidence the following acts , of assembly, to wit: An act, entitled, <em>\u201c </em>An act,\u201d &amp;c. passed at November session 1766, ch. 22; an act, entitled, <em>\u201c </em>An act,\u201d &amp;c. passed at May session 1768,. ch. 22; an act, entitled, \u201c An act,\u201d &amp;c. passed at September session 1770, ch. 7; and also proved in evidence the location made by the commissioners in virtue of the said act, and that the lots were by the said commissioners laid out in the same manner the plaintiff hath located the same on the plots in this cause, beginning at the letter A, &amp;c. He also gave in evidence, that the plaintiff,' at the time of placing and laying the dirt hereafter mentioned, and continually from the time of the deed aforesaid, in the year 1747, was seised in fee of the land in the same deed mentioned. He also proved in evidence, a bond dated the 6th of January 1767, given by himself and sureties; in pursuance of the directions of the act of assembly aforesaid.</p><p id=\"AaCj\">It was proved also in this cause, that the N. W. branch of Patapsco river, in the declaration mentioned, always, unless when the tide was lower than common, and usual low water, overflowed the place described on the plots to begin at the point or prick near the letter W. on the W. side thereof, which said place is circumscribed on the N. by the red plain line running E, from, &amp;c. and that the said land always was, since the memory' of the witnesses, unless at such times as aforesaid, covered with water; and also that the water always flowed at a common low tide above the said red line first mentioned, into Water-street, described on the said plots; and also that the water always overflowed at common low tide the place where it is alleged the defendant has placed the dirt, &amp;c. mentioned in the declaration. Likevviso, that the water of the said branch does now, at a common low tide, flow over the place ciroumscrihed as above, beginning at a point near the letter W. except the said dirt &amp;c. alleged to be placed by the defendant, and does also at. such tide surround the place where it is alleged the dirt, &amp;c. was placed by the .defendant as mentioned in the declaration. The plaintiff also proved in evidence, that at common high tide, loaded scows, drawing 15 inches of water and upwards, might well pass on the water of the said N. W. branch of Patapsco river to the land aforesaid of the plaintiff, opposite to and to the northward of the place described by the said letter W. on the plots; and that the defendant put and placed the stone, earth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>and sand, mentioned in the declaration, and of the length and breadth described in the same declaration, from the same letter \\Y. to the letter X. marked on the plots, whereby that space was made dry land, and the plaintiff is hindered from sailing, or in any manner navigating scows or vessels of any kind, to his lands aforesaid, as he might have done before the laying and placing the earth, stone and sand aforesaid, in manner aforesaid.</p><p id=\"b559-3\"><em>Chase, </em>for the defendant,</p><p id=\"A1Dj\">objected, that the proof is variant from the facts specified in the declaration; the proof being, that earth, sand, &lt;kc. was placed by the defendant in the water, but that the water flowed beyond the place where, &amp;c. And he prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that the evidence aforesaid offered was materially variant from the matters alleged in the declaration in this cause, and did not support the same.</p><p id=\"b559-5\">The plaintiff declares that the defendant put a large quantity of stones and earth in the navigable river con<em>liguous </em>to the southern part of said land and marsh, and of the lots, so that a great part of the said navigable river, <em>contiguous </em>to said land and marsh, and to the lots, is become dry land. The intent of the declaration was to give notice of the charge, that the party may defend himself, and if he is at liberty to vary from it, it would be rather a trap than otherwise. The declaration is, that the defendant lias thrown up earth, &amp;c. <em>contiguous; </em>he must therefore prove it so, otherwise he may as well prove it in any other part of the river; and so set up to be superintendant general of it. The plaintiff has not declared, according to the truth of his case, which is essential for him to <em>do. </em>\u2014 Gilb. <em>L, E. </em>240, 241, cites <em>Styles, 355. </em>Must prove the <em>way. </em>\u2014 Vin. <em>Evid. </em>63, <em>pi. 3. </em>1 <em>Sail:. </em>385, <em>pi, 37. </em>2 <em>Salk. </em>661. A person cannot contradict his declaration, but if it stands general, he may sometimes be admitted to explain it. \u2014 e. g. Suppose the plaintiff here bad declared generally that the defendant threw stones in the river, but did not say in what place <em>particularly, </em>it standing generally, might be reduced to a certainty by-evidence, and if proved contiguous to the plaintiff\u2019s land, it is still correspondent with the declaration, (being in the river,) though more particular, bat it would have been bad on demurrer. The matter in issue is, whether he put stones, &amp;c. <em>contiguous </em>to the plaintiff\u2019s land, and therefore that only must be proved.

He instances cases of water mills and iron works, under writs of <em>ad quod damnum. </em>Baltimore-Town was laid out by this law, <em>ergo, </em>all who purchased did it under notice of these terms. All the acts relative to Baltimore-Town, passed before and since this law, have a saving of rights; but this act lias not.</p><p id=\"APNR\">The counsel for the defendant are in this dilemma \u2014 The act of 1745, <em>ch. </em>9, must have a reasonable construction according to the general intendment of it, or it must have its full operative force. If a reasonable construction is given, all persons will be restricted, except those having lam\u00ed adjoining the water; if not, all persons are allowed to snake improvements. Improvements made before, by tbe owners of land adjacent* were deemed not altogether lawful. This law is therefore to have reference to such cases. If not restricted at all, a person might run a wharf quite across tbe basin, and obstruct the navigation.</p><p id=\"b561-4\">The act of 1753, <em>ch. </em>27, declares it unlawful to injure the navigation of Baltimore-Town,</p><p id=\"b561-5\">The banks of a river, also the sea shore, are public by the law of nations.

Law's being rules of conduct prescribed, it is necessary these rules should be understood; for, to oblige a man to obey a thing beyond his comprehension, is unjust. There is no other way of expressing the meaningoi'tlielegislaturebut by words; but if the law says one tiling, and means another, it is rather a trap than any thing else.

Before the law' can be ascertained, the. court must take cognizance of so much of the fact as is recess ary to form a judgment of the <em>law. </em>\u2014 Ex <em>Jacto jus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>\u25a0oritur; </em>and to tic them up from considering the fact, would be preventing them from determining the law.</p><p id=\"A2A\">If a witness is interested, he shall be rejected; but whether he is or not, is a matter of fact. If a man dedares one thing, and proves another, whether the proof is variant, is a fact. If there is nothing more necessary than to give evidence of <em>something, </em>the court will always be precluded from their determination by this doctrine.</p><p id=\"b565-4\">Suppose the plaintiff bad proved nothing at all, he could not have maintained his suit; and to prove a thing immaterial, and which does not affect the question, is the same. The gist of the action here is special damage; there is none alleged in the declaration sufficient to support the suit on our principles. The declaration is in the form of the indictment. Something further then must be proved, but there is no evidence of other matter \u2014 12 <em>Mod. </em>263, \u00ab %</p><p id=\"Amm\">To support an action for a public nuisance, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove a <em>special </em>and <em>particular </em>damage, actually sustained, <em>prior </em>to the commencement of the suit. No action lies for a public nuisance for a special damage., unless it be proved positive and direct, and confined to the plaintiff alone, and shall be previously and positively sustained before the suit brought, and not a damage sustained in common with other persons, or consequently and argu<em>mentatively </em>\u2014 3 <em>Blk. Com. </em>220. 2 <em>Wils. 58. b. 5 Co. 73. a. </em>9 <em>Co. </em>113. <em>a. Co. Litt. </em>56. <em>a. </em>Year book, 27. <em>II. VIII. p. 9,7, Baldwin\u2019s </em>opinion \u2014 That one man\u2019s being subjected to a greater <em>inconvenience </em>than another, is no.t sufficient to maintain a private action, is supported by <em>Holt\u2019s </em>opinion in 1 <em>L. Hay. </em>486.</p><p id=\"b565-6\">No individual can sustain a damage for a public nuisance, unless it be a special damage which is not common to other persons; it must be direct, and not consequential \u2014 1 <em>Salk. </em>15. 12 <em>Mod. </em>262. Comb. 480. <em>Comyn, </em>58. <em>Garth. </em>451. <em>Holt, </em>10. 1 <em>May. </em>486. 1 <em>Salk. </em>12. <em>T. </em>Jones, 156. 1 <em>May. </em>494. <em>Carth, </em>196.</p><p id=\"b565-9\">The case in 1 <em>Hay. </em>486, is distinguishable from the present case; because in the <em>per quod </em>in <em>Raymond </em>there is a <em>special </em>and <em>particular </em>damage <em>shewn </em>\u2014 In this case it is not so, for the declaration specifies that the <em>value </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s land was greatly <em>diminished, </em>and that he was deprived of the <em>advantage of sailing boats, </em>&amp;c. to and from the said <em>land.</em></p><p id=\"b565-10\">This case may be compared to an action for <em>words not actionable, </em>in which a <em>special </em>damage must be <em>alleged </em>and <em>proved\u2019, </em>therefore in this case there must be proof of a particular damage sustained, antecedent to the bringing the suit.</p><p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>He puts the case of an action by a tiiastfer for beating servant, in which the allegation is general <em>per qno\u00fa seroitinm amisit; </em>hut proof must be made of a loss of service. He admits that the charge, may be general, but it must be specially proved \u2014 Curf/i. 194. <em>Comb. </em>180. 1 <em>Show. </em>243, 255. <em>Holt, </em>6. 3 <em>Mod. </em>389.</p><p id=\"b566-4\">To enable the plaintiff to maintain this action, the damage must be <em>direct </em>and not consequential. Here there has been no proof of positive damage.</p><p id=\"A8Vb\">The general rule is admitted with the exception. The plaintiff had an exclusivo right to lade and unlade boats, &amp;c. therefore he sustained a particular damage. No person was concerned in the diminution of the value of his land but himseif. The position taken, that t\u00edtere must be a direct and positive damage, is denied. The jurynnust say whether a particular damage has resulted from the nuisance; and the direction of the court ought\u2019 not to extend further than to direct the jury that they must find a particular damage in order to give a verdict for the plaintiff.</p><p id=\"b566-6\">The Court directed the jury, that it was necessary the plaintiff, in order to support the issue on his part, in this cause, should prove and give in evidence to the jury, that he, the plaintiff, by the occasion mentioned in the declaration in this cause, had, before the bringing of this suit, sustained particular damage; but the court refused to give any opinion, or direction to the jury, whether the evidence offered .was sufficient to prove such special damage, but declared the weight and force thereof were proper to be left to the jury; and left the same with the jury for their consideration accordingly.</p><p id=\"b566-7\">Judgment was confessed upon terms, a juror having been withdrawn by consent.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
