In answer to this, I allege that the above rule is not an uni &gt; versal one; there are many cases where a suspension <em>is no </em>extinguishment of a personal action, If the cbligco makes the obligor his executor, this is a <em>suspension </em>o? the action, (and an extinguishment of the debt if acscic <em>to </em>pay creditors,\") because the obligor cannot sue himself, and the same person who in to pay is to receive; but it is not an extinguishment if no assets besides to pay debts; bat suppose flic, executrix cf the obligee marries the obligor, this is <em>only a suspension, </em>and upon this death of the executrix the administrator <em>de bonh non </em>may bring suit on the bond.

A difference may be taken between suspensions which are occasioned by act of law, and the act of the party. Is the present case a suspension by act of law or the act of the party? It is a suspension by act of law, and not of the party, with respect to <em>thofeme, </em>because the law will not impute negligence to her, (she being an infant and/esrie covert,) <em>to </em>deprive her of her right; and therefore may well be a suspension without an <em>extinguishment- </em>\u2014 Sail:.. 299. 5 <em>Bw </em>con, -379, <em>tit.

Here a cause of action accrued on the intermarriage of the plaintiff. It does not appear that he was under the disabilities mentioned, at the time the cause of action accrued; and this suit not being brought within 12 years from the time such cause of action accrued, therefore plaintiffs are barred.</p><p id=\"b536-6\">The principle then laid down is, that a husband having an interest in his wife\u2019s property, may defeat that interest, and deprive himself of any advantage from it, And here it is proper again to observe, that we say nothing about its depriving the wife, it being totally foreign to the present question, which is how far the husband\u2019s laches shall bind himself, and not how far they* shall bind his wife after bis death. To establish which, I will shew that the husband\u2019s delinquency shall in many instances bind his wife, but shall always bind him <em>t </em>\u2014 Baron <em>and Feme, 73, pi. </em>1, 2, 3, <em>76.

I answer, this is contradicting the policy of the law in protecting the wife in every other instance, which for her benefit restrains the husband from having all in <em>his </em>power. If this debt is recovered, and husband dies, it goes to his executors. Ami cannot it be a question which is most for her benefit, to have a thing at her husband\u2019s death or not? If this reasoning is just, and the more of the wife\u2019s estate, the, husband gets the greater her advantage., why does not the law' give him all the wife\u2019s property whatever on the iiitermawiage?</p><p id=\"b537-10\">The husbaiul may bring suit alone on a bond debt due Bis wife. <em>Vern. </em>396. <em>Ch.Pr.A15.</em></p><p id=\"b537-11\">This would defeat the act ot limitations altogether; most women nrnrry under age \u2014 Bonds given to them must be by persons of full age; therefore the chance of survivorship is against obligors, and the meninge may continue many years, 20, SO, or 40, and then this dormant claim is to be set up.

G. is dead, having made his will, and therein, after devising the use of his real estate to his wife, and applying the produce of his estate, (beyond, &amp;c.) <em>to \u00bfhe discharge of his just debts, </em>directed, &amp;c. Again G. G. in his will, makes use of the following words, viz. \u201cItem. My will is, that all the rest of my personal estate, <em>after my legal debts are paidP </em>be sold,\u201d &amp;c.</p><p id=\"b539-6\">The questions put are, 1st, Whether the act of limitation may he set up as a bar upon a suit on the bond at law? 2d. Whether supposing a bar at law on the bond, there is any remedy in equity? 3d, How the bequest to M. M. will operate?</p><p id=\"b539-7\">As to the first \u2014 -The answer will depend upon the fact whether Mrs. <em>Belt </em>was of age or not when she intermarried with Mr. <em>Belt; </em>if she was, there will be a bar; if she was not, I conceive there will not be a bar.</p><p id=\"b539-8\">Mrs. <em>Belt, </em>it is said, was born in December 1732, and her present husband, it is said, married her in the year 1752. I presume it will be an'easy matter to ascertain the fact of her age when she married'..</p><p id=\"b539-9\">But taking it that there would be a bar at law.</p><p id=\"b539-10\">2diy. I conceive that there will be a bar in equity with respect to the sureties in the bond, it not being in the power of G. G. by expressions in his will, to make his sureties liable beyond the operation of their own act in executing the bond, and the act of limitation being as obligatory in equity, where there is no circumstance of fraud, &amp;c. as at law; but I conceive, that there maybe full remedy in equity against G. G\u2019s estate. If it were any way necessary, the parts of G. G's will, so far as his estate is concerned, above mentioned, would take this case out of the act of limitation, especially as the demand is on the behalf of a child of G. G. but I apprehend a suit in equity ought to take the matter up on the footing of <em>Forbes\u2019s </em>will claiming the legacy, ante calling for a discovery and account, without paying any regard to the bond.</p><p id=\"b540-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Whether a bond extinquishcs a legacy upon a question between a court of law, and the spiritual court, on the point of jurisdiction, has been a question differently determined; but I do not know that it has been held to be a merger in equity, and am inclined to think the doctrine of extinguishment, which a court of law might favour, to <em>controul </em>the jurisdiction of the spiritual court, would be not so favourably regarded, in equity to <em>oust </em>chancery of its jurisdiction; but be that as it may, the notion of merger does not apply in this case; for where it does, the superior debt is tine, which by the subsequent account passed by G. G. it appears was not the case, and as G. G. unrav.lied the settlement on account of the error, a cause for which it might have been unravelled in equity, and the bond there set aside, I conceive that the bond cannot be set up in equity to answer the purpose of a merger, <em>i. e. </em>it cannot be considered in one view as not obligatory on G. G. in case a demand had been made upon it, and in another view as obligatory upon the obligee to work an extinguishment. Moreover, the bond directed to be given by our testamentary act, is merely f&lt;\u00bbr the security of the minor, and comes up to the reason assigned by <em>Dodaeridge </em>in <em>Gardner's case, </em>2 <em>Ro. Rep. </em>why a bond does not deprive a legatee of his remedy in the spiritual court.</p><p id=\"b540-3\">As to the last question \u2014 1 conceive that the bequest to M. M. ought to be made good for the whole. If the testator had bequeathed specifically'thr corn, &amp;c. in such a house, and there had been none, or less than the quantity there, it might have been otherwise; but 'his was an absolute unspecific bequest. If an ox, or cow named A. is given, and afterwards destroyed, the legacy fails; hut if 1 give an ox, or a cow, and have neither, the executor must buy one out of the assets; or if 1 give ten of either, and have only nine, the deficiency, for the like reason, ought to be made good out of my estate. Even in the first case I have put under this question, some books, seem to consider the legacy as absolute, with a demonstration only how to be paid.</p><p id=\"b540-6\">Another opinion of <em>Daniel Bulany, </em>Esquire, the first and latter parts of which are m slaid:</p><p id=\"b540-7\">\u00abThe case in 3 <em>P. Will, </em>does not appear to me to be material. Without doubt, if the trustee of infant neglects, the art of limitation will hind both at law and in equity; at. law very dearly, because the person having the legal claim is <em>only </em>considered, trust being in no sort the subjectoflegal consideration;fortheverydeffniti(iaoftrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u00a1fo where. fhere is anrh a \u201cconfidence between parties that \u201cno action at law will lie- but is merely a case for the \u201cconsideration of equity,\u201d vide 2 <em>JUlins, </em>612,* and if wanted, many other books to the same purpose.</p><p id=\"b541-3\">Wherefore the <em>eesiuy que </em>trust is not taken notice of at law, and consequently, no doubt, hut the trustee\u2019s neglect will bind him there.</p><p id=\"b541-4\">The above description of a trust shews, that even in, the \u00bb :;sideration of equity, the confidence is <em>merely between the parties; </em>and that another person cannot be affected by it. The case in <em>P. Will, </em>speaks in the same language, \u201cas to the trust, that is <em>only </em>between the ad\u201cminisirator and the infant, and <em>does not effect the </em>com\u00ab <em>*\u2018pany.m&gt;</em></p><p id=\"b541-6\">A trust is not affected by the act of limitation. The matter being understood as above, this rule applies only between the parties, and not to a stranger.</p><p id=\"b541-7\">The res-dt is, that inasmuch as neither at law, nor in equity, is a trust considerable, but between the parties, the act of limitation Id pleadable by every one not a party to the trust; buf by a party it is not, (that is,) so far as the trust is in contemplation.</p><p id=\"b541-8\">The case in <em>Cro. Car. </em>200, 201, though the other reports of the case do not correspond with it, is, certainly, good law. <em>Co. Lift. </em>246, <em>a. b. </em>may also be cited, and Ziff. sect. 403. But, as they seem to me, are wide of the point The entry of the husband <em>is </em>a remedy to vest an estate of freehold in himself, and, if neglected, his own estate is affected thereby. He may lose his entry! and <em>his </em>wife\u2019s, after his death, be preserved! but if, in the present case, the action were not maintainable, the debt would be altogether extinguished,* for a personal action, (as this is,) being once suspended, can never be revived <em>= </em>\u2014 Hob. 10 <em>Tryer \u00a3\u2022 Gildridge. </em>In <em>Cro. Car. </em>the husband alone is affected, the remedy of the wife is preserved. Where there is a legal right it cannot be destitute of a legal remedy. The debt in the present case is a chose in action belonging to the wife, who was an infant till after she married. During her infancy and coverture, n\u00ab* laches are imputable to her. Suppose her to survive her husband, might she not maintain the action? If she might, so can the present action be maintained, because, as is said above, if it be suspended for an hour, it will be totrily extinguished. It cannot be maintained that she night support the action after her husband\u2019s decease, and <em>jn </em>he maintained that the present action cannot be supported; and if it he advanced, that she would not he able t\u00ab maintain it after the death of her husband, the saving in (he act, of infancy and coverture, world he of little or <em>wn </em>f\u00ed.v\u00ed!\u00dc? as will be hereafter shewn.</p><p id=\"b542-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>I liave already observed, that a legal right cannot be destitute of a legal remedy, and the case in Croke, well considered, is rather, in principle, for the action. <em>Ger-min </em>argued, that if one enters after a devise, before the devisee enters, and dies seised, the descent shall not take away the entry; so fine and non-claim shall not bar, where it is not turned into a right. The Court, contra \u2014 \u2022 Though a descent in the case put should not bind, because then no action could be maintained, there never having been a seisin, <em>and so there would he no remedyi </em>In the case, though the husband was barred of his entry, the right of the wife was admitted. Why did not the descent bar? Because if it did, no remedy would be leftj for thesake ofthe right, the remedy is preserved. Though the husband was barred in respect of his interest, yet the wife was not. But suppose the consequence of the husband\u2019s being barred, would have, been the barring of the wife, then the case put by <em>Germin, </em>of devise and descent, would have ruled it.</p><p id=\"b542-3\">Since the case put by <em>Germin, </em>of devise and descent, did not apply to the case of the fine, and non-claim, wherein is the difference between the two cases? The entry was not taken away, because then there would have been no remedy left. In the latter, though the entry of the husband taken away,-the wife\u2019s right preserved. If the former case did not properly apply to the latter, neither would the latter apply to a case similar to the former, as the present, wherein, if the present action be not maintainable, there never can be remedy.</p><p id=\"b542-4\">The case put by <em>Littleton </em>is this \u2014 If there be title of entry in husband and wife, as in right of the wife, the entry of the husband is taken away by descent; but on his death the wife may enter; for that no laches shall turn the wife to any prejudice or loss. Suppose the husband\u2019s loss of entry would have deprived the wife of hers, then the laches of husband would have turned to her prejudice or loss, and the very reason given would have been against it. This case, and the case in <em>Croke,. </em>shew only that the husband may be affected where the wife\u2019s, right is preserved undestroyed by the husband\u2019s laches., But how would it be in the present case? Lord <em>Coke </em>in his explication observes, if <em>a feme sole </em>be disseised, and then marry, and disseisor die seised, the descent shall take away the entry of the wife, because she might have entered whilst <em>sole, </em>and it Was her folly to take a negligent husband; but if an <em>infant,, </em>whilst <em>sole, </em>she would not be barred. In the present case, had <em>the feme </em>been sole, and of age when the cause of action arose, I admit, according to the former case put by Lord <em>Coke, </em>the <em>feme </em>would be affected by the neglect of the husband; but she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>leaving been an infant, I contend she is not bound according to the latter case, and that this action is necessarily maintainable to preserve her remedy, for the reason above mentioned.</p><p id=\"b543-3\">Tike present suit is in <em>jure uxoris </em>\u2014 the judgment would not <em>sua ii </em>transfer the debt to the husband, for the wife surviving would be entitled to it\u00bb</p><p id=\"b543-4\">\"When the law grants or preserves a right, it allows every thing necessary to its preservatiom-Co. 56. <em>a. </em>&lt;53. <em>a.
