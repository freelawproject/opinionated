The last tract appears not to have been in dispute. The defendant took defence on warrant, and plots were returned.</p><p id=\"b515-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s title was a patent of confirmation of <em>Daniel\u2019s Lot Revised, </em>granted to <em>Richard Ruff </em>on the 3d of November 1753; that <em>Richard Ruff </em>had been dead <em>7 </em>or 8 years, leaving <em>Richard Ruff, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, his eldest son and heir at law, who arrived at age in June 1764.</p><p id=\"b515-9\">The defendant\u2019s title was a certificate of survey of <em>Ranger\u2019s Lodge, </em>made on the 15th of June 1681, for <em>David Jones, </em>for 500 acres, and patented to the said <em>Jones </em>on tlie 10th of August 1684, for 5.00 acres.</p><p id=\"b515-11\">Also the return made by a jury on the 9th of September 1706, under a warrant issued on the 6th of September 1706, in pursuance of the act of assembly of 1699, <em>ch. 18, for ascertaining the bounds of land, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p><p id=\"b515-12\">The defendant located <em>Ranger\u2019s Lodge </em>on the. plots agreeahly to the said return of the jury, thereby covering a part of the plaintiff\u2019s tract called <em>Daniel\u2019s. Lot Revised.</em></p><p id=\"A4vR\">objected to the said return being offered in evidence to the jury.</p><p id=\"b515-14\"><em>1st Objection. </em>Tlie return is not evidence, because the defendant has not laid down <em>Ranger\u2019s Lodge </em>on tlie plots returned in this cause, agreeably to. the jurors return, and consequently the evidence is not applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tbe plots. The return directs that tbe tract shall run from the <em>beginning </em>A. 314 <em>perches; </em>whereas on the plots it runs JV. 85 <em>E. </em>328 <em>perches. </em>In the return, <em>thence </em>JV. 330 <em>perches with the said run </em>\u2014 on the plots, JV. 5 1-2 <em>TV. </em>324 <em>perches, leaving the run. </em>In the return, <em>then TV. 250perches^ </em>\u2014 on the plots, <em>W. </em>249 <em>perches to a bounded white oak; </em>which varies every course, and sets up a tree, which is neither in the certificate nor in the return of the jurors.</p><p id=\"b516-3\">The expressions in the <em>certificate </em>of <em>Ranger\u2019s Lodge </em>made for <em>Jones, </em>are \u201clying in Baltimore county at the head of Bush river, in a branch called Middle Branch, beginning at a <em>bounded white oak </em>standing <em>on the </em>JV. <em>E. side of a run called Binam\u2019s Run, </em>and running <em>E. </em>250 <em>perches </em>to a bounded <em>white oak </em>standing <em>by a run </em>called <em>John James\u2019s Jinn, </em>thence <em>with the said run JV. </em>320 <em>perches, </em>then <em>TV. </em>250 <em>perches, </em>then with a straight Une, &amp;C\u00bb containing 500 acres.</p><p id=\"b516-4\">2d <em>Objection. </em>The defendant\u2019s ease is not within, nor executed pursuant to, the act, on which the jurors return was founded.</p><p id=\"b516-5\">The jurors add 50 per cent, and say it is within the first example of the law. Blit that law only gives 50 per cent, when running <em>a certain course, </em>and certain number of perches, <em>to a bay, </em>&amp;c. <em>if the course directs </em>thereto, and the number of perches fali short, if adding 50 per cent, will react\u00bb the bay, &amp;c. the fine shall be extended the' eto, being <em>certain, natural </em>and <em>unalterable </em>bounds.</p><p id=\"b516-6\">There is no example in the law of <em>reversing the first course to find a beginning, </em>which the jurors did in this can to find an artificial beginning, to wit, a tree, and fixed at the beginning without any proof, by a sort of guess; and the;, ga%e 64 perches to reach the second tree standing on <em>John James\u2019s Run, </em>when the law only gives 50 per cent, to reach a bay, creek, &amp;c. <em>natural boundaries.</em></p><p id=\"b516-7\">x he defendant should shew his case <em>to be </em>expressly within an example of the law, or the court cannot presume it to be. within the equity, mischief or intention of the l;\\v, and the court is restricted hy. the last clause of the act.</p><p id=\"b516-8\">There is <em>no </em>example in the law, how to find either a first, second, third, or fourth tree, when lost.</p><p id=\"b516-9\">Where a tree is lost, no beginning could be set up to. prejudice an elder tract, which is done in this case.</p><p id=\"b516-10\">There is only <em>one </em>instance put in the law, of a tree lost, and that is <em>of a tree standing in the line of a tract, </em>hut. then to hold <em>only the precise number of perches.</em></p><p id=\"b516-11\"><em>3d Objection. </em>The jurors exceeded their authority;, they did not pursue their derivative power; and having done moro than is warranted hy the act, all is void.</p><p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Statutes creating new jurisdictions are. to be construed strictly, and ar? not to be taken by equity. \u2014 1 <em>Str. </em>255, 260. <em>Bac. M. tit. Statutes. </em>Ami statutes which gave new remedies shall, not have a liberal construction \u2014 2 <em>Sid. </em>28, 62, 63.</p><p id=\"b517-5\">This act cannot be styled wise, technical, or prudent, but with truth may be called <em>ignorant, </em>unintelligible, <em>illiterate, </em>and <em>against natural justice. </em>It directs no notice? to persons interested, as is done, by every law since, to wit, 1715, 1718, 1722, 1723. By this act aman maybe condemned unheard, his property affected secretly, and without any opportunity to support his right; and , no judgment can be given against a man net present, unless b\\ his default, he neglects to appear.</p><p id=\"b517-6\">The law directs the county court to grant a warrant of resurvey and a venire for a jury, <em>there (i. e. </em>in such case,) She surveyor to have the same fees as for primitive surveys, and <em>he </em>shall certify that by virtue of the warrant, <em>he </em>hath resurveyed the land, and that/ifi hath resurveyed and regulated the same according to the 1st, 2d, or other example of the law, which certificate, with a fair plot, <em>shall </em>be returned to the <em>examiner </em>of the county, and being approved by him, to the county clerk to be recorded. The governor to appoint the examiner,, and he, to have fees directed by the law.</p><p id=\"b517-7\">In this case, the return is by the jurors and <em>sheriff, </em>without any plot, and the. surveyor, the principal executive person, not present; no plot returned to the examiner, another necessary officer; and such return repeals or makes void or useless all that part of the law which creates such officers, and points out their office and duty.</p><p id=\"b517-8\">The jurors might be surveyors \u2014 admit it; yet a surveyor is directed by the law, and the return and plot is no evidence of boundaries unless made' by the surveyor, and passed by the examiner, which if done, might give some credit and exactness to the work, and would perpetuate the land in the same view for ever by the plot so returned to the county court and recorded, which we are enow* deprived of, and the proceedings of the jury in the dark. And here a return by persons not authorised, not deemed capable by the law*, without the sanction of the. surveyor and examiner, or a plot, is attempted to. establish bounds, when the law requires many persons and many acts to constitute such proceedings as proof.</p><p id=\"b517-9\">It is, apprehended that the jurors by the law were <em>onhj to </em>examine witnesses, and by proof to ascertain the bounds; but in tiiis case they usurped the department of surveyor and exaniiner.</p><p id=\"ADD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>When an act of parliament directs a thing to be don\u00e9 before <em>one, </em>it is an exclusion of all others. 11 <em>Co. </em>59. <em>Hob. </em>259. <em>Carter, </em>36. <em>Vaugh. </em>179. <em>Plowd. </em>206. <em>Savil, </em>36. 1 <em>Co. </em>11. <em>Holt, </em>215. 12 <em>Mod. </em>202. <em>Yelv. </em>26. <em>Noy, </em>46. <em>Bulst. </em>185. <em>Vin. tit.
