On the trial it appeared, by undisputed evidence, that the injury occurred in the following manner : Several of the occupants of defendant\u2019s tenement house, in Mulberry street, were on the roof engaged in beating a carpet. One of them, a boy named McCarthy, got on the railing surrounding the roof, in order to fix or attach a rope to one of the poles. His foot slipped, and in falling, to save himself, he caught the coping of the chimney, and pulled or pushed a piece of it off, which fell on the slanting roof of the adjoining house, and slipped thence to the street, striking the plaintiff on the way. The judge charged that, if the chimney was in an improper condition, defendant was liable, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>regard to the act of the hoy which caused the coping to fall.

There can be no doubt that the owner is responsible for his negligence either in constructing or upholding the freehold <em>(Eakin </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 E. D. Smith, 36), but for the negligent use of it by others, he cannot be made liable.
