This is not correct. The true principle is, that while a master is liable when the servant is in the line of his employment at the time of committing an injury, though he may. go out of his way and do his work in an improper and roundabout manner, yet this liability does not extend further. Take, for example, a late case where the master sent his car-man and clerk to deliver some wine and bring back some empty bottles, and on'their return, when about a quarter of a mile from the office, the carman, instead of doing as he was bidden, and putting up the horses, was induced by the clerk to drive in quite another direction on 'business of the clerk\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and thus injured a person in the street; the master was held not to be liable <em>(Sleath </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>9 Car. &amp; P. 607; <em>Storey </em>v. <em>Ashton, </em>4 Law.

F. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaG\">\u2014The plaintiff in the court below obtained a verdict for $250 damages, for the negligent driving of defendant\u2019s horse and carriage by defendant\u2019s servant, by which a horse belonging to plaintiff was killed. The accident occurred oh the evening of March 29th, 1871, at the corner of 7th avenue and 27th street. The plaintiff drove .up 7th avenue, and when he arrived at 27th street went across the west railroad track to go down 27th street, where he stabled, but when his horses reached the cross-walk, the defendant\u2019s coachman, driving defendant\u2019s horse before defendant\u2019s wagon, came very rapidly down 7th avenue, and a collision occurred, the shaft of the wagon ran into plaintiff\u2019s horse, who subsequently died of the wound. The evidence establishes a strong case of negligence on the part of defendant\u2019s coachman, and the only question in the case is, whether defendant can be held liable for the act. The testimony ,of the coachman, which is entirely undisputed, shows that when the collision occurred he was not driving the horse on his master\u2019s business, but on an errand of his own. He says, \u201c I was directed towards the latter part of that afternoon^ by Mr. Char-lick, to take his horse and wagon and go on a message to Hunter\u2019s Point R. R. depot, to get a map for, him and some other papers. I took his horse and wagqu and went out of the stables on 33d street around into 34th street, and so down in a direct line to 34th street ferry to jLunfer\u2019s Point. This was about twenty minutes past six o\u2019clock. I got the maps and papers at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Hunter\u2019s Point, and came back immediately the same way, and got home and delivered the message to Mr. Charlick about half-past seven o\u2019clock, p. m. He was in his room. He did not send me anywhere else that night. I afterwards took the mare and wagon, and went on an errand for myself down 7th avenue to 24th street. Q. <em>\u201c </em>Had this anything to do with Mr. Charlick\u2019s business?\u201d A. No, sir, nothing in the world.\u201d There is no contradiction of this in any part of the case. The coachman swears the mare needed exercise, but also swears that this trip down 7th avenue to 27th street was on an errand for himself, and there is nothing to show that it was taken to exercise the horse. The defendant stated to plaintiff, as plaintiff\u2019s witness, O\u2019Cara, swears, that he, defendant, did not know the reason of the coachman going down to 27th street, and said he had no business there. There is no contradiction of all this by any witness. It therefore appears, that while the coachman was the servant of defendant, and was driving the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon, yet he was not, when the accident occurred, going to or returning from any place by defendant\u2019s order or on defendant\u2019s business, or in pursuance of his employment as coachman, but had fully performed all he was directed to by defendant, and, instead of taking the horse to the stable, was driving upon an errand of his own in an entirely different direction, without defendant\u2019s knowledge or -consent. Upon these facts it seems to me that defendant is not liable (Sherman <em>&amp; </em>Bed. on Neg. \u00a7 63, and cases cited; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Crassweller, </em>13 Com. B. 237). The text book here cited observes, that \u201c if the act be done while the servant is at liberty from service, and pursuing his own ends exclusively, there can be no question of the master\u2019s freedom from liability, even if the injury could not have been committed without facilities afforded to the servant by his relations to his master.\u201d The case cited above was, that where a carman having finished the business of the day, returned to his employer\u2019s shop with the horse and cart, and obtained the key of the stable, which was- close at hand, but instead of going there at once and putting up the horse, as it was his duty to do, he, without his master\u2019s knowledge or consent, drove a fellow workman to Euston Square, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>and on his way back ran over and injured the plaintiff and his wife; and it was held (all the judges concurring) that, inasmuch as the carman was not at the time of the accident engaged in the business of his masters, they were not responsible for the consequences of his unauthorized act.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On a motion for a re-argument, or for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, the following opinion was delivered :</p>\n<author id=\"b349-8\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014J. F. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhC\">\u2014There seems to be no reason for a re-argument of this appeal. The judgment below was reversed by us upon the authority of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Crassweller, </em>13 C. B. 237. That case was decided long after the cases of <em>Joel </em>v. <em>Morrisson, </em>6 Carr. &amp; P. 501, and <em>Sleath </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>9 Carr. &amp; P. 601. In the latter case, a verdict was given for the plaintiff upon the charge of Erskine, J., that \u201c where the master has intrusted the servant with the control of the carriage, it is no answer that the servant acted improperly in the management of it ; the ground is that he has put it in his servant\u2019s power to mismanage the carriage by intrusting him with it ; he was acting in the course of his employment until he had deposited the carriage in the Red Lion stable.\u201d In that case the facts were these: the coachman drove his master to Great Stamford street; his orders were to put up at the Red Lion stable in Castle street, Leicester square, and meet his master at the Olympic theatre; he went, instead, into Old street road on business for himself. He was, therefore, actually sent to a certain place by his master and made a deviation from the road on his own affairs, all the time having the carriage out on his master\u2019s business. . So in <em>Joel </em>v. Morrisson, the servant was going out of his way when driving on his master\u2019s business, and his master was made liable. But in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Crassweller, </em>the car-man was taking the horse to the stable <em>\u201c </em>after the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the day was done,\u201d and instead of going to the stable, took a fellow-workman home, and afterwards, on his way back to the stable, ran against the plaintiff. Maul\u00e9, J., says, \u201c'At the time of the accident he was not going a roundabout way to the stable nor making a detour. He was not engaged in the business of his employers.\u201d Jervis, J., says, \u201cIf the master is liable where the servant has deviated, it must be where the deviation occurs in a journey on which the servant has originally started on his master\u2019s business.\u201d And the master in that case was held not liable. So in this case, the coachman of the defendant Charlick had duly performed his errand, had returned and delivered his message, and, having no further instructions, instead of taking the horse up to the stable, drove down Seventh avenue on an errand of his own, and while so going down, ran against the plaintiff\u2019s horse. I can only repeat the words of Williams, J., in the case of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Grass</em>weller, <em>\u201c </em>I should be extremely sorry if any authority could be found which would compel us to hold that this man was at the the time of the accident, which occurred through his breach of duty, acting in the employ of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The motion for a re-argument is denied, but as there does not seem to be any decision of our court of last resort, upon a question which has been very thoroughly discussed in England, I am in favor of permitting the plaintiff to appeal to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> Present, Van Brunt, Larremore, and J.
