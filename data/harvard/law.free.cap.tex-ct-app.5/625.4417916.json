Habeas Corpus \u2014 Second Application.\u2014An application for a second writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>must show that since the hearing in the first application important testimony has been obtained, which it was not possible to get at the former hearing. The application must also set forth the testimony so newly discovered, and if it be that of a witness, the affidavit of the witness must accompany the application.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-14\">2. Same. \u2014 But such application is not limited to newly discovered evidence. The right is conferred in two classes'of cases: 1. Where the applicant has obtained important evidence which, not newly discovered, it was out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>his power to produce on the former hearing. 2.- Where the evidence is newly discovered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-3\">3. Same. \u2014 It is not sufficient-that the second application he accompanied by the affidavit of the witness, but it must in all things conform to the rule governing applications for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-5\">4. Same \u2014 Practice.\u2014If the application does not in all things conform to this rule, the court below would be authorized to refuse the writ; and such action wduld be conclusive, for an appeal does not lie 'from the refusal of the lower court to grant the writ.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-7\">6. Same \u2014Practice in this Court. \u2014 The court below having granted the writ, and, upon hearing the testimony, having ruled that it was not newly discovered, this court, even though it concurs in that view, will not for that reason, or because the applicant was not entitled to the writ, affirm the judgment refusing hail. But, the writ having been granted and the proofs heard by the court below, and the evidence having become part of the record, on appeal this court is required to hear the facts and law arising thereon, and to enter such judgment and make such orders as the law and the nature of the case require.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-8\">6. Same. \u2014 This court is precluded from revising the action taken below on incidental questions in this class of cases.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-10\">7. Bight of Bail. \u2014 The Constitution of 1876 provides that \u201call prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offences when the proof is evident.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-12\">8. \u201cProof is evident\u201d if the evidence adduced on the application for bail would sustain a verdict convicting the prisoner of murder in the first degree ; but if the evidence be of less \u00e9fficaey, bail should be allowed him. In other words, bail is not a matter of right, if the evidence is clear and strong, leading a well-guarded-and dispassionate judgment to the conclusion that the offence has been committed; that the prisoner is the guilty agent; and that, if the law be administered, he will be capitally convicted.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-14\">9. Practice in this Court. \u2014 The present case being held bailable, and the record disclosing the prisoner\u2019s ability to give bond in a certain sum, deemed reasonable, this court empowers the sheriff to take such bond, with sufficient sureties, and conditioned according to law, and directs that it be filed in the District Court having cognizance of the case.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b634-16\">Appeal from the District Court of Austin. Tried below before the Hon. L. W. Moore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-17\">The applicant in this case was charged by bill of indictment with the murder of Nicholas Umiaud, alleged to-have been committed in Austin County, October 13, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Sutton testifies, in substance, that his attention was first called to the difficulty, as he was going to the coffee-stand for a cup of coffee, by hearing some angry words near him, and discovered it was Umland (the deceased) and James Foster (a brother of defendant\u2019s), standing facing each other, when he heard Umland say, \u201c If that is not sufficient, I am a man,\u201d or words of like import, and James Foster replying, \u201c I am, too,\u201d or words of like effect. He (Sutton) went to them to make peace, and extended his hands forward and placed the back of his right hand against Umland and the back of his left against James Foster. He heard no other remarks between the parties, and knew by the tone of Umland\u2019s voice that he was mad. Just at this moment he saw a hand from his left side, in front, pass him and catch Umland by the right shoulder (Umland having his right hand in his pocket at the time), when he turned and saw that it was the defendant, Scurry Foster, with a pistol in his hand. Just at this time Umland made a plunge forward about two steps, or was jerked forward, and the pistol fired and Umland fell, wounded near the shoulder, and died about an hour thereafter. When witness first saw defendant he was almost directly behind or beside James Foster. All that he saw or heard occurred inside of a minute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">H. C. Ferris testified, in substance, that he and Umland were at the coffee-stand drinking coffee; Umland had finished, and was sitting off on a beer-keg, waiting for him. He was sitting upon another keg, about two feet from Umland. At this juncture James Foster came up, and Umland and he were talking. He heard Umland say, \u201c I have made that up with you two or three times, but if you crowd me, or want anything more,\u201d\u2014or something to that effect, \u2014 \u201cI am a man, and will defend myself.\u201d Foster replied', \u201c I am, too.\u201d He (Ferris) then said to them, \u201c Boys, boys, bo vs,\u201d and went on drinking his coffee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The next thing he heard was the report of a pistol, and Umland exclaimed, \u201c Ferris, I am a dead man.\u201d He then went to the place where Umland was lying, which was ten or twelve feet from where he (Ferris) had been sitting at the coffee-stand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-5\">Upon cross-examination, this witness states that the first remark he heard from Umland, when he was talking with James Foster, was, \u201cWe have made friends over this two or three times, and what is the use of saying anything more about it,\u201d or something of that sort; and he thinks he further said, \u201c If you want anything more, I am a man, and by G\u2014d you can get it; I stand in my own shoes ; \u2019 \u2019 and James Foster replied, \u201cI am a man, too.\u201d The first he saw of James Foster, he was standing near him and Umland, and both were talking. At first Umland was sitting, but when he made those remarks he rose up. James Foster and Umland were standing close together when he heard these remarks. At this time both were so near to him that he could have touched them. He did not see the pistol fired. Thinks the parties were ten or twelve feet from him when the pistol was fired, but he did not observe how they got from where they were when he first noticed them to where they were when-the pistol fired. He (witness) was somewhat under the influence of liquor that night. Don\u2019t remember any one knocking his hat off that night, and telling him he meant no harm by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-6\">Joe Nichols\u2019s testimony: He was keeping a coffee-stand at the Piney school-house on the night of the homicide. Between thtee and four o\u2019clock in the morning, Umland and Ferris came to the coffee-stand for coffee. Ferris drank two cups and Umland one. Umland had finished his cup, and Ferris was sitting there mincing his, with his head down, and-during this time James F\u00f3st\u00e9r came up and slapped Ferris\u2019s hat off- his head. Umland picked up the hat and put it backon Ferris\u2019s head, and said to-Fos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tor, \u201c Don\u2019t be slapping Ferris\u2019s hat off that way ; he might get mad.\u201d Foster replied, \u201clam not afraid of making Deacon Ferris mad; I have known him for a long time.\u201d Ferris raised his head then, and said, \u201cNo, there was no danger of his getting mad.\u201d Foster then said something to Umland, not understood by the witness. Umland then said, \u201c Jim, I have made friends with you two or three times about that thing, and what is the use to keep bringing it up?\u201d Umland then got up and said, \u201c I am a man, and stand i.n my own shoes ; \u201d and Foster said, \u201c So am I.\u201d Then the defendent, Scurry Foster, stepped up and said, \u201cI am right here, ready for anything.\u201d Then Umland and Scurry Foster stepped off two or- three steps from the coffee-stand, and there were some words passed between them, which the witness did not understand, after which Scurry Foster slapped Umland\u2019s jaws. Then Umland either struck him or pushed him. The motion was with the right hand, and seemed to. be straight out from his body, and defendant either stepped back or the blow pushed or staggered him back; and as he stepped or staggered back he reached down in his breast and pulled out a pistol from his vest or coat pocket, inside, presented it, and fired, and Umland fell on his back, and said twice, \u201c Charlie, I am a dead man.\u201d Witness heard the click of the pistol as it was cocked. Umland seemed to be in a good humor during the time he was sitting at the coffee-stand. While sitting at the coffee-stand with Ferris, Umland did not use any harsh or profane language about anybody, or make any threats. Saw nothing in Umland\u2019s hands during the difficulty. Don\u2019t remember that Ferris said anything to anybody while at the coffee-stand. They were sitting there half to three-quarters of an hour before Foster came up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-6\">Upon cross-examination, the witness stated that when James Foster commenced the conversation with Umland he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>seemed to be speaking privately, and in an undertone ; when Umland got up, and said, \u201cJimmie, we have settled that two or three times, and what is the use of bringing it up again, or throwing it up to him, or keeping talking about it,\u201d \u2014 or something to that effect \u2014 \u2018 \u2018 that, by Gr\u2014d, he was a man, and stood in his own shoes.\u201d At this time Scurry Foster came up, and said, \u201c He was here, and ready for anything; \u201d and without any further remarks, Scurry Foster and Umland retired six or eight feet from the counter and engaged in a conversation he did not understand, when Scurry Foster slapped Umland\u2019s jaws, etc. Saw Sutton, who seemed to be trying to keep Scurry Foster and Umland apart. When he first noticed Sutton he put a hand on Umland and a hand on Foster,' and then the slapping was done, and Umland either struck or pushed him. Did not see anybody in the group at this time except Umland, defendant, and Sutton. Did not see anybody catch Umland by the shoulder, and give him a jerk. Thinks he would have seen it if it had occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-5\">C. H. Brossman\u2019s testimony: He was a brother-in-law of Umland, and witnessed the homicide. While going from the school-house towards the coffee-stand, heard Umland make the remark, \u201cI am aman, and stand in my own shoes.\u201d Was six or eight steps from Umland at the time. The remark attracted his attention to the party. Some reply was made by a person standing in front of Umland, that he did not hear. There were three persons in the group besides Umland. As the remark was made, he saw some one of the three stepping between them, and a motion of his hands as if trying'to keep them apart. He then saw one of the party, the one furthest from Umland, advance towards him ; saw the barrel of the pistol, the flash, and the fall of Umland. The pistol was in the hands of the party who advanced, and at\" the crack of the pistol Umland fell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>When the pistol fired, did not see Umland striking with his hands. Thinks if he had been, he could have seen it. He was excited at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-6\">The State also introduced John B. Lewis, deputy-sheriff of Austin County, and the officer who arrested Scurry Foster upon the spot at the time of the homicide, who testified that about an hour or more previous to the homicide he saw deceased having a quarrel with some other parties, and that he had an open pocket-knife in his hand, and that he (the sheriff) requested him to put up the knife ; and he replied that he was not armed, that he only had a pocket-knife, and he thought he had a right to keep that in his hand. He then ordered him to put the knife in his pocket, which he did. The knife was an ordinary pocket-knife, with a blade some two or three inches long. After the killing, Mr. Lang-hammer showed me a knife having the same appearance as the knife I saw Umland have. Ordinarily, I would take it for the same knife. That he was standing in the vicinity of the shooting at the time it occurred, and saw the flash of the pistol; that Foster, after the pistol fired, stepped rapidly backward five or six steps and stopped, and by the time he had stopped he caught hold of him, and wrested the pistol from his hands: that he seemed to be very much excited when he first got hold of him, and said he would shoot any man that tried to cut his throat; that he examined the wound upon Umland. The shot penetrated between the right nipple and collar-bone. The wound seemed to have been slanting, and not directly in front, and ranged in. Previous to the shooting, he had seen Umland take several glasses of beer, and thinks he was somewhat, though not much, excited from drinking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-7\">E. R. Thomas, a witness for the State, testified that he examined the body of the deceased the morning after the homicide, and found a wound on the right side of the body, just below the collar-bone. He examined carefully the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>wound. It ranged towards the left and centre, across the body.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-5\">J. A. Traylor, witness for the State, testified that defendant and Umland had some quarrelling and harsh words at a bar-room in Chappell Hill, last Christmas. Witness, as a peace officer, suppressed the quarrel, and Umland went off over across the street, and said something back to defendant, such as that he had acted the d\u2014d rascal, or d\u2014d scoundrel; and Foster replied that he was not able to fight him, but that he would see him another time. The parties were both in drink at the time, and they got together the next morning, through the intercession of friends, and settled their quarrel, and made friends and shook hands uver the settlement. Witness saw the parties meet about two weeks afterwards, and their meeting was friendly. Umland, when drinking, was sometimes inclined to be quarrelsome. Witness had known of his having several fights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-6\">W. P. H. Tatum also testified to substantially the same \u25a0facts as Traylor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">The testimony alleged to have been newly discovered, and upon which the second application is based, is that of the witnesses T. J. Estes, Japhet Collins, James Manning, Henry May, J. W. Moss, Peter Anderson, John Foster, and John D. Cochran, all of whom were at the ball on Piney on the night of the homicide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-8\">Estes testifies that between ten and eleven o\u2019clock in the night he saw Umland show H. C. Ferris a large pocket-knife, and heard him say to Ferris, \u201c This is the only weapon I have, but I will use it;\u201d and that later, between one and two o\u2019clock, he heard Umland and Ferris talking together some time in a low tone, all of which he did not hear (they being three or four feet from him, sitting on a bench), and, while talking, Umland drew from his pocket a knife, and said, \u201c I have no other weapon but this ; but you know, Deacon, I am no coward, and am afraid of no man;\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>with an oath, said, \u201cI will use it on him.\u201d Witness did not hear distinctly the name of the party upon whom the knife was to be used, but from the conversation he believed it to be Scurry Foster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">Japhet Collins testified, in substance, that he was some twelve or fifteen feet from the parties at the time of the homicide, and his attention was attracted to them.by loud talking; that he saw James Foster, Scurry Foster, and Umland standing close together; that he saw a motion of the hands between the parties, and immediately he saw defendant going back, and Umland following him up, and that he was advancing at the time the pistol fired ; that James Foster seemed to be trying to keep Umland back and prevent a difficulty; that when he first noticed them, James Foster was between Umland and Scurry Foster, but before the pistol was fired Umland had either pushed him aside or passed him. As soon as Umland fell, he (the witness) sprang to him, and heard him say, \u201c I am a dead man ; \u201d and also heard Foster (defendant) say \u201cthat he would shoot any man that tried to cut his throat; \u2019 \u2019 this remark of defendant\u2019s was made immediately after the firing, and just as Umland fell to the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">James Manning testified that sometime during the night of the homicide, about eleven o'clock, he was passing by where Umland and Deacon Ferris were sitting on a bench, and he heard Umland say, \u201cIf he bothers me, or if he bothers me again, I will stick this in him.\u201d That the remarks were made in an angry manner, and seemed to be in earnest. The witness did not know who it was that he was speaking abopt, nor what it was that he was going to stick in him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">Henry May testifies that he saw the killing, and was about ten or fifteen feet from the parties at the time, and heard them talking, and they seemed to be quarrelling. Scurry Foster said, \u201c Claus, I don\u2019t want to have any diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>culty with you;\u201d and Umland replied,' \u201c I don\u2019t care a d\u2014n. I will cut your d\u2014d throat,\u201d and made a lick at Foster with the lmife, which was either a large pocketknife or a dirk; he could not say which, as he only saw the blade. When Umland struck at Foster with the knife, Foster began to retreat, and retreated about six feet before he fired at Umland, Umland following him up, still striking at him with the knife. He cut at Foster two or three times before the pistol was fired. This occurred near the coffee-stand. There were several persons standing near by, but could not say who they all were. When he first saw the parties James Foster was between them. When the pistol was fired no one was between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">J. W. Moss testifies that he was near the parties at the time of the homicide; that his attention was called to them by loud talking, when he turned and saw Scurry Foster backing and retreating from some one he did not know, but whom he was afterwards told was Claus Umland. It was the same party who was killed. That after Foster had retreated five or six feet he fired at the deceased, who seemed to be advancing towards Foster when the pistol fired. He could not distinguish the words used by the parties. Foster did not fire over or around the shoulders of Thomas Sutton or any one else. James Foster was between the parties when he first saw them. He could not say positively' that deceased was walking towards- Foster at the time he was shot, but he seemed to be advancing upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">Peter Anderson testifies that about five minutes before the homicide he saw defendant and deceased standing talking together, and heard defendant say to Umland, \u201c I don\u2019t want any trouble with you; \u201d and Umland replied, \u201c You' d\u2014d s\u2014n of a b\u2014h, I\u2019ll cut your throat from ear t\u00f3 ear.\u201d He seemed to be angry, and had a knife (which he took to be a pocket-knife) in his hand at the time, holding it a little behind him. After Umland was shot, he saw a man come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>up to the body and stoop down and take a knife out of or from near the right hand of deceased, and walk off with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">John Foster testifies that he saw the pistol that was exhibited at the examining' trial as the one with which the killing was done. It was his pistol; and about eleven o\u2019clock in the night he lay down upon a bench and went to sleep, and while asleep, some one took from his person the pistol, and his watch and chain.

He . did not speak, of the conversation with Umland until after the shooting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\">Frank F,ord testified that he was at the barbecue and ball at Piney school-house, and, as he supposed, about three-quarters of an .hour before the shooting, he passed by Umland and Ferris, sitting at the coffee-stand, and heard Umland remark \u201cthat he intended to cut Scurry Foster\u2019s d\u2014d throat before day.\u2019\u2019 He did not know Umland at the time.,, He (witness) passed on, and soon met Scurry Foster, and told him of the remark, and he asked who it was, and he turne.d around and pointed out the man to Foster that had made the threat alluded to, and Foster informed him who the man was. There was a large crowd on the grounds,at the time, and people were constantly passing and, repassing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">Levi Rogers testified that he resided at Chappell Hill. Had known Claus Umland for quite a number of years. The Friday night before the Saturday night that Umland was killed, he saw him at a grocery in Chappell Hill, and Umland told him (the witness) that he was going .down into Austin County to attend a barbecue and dance, and that he didn\u2019t know that, he ever would get back again, but that he was going prepared. Umland, when in drink, was inclined to be quarrelsome.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-7\">Charles Langhammer testified that he was the sheriff of Austin County, and was about fifteen or sixteen feet from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Umland at the time he was shot; that he went to him in about ten minutes after he was shot. Did not notice the position of his hands at the time. He then went off, and returned again in not exceeding five minutes, and found him lying on his back, and his left hand resting on his body. He had a knife in his left hand. The knife was open. (The knife was here exhibited.) The knife was in such a position that he did not see it until he raised the hand. Does not know which way the blade was pointed, nor whose knife it is. It is the same knife he had shown to John Lewis. Would judge the blade to be from two and one-quarter to two and one-half inches long, and the handle \u25a0about three inches long.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">Upon cross-examination, witness said he did not know how the knife came in Umland\u2019s hand. The knife was loose in the hand. When he raised the hand the knife came with it, but there was no resistance when he took the knife out. There were a great many people around when he took the knife out of the hand. There had been a great many people around the body whenever he approached it, going and coming. The knife is one that had been used a good deal; has been whetted up, and is considerably worn. Noticed Ferris washing the face of the deceased. He took Umland to be dead when he took the knife out of his hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">Lucien Collins testified that, about a half-hour before the shooting, he saw H. C. Ferris sitting on a lager beer keg at the coffee-stand, and he took him to be drunk. He (witness) stepped up, and slapped him on the back or shoulder, and said, \u201c Hello ! Ferris, what are you doing here?\u201d and he replied, \u201cI am just resting myself.\u201d Witness wanted to talk to him, but he did not seem to notice much, and he went off and left him. He was then in a stupid condition. Could not say whether it was caused from drinking or want of sleep. Had seen Ferris about two hours before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the homicide. He was drinking, but did not notice his being intoxicated then.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">John D. Cochran testified that he s\u00e1w H. C. Ferris about two hours before the shooting. Had some conversation with him, and thought he was considerably intoxicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">G. E. Miller testified, for the State, that he saw Umland inside of three minutes after he was shot. He was still alive, and his hands lying out from the body on the ground. They were neither clenched nor open. The palms of the hands were up. The right hand was over a foot, and the left four or six inches from the body. Did not notice anything in his hands; nor did he notice, in particular, to see if anything was in his hands. From the position of his hand, did not think it would have held a knife if it had been raised over on his body.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-7\"><em>J. P.

The first application was made and heard before indictment found, and the application in this case after indictment. Applicant\u2019s right to a second writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was based upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Upon the hearing in chambers, the district judge rendered the following judgment, viz.: \u201cIt appearing to the court that the evidence introduced by the applicant alleged to be newly discovered was not in fact such evidence, and accordingly not sufficient to authorize the court to change the former judgment of the court refusing bail, and for other and sufficient reasons, it is ordered and adjudged by the court that the prisoner, Scurry Foster, be remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Austin County, to be by him confined, without bail, to answer the indictment preferred against him by the grand jury of said county, charging him with the murder of Nicholas Umland,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">With regard to second applications for the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>our statute reads thus: \u201cA party may obtain the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>a second time by stating in the application therefor that since the hearing in his first application important testimony has been obtained, which was not in his power to produce at the former hearing. He shall also set forth the testimony so newly discovered; and if it be that of a witness, the affidavit of the witness shall also accompany such application.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. 2642.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">A casual reading of the language of this statute might lead to the inference that such second applications would be limited exclusively to evidence which was newly discovered. Such, however, is not our interpretation, based upon a proper construction of the whole article, and, as we think, in perfect consonance with the broad principles of justice and human liberty upon which the writ is founded, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the better protection and security of which its privileges were intended mostly to subserve. We are of opinion that the statute intended to confer the risfht in two classes of cases: First, where important testimony has been obtained, which, though not newly discovered, or which, though known to him, it was not in his power to produce at the former hearing; second, where the evidence was newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In either case his application, if it be on account of the testimony of a witness, should not only be accompanied by the affidavit of the witness, but the reasons why the testimony was not adduced should be fully stated, in order that the judge or court to whom the application was addressed might know, in the one case, why it was out of his power to produce it at the former hearing, and in the other, such facts stated as would satisfy the court that the failure to discover the testimony was not attributable to any lack of proper diligence on his part; in other words, the application should be so full and complete as to apprise the court of all the facts necessary to be known, that it might act advisedly in granting or refusing the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We cannot better, perhaps, illustrate our idea than by the facts presented in the case at bar. As we have seen, the application was upon the ground of newly discovered evidence. In such a case, we take it, all the recognized rules with reference to newly discovered testimony on motions for new trials would obtain and govern. The showing should be the same. If the showing itself discloses, we will say, want of diligence, or that the evidence is cumulative, or that it was intended to impeach a witness, or any other fact which whould render it insufficient or invalid on a motion for new trial, then the judge or court would be fully authorized in refusing the writ,' and his refusal would be conclusive; for an appeal does not lie from the refusal of a district judge to grant a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Ex parte </em>Ainsworth; 27 Texas, 731; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>The State, </em>40 Texas, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In this case, 'however, the judge granted the writ; and theu,uponthe hearing, determined that the evidence was not newly discovered. A question is here presented which has \u2022never before arisen in this State, and that is, What should be the practice in this court on appeal, even supposing the court should concur in the view of the District Court that the evidence was not newly discovered? Will we affirm the judgment because the party was not primarily entitled- to the writ? Clearly not. Having granted the writ and heard the-testimony, the evidence thus heard becomes part of the facts of the record. The rule of practice as prescribed by the statute applies-: \u201c The Supreme Court [Court of Appeals] shall hear the appeal upon the facts and law arising upon-the record, and shall enter such judgment and make such orders as the law and the nature of the case may require.\u201d Pasc. Dig.; art. 3221. \u201c The opinion of a district or supreme judge shall not be revised as to any incidental question which may have arisen on the hearing of the application for <em>habeas corpus, </em>the only design of the appeal being to do substantial justice to the party appealing.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. -3222.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The case, then, must be determined by us, not upon the question as to whether- the evidence is newly discovered, but upon the evidence as we find it-adduced on the hearing and presented in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Taking the record as an entirety, and considering all the testimony as it here appears, is the prisoner entitled to bail? Our present Constitution- provides that \u201c all prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital otfenees when the proof is evid\u00e9nt.\u201d Const., art. 1, sec. 11. What is the proper definition to be given and the legal interpretation to be placed upon the words, \u201c when the proof is evident,\u201d as used in the constitutional provision quoted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>has been a most fruitful source of discussion with the legal profession of the State since the adoption of the Constitution of 1869, where the same language is used as in the. present Constitution. No legal construction has ever been directly given it. In the ease-of <em>Ex parte </em>Rothschild,- 2--Texas. Ct. -App. 560, this court promised-to avail itself-of the first .suitable case to discuss, the meaning of -these words, and to declare the rules which would regulate and govern the action of this court in its adjudications upon' <em>habeas corpus </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 25 Texas, 33, our Supreme Court -gave their interpretation of the meaning;of the expression, \u201c proof is evident or presumption great,\u201d as used with reference to bail, in the ninth section of article 1 of the Constitution of 1845. Roberts, J., says The terms * *- * are as definite to the- legal mind as any words of explanation could make them, and are intended to indicate the same degree of certainty, whether the evidence be direct or circumstantial.. The design is to secure the right of bail in all cases, except in those in- which the' facts might show with reasonable certainty that the prisoner is guilty of a capital offence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The omission of the words, \u201c or presumption great,\u201d and the use of the expression, \u201c proof is evident,\u201d in the present Constitution, it is contended, materially change the rights of a prisoner, and require, to justify a refusal of bail, the establishment of a much more direct and certain case of guilt than formerly. Doubtless this is so. Some, however (able lawyers), go to the extent of insisting that a mere conflict of testimony will necessarily entitle a party to bail, since that cannot be said to be evident which admits of dispute ; and the case of <em>Ex parte Miller, </em>41 Texas, 213, is .frequently cited in support of this position. When examined with reference to the facts of the case before the court, and which were the facts to which alone the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>opinion relates, or even independently considered, we do not think the rules therein laid down warrant such construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Again, it is insisted that the only true and correct meaning of the word \u201c evident\u201d is that given it by lexicographers whose works are recognized as of standard authority. Take, for instance, the definition given by Webster, and we believe his definition is about the same as that of most standard authors. He defines \u201c evident\u201d to be, \u201c <em>dear to the mind; </em>obvious ; plain ; apparent; manifest: notorious ; palpable.\u201d This is very satisfactory, is doubtless accurate and correct, and, as we shall endeavor to show hereafter, not inconsistent with our view of the constitutional expression, \u201cproof is evident,\u201d even when subjected to philological construction. Perhaps we cannot succeed better in making olirselves understood than by declaring the general rules which will control and govern us in refusing bail, under the constitutional prohibition, than by attempting to announce a definite abstract meaning for the constitutional expression, which is not easily defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania have laid down a rule upon this subject which we think worthy of approval. In <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keeper of Prison, 2 </em>Ashm. <em>227, </em>it is said to be \u201c a safe rule, where a malicious homicide is charged, to refuse bail in all cases where a judge would sustain a capital conviction, if pronounced by a jury, on such evidence of guilt as was exhibited to him on the hearing of the application to admit to bail; and, in instances where the evidence of the Commonwealth is of less efficacy, to admit to bail.\u201d <em>2 </em>Ashm. 227; Hurd on Habeas Corpus, 438; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Summons, </em>19 Ohio, 139 ; <em>Ex parte Bryant, </em>34 Ala. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The same idea is tersely and happily expressed by Brickell, C. J., in <em>Ex parte McAnally, </em>53 Ala. 495. He says : \u201cIf the evidence is clear and strong, leading a well-guarded and dispassionate judgment to the conclusion that the offence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>has been committed; that the accused is the guilty agent; and that he would probably be punished capitally if the law is administered, bail is not a matter of right.\u201d See also <em>Ex parte Nettles, </em>Sup. Ct. Ala., A. D. 1878.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We know of no better exposition of our views with-regard to the -proper construction of the constitutional expression, \u201c proof- is evidentj\u201d than the two rules - quoted; and when subjected to'strictest criticism, We cannot see that they are in anywise inconsistent with the definition quoted from Mr. Webster. Besides this, they furnish ample restrictions to regulate and govern the action of the courts in their adjudications upon- questions of bail in capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">When we apply the doctrine thus enunciated to\"the facts in evidence, as shown in the record before us, we are not satisfied that \u201c the proof is evident.\u201d Consequently,- we believe that the applicant is entitled to bail. We do not wish to be understood as saying that he is not guilty of murder in the first degree, and that this fact may not be made to appear most fully upon his final trial. We are only passing upon the sufficiency of the- evidence as exhibited in this record, and upoii it alone is our opinion predicated. We will not comment upon it, lest our comments should influence the final trial; to decline to do so is the uniform practice, as it has always-obtained in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In the record we are furnished with an agreement of counsel for the State and applicant, that applicant can give a bond in the sum of $5,000.\" The court have, therefore, concluded that the sum of $5,000 would be proper in the premises. It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged by the court that the applicant, Scurry Foster, be admitted to bail in the sum of $5,000, with good and sufficient sureties, and that this judgment of the court be certified to the sheriff of Austin County, the officer having custody of said applicant, who is authorized and empowered to receive a bail-bond for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that amount, properly executed, and conditioned'as the law requires; which said bail-bond, when so executed and approved by said sheriff, shall be filed by him in the District Court of said Austin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
