Evidence. \u2014 If the jury in a criminal action finds it impossible to reconcile a conflict of testimony, they are empowered to give credence to that which, in their opinion, is best entitled to it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b483-13\">3. Same \u2014 Case Stated. \u2014 In a prosecution for the wilful and wanton killing of a dog, the defendant, a minor, offered in evidence the directions of his father as to what he should do if the dog was again caught in mischief upon the premises. <em>Held, </em>properly excluded; and that what the dog had previously done could not be shown in evidence to afford a legal excuse for the defendant to kill the dog at the time he did. And <em>held, </em>further, that the fact that defendant was a minor only proves that he was under the age of twenty-one, and the additional fact that he was directed by his father, with whom he was living, to kill the dog, without further evidence of defendant\u2019s age, is no defence for the wanton killing of the dog.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b483-15\">4. Same. \u2014 The burden of proof, to show that the discretion of a minor defendant was sufficient to understand the nature and illegality of the act constituting the offence, does not devolve upon the State until it is shown that the minor was aged between the years of nine and thirteen.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b483-17\">6. Malicious Mischief. \u2014 A dog which has an owner is a \u201cdumb animal,\u201d within the meaning of articles 2344 and 2345, Paschal\u2019s Digest.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-18\">Appeal from the County Court of Jefferson.

If there be a. radical error in the charge to the jury, exception thereto-at the time is unnecessary; and if made ground for new trial, and overruled, the cause on appeal may be reversed. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Texas Ct. App. 84; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Texas Ct. App. 404. The delivery of the law-book to the jury was, in effect, to leave to the jury the construction and application of the law, and was a <em>radical' </em>error. Pasc. Dig., arts. 3058, 3060; <em>Prince v. Randolph, </em>12 Texas, 295 ; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>11 Texas, 403.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">2. Considered in connection with the evidence admitted,, that the defendant was a boy, living with his father and under his control, and the circumstances attending the killing, as also admitted for the defence, the evidence excluded was relevant to show <em>hnowledge </em>and <em>intent, </em>and whether or not the act charged to be an offence was <em>wilful </em>and <em>wanton. Pa</em>sc. Dig., art. 2345 ; <em>Persons </em>v. <em>The State, 3 </em>Texas Ct. App. 244, and authorities there cited; <em>Branch </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 Texas, 622; <em>Benson </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 11. Apply to the facts of this case the last two-authorities, as they define the offence, and illustrate the negative of wantonness, substituting a <em>dog </em>of mischievous-habits (permitted by its owner to run at large, and against the incursions of which no fence is required by law) for the horse, and we respectfully submit that the relevancy of the said testimony is very apparent; and horses have, while dogs have not, an intrinsic value. 2 Chitty\u2019s Bla. Com., b. 4, marg. p. 236 ; id., marg. p. 7, par. 21; 1 id., b. 2, marg, p. 393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">Property in dogs is not absolute, but defeasible by'the resumption of their ancient propensities to roam at large and depredate. Id., marg. pp. 393, 394.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">An action under the common law would only lie for <em>unlawfully </em>destroying them. Id.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">It was not under the same law, nor is it now, unlawful, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>a party injured, to abate them as a nuisance by destroying them \u2014 there being no remedy against their trespasses by distraint \u2014 when they encroach upon the premises and attack the person or property of the citizen. 2 id., b. 3, marg. p. 3, art. 1; marg. p. 5, par. 4, note 6; id., 6, 7, 8, par. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">In support of the assignments of error, in other respects, it may be said that the exclusion of said testimony, and the \u2022surrender of the law to the jury, by the court, was calculated to impress, and did impress, the minds of the jury <em>\u25a0that the only question, the criterion of guilt, </em>was, \u201c Did the \u2022defendant kill the dog? \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">But, presuming everything else in favor of the verdict, the effect of the rulings of the court was to exclude <em>any </em>evidence as to the former depredations or habits of the dog in justification for killing him off the premises of the \u2022owner, and while he was trespassing on the premises of .another. And whilst this construction of the law mi\u00fcht have the effect to redeem and render less obnoxious dogs \u2022of the habits of \u201c old dog Tray,\u201d or his companions in Webster\u2019s spelling-book, yet we respectfully submit that, for reasons too apparent, such a construction could not have been contemplated by the Legislature in the enactment of the statute under which this prosecution originated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-8\"><em>Thomas Ball, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-9\">Ectob, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQjZ\">The information in this case is under article '2344, Pascal\u2019s Digest. It charges that the defendant, on \u2022or about August 19, 1878, in the county of Jefferson, \u201c did unlawfully, wilfully, and wantonly kill a certain dumb animal, namely, a dog, the property of another person; contrary to the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The first assignment of errors refers to the charge of the court, and is as follows, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201c 1. The court erred in delivering to the jury Paschal\u2019s Annotated Digest of the Laws of the State of Texas, in connection with a verbal charge, at the same time referring them particularly to articles 2344 and 2345, and in instructing and permitting them to take said law-book with them on their retirement, the parties having agreed only to a verbal charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The question raised by this assignment should have been presented by bill of exceptions. The defendant, by himself or counsel, should have saved a bill of exceptions to the action of the court below which is complained of, so as to have brought the question properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The evidence, both on the part of the prosecution and the defence, shows that defendant shot and killed a dog, the property of one Wilson Gainer. The witnesses introduced on the part of the State testified that the dog got after a rabbit in the field of Gainer, where his sons were at work; that the dog pursued the rabbit into the adjoining field of Zack McDaniel, and that the defendant there shot and killed the dog while he was after the rabbit. The witnesses on the part of the defence testified that they saw Gainer\u2019s dog come upon the premises of Zack McDaniel, go to a scaffold upon which he had meat drying, take a piece of meat therefrom,, and that the defendant, who was then a boy living with his father, ran into the house, got the gun, and shot the dog-while he was running off with the piece of meat. There was an irreconcilable conflict in the evidence offered on the part of the prosecution and the defence. The jury saw proper to believe the State\u2019s witnesses, and in this we cannot say that they committed an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">We believe that the court properly sustained the exceptions to the evidence referred to in'defendant\u2019s bill of excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>tions. The hearsay declarations of Zack McDaniel were not admissible in evidence as to the directions given by him. to his son, the defendant, in case the same dog was caught in mischief upon the premises of Zack McDaniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">What the dog had done before could not be shown in-evidence as a defence, so as to afford a legal excuse for the-defendant to kill the dog at the time he did. The fact that: the defendant was a minor, and lived at the time with and was controlled by his father, would not shield him from punishment for wilfully and wantonly killing the dog. Our statute provides that \u201c no person shall be convicted of any offence committed before he was of the age of nine years, nor of any offence committed between the years of nine and thirteen, unless it shall appear by proof that he had discretion sufficient to understand the nature and illegality of the-act constituting the offence.\u201d If the evidence had shown that defendant, at the time he killed the dog, was between the ages of nine and thirteen, the burden of proof would have been upon the State to have shown that he had discretion sufficient to understand the nature and illegality off the act constituting the offence. The fact that defendant was a minor only proves that he was under twenty-one years-of age, and the further fact that he was living with his father, and that he was directed by his father to Mil the dog, without further evidence in regard to defendant\u2019s age at the-time, would not shield him from punishment for wilfully and wantonly killing Gainer\u2019s dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The court did not commit an error in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for new trial and in arrest of judgment. The-information is a good one. It is made an offence by our statute to wilfully and wantonly kill a dog, as it is to kill any other dumb animal, the property of another. PascDig., arts. 2344, 2345.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We find nothing in the entire record that would warrant us in reversing the judgment, and it is therefore affirmed -</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
