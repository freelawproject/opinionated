D. 1876, in the county of Hamilton, and State of Texas, Walker Bush and C. C. Prater did wilfully disturb a congregation-assembled for religious worship, and conducting themselves in a lawful manner, by loud and vociferous talking and quarrelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">In our opinion, the indictment is sufficient under the statute of April 23, 1874. Gen. Laws Thirteenth Legislature, 43 ; <em>Corley </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 Texas Ct. App. 412. The court did not err in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">The judgment must, however, necessarily be reversed, for the reason that the record nowhere discloses that the-defendant on the trial pleaded, or that a plea was interposed for him under the statute. <em>Stacey </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 Texas Ct. App. 121; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>The State, </em>4 Texas Ct. App. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
