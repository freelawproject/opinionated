Circumstances which are accepted as natural and normal incidents of a rural society by those who are nurtured by an agrarian environment do not always match the expectations of bucolic life anticipated by suburbanites as they move out to the countryside. While new residents may well expect, and accept, vistas of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>fields of waving grain, pastural scenes of dairy cattle on the hillside and the rustic ambiance of the pond and wetlands area in the meadows, they sometimes belatedly discover that the plow precedes the grain, manure accompanies the cattle, mosquitoes infest the ponds, and the products of the fields and animal husbandry must go to market. Since the advent of zoning, the conflicts between rural reality and suburban expectations have been refereed by zoning administrators who, all too often, have found themselves in the unenviable position of reconciling the irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The zoning law has attempted to serve as a mechanism for the resolution of these conflicts and to provide for an orderly process that recognizes the inevitable transition, while at the same time preserving and permitting the continuation of long-standing practices and customs. The relevant body of law governing this transition is the law of nonconforming, primary, accessory, and incidental uses. When the principles of this body of law are properly understood and applied by zoning administrators and ultimately by trial courts, the transition process is successfully managed. In this case, the trial judge clearly understood the process and correctly applied the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The dispute arises from the use of a 2.022 acre parcel of land in Carroll County, Maryland, which was zoned \u201c \u2018A\u2019 Agricultural District.\u201d Since 1923, a bulk milk delivery, distribution and trucking business has been operating from the site serving the farming community.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Milk, unlike some agricultural products, is produced (harvested) every day. It is picked up by truckers who serve individual farms and collect their milk for transport to the dairies where it is processed. There is no respite from collection, because the cows take none from their production, and the product is perishable. In modern times this truck collection and delivery system is almost as important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>as the cow.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">With the advent of zoning in Carroll County in 1965, the appellee\u2019s milk trucking and distribution business became a nonconforming use. As such, it was then, and is now, a lawful use. The business involves the operation of between 30 and 35 trucks per day from its site, all of which must be mechanically serviced on a regular basis. As new trucks are purchased, old trucks are retired. In order to facilitate maintenance, the decommissioned vehicles are stored <em>on </em>the site as a source of parts for the operable trucks. This cannibalization and repair program occurs incrementally, and results in the storage of parts as well as vehicles. To the casual passerby, perhaps to neighboring residents in search of rustic scenes to match their expectations, and occasionally to some zoning administrators, these vehicles and parts, or some of them, appear to be junk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The Carroll County ordinance attempts to regulate junkyards. In 1988, the zoning office, and ultimately the Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d), declared that the site was not a nonconforming junkyard because it had not registered and thus had not been \u201ccertified\u201d as one under the ordinance. In essence, the zoning authorities were attempting to order the cessation or reduction of use of the outside portions of the property. There was no evidence which indicated that, at the time in question, greater use was being made of the property for storage, etc., than had previously been made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The Board upheld the administrator\u2019s decision. Appellee appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the circuit court, where it was heard by Judge Burns. In a short but well-reasoned memorandum opinion, he cut to the heart of the matter and reversed the Board. The County Commissioners of Carroll County appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Judge Burns stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">As all parties know this family-owned business has a long history in Carroll County and it is undisputed that it is a lawful non-conforming use within this zone. Prior to 1987/1988 Appellant\u2019s storage of these vehicles in question, incidental to the business, was not seen as a \u201cjunkyard\u201d under the Zoning Ordinance. We cannot condone changing the standard now and considering this incidental use of the otherwise valid business (non-conforming use) a \u201cjunkyard\u201d when there is no substantial evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>support said determination. Therefore, the Board\u2019s decision is not \u201cfairly debatable\u201d and cannot be affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">We are persuaded by the case law cited by Appellant\u2019s counsel, specifically <em>Atkins v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>[53 N.C.App. 723] 281 S.E.2d 756, (N.Car.1981). Additionally, we note that this has always been an incidental part of this business. That such storage now becomes a violation creating a \u201cjunkyard,\u201d is a new interpretation by the County____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Because we agree with the trial judge, we will not address estoppel, nor discuss <em>Permanent Financial Corp. v. Montgomery Co., </em>308 Md. 239, 518 A.2d 123 (1986), cited by the parties. The Zoning Administrator\u2019s apparent strategy was to redefine the nonconforming milk distribution business as a junkyard, and then to terminate it, when in fact he had no administrative power to terminate the <em>milk distribution business </em>nor any proper incidental use of that business. Judge Burns saw beyond the junkyard label and correctly identified Zent\u2019s truck maintenance operation as a use incidental to the primary use authorized by the legal nonconforming use possessed by Zent.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The appellant raises two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel, where the evidence failed to establish that county officials ever approved the alleged zoning violation or caused the alleged violator to change his position in reliance upon the purported approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">II. Whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion that appellee\u2019s practice of retaining inoperable, obsolete trucks and other items constitutes a junkyard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">For reasons which will become apparent, we shall not address the first question. Appellant\u2019s second question ignores, the trial court\u2019s finding. We will address it only inferentially as we directly confront the real issues stated in appellee\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>I. Did the circuit court correctly determine that the incidental storage of material on appellee\u2019s site in connection with appellee\u2019s admittedly lawful non-conforming use was not a \u201cjunkyard\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">II. Is the incidental storage of material on appellee\u2019s property no more than an accessory use to the lawful non-conforming trucking business and not a principal \u201cjunkyard\u201d use subject to the enforcement sought by appellants?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The Court of Appeals, in discussing zoning ordinances generally, has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">Such ordinances are in derogation of the common law right to so use private property as to realize its highest utility, and while they should be liberally construed to accomplish their plain purpose and intent, <em>they should not be extended by implication </em>to cases not clearly within the scope of the purpose and intent manifest in their language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\"><em>Landay v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>173 Md. 460, 466, 196 A. 293 (1938) (citation omitted, emphasis added). <em>See also Aspen Hill Venture v. Mont.

We said in <em>Lone v. Montgomery Co., </em>85 Md.App. 477, 494-95, 584 A.2d 142 (1990), \u201cZoning is an exercise of the police power and, to be valid, must be in the general public interest for promotion of health, safety or general welfare of the community. It is an exercise of the police power which takes away, for public good, some rights of individuals to use their property as they please while giving them rights to restrict injurious uses of others\u2019 property.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>In <em>Lone, </em>we discussed the concept of nonconforming uses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">An owner of land may establish a \u201clawful nonconforming use\u201d if the evidence conclusively establishes that before and at the time of the adoption of the original zoning ordinance, he was using substantially all of his tract of land in a then-lawful manner for a use which by a later legislative action became nonpermitted. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals of Howard County v. Meyer, </em>207 Md. 389 [114 A.2d 626] (1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>Id. </em>85 Md.App. at 496, 584 A.2d 142. <em>See also McKemy v.

The trial judge discerned this and, in an appropriate exercise of his discretion, corrected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">We discussed the standards for <em>judicial </em>review of zoning decisions in <em>Neuman v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>23 Md.App. 13, 325 A.2d 146 (1974), where we reversed the trial court\u2019s affirmance of a zoning agency.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">The general rule is that the action of a zoning board will not be reversed on appeal if there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record to support the board\u2019s finding. If such evidence does exist in the record, the matter is considered to be \u201cfairly debatable\u201d, and the courts may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>not substitute their judgment for that of the board____ On the other hand, where the action of the board is not supported by substantial evidence the board\u2019s decision cannot be said to be \u201cfairly debatable\u201d. Under those circumstances the board\u2019s finding falls into the category of being arbitrary, capricious and a denial of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 14, 325 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">We must, in order to assess a <em>trial court\u2019s </em>ruling, apply a different test. Judge Bishop, for this Court, restated that test in <em>Alston v. Alston, </em>85 Md.App. 176, 184, 582 A.2d 574 (1990): \u201cWhile the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard applies to the court\u2019s findings of fact, the application of the law to the facts is judged on the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>See also People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. 738, 584 A.2d 1318 (1990). We must thus apply both standards: (1) the fairly debatable standard in assessing the trial court\u2019s findings in respect to the agency decision, and (2) the abuse of discretion standard in respect to the trial court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Due to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the use was incidental to the nonconforming use and thus was not a junkyard, it is necessary to review the law of extension, intensification, and incidental and accessory uses, all in relation to nonconforming uses. We first discuss the difference between extension and intensification.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Extension-Intensification</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The factors to be considered in determining whether an activity is within the scope of a nonconforming use are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">(1) to what extent does the current use of these lots reflect the nature and purpose of the original non-conforming use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">(2) is the current use merely a different manner of utilizing the original non-conforming use or does it constitute a use different in character, nature, and kind;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-12\">(3) does the current use have a substantially different effect upon the neighborhood;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>(4) is the current use a \u201cdrastic enlargement or extension\u201d of the original non-conforming use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><em>McKemy, </em>39 Md.App. at 269-70, 385 A.2d 96 (footnote omitted);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Lone, 85 </em>Md.App. at 496-97, 584 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In <em>Kastendike v. Baltimore Ass\u2019n for Retarded Children, Inc., </em>267 Md. 389, 397, 297 A.2d 745 (1972), the Court was confronted with whether the change in use of a nonconforming facility from treating alcoholics and the elderly, to treating retarded adults, was a zoning violation, and found that it was not. We quoted from <em>Green v. Garrett, </em>192 Md. 52, 63, 63 A.2d 326, <em>aff'd after remand, </em>193 Md. 260, 66 A.2d 412 (1949), a case involving Memorial Stadium:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u201cThe appellants contend that the enlargement of this use to include professional baseball games for a considerable period of a year is not within the exemption, but we cannot so find____ We have never held that the more frequent use of a property for a purpose which does not conform to the ordinary restrictions of the neighborhood is an extension of an infrequent use of the same building for a similar purpose____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-10\"><em>Kastendike, </em>267 Md. at 397, 297 A.2d 745. In <em>Kastendike, </em>we discussed the case of <em>Parr v. Bradyhouse, </em>177 Md. 245, 9 A.2d 751 (1939), which held that a change of use from a \u201cdairy business\u201d to a riding academy was permitted and \u201cthat the change from cows to horses could not affect the right to use the land as a non-conforming use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>267 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>at 398, 297 A.2d 745. <em>See Kent Co. Planning Inspector v. Abel &amp; Abel, </em>246 Md. 395, 405, 228 A.2d 247 (1967) (property owner may intensify a nonconforming use); <em>Helfrich v. Mongelli, </em>248 Md. 498, 504, 237 A.2d 454 (1968) (\u201cThe changes in Ridgeway Inn, an already nonconforming use, consisted primarily of enclosing the porch. This amounts to no more than a permissible intensification of an existing nonconforming use and hardly amounts to a change that would affect the character of the neighborhood.\u201d) (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">A legal nonconforming junkyard was at issue in <em>Feldstein v. LaVale Zoning Bd., </em>246 Md. 204, 227 A.2d 731 (1967). The yard was being used more frequently than before, and the height of the junk piles had been increased. The applicable statute prohibited the extension of a nonconforming use. The court discussed the difference between an extension and an intensification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">The zoning ordinance ... provides that a nonconforming use shall not be extended, but that does not mean that the vested nonconforming use of the junkyard owner could not be lawfully intensified. The chancellors held that the increase in the quantity and height of the stored scrap metal was an intensification and not an extension under the law. We agree.... While a nonconforming use should not be extended or perpetrated longer than necessary, the more frequent present use of property for the same or a similar use than that for which it had been used less frequently theretofore was held to be an intensification and not an extension....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 211, 227 A.2d 731 (citations omitted). <em>See also Wilson v. Mayor and Comm\u2019rs of the Town of Elkton, </em>35 Md.App. 417, 426, 371 A.2d 443 (1977) (\u201cDistinguished from a prohibited <em>extension </em>of a non-conforming use is what the courts look upon as a mere intensification of the existing lawful use.\u201d) (Emphasis in original.) <em>But see Phillips v. Zoning Commission, </em>225 Md. 102, 110, 169 A.2d 410 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The Court in <em>Jahnigen v. Staley, </em>245 Md. 130, 225 A.2d 277 (1967), was faced with at least two issues: the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>owner\u2019s construction of extensive dockage additions, and a large increase in the number of rental boats, both in a nonconforming marina. While upholding the trial court\u2019s finding that the additional dockage was an invalid extension, the Court held, with respect to the boats, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">[W]e hold that the rental of rowboats can not be so limited. Any increase in the number of rowboats rented would be an intensification of non-conforming use and would not be an extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">We affirm the decree of the chancellor in all respects <em>except </em>that portion thereof which restricted the rental ... to the seven rowboats ... which is modified so as to permit the rental of rowboats which appellants might own and the storage, repair, and maintenance of those rowboats.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 225 A.2d 277 (citations omitted, emphasis added). In <em>Nyburg v. Solmson, </em>205 Md. 150, 161, 106 A.2d 483 (1954), a nonconforming use for the operation of a garage, storing of cars, sale of gasoline was expanded to include storage of <em>new </em>cars prior to shipment to new car distributors. The Court stated: \u201cWe think that ... here there is not an extension but merely an intensification of a long continued non-conforming use.\u201d <em>But see Dampman v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>231 Md. 280, 286, 189 A.2d 631 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Other jurisdictions have expanded upon the intensification theory. In <em>Appeal of Suburban Gen. Hosp., </em>48 Pa. Cmwlth. 273, 410 A.2d 85 (1980), a nonconforming helicopter pad which was incidental to the operation of a hospital was at issue. The precise issue concerned additional paving and lighting of the pad. The Court stated: \u201cOnce we perceive that a nonconforming use exists, \u2018a nonconforming use cannot be limited by a zoning ordinance to the precise magnitude thereof which existed at the date of the ordinance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>410 A.2d at 88 (citation omitted). In <em>Silver v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>435 Pa. 99, 255 A.2d 506 (1969), the court voided a Philadelphia County ordinance which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>prohibited any expansion of a certain nonconforming use and discussed the doctrine of \u201cnatural expansion\u201d applicable in Pennsylvania:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">The doctrine of natural expansion was promulgated by this Court some forty years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">If a person owns property which constitutes a valid non-conforming use, it is inequitable to prevent him from expanding the property as the dictates of business or modernization require.... [W]e must conclude from the tenor of these decisions that the right of natural expansion is a constitutional right protected by the due process clause.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\"><em>Id. </em>255 A.2d at 507 (footnote omitted). <em>But see Appeal of Ferraro, </em>174 Pa.Super. 570, 102 A.2d 186 (1954) (land owner\u2019s request to operate a machine shop on premises, where he had a valid nonconforming use for a delivery business including the repair of delivery trucks, was rejected); <em>Firth v. Scherzberg, </em>366 Pa. 443, 77 A.2d 443 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The business being operated in the case at bar is exactly the same business being operated at the time of the enactment of the ordinance, and it is being operated on the same land. There has been little, if any, measurable increase in the degree or intensity of the operation. The evidence indicates that there had been constant storage of items outside, which were adjunct to the repair phase of the business at issue, prior to the enactment of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">There is little, if any, evidence that there had been an increase in use amounting to an illegal extension. To the extent there was any evidence of an increase in use, that increase would be an intensification. There was thus insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ficient evidence to make the issue fairly debatable. Accordingly, when the trial judge found that the administrator had <em>mistakenly </em>concluded as a <em>matter of law </em>that the incidental use of the property ancillary to the milk distribution business was a junkyard, he was correct. The administrator\u2019s decision was clearly arbitrary and capricious. We further explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Accessory Use</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In general, an accessory use is regarded as \u201ca use which is dependent on or pertains to the principal or main use.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 82 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Zoning and Planning </em>\u00a7 169 (2d ed. 1976) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Kowalski v. Lamar, 25 </em>Md.App. 493, 499, 334 A.2d 536 (1975), we relied on cases from foreign jurisdictions to determine that the use there questioned was not an accessory use. We cited <em>Town of Harvard v. Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 275 N.E.2d 347, 349-50 (1971); <em>Williams v. City of Bloomington, </em>108 Ill.App.2d 307, 247 N.E.2d 446, 449-50 (1969); <em>Samsa v. Heck, </em>13 Ohio App.2d 94, 234 N.E.2d 312, 315-16 (1967); <em>Silver, </em>112 A.2d at 86-87; and <em>City of Warwick v. Campbell, </em>82 R.I. 300, 107 A.2d 334, 336-37 (1954). We cited no Maryland authority. <em>Kowalski </em>has not since been cited by the Maryland appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">While at first glance, our recent case of <em>Co. Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Uhler, </em>78 Md.App. 140, 552 A.2d 942, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 428, 559 A.2d 791 (1989), appears to be similar to the issues now raised by appellant, it is, in fact, quite different from the issues resolved by the trial court. The issue there was whether or not a certification for a junkyard had been obtained. The equipment stored there was found to have been abandoned and was not used in the operation of a conceded legal nonconforming use. In the present case, there is no dispute as to the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the primary nonconforming use.

Generally, a use which is so necessary or commonly to be expected that it cannot be supposed that the ordinance was intended to prevent it will be found to be a customary use.

Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>53 N.C.App. 723, 281 S.E.2d 756 (1981), involved an increase in use by a landowner. The property was being used for the storage and sale of grain, fertilizer and lime, and for seed cleaning. As to those uses, he had a valid nonconforming business. The proprietor delivered the lime throughout Tennessee, and decided that he would also stockpile sand, rocks, and lumber on the site, so as to carry them with him on lime deliveries and sell them along his route. The zoning board had authorized him to store sand and gravel and to transport sand, gravel, and lumber if those products were sold in conjunction with the hauling of grain, lime, and fertilizer. This was allowed to avoid \u201cdeadheading.\u201d The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">Under the Doctrine of Accessory Uses, a landowner is permitted to maintain an accessory or incidental use in connection with a permitted use of land <em>if the accessory use is truly incidental </em>to the primary nonconforming use and does not change the basic nature of the use of property. Given the nature of Rape\u2019s agricultural service business, we are not convinced that the stockpiling or transportation of sand, gravel or lumber is incidental to any use of Rape\u2019s property permitted by the Ordinance.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>Id. </em>281 S.E.2d at 760 (citations omitted, emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">One of the most restrictive definitions of \u201caccessory use\u201d is that found in <em>Lawrence v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of the North Branford, </em>158 Conn. 509, 264 A.2d 552 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">The ordinance in question defines an accessory use as one which is subordinate and customarily incidental to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>main building and use on the same lot. The crucial phrase \u201ccustomarily incidental\u201d is typically present in this type of legislation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">The word \u201cincidental\u201d as employed in a definition of \u201caccessory use\u201d incorporates two concepts. It means that the use must not be the primary use of the property but rather one which is subordinate and minor in significance. Indeed, we find the word \u201csubordinate\u201d included in the definition in the ordinance under consideration. But \u201cincidental,\u201d when used to define an accessory use, must also incorporate the concept of reasonable relationship with the primary use. It is not enough that the use be subordinate; it must also be attendant or concomitant. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">The word \u201ccustomarily\u201d is even more difficult to apply. Although it is used in this and many other ordinances as a modifier of \u201cincidental,\u201d it should be applied as a separate and distinct test. Courts have often held that use of the word \u201ccustomarily\u201d places a duty on the board or court to determine whether it is usual to maintain the use in question in connection with the primary use of the land. In examining the use in question, it is not enough to determine that it is incidental in the two meanings of that word as discussed above. The use must be further scrutinized to determine whether it has commonly, habitually and by long practice been established as reasonably associated with the primary use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-9\"><em>Id. </em>264 A.2d at 554 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Addressing the facts in the case at bar and applying any of the definitions or tests we have described from other jurisdictions, including that mentioned in <em>Lawrence, </em>we are compelled to hold that the use described in the case at bar was attendant, concomitant, and customary to the primary use of the property. It was thus incidental to, or accessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>to, the primary nonconforming use. We hold that when a use does not change the basic nature of the primary permitted nonconforming use and is truly incidental to, and supports the nonconforming use, it is an accessory use and, unless expressly prohibited by statute, is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">When Judge Burns opined that \u201cthere is no substantial evidence to support\u201d a determination that the use of the property being complained of, had not predated the ordinance, and was not incidental to a valid nonconforming use, he was correct. There was no dispute that these activities had been occurring prior to the ordinance and that there had been little, if any, intensification since the advent of zoning in the County. Every iota of evidence before the agency, and thus reviewed by the court, supports, and supports only, a finding that the use was clearly incidental and accessory to the legal nonconforming use. Intensification of the use, if any, was clearly appropriate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s administrative actions were therefore arbitrary and capricious. The use at issue was clearly an accessory use and incidental to the operation of the lawfully permitted milk distribution business. No other interpretation of the evidence is logically supportable. We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion. Accordingly, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>With our decision, we do not mean to say that the County cannot, in time, reduce or limit this, or any other use, provided it does so in a reasonable exercise of the police powers and does so in a manner properly recognizing property rights. <em>See Lone, </em>85 Md.App. 477, 584 A.2d 142. As we indicated in <em>Lone, </em>and as Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have stated in a line of cases involving billboards (and even in junkyard cases), there are appropriate methods for eliminating nonconforming uses,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but terminating nonconforming property rights by bureaucratic redefinition is not one of them. This type of decision, fraught as it is with the emerging conflicts between the vanishing agricultural character of the County and its emerging suburban character, is a policy-making decision best made in an arena permitting full public debate by policy-makers \u2014 the elected representatives \u2014 not by the professional planners and zoners who <em>only </em>apply that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">As we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the uses were incidental (and accessory) to a primary legal nonconforming use, we do not address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\">.
