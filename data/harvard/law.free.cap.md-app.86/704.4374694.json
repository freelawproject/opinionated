Allstate now appeals to us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>from an order of the Circuit Court for Carroll County in which the court entered judgment against Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\n<em>Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In 1984, Jeffrey Lee Geiwitz bought a \u201cskeleton\u201d car \u2014 a 1970 Chevrolet Nova \u2014 for restoration. The seller delivered the car to Geiwitz, after which time Geiwitz never drove the car but proceeded to restore it for show purposes. For six months, Geiwitz kept the car at his parents\u2019 residence while he disassembled it. He subsequently loaded the car onto a trailer and took it to a Hampstead Amoco station to have body work and painting done. When the work was completed in late December 1985 or early 1986, the station owner transported the car via trailer to David and Patricia Cecil\u2019s (appellees) residence. Geiwitz completed his restoration work on the car in January 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Geiwitz then improperly obtained Maryland license tags for the car by giving the Motor Vehicle Administration the tag number and body number of his 1973 Datsun, which he regularly drove and which was validly insured. Geiwitz purportedly obtained the tags for show purposes, <em>i.e., </em>to enter the Nova into a street car class competition. In February 1986, Geiwitz showed the car at the \u201cWorld of Wheels\u201d in the Baltimore Convention Center. Geiwitz transported the car to the Convention Center via a truck-pulled trailer. In his deposition, Geiwitz testified that he did not drive the car to the Convention Center \u201c[bjecause it\u2019s not, the car is not that, it\u2019s just for show. It wasn\u2019t made for driving.\u201d Geiwitz continued to store the car in the Cecils\u2019 driveway where he worked on it from time to time. Geiwitz did general maintenance and \u201clittle things that needed to be fixed,\u201d including tuning and cleaning the engine, changing the clutch, changing the oil and the oil filter. He worked on the car in the Cecils\u2019 garage three'\u2019or four times prior to the incident at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">On the evening of March 8, 1986, Geiwitz drove the car into the Cecils\u2019 garage to fix the gas gauge. He brought a kerosene heater from the Cecils\u2019 basement into the garage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>lit the heater, and positioned it in the middle of the floor\u2014 about ten feet away from the car. Geiwitz drained the gasoline from the car\u2019s gas tank into a bucket, which overflowed. When he noticed the gas flowing toward the kerosene heater, Geiwitz went to move the heater, at which point the gas ignited. The fire destroyed Geiwitz\u2019s car and extensively damaged the Cecils\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, appellee, paid the Cecils, its insureds, $124,841.85 for their property damage from the fire. State Farm then filed a tort action against Geiwitz in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, seeking subrogation. Because Geiwitz resided in his parents\u2019 household, he was an insured person under their homeowner\u2019s policy. Specifically, Geiwitz was covered under a Deluxe Homeowner\u2019s Insurance Policy, No. 018413396, issued by Allstate Insurance Company. The policy, however, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">5. We do not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy, renting, loaning, entrusting, loading or unloading of any motorized land vehicle or trailer. However, this exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">a) a motorized land vehicle in dead storage or used exclusively on an insured premises....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Consequently, Allstate filed a declaratory judgment action on the grounds that the homeowner\u2019s policy did not cover the subject loss due to the \u201cautomobile exclusion\u201d provision. Both State Farm and Allstate filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After oral argument on the motions, the court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. Allstate appeals to us from that ruling and asks whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">I. The trial court erred when it held that the subject vehicle was in \u201cdead storage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">II. The trial court erred when it ruled that the homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage because the subject vehicle was not used on public highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Allstate contends that the trial court erred when it held that the subject vehicle was in \u201cdead storage.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It submits that in interpreting an insurance contract, a court must give words their \u201ccustomary and normal meaning.\u201d On this basis, Allstate argues that \u201cdead\u201d in this context means \u201ctotally inoperable, incapable of any function whatever,\u201d while \u201cstorage\u201d means that which is put \u201cbeyond use, beyond any handling or dealing with them in the ordinary course of things.\u201d Thus, reasons Allstate, Geiwitz\u2019s car was not \u201cin dead storage\u201d within the meaning of the policy because the car \u201cwas fully operable, was in fact driven from place to place, was being used as an automobile and was regularly repaired and maintained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>802 Md. 383, 388-89, 488 A.2d 486 (1985), the Court of Appeals set forth the principles of insurance contract construction in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">An insurance contract, like any other contract, is measured by its terms unless a statute, a regulation or public policy is violated thereby. To determine the intention of the parties to the insurance contract, which is the point of the whole analysis, we construe the instrument as a whole. Maryland courts should examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-7\"><em>Id. </em>In so doing, \u201cwe accord a word its usual, ordinary and accepted meaning <em>unless </em>there is evidence that the parties intended to employ it in a special or technical sense.\u201d <em>Cheney v. Bell National Life Ins. Co., </em>315 Md. 761, 766, 556 A.2d 1135 (1989) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\u201cCourts may construe unambiguous contracts as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Pacific Indemnity, </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d 486. \u201cThat a term cannot be precisely defined so as to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>clear its application in all varying factual situations does not mean that it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496, 229 A.2d 70 (1967). The parties concede that the term \u201cdead storage\u201d is not ambiguous as used in the homeowner\u2019s policy. We agree. Further, even if we concluded that the term was ambiguous, we still could determine the proper construction of the policy because there is no factual dispute in the evidence. <em>Pacific Indemnity, </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Lay dictionaries, such as Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, do not define the term \u201cdead storage.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, however, defines the term as follows: \u201cThe storage, especially of automobiles in public garages, where automobiles not in use are to remain uninterruptedly for a time, sometimes for the season.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 359 (5th ed. 1979). The definition originated in <em>Hogan v. O\u2019Brien, </em>123 Misc. 865, 206 N.Y.S. 831, 832, <em>aff'd, </em>212 A.D. 193, 208 N.Y.S. 477 (1924), in which the court addressed the extent of a garage keeper\u2019s responsibility for cars placed in his garage for storage. The court in that case also distinguished \u201cdead\u201d from \u201clive\u201d storage, defining the latter as \u201cthe storage of cars in active daily use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although not directly on point, the <em>Hogan </em>court\u2019s definitions of dead and live storage indicate that the term \u201cdead storage\u201d cannot be defined by simply separating the two words and then combining the common meaning of each. Instead, we think that the term \u201cdead storage,\u201d as it appears in insurance policies, is employed in a technical sense or as a term of art and should be interpreted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Maryland courts have not yet addressed the issue of when a car is in dead storage for purposes of coverage under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. Other courts that have addressed the issue have resolved it based on the facts of each individual case. <em>See </em>Annotation, Liability Insurance: When is Vehicle in \u201cDead Storage,\u201d 48 A.L.R.4th 591 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Usually, the issue of whether a vehicle is in dead storage arises from similar fact patterns. An insured owns a vehicle for <em>transportation </em>purposes. For some reason, usually because the vehicle is inoperable, the insured has not used the vehicle, <em>i.e., </em>driven the vehicle on the public roads or elsewhere, for a period of time. Whether the vehicle is registered or insured varies. Often, an incident that results in bodily injury or property damage will occur from the insured\u2019s \u201cmaintenance\u201d of the vehicle, <em>i.e., </em>from the insured\u2019s attempts to make the vehicle operational again. On these facts, a majority of courts have held that a vehicle undergoing maintenance cannot also be in dead storage because the terms are mutually exclusive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Broadway v. Great Am. Ins. Co., Inc., </em>465 So.2d 1124 (Ala.1985) (car stored in shed for one month before insured repaired it was undergoing maintenance, and therefore was not in dead storage, when gasoline used to prime carburetor ignited and burned bystander); <em>Holliman v. MFA Mutual Ins. Co., </em>289 Ark. 276, 711 S.W.2d 159 (1986) (disabled car that owner never insured, licensed, or registered, but drove on public roads, was undergoing maintenance, and therefore was not in dead storage, when gasoline used to prime carburetor ignited and burned bystander after car had sat in shed for two months); <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. Allaire, 25 </em>Mass.App.Ct. 159, 516 N.E.2d 179 (1987) (car was undergoing maintenance, and therefore was not in dead storage, when it lurched forward during an engine tune-up and struck a bystander even though owner had cancelled insurance and registration and taken car off the road, although he intended to re-register and re-insure it sometime later that year); <em>North Star Mutual Ins. Co. v. Carlson, 442 </em>N.W.2d 848 (Minn.Ct.App.1989) (vehicle without battery in it that had not been driven or otherwise moved for over four years and was overgrown with weeds and hay, but which owners intended to sell at auction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>transportation, was undergoing maintenance, and therefore was not in dead storage, when the can of gasoline used to prime the carburetor burst into flames and burned a bystander after the owner threw the burning can).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">One court, however, has held that a car <em>can </em>undergo maintenance and still be in dead storage. In <em>Beale v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>No. 67 (Tenn.Ct.App. Apr. 8, 1985) (LEXIS, State Library, Tennessee file), a car owner stored his car in a carport for several months after the car became disabled. The owner later attempted to start the car, intending to move it to his parents\u2019 home. While charging the battery, the owner caused gasoline to spill underneath the car when he tried to repair a crimp in the fuel line. A spark from the battery charger ignited the gasoline, resulting in a fire that caused extensive property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The Tennessee Court of Appeals noted that under the language of the policy, \u201ceven though someone is performing maintenance on the car, if it is in dead storage, insurance coverage is not precluded.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the only question before the court was whether the car was in dead storage when the incident occurred. The court concluded that it was in dead storage for several reasons: (1) the car had been inoperable for several months, (2) the car did not have a current city sticker, and (3) the owner used another vehicle for transportation. The court also noted that even if the owner successfully had moved the car from the carport to his parents\u2019 residence, \u201cthe simple movement of the vehicle did not affect its status.\u201d That is, the mere fact that the owner moved the car from one storage site to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>another did not take the car out of dead storage within the meaning of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The primary difference between these cases and the case <em>sub judice </em>is the fact that Geiwitz kept the car as a collectable, <em>not </em>as a means of transportation. The language of the homeowner\u2019s policy itself suggests that the purpose of the exclusionary clause was to disallow coverage specifically for vehicles used for transportation on public roads.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">5. We do not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy, renting, loaning, entrusting, loading or unloading of any motorized land vehicle or trailer. However, this exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuV\">a) a motorized land vehicle in dead storage <em>or used exclusively on an insured </em>premises----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">(emphasis added). Vehicles used for transportation on public roads necessarily would have to be insured under an automobile insurance policy. The automobile policy, then, would cover any bodily injury or property damage that arose from vehicle-related incidents. Because Geiwitz did not use the car for transportation purposes, there was no reason for him to purchase an automobile insurance policy. We think that under these circumstances, he reasonably could have believed that the homeowner\u2019s policy would cover any bodily injury or property damage from a vehicle that was kept as a collectable item rather than a means of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Factually, this case is most similar to <em>Sharpe v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>558 F.Supp. 10 (E.D.Tenn.1982). In <em>Sharpe, </em>the insured owned a collection of eight old motor vehicles that he housed in a garage on his property. These vehicles were unlicensed and never driven on public roads, although the insured occasionally \u201cstarted the engines and drove the cars around the yard.\u201d When a fire destroyed the vehicles and the garage, the insurer claimed that the policy excluded coverage on the motor vehicles. The appellate court upheld a jury\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the vehicles were in dead storage at the time of the fire and, therefore, not subject to the exclusion. Thus, the fact that the cars were operable and that the insured sometimes drove them on his property did not change the status of the cars for purposes of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Like the insured in <em>Sharpe, </em>Geiwitz kept the car as a collectable item, <em>not </em>as a means of transportation. That the car was operable, that Geiwitz occasionally moved it from one part of the Cecils\u2019 property to their garage to work on it, that he imprudently and improperly obtained license tags for it, or that he was attempting to repair the gas gauge when the accident occurred did not change the status of the car as one in dead storage for purposes of coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy. Had Allstate wished, it could have incorporated into the policy the very restrictions on the meaning of \u201cdead storage\u201d that it now asks us to find implied in the language that it actually used, <em>see Allstate v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 497-98, 229 A.2d 70 (1967); it chose not to do so. We hold that Geiwitz kept the car in dead storage on the Cecils\u2019 property within the meaning of that term as the parties used it in the homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In its brief, Allstate noted that the trial court concluded that the car was in dead storage based on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">1) the subject vehicle was used as a showpiece and not as a means of transportation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">2) the vehicle was operable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">3) while owned by Defendant, the vehicle was operated only off of the public roadways and only for loading and unloading it from a trailer or for positioning the vehicle on a private driveway, in a garage or in a showplace;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">4) the vehicle was repaired and maintained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">5) the vehicle was registered and licensed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>6) the vehicle was not insured for use on the highway</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Allstate contends that under its definition of dead storage, findings 2, 4, and 5 cannot support the court\u2019s holding that the vehicle was in dead storage. Thus, it argues that the court relied solely on the fact that Geiwitz did not use the vehicle for transportation on public roadways as the basis for its conclusion, thereby \u201cindulging in the forbidden practice of rewriting the subject insurance policy.\u201d Because we already have explained why we do not agree with Allstate\u2019s definition of dead storage, we need not address this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\">. <em>See </em>section II <em>infra </em>for those facts from which the circuit court concluded that the car was in dead storage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-5\">. It is important to note that the provisions of the policies in these cases are not always the same, and are different than those at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">. The provision states that \" \u2018[t]his policy does not apply ... to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of ... any motor vehicle.\u201d The policy, however, further stated that the exclusion \u201c \u2018does not apply to bodily injury or property damage occurring on the residence premises if the motor vehicle is ... kept in dead storage on the residence premises.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>Beale v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>No. 67 (Tenn.Ct.App. Apr. 8, 1985) (LEXIS, State Library, Tennessee file).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
