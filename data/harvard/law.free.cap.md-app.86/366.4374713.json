Nevertheless, the court reversed the Secretary\u2019s Order and remanded the case for a hearing regarding the acceptance and effect of an <em>ex parte </em>communication. Appellant contends that the Secretary of Personnel lacked jurisdiction to reverse the decision of her designee and therefore the trial court abused its discretion in remanding the case for further proceedings instead of merely revising the Secretary\u2019s decision and reinstating that of the designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Perceiving no reversible error, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">On 6 June 1988, appellant, who had been employed as a Direct Care Worker IV at The Rosewood Hospital Center<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> since 9 May 1984, was accused of physically abusing a patient. Charges for removal of appellant from his position were filed on 10 June 1988. A disciplinary hearing was held on 3 March 1989 before a hearing officer, Mary Shock, at the Department of Personnel. Both appellant and Rosewood were represented by counsel at that hearing. On 25 May 1989, the hearing officer, having found that appellant had slapped a patient\u2019s hands, issued a Proposal for Decision wherein she recommended that the charges for removal be dismissed, that appellant be suspended without pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>for ten days beginning 6 June 1988, and that he be reinstated with back pay except for the period of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Appellees, The Rosewood Hospital Center and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, filed timely exceptions to the proposal, and on 12 July 1989 an exceptions hearing was held before Ms. Jeanne M. Zarnoch, to whom the Secretary had delegated all authority to approve proposals for decisions in various cases. On 19 July 1989, Ms. Zarnoch issued an Order of the Secretary, in which she adopted the hearing officer\u2019s proposal and ordered that appellant be reinstated. Appellees did not appeal this order to the circuit court. On 24 July 1989, however, Ms. Zarnoch issued a stay of her order after receiving a letter, dated 11 July 1989, from Dr. Allan M. Radinsky, Facility Director of The Rosewood Hospital Center, in which he objected to the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the abuse inflicted by appellant was not sufficiently serious to warrant his dismissal and requested that the Proposal for Decision be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Ms. Zarnoch received the letter on 21 July 1989 and treated it as a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations 06.01.03.20 (1989). After issuing the stay, Ms. Zarnoch informed appellant of her decision and provided him with a copy of the letter and a period of 15 days in which to respond to the arguments raised therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Appellant objected to the stay of the 19 July 1989 Order and requested a hearing regarding the acceptance and effect of the letter, which he argued was an improper <em>ex parte </em>communication. No hearing was held regarding the letter, however, and Ms. Zarnoch refused to rescind her stay. Thereafter, by a letter dated 27 July 1989, appellant addressed the issues raised by Dr. Radinsky and reiterated his opposition to any reconsideration of the 19 July Order. A final Order was issued by the Secretary of Personnel, Hilda E. Ford, on 14 August 1989, wherein she rejected the 25 May Proposal for Decision, overruled the 19 July order of Ms. Zarnoch, terminated appellant from his position as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Direct Care Worker, and barred him from future employment with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene until June 1991. After his subsequent requests for reconsideration were denied, appellant filed an appeal with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, pursuant to Md. Rule B2, in which he argued that Secretary Ford had no jurisdiction to issue the Order of 14 August and that Dr. Radinsky\u2019s letter was an improper <em>ex parte </em>communication that should not have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">On 11 April 1990, the circuit court held that the Secretary retained final approval authority over her designee\u2019s Decision and Order; however, the court further found that the Secretary had violated various procedural requirements in exercising her retained authority by considering Dr. Radinsky\u2019s letter without granting appellant\u2019s request for a hearing. The court agreed with appellant that the 11 July letter constituted an <em>ex parte </em>communication in violation of Md. Code (1984), State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 10-213(a), since it was sent too late to be considered either as a motion for reconsideration or a memorandum agreement under the applicable regulations. Therefore, the trial court reversed the Order of 14 August 1989 and remanded the case for a hearing concerning the acceptance and effect of the 11 July letter from Dr. Radinsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding that the Secretary of Personnel retained approval authority over the Order and Decision of her designee, Ms. Zarnoch. Specifically, he argues that the Secretary divested herself of all such authority by virtue of a Notice of Delegation of Authority, dated 1 March 1987, which was published in the <em>Maryland Register </em>on 10 April 1987, pursuant to Md.Code Ann., art. 64A, \u00a7 36A(e). In the Notice of Delegation, the Secretary delegated to Ms. Zarnoch \u201call authority to approve proposals for decisions in\u201d various cases including \u201cappeals of charges for removal\u201d in accordance with CO-MAR 06.01.01.47. Appellees contended, and the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>agreed, that despite the Delegation of Authority, the Secretary retained the authority to review and revise the orders of her designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Md.Code Ann., art. 64A, \u00a7 33 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">(b) (2)(i) No employee who has completed his probation may be permanently removed from the classified service except for cause, upon written charges and after an opportunity to be heard in his own defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">(ii) Such charges may be filed by the appointing authority or by any citizen, provided, however, that no such charges may be filed by a citizen, without the consent of the appointing authority or of the Secretary, and such charge shall within ninety days after filing, be heard, investigated and determined by the Secretary or by some person or board appointed by the Secretary to hear, investigate and determine the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">(iii) The Secretary of Personnel shall render his decision within 45 days after a hearing is held before him or his authorized representative or within 45 days after all legal memoranda or briefs have been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">(c) <em>Decision of Secretary final. </em>\u2014 The finding and decision of the Secretary or of such person or board when approved by the Secretary shall be final, and shall be certified to the appointing authority and shall be forthwith enforced by such authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In finding that the Secretary did not divest herself of all authority over the orders of her designee, the trial court relied upon <em>Comptroller v. Myers, </em>59 Md.App. 118, 128, 474 A.2d 941 (1984), in which we held that the Secretary of Personnel was not authorized to delegate the responsibility for final approval of decisions regarding the removal of classified employees, and was <em>required </em>to approve any removal decision before it became final. Finding that <em>Myers </em>was dispositive of the issue, the circuit court held that the Secretary \u201cwas required to finally approve her designee\u2019s Order\u201d and that therefore, she retained the authority to revise the order before granting her approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Shortly after we decided <em>Myers, </em>however, the General Assembly amended art. 64A and enacted \u00a7 36A, which specifically authorizes the Secretary to delegate her approval authority. Section 36A, entitled \u201cDelegation of Authority by Secretary,\u201d provides in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">(c) <em>Approval of certain proposed decisions. </em>In cases requiring the Secretary\u2019s approval or consent, the Secretary may designate either the Deputy Secretary, an assistant secretary, or another official whose duties and responsibilities are unrelated to the hearing process to approve proposed decisions of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">(3) Proposed decisions of removal cases under \u00a7 33 of this article or Article 29, \u00a7 ll-109(b) of the Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">(e) <em>Notice. </em>\u2014 When the Secretary designates authority under this section, the Secretary shall within 30 days of the designation, publish notice of the designation in the Maryland Register. (1985, ch. 573; 1986, ch. 429.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Secretary complied with the requirements of \u00a7 36A when she published the following Notice in the 10 April 1987 issue of the <em>Maryland Register:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At60\">Subject: Notice of Delegation of Authority</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9b\">Add\u2019l Info Effective March 1, 1987: I, Hilda E. Ford, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Secretary of Personnel by Article 64A, \u00a7 36A, Annotated Code of Maryland, hereby delegate to Jeanne M. Zarnoch, Personnel Administrator, all authority to approve proposals for decision in the following types of cases under COMAR 06.01.01 State Employees Personnel Regulations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">A. An appeal of charges for removal in accordance with Regulation .47; B. An appeal of a rejection on probation in accordance with Regulation .37F; C. An appeal of a demotion in accordance with Regulation .41;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>D. An appeal of a report of unsatisfactory work or conduct in accordance with Regulation .64; E. An appeal of a disciplinary suspension in accordance with Regulation .46; F. An appeal of a suspension without pay pending the filing of charges for removal in accordance with Regulation .65; and G. An appeal of a recommendation of outside arbitrators under Regulation .56C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">By virtue of \u00a7 36A, the Secretary clearly had the discretionary authority to delegate final approval authority for removal decisions to Ms. Zarnoch. That conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. We must now determine if the circuit court reached the correct result, that the Secretary had the authority to review and revise Ms. Zarnoch\u2019s order, albeit for the wrong reason. \u201c[W]here the record in a case adequately demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was correct, although on a ground not relied upon by the trial court and perhaps not even raised by the parties, an appellate court will affirm.\u201d <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1021, 100 S.Ct. 680, 62 L.Ed.2d 654 (1980). <em>See also Burwell v. Easton Memorial Hosp., </em>83 Md.App. 684, 691, 577 A.2d 394 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Section 36A was enacted to provide the Secretary of Personnel with the discretion to delegate certain authority in order to enhance the overall efficiency of the Department. The preamble to \u00a7 36A provides that the section was enacted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">FOR the purpose of authorizing the Secretary of Personnel to designate a representative to hear and <em>issue final decisions in certain cases; authorizing the Secretary of Personnel to designate a representative to hear and </em>decide certain cases; providing for designation of certain officials in the Department of Personnel to approve certain decisions; <em>requiring the Secretary of Personnel to publish within a certain time notice of certain designations of authority; </em>and generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>relating to the hearing and approval process for certain cases in the Department of Personnel. (1985, ch. 573.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Nothing in the above language, or in any of the cases interpreting \u00a7 36A, suggests that the Legislature intended to render a delegation of authority by the Secretary irrevocable. To the contrary, the power to delegate approval authority over various proposals must include implicitly the right to revoke that delegation and overrule a designee\u2019s decision when that decision is inconsistent with the policies of the Secretary. When that implicit right is not exercised, the decision of the designee is, by virtue of the delegation of authority, the final decision of the Department. Absent any clear statement of legislative intent to render all delegations of authority irrevocable, the Secretary must retain the authority to intervene in cases in which the proposed decision is inconsistent with the policies or goals of the Department, since it is the Secretary who must ultimately bear the responsibility for the decisions of her subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We hold, therefore, that by delegating her approval authority the Secretary essentially authorized Ms. Zarnoch to speak for her, as her agent, in cases involving, <em>inter alia, </em>charges for removal. In so doing, the Secretary did not surrender her right, indeed her obligation, to intervene and speak for herself when she disagrees with the judgment of her subordinate. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s decision recognizing the Secretary\u2019s authority to intervene was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in remanding the case to the Department of Personnel for further proceedings. He asserts that the Secretary has never intervened in a prior removal case and that, therefore, her intervention in the case <em>sub judice </em>was an unexplained deviation from established procedure. Consequently, appellant argues that the Secretary\u2019s order should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>been stricken and the original order of 19 July 1989 reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Relying upon <em>Montgomery County v. Anastasi, </em>77 Md. App. 126, 549 A.2d 753 (1988), appellant contends that the Secretary\u2019s intervention was an arbitrary and capricious act. His argument in this regard fails for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the record is devoid of any evidence concerning the frequency, or, for that matter, infrequency, with which the Secretary has overruled the decisions of Ms. Zarnoch. Moreover, even if appellant\u2019s claim were well established by evidence in the record, his reliance on <em>Anastasi </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In <em>Anastasi </em>we held that, by rendering opposite decisions based upon <em>indistinguishable facts </em>without explaining adequately the basis for doing so, the Montgomery County Merit System Protection Board had exercised its authority in an arbitrary manner in violation of Md.Code (1984), State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 10-215(g)(3)(vi). 77 Md.App. at 138-39, 549 A.2d 753. In so holding, we adopted the reasoning of the federal courts; namely, that an agency\u2019s unexplained deviation from prior precedents <em>may </em>constitute an arbitrary and capricious act. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 549 A.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>even if we were to assume that the Secretary has never before intervened in a removal case, appellant does not claim that there have been cases involving similar factual circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>an employee who physically abuses a patient, in which the employee has not been \u201cseparated\u201d or terminated from his position. Assuming that the Secretary has never before reversed a decision of Ms. Zarnoch, that fact, by itself, would be insufficient to support the conclusion that the Secretary\u2019s conduct was arbitrary or capricious and in violation of Md.Code (1984) State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 10-215(g)(3)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">After finding that the 11 July 1989 letter from Dr. Radinsky was an improper <em>ex parte </em>communication in violation of \u00a7 10-213(a), the court determined that the Secretary violated appellant\u2019s due process rights by denying his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>quest for a hearing regarding the acceptance and effect of the letter. Therefore, the court remanded the case to the Department of Personnel for the purpose of conducting such a hearing. Appellant contends, again without the aid of supporting authority, that the court abused its discretion in remanding the case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Md.Code (1984) State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 10-215(g), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">(2) affirm the decision of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision of the agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">(iii) results from an unlawful practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">A decision as to whether to remand, affirm, reverse, or modify a decision of an administrative agency is one that is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. When the agency has committed an error of law, <em>i.e., </em>by considering improperly an <em>ex parte </em>communication as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court should remand the case to the agency for further proceedings designed to remedy the error. <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Bassler, </em>289 Md. 501, 509, 425 A.2d 1003 (1981). <em>See also Temmink v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>205 Md. 489, 497, 109 A.2d 85 (1954); <em>Howard County v. Davidsonville Civic Ass\u2019n, </em>72 Md.App. 19, 50, 527 A.2d 772, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 286, 533 A.2d 1308 (1987); <em>Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>67 Md.App. 693, 712, 509 A.2d 702 (1986). Since the 11 July 1989 letter was not part of the record before Ms. Zarnoch or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Secretary, it could not be used properly as the basis for a final decision. The trial court correctly observed that appellant\u2019s request for a hearing regarding the impact of the letter should have been granted to ensure that the final Order of the Secretary is based only on matters contained in the record. Therefore, the court\u2019s decision to remand the case for the purpose of conducting such a hearing, which is what appellant requested the Secretary to do, was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">.
