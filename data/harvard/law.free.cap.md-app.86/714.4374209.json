(\u201cCottman\u201d), a Pennsylvania corporation, is a franchisor of numerous automotive transmission repair facilities throughout the United States. In 1988, the Attorney General\u2019s Office of the State of Maryland (\u201cState\u201d) filed a four count complaint against Cottman in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Counts 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>through 3, citing the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), Md.Com.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>alleged that Cottman engaged in trade practices which were unfair and deceptive under \u00a7 13-301(1), (3), (7) and (9). In Count 1, the State asserted that Cottman was selling unnecessary transmission inspections to its customers by misleading them into believing that the inspections were required by Cottman to form an estimate of the repair costs. Count 2 alleged that Cottman induced customers to authorize and pay for unnecessary repairs. Count 3 stated that Cottman had charged customers for fictitious repairs. Count 4 alleged that Cottman had violated the Automotive Repair Facilities Act (\u201cARFA\u201d), Md.Com.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 14-1002, and \u00a7 13-301(13)(vi)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the CPA by failing to provide written estimates of parts and labor costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The State filed a Motion for an Interlocutory Injunction pursuant to Md.Com.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 14-406(a), seeking to halt the alleged unfair and deceptive trade practices. At a conference prior to a hearing on the injunction, the trial judge ordered that the case files be sealed. He also closed the courtroom to the public and prevented the State from communicating with the press about the case. After a denial of a Motion to Reconsider the closure order, the State appealed. This Court reversed the closure and limited the order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so as to proscribe only those comments which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>relative to the merits of the case. <em>State v. Cottman Transmission Systems, </em>75 Md.App. 647, 542 A.2d 859 (1988) <em>(\u201cCottman I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The hearing on the State\u2019s Motion for Interlocutory Injunction was then held, and the motion was denied. The trial judge granted an oral motion by Cottman for summary judgment on the issue of agency, ruling that no principal/agent relationship existed between Cottman and its Maryland centers with respect to the recommendation and sale of unnecessary repairs by its franchisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The State appealed. <em>State v. Cottman Transmission Systems, </em>[No. 1430, 1988 Term, per curiam, filed April 26, 1989] (citations omitted) <em>(\u201cCottman II\u201d). </em>In our discussion of the motion for interlocutory injunctive relief, we necessarily dealt with the <em>likelihood </em>of success on the merits, and held that the State had <em>at that stage </em>failed to prove that Cottman\u2019s Maryland shops were agents of the Pennsylvania corporation. Thus, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to issue the requested interlocutory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">After subsequent hearings, the trial judge granted a summary judgment motion by the State regarding Cottman\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> withholding of diagnostic and price information from consumers, ruled that Cottman\u2019s participation constituted a deceptive practice, and enjoined its continuance. In the instant appeal, we shall decide the validity of that summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The entry of summary judgment ultimately resulted in the entry of final judgment for the State as to Count 1, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>final judgment for Cottman as to Counts 2, 3, and 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cottman\u2019s franchisees were not parties, and were held not to be its agents, so they were not ordered to do anything. A $100,000 civil penalty was imposed on Cottman, and a permanent injunction was issued requiring it to \u201cissue new policy directives to its franchises ... directing ... them to no longer withhold from consumers material price and diagnostic information immediately after performance of any road test and external transmission inspection and before the consumer commits to paying for an internal transmission inspection____\u201d The judge denied the State\u2019s motion for restitution to the consumers involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The State presents these questions on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">I. Is restitution under the Consumer Protection Act only available to consumers who received no goods or services after being deceived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">II. Did the lower court err in failing to order the disclosure of material price information, the omission of which would tend to deceive consumers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">III. Did the lower court err in determining on summary judgment that Cottman is not responsible for its centers\u2019 sale of unnecessary transmission repairs, despite evidence that Cottman\u2019s centers are required to follow all directives Cottman issues concerning both overall policies and day-to-day operations, that Cottman hires and fires center personnel, that Cottman encourages the sale of unnecessary repairs, and that Cottman requires the use of procedures that result in the sale of unnecessary repairs? [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">In its conclusion, the State clarifies its requested relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">[T]he lower court\u2019s denial of restitution [should] be reversed and remanded for any necessary proceedings to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>provide consumers with the restitution contemplated by the Consumer Protection Act, that the lower court\u2019s refusal to order Cottman to disclose the maximum price [of transmission repairs] be reversed and remanded for entry of an order requiring such a disclosure, and that the Order ... granting judgment to Cottman on Counts II, III, and IV be reversed and that the case be remanded for a jury trial on those counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Cottman filed a cross appeal, asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">1. Whether the circuit court erred in interpreting the general Consumer Protection Act to add a requirement to the more specific Automotive Repair Facilities Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">2. Whether the court impermissibly amended the Automotive Repair Facilities Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">3. Whether the court erred in holding that the \u201cRCI\u201d method is a deceptive practice under the Consumer Protection Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">4. Whether the court erred in failing to assess the alternatives before finding that the RCI method was deceptive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">5. Whether the court erred in failing to require the State to proceed by rulemaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">6. Whether the court erred by imposing penalties vicariously on Cottman for the acts of its non-agent licensees.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">This multiplicity of questions may be reduced to three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>1) the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment on each of the four counts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">2) whether the trial judge erred in interpreting the CPA and ARFA to allow</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">a) the imposition of civil penalties, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azg\">b) issuance of a permanent injunction requiring Cottman to direct its franchisees to provide consumers with price and diagnostic information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">3) whether the.trial judge erred in refusing to grant restitution to consumers under Count 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">We shall address these three issues as is necessary within our discussion of summary judgment with respect to the individual counts, and discuss the other issues as we deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"AoK6\">In <em>Lone v. Montgomery Co., </em>85 Md.App. 477, 503-04, 584 A.2d 142 (1991), this Court discussed the appellate standard of review of summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must first determine whether a dispute of material fact exists. <em>Arnold Developer, Inc. v. Collins, </em>318 Md. 259, 262 [567 A.2d 949] (1990). \u201cA material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261 [567 A.2d 949] (quoting <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111 [492 A.2d 608] (1985)). Where the facts are susceptible to more than one permissible inference, the choice between inferences should be made by the trier of fact, and should not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>285 Md. 216 [401 A.2d 1013] (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>291 Md. 241 [434 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>A.2d 564] (1981); <em>Miller v. Nissen Corp., </em>83 Md.App. 448, 458 [575 A.2d 758] (1990); <em>Barb v. Wallace, </em>45 Md.App. 271 [412 A.2d 1314] (1980). When a determination is made as to whether a factual dispute exists, all inferences must be resolved against the moving party, even if the underlying facts are disputed. <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302 [413 A.2d 170] (1980); <em>Maloney v. Carling Nat\u2019l Breweries, Inc., </em>52 Md.App. 556 [451 A.2d 343] (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">COUNT 1</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The judge made certain rulings with respect to this count. We list them as we shall hereafter address them. He (A) entered summary judgment for the State concerning the issue of Cottman\u2019s deceptive business practices, finding Cottman in violation of the CPA for its policy of requiring its franchisees to conceal material information from consumers; (B) granted an injunction; and (C) assessed a civil penalty; (D) ruled that, as a matter of law, there was no agency relationship between Cottman and its franchisees; and (E) denied the State\u2019s request for restitution to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Deceptive Business Practices</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The CPA defines a deceptive trade practice in this context as either a \u201c[f]ailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends to deceive,\u201d Md.Com.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 13-301(3) (1990); or \u201c[djeception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation, or knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the same in connection with,\u201d \u00a7 13-301(9); or as a violation of the ARFA, \u00a7 13-301(14)(vi). An omission is considered material if a significant number of unsophisticated consumers of the goods or services would attach importance to the information in deciding on a course of action. <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 10, 517 A.2d 328 (1986). <em>See also Charles of the Ritz Distributors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>143 F.2d 676, 679-80 (2d Cir.1944). We think that a material fact, in the context of the case at bar, is one which a reasonable consumer of transmission repairs would consider important when deciding whether to give a mechanic permission to work on his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The trial judge granted partial summary judgment for the State on Count I. He ruled, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">2. Cottman withholds diagnostic and price information from consumers before the consumers commit to an internal transmission inspection (the \u201cRCI\u201d, remove, check and install);[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">3. this diagnostic and price information is material to consumers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">4. the practice of withholding this diagnostic [the type of repairs needed] and price [the cost of the repairs] information is a deceptive practice as that term is defined under Sections 13-301(3) and (9) of the [CPA] and violates Section 13-303 of the [CPA]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">According to the trial court, Cottman\u2019s directive to its franchisees, requiring them to withhold diagnostic information, when that information was known and thus was a material fact, was a deceptive practice by Cottman, independent of whether there was an agency relationship.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>We agree that the diagnostic information is important, because a reasonable consumer would attach importance to learning that an overhaul is needed, prior to committing to an internal inspection which is marketed as necessary to determine that very fact. Omission of this information is a deceptive business practice, because when a transmission repairperson externally inspects a vehicle\u2019s transmission a diagnosis always occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The court asked Cottman\u2019s vice-president, James Corkran:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOE\">Do you know for certain whether or not once you go through the 21 point inspection and it\u2019s test driven and the external examination has been done ... whether or not it, at a minimum, it requires a soft part overhaul?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">THE COURT: You would know that with what I would say is a 99 percent certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">THE COURT: And the customer is not advised of that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">THE WITNESS: Yes[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">THE COURT: The customer is advised that for 200 dollars an RCI can be conducted and the exact price then can be quoted. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">THE WITNESS: Yes, it is[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">We have not located any evidence in the thousands of pages of the record extract which contradicts this testimony. We hold, therefore, that there is no dispute of fact regarding Cottman\u2019s concealment of diagnostic information.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">The price information is likewise important, as even Cottman concedes: \u201cThe problem with overhaul and maximum prices is that consumers attach the <em>wrong importance </em>to that information.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The consequences of consumer acquisition of price information may not be to Cottman\u2019s liking, but that information is unquestionably a material fact. There is no dispute that the minimum and maximum price for an overhaul of any particular transmission may be readily determined. The mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>mum price stems from the cost of the time and materials which always must be expended on any overhaul for that brand (called a \u201csoft parts\u201d overhaul by the parties). The maximum price is the cost of a completely rebuilt or exchanged transmission. The parties also do not dispute the difficulty of determining the exact cost in an intermediate situation, where it is evident from the external inspection that the transmission requires at least a \u201csoft parts\u201d overhaul, and possibly more.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Failure to mention the possible total price, when that price is known to the merchant, <em>under the circumstances of this case, is a deceptive practice. </em>We hold that when a franchisor directs deceptive practices by using its economic and contractual clout to force its franchisees to commit deception, to the extent here exhibited, the franchisor equally commits a deceptive practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Scope of the Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The injunction defined price and diagnostic information as \u201cmaterial to the consumer\u201d and directed that it be disclosed, but did not specify whether it was referring to minimum or maximum prices. Prior to the injunction\u2019s issuance, the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">I did not make a finding that minimum prices had to be quoted. I didn\u2019t make that finding and I definitely didn\u2019t make a finding about maximum prices. The finding or the order regarding minimum prices is only an affirmative injunctive act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">The minimum pricing was only the affirmative act trying to come to some terms with a way to dispose of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZBV\">Given this somewhat ambiguous statement concerning the judge\u2019s intended definition of price, we will interpret it and hold that price information must be given <em>consistent with the diagnosis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The <em>Golt </em>definition of materiality forces the conclusion that the projected cost of repair is of vital concern to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>consumer <em>if the repair is a possibility. </em>For example, if an external inspection results in a diagnosis that a transmission requires a \u201csoft parts\u201d overhaul and <em>possibly </em>a new torque converter, the customer must be told exactly that. The customer must also be informed of the minimum cost which has so far been ascertained; in this example, the cost of a \u201csoft parts\u201d overhaul plus the <em>possible </em>extra cost of replacing the torque converter. Thus, the customer must be given two categories of price information: (1) the cost of repair that is certain to be needed, and (2) the possible cost of repair that is likely to be required. The customer may then make an informed choice as to whether to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Civil Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Cottman contests the assessment of civil penalties against it on the ground that it should not be penalized for the actions of third parties over which it had no control. In support, it points to our conclusion in <em>Cottman II </em>regarding Cottman\u2019s total lack of control. We disagree. The CPA provides that for a first violation, a \u201cmerchant who engages in a violation of this title is subject to a [civil] fine of not more than $1,000 for each violation.\u201d Section 13-410(a). Cottman, not its franchisees, was found to have violated the CPA, and is thus properly subject to penalties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>We have heretofore specifically upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling on the basis that Cottman itself participated in the deceptive practices. Section 13-101(g) defines a merchant as one \u201cwho directly or indirectly either offers or makes available to consumers any consumer goods, consumer services, consumer realty, or consumer credit.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">[T]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention. The language of the statute itself is the primary source of this intent; and the words used are to be given \u201ctheir ordinary and popularly understood meaning, absent a manifest contrary legislative intention.\u201d <em>In re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. [515], 520, 471 A.2d 313 [ (1984) ]. Stated another way, where the language of the statute is free from ambiguity, courts may not disregard the natural import of the words used in order to extend or limit its meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AedX\"><em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744-45, 580 A.2d 188 (1990) (citations omitted). <em>See also D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177 (1990); <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 480, 578 A.2d 761 (1990); <em>Brodsky v. Brodsky, </em>319 Md. 92, 98, 570 A.2d 1235 (1990); <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>319 Md. 597, 603, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990); <em>Davis v. State, </em>319 Md. 56, 60, 570 A.2d 855 (1990); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). The Legislature, by its inclusion of the word \u201cindirectly\u201d in its description of the acts which make one a merchant, strongly indicates that a merchant is not only one who has face to face dealings with consumers, but also one who substantially participates in the process, as Cottman did.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">We also note that the evidence introduced subsequent to our filing of <em>Cottman II </em>belies Cottman\u2019s assertion of lack of control. For example, one of the deponents testified that the operations managers visited the repair shops periodically, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">Their job is to police the operation, to police the shop, to make sure the managers are following the sales tracks [memorized sales pitches], to make sure the managers aren\u2019t giving out prices over the phone, to make sure they are writing up the repair orders, to make sure they are using the forms, check your files, check your cabinets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOo\">There was also testimony to the effect that the operations managers pressured the repair facilities to inflate their estimates so that minor preventive repairs would become major overhauls:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">[Y]ou should never have more PMS\u2019s [preventive maintenance services] than you have major jobs. They also pull out the repair orders and look at what\u2019s written on them and if it\u2019s burnt fluid [discolored transmission fluid], or leaks, or whatever, they feel like those jobs should be major jobs and they tell you that the manager is not converting enough of those jobs into major jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP_\">Cottman did not merely exercise control over peripheral matters such as cleanliness or business hours; its control extended to every facet of the individual repair shop\u2019s <em>dealings with its customers </em>as well as its internal business practices. The operations managers\u2019 review of the records of each repair and their instructions regarding future repairs are inconsistent with Cottman\u2019s averments of total lack of control. For example, the establishment of sales pitches which were to be followed word for word, and quotas for the major and minor categories of transmission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>repairs determine that the repair shop personnel had little discretion in their dealings with the individual customer. The result was a significant level of control over the day-today performance of the work, the manner in which it was to be done, <em>and the way the deception was to be practiced upon the public. </em>As we have indicated, this deception need not be grounded in an agency relationship in order to be prohibited.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">It necessarily follows, and we so hold, that a franchisor who indirectly or directly offers goods, services, realty or credit may be a merchant as defined in the Act. The purposes stated in the Act support this holding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a merchant acting indirectly, it may be held liable for its deceptive practices. When its deceptive practices result in violations, the correct penalty determination would be based on the franchisees\u2019 furtherance of the franchisor\u2019s deceptive practice with respect to individual consumers. Thus, each contact by the franchisees that perpetuates the franchisor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>deception is a prohibited act, for which either merchant may be held accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">As we have indicated, the manner in which the fine was computed has not been attacked on appeal. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s imposition of civil penalties against appellant for <em>its </em>deceptive practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The Agency Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Another summary judgment issue we shall discuss in connection with Count 1 concerns the issue of agency. The State reasons that by virtue of Cottman\u2019s right of control, it is either a master and its franchisees servants, or that it is a principal and its franchisees agents. It argues that Cottman is, therefore, liable for the misrepresentations made by its service centers as either a master or a principal under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, we must determine the legal standards of (1) the principal/agent relationship, and (2) the master/servant relationship, to arrive at a definition of what a material fact is in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">In <em>Sanders v. Rowan, </em>61 Md.App. 40, 484 A.2d 1023 (1984), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>[T]he principal/agent relationship is a generic one \u2014 a genus, of which the master/servant relationship is a species. Thus, while all masters are principals and all servants are agents, there are some principals who are not masters and some agents who are not servants. Agents who are not servants are regarded as independent contractors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><em>Id </em>at 50, 484 A.2d 1023. By definition, therefore, both independent contractors and servants are agents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the present case, we are asked by the State to make a determination as to the repair centers\u2019 status, both as agents and as servants. While we have determined that Cottman is liable independent of agency considerations, we nevertheless address this issue in order that it may be resolved. We must first determine whether there was a dispute of material fact as to agency; if there is, its resolution would be a matter for the trier of fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">There are three elements that are integral to an agency relationship: (1) The agent is subject to the principal\u2019s right of control; (2) the agent has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the principal; and (3) the agent holds a power to alter the legal relations of the principal. <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-14 (1958). In noting that the control element is instrumental in proving the existence of an agency relationship, the <em>Restatement </em>explains that \u201c[i]t is the element of continuous subjection to the will of the principal which distinguishes the ... agency agreement from other agreements.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 1(1) comment b (1957)____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\"><em>Schear v. Motel Management Corp., </em>61 Md.App. 670, 687, 487 A.2d 1240 (1985). When an agency relationship is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sought to be inferred from the parties\u2019 conduct, the party alleging the agency has the burden of proving its existence, nature and extent. <em>Proctor v. Holden, </em>75 Md.App. 1, 20-21, 540 A.2d 133, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 506, 545 A.2d 1343 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The State argues that \u201cthe determination of whether an agency relation exists ... is to be determined by evaluating <em>five </em>(not three) criteria____\u201d (Emphasis in original.) It then lists the right to hire, fire, payment of wages, the right to control, and whether the work is performed as part of the regular business of the principal,' as the required factors. As we have seen, this assertion is incorrect. The first determination of agency is made using the three <em>Schear </em>factors. The five factors urged upon us by the State are indicative of a <em>master-servant </em>relationship, and are only considered after a preliminary determination of agency has <em>already been made. </em>Only then is the inquiry focused on the possible existence of a master/servant relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">One may be an agent of another, owing to his principal the fiduciary obligations of loyalty and general obedience, but at the same time not be sufficiently under the control of the principal to be considered a servant. <em>The relationship of master and servant </em>exists only when the employer has the right to control and direct the servant in the performance of his work and in the manner in which the work is to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">In <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., </em>214 Md. 479, 491, 134 A.2d 296 (1957), this Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">[T]here are at least five <em>criteria </em>that may be considered in determining the question whether the relationship of master and servant exists. These are: (1) the selection and engagement of the servant, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power to discharge, (4) the power to control the servant\u2019s conduct, (5) and whether the work is a part of the regular business of the employer. Standing alone, none of these <em>indicia, </em>ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>cepting (4), seems controlling in the determination as to whether such relationship exists____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\"><em>Chevron, U.S.A. v. Lesch, </em>319 Md. 25, 32-33, 570 A.2d 840 (1990) (emphasis added, citations omitted).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We note first that in <em>Cottman, II, </em>we were concerned with whether the trial judge was wrong in not finding the existence of an agency relationship. In the present appeal, we are concerned with whether any trier of fact could have found the existence of an agency relationship. We are also concerned with whether there was a dispute of a material fact, and if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We shall, therefore, next apply the three <em>Schear </em>factors to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The licensing agreement between Cottman and its franchisees stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">The relationship between COTTMAN and OPERATOR is strictly that of a licensor and licensee and OPERATOR is an independent contractor. This Agreement does not create a joint venture, partnership, or agency and any act or omission of either party shall not bind or obligate the other except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEF\">This contractual disavowal of an agency relationship is borne out by the record. The evidence shows that Cottman received 20V2% of its franchisee\u2019s gross sales, with the franchisees retaining 79V2%. In the record we have reviewed, we have not found any sufficient evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the franchisees had a duty to act primarily for Cottman\u2019s benefit. While there may have been sufficient evidence, as to the other two factors, to generate a jury issue, there was none with respect to the second agency factor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that there is no dispute of material fact regarding the absence of the principal/agent relationship between Cottman and its franchisees. The trial judge was correct in rendering summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The State also made a request, under Count 1, for restitution to the consumers involved in Cottman\u2019s deceptions. The stipulated summary of the hearing reveals that the judge granted Cottman\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on the restitution issue, apparently ruling that as the consumers received an internal transmission inspection for their money, the deception did not harm them.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Section 13-406 (c) provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The court may enter any order of judgment necessary to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHf\">(1) Prevent the use by a person of any prohibited practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>(2) Restore to a person any money or real or personal property acquired from him by means of any prohibited practice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The proper standard here is not whether the customers received an inspection for their money; it is whether the merchant induced the consumers to pay for the inspections through deception. <em>See Golt, </em>308 Md. at 13-14, 517 A.2d 328 (where a landlord failed to disclose a material fact, tenant is entitled to restitution of the rent he paid for an apartment even though he had lived in it);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Consumer Protection Div. v. Consumer Publishing Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 780-81, 501 A.2d 48 (1985) (allowing restitution even in the absence of direct evidence of consumer reliance on deceptive diet pill advertisements); CPA \u00a7 13-403(b)(l) (if, after an administrative hearing, the Consumer Protection Division finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the CPA was violated, it <em>must </em>issue an order taking affirmative action \u201cincluding the restitution of money or property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">It necessarily also follows, and we so hold, that a franchisor may be held liable for restitution for its deceptive practices. The correct measure of restitution would be the sums spent by the consumer in reliance on the practice, whether paid to the franchisee or franchisor. Under the circumstances of this case, either may be held accountable. Thus, when the trial court found that Cottman as a franchisor was a merchant, and thus had indirectly engaged in deceptive practices, it should also have held that the money spent by consumers as a result of this deception be returned to them by Cottman. To find otherwise is an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of discretion. We note that to hold otherwise would make the restitution procedure meaningless in every case where something is provided, through deceptive practices, to those being deceived. That is not the intent of the restitution provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">We reverse the denial of the State\u2019s request for restitution, and we remand for the institution of a \u201cprocedure for the individual determination of consumer restitution claims.\u201d <em>Consumer Protection, </em>304 Md. at 781, 501 A.2d 48; <em>State v. Andrews, </em>73 Md.App. 80, 533 A.2d 282 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">COUNT 2</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Count 2 involves a dispute over the sale of \u201cpreventionary\u201d overhauls, and Cottman\u2019s participation in the process. The State alleged that Cottman induced customers to authorize and pay for unnecessary repairs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The primary methods used, the State argues, are Cottman\u2019s sales instructions to its repairs centers that customers are to be told (1) that the transmission needs an overhaul if the transmission fluid is discolored (the \u201cburnt fluid\u201d technique); and (2) if a transmission is leaking, the staff is to recommend a \u201cpreventionary overhaul\u201d even where the leak may be fixed by a simple resealing. The trial judge granted summary judgment for Cottman.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We think that there is a dispute of material fact regarding the sale of unnecessary repairs. For example, a manual authored by Chrysler Motors, and included in the record, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">Along with the fluid level, it is equally important to check the condition of the fluid. <em>When the fluid smells burned </em>or if it is contaminated with metal bushing or friction material particles, <em>a complete overhaul is needed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyZ\">(Emphasis added.) This view of the solution to the problem contrasts with other evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Q. So your view would be, I take it, even if the fluid is slightly burnt or burnt for that matter, if the car drives okay you would or would not do an overhaul?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">A.. Would not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The State must do more than merely prove that the centers sold unnecessary repairs. As we have shown in our discussion of agency <em>supra, </em>no principal/agent relationship between the repair shops and Cottman was proven. Thus, the State must prove that Cottman\u2019s participation violated the CPA as to .these \u201cpreventionary\u201d overhauls. It cannot depend solely upon the contacts between Cottman\u2019s franchisees and the ultimate consumer. There is a dispute regarding this factual issue, with the State offering exhibits tending to prove that Cottman\u2019s requiring its centers to perform unnecessary repairs constituted a prohibited practice, and Cottman offering evidence to the contrary. \u201cEven where the underlying facts are undisputed, if the undisputed facts are susceptible of more than one permissible factual inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law, and summary judgment should not be granted.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, </em>320 Md. 584, 591-92, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). If the facts are susceptible to more than one inference, as they are here, summary judgment is likewise not proper. <em>Finci v. American Cas. Co., </em>82 Md.App. 471, 478, 572 A.2d 1092, <em>cert. granted, </em>320 Md. 636, 579 A.2d 281 (1990). <em>See also Arnold Developer v. Collins, </em>318 Md. 259, 567 A.2d 949 (1990); <em>King v. Bankerd, 303 </em>Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>80 Md.App. 237, 242, 562 A.2d 762, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>315 Md. 97, 553 A.2d 684 (1989); <em>Bennett v. Baskin &amp; Sears, </em>77 Md.App. 56, 95-96, 549 A.2d 393 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We reverse the grant of summary judgment on Count 2, and remand for a resolution of this question by a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">COUNT 3</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">This count alleged that Cottman had charged customers for repairs <em>it </em>had not made. We have affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>trial court\u2019s finding on the agency question. Thus, we affirm his grant of this summary judgment issue in Cottman\u2019s favor, as we could find no evidence in the record that would create a dispute as to a material fact. While there may have been evidence that the centers may have charged for fictitious repairs, the trial court failed to find sufficient evidence that this was a practice imposed, or attempted to be imposed, on the repair centers by Cottman. There being no agency relationship, the centers were not acting on Cottman\u2019s behalf in this regard. We discern no error in that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">COUNT 4</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Count 4 concerns the allegations by the State that Cottman violated the ARFA and CPA by failing to give written estimates of parts and labor costs. The CPA is a generic statute, and in \u00a7 13-301(14)(vi) it incorporates ARFA\u2019s requirements as applicable. ARFA \u00a7 14-1002 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">(a) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">(1) Before beginning any repair work on a motor vehicle for which a customer is charged more than $50, an automotive repair facility shall give the customer on his request a written statement which contains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">(i) The estimated completion date; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">(ii) The estimated price for labor and parts necessary to complete the work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">(b) ... An automotive repair facility may not charge a customer without his consent any amount which exceeds the written estimate by 10 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">\u201cRepair\u201d is not defined in the ARFA. To effectuate the intention of the Legislature, we will assign the ordinary meaning to the word. <em>See Privette, </em>320 Md. at 744-45, 580 A.2d 188; <em>D &amp; Y, Inc., </em>320 Md. at 538, 578 A.2d 1177; <em>Taxiera, </em>320 Md. at 480, 578 A.2d 761; <em>Brodsky, </em>319 Md. at 98, 570 A.2d 1235; <em>Morris, </em>319 Md. at 603, 573 A.2d 1346; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number><em>Davis, </em>319 Md. at 60, 570 A.2d 855; <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d 628. The common meaning of the term is \u201cto restore to a good or sound condition after decay or damage; mend: <em>to repair a motor.\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1215 (unabridged ed. 1983) (italics in original). \u201cDiagnosis,\u201d on the other hand, means \u201cto ascertain the cause or nature of (a disorder, malfunction, etc.) from the symptoms: <em>The mechanic diagnosed the trouble that caused the engine knock.\u201d Id. </em>at 397 (italics in original). It seems obvious to us that a diagnosis is not the same as a repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The ARFA does not require Cottman or the repair shops to give written estimates before finding out what was wrong with each transmission. Cottman is thus not required under the ARFA to give a <em>written </em>estimate of repairs until after it has performed a diagnosis to its satisfaction, whether that be by external inspection only, or by both external and internal inspection. Because the ARFA mandates that a written estimate may not be exceeded by more than 10%, were we to hold otherwise, we would force Cottman to issue a written estimate forcing it to either inflate all its estimates to the theoretical maximum price, or to gamble that the external inspection was completely accurate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that the judge was correct in ruling for Cottman on this count.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Adjudication vs. Rulemaking</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Cottman argues that the minimum cost estimate formula required by the injunction is an effective change in existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>law which formulates a rule of widespread application, and as such, is impermissible under <em>CBS, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>319 Md. 687, 575 A.2d 324 (1990). It contends that the formula must be promulgated by rulemaking, not adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The standard enunciated in <em>CBS </em>is that \u201cwhen a policy of general application, embodied in or represented by a rule, is changed to a different policy of general application, the change must be accomplished by rulemaking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696, 575 A.2d 324. There, the state comptroller changed the formula for apportionment of corporate nationwide income for state tax purposes. Prior to 1980, CBS had computed its Maryland taxes by using a three-factor formula prescribed by the Maryland Code. The factors were sales, payroll, and property. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 575 A.2d 324. In 1980, the comptroller decreed for the first time that advertising income be added to the sales factor. The Court stated that this change led to a substantially new policy which was generally applicable, and held that it should have been promulgated by rulemaking instead of adjudication. <em>Id. </em>at 699-700, 575 A.2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The Supreme Court of Hawaii, in <em>Shoreline Transp. v. Robert\u2019s Tours and Transp., </em>70 Haw. 585, 779 P.2d 868 (1989), recently penned a useful capsule description of the difference between rulemaking and adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">Rulemaking is the process by which an administrative agency lays down new prescriptions to govern the future conduct of those subject to its authority; adjudication is the process by which the agency applies either law or policy, or both, to the facts of a particular case. Rule-making is essentially legislative in nature, not only because it operates in the future, but also because it is concerned largely with considerations of policy. Adjudication, conversely, is concerned with the determination of past and present rights and liabilities. Typically, it involves a determination as to whether past conduct was unlawful, so that the proceeding is characterized by an accusatory flavor and may result in disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Id. </em>In <em>Consumer Protection, </em>304 Md. at 753-54, 501 A.2d 48, the Court of Appeals, in discussing the company\u2019s argument that the proper way for the Division to proceed was by rulemaking, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\">Courts have generally held that administrative agencies \u201c[are] not precluded from announcing new principles in ... adjudicative proceeding^] and that the choice between rule making and adjudication lies in the first instance within the [agency\u2019s] discretion.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 294, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1771, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">As Justice Murphy said for the Court in <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., ... </em>[332 U.S. 194, 202-203 [67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995] (1947)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201cThe function of filling in the interstices of the Act should be performed, as much as possible, through the quasi-legislative promulgation of rules to be applied in the future. But any rigid requirement to that effect would make the administrative process inflexible and incapable of dealing with many of the specialized problems which arise____ Not every principle essential to the effective administration of a statute can or should be cast immediately into the mold of a general rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">[T]he agency must retain power to deal with the problems on a case-to-case basis if the administrative process is to be effective. There is thus a very definite place for the case-by-case evolution of statutory standards. And the choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <em>ad hoc </em>litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">For these reasons most courts have allowed agencies broad discretion in choosing whether to develop policy by rulemaking or adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>This Court has not addressed the question of when, if ever, an agency is required to proceed by rulemaking. Nonetheless, in the instant case it was clearly appropriate for the Division to proceed by adjudication, even under the restrictive view expressed in <em>Ford Motor Co. v. F.T.C. </em>[673 F.2d 1008 (9th Cir.1981)], <em>supra. </em>The Consumer Protection Division did not change existing law or even formulate rules of widespread application in this proceeding.

It establishes that \u201c[fjailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends to deceive\u201d is a deceptive trade practice. Section 13-301(3). The formula imposed by the judge in the case at bar is an expression of this general policy of consumer protection, and logically flows from this standard by defining what a deceptive practice is, in the context of transmission repairs. Thus, the CPA enunciated a policy of general application. The trial judge considered that general policy, and applied it to the specific factual situation at hand. The court simply applied the statutory standards to the facts in the record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>See McDonald v.

Because of the labyrinthic nature of this case, our resolution of the issues cannot be best discussed using the organizational arrangements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>of the parties\u2019 briefs. We therefore will use our own outline. To aid in understanding our rulings in respect to appellant\u2019s issues, we note that our discussion of the first issue begins in the portion of our opinion entitled \u201cCount I E. \u2014 Restitution\"; for the second issue, see \u201cCount I A.- \u2014 Deceptive Practices\u201d and \u201cB. \u2014 Scope of the Injunction\u201d; and for the third issue, see our discussion in \u201cCount I D. \u2014 The Agency Relationship\u201d; \u201cCount 2\u201d; \u201cCount 3\u201d and \u201cCount 4.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b747-13\">.

Cottman misreads the record. The judge stated, \"... I have no criticism of the R.C.I..... I find that to be in complete conformity with Maryland law.\u201d He thus agreed with Cottman that the R.C.I. itself was not a deceptive practice, but that it was the withholding of information as to its necessity that was deceptive.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b750-14\">. As discussed <em>supra, </em>Cottman was found to be a \u201cmerchant.\u201d In order to accept Cottman\u2019s theory, we would have to hold that a merchant company may insulate itself from the consequences of its deceptive practices by conducting them through intermediaries. We reject that theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. Pursuant to the finding of violation, a civil penalty of $100,000 was entered against Cottman, payable in four yearly installments. According to the plain language of the statute, at least 100 violations would have to have been committed by Cottman to result in a fine of this amount. When calculating the penalty, the trial judge staled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">After having listened to the discussions of both attorneys\u2019, I have come to the conclusion that we have more than ample reason to justify a numerical penalty____ The problem is to work out an adequate penalty. In light of the broad discretion of the stature [sic], I am going to impose a penalty up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) categorically, with a fashion I feel is an adequate fine in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">No findings were ever made regarding the dates of, or number of times the CPA was violated. <em>See State v. Action TV Rentals, </em>297 Md. 531, 561, 467 A.2d 1000 (1983) (where the State did not specify in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>brief any particular transaction or number of occasions where the violation occurred, the appellate court will not find reversible error in the trial court\u2019s failure to lay fines). This Court in the past has seemed to hold that the defendant must have the opportunity to cross-examine each witness. <em>Klein v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 640, 646, 452 A.2d 173 (1982), cert. denied, 295 Md. 440 (1983) (there must be sufficient sworn testimony to support each violation); <em>Smith v. Attorney General, </em>46 Md.App. 78, 88-89, 415 A.2d 651 (1980) (evidence as to 80 out of 100 consumer complaints concerning violations of the CPA was insufficient, as the complaints were not supported by sworn testimony); <em>Devine Seafood v. Attorney Gen., </em>37 Md.App. 439, 444, 377 A.2d 1194 (1977), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 282 Md. 482, 385 A.2d 85 (1978) (the appropriate standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence). General restitution orders were, however, approved by the Court of Appeals in <em>Consumer Protection Division v. Consumer Publishing Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 501 A.2d 48 (1985). <em>See also State v. Andrews, 73 </em>Md.App. 80, 533 A.2d 282 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">This issue of the method of computation of the penalty was not raised on appeal; therefore, we decline to address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b756-5\">. See our discussion, <em>infra, </em>of agency. We distinguish agency from that degree of control necessary to establish \"indirect\" participation under the CPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">. 1967 Md.Laws Ch. 388 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">WHEREAS, there has been mounting concern over the increased incidences of deceptive practices in connection with the sale of goods and services in the State of Maryland; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT80\">WHEREAS, certain merchants unfairly take advantage of an unsuspecting public and thereby reap an undeserved profit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnC\">WHEREAS, such practices undermine the public confidence in those supplying consumer goods and services, while actually a majority of these businessmen operate with integrity and sincere regard for their customers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agd\">WHEREAS, the people of Maryland should be protected from the practices of a small minority of unscrupulous individuals and to rid the State of the individuals would work to the advantage of the honest businessmen of the State by raising public confidence in the business community____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The CPA contemplates the elimination of the \u201cpractices.\u201d If it was intended to apply only to merchants who had contact with consumers, it would not have included \"indirect\u201d purveyors of offers, etc. The statute was designed to punish those who, like Cottman, committed, <em>or caused, </em>the practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b757-10\">. As we have stated, the existence of an agency relationship is not essential to Cottman\u2019s liability, given the purposes of the CPA and its applicability to indirect acts. Thus, while the existence of an agency relationship may determine many legal issues between the parties, and between them and third parties, the existence of an agency relationship is not essential to the maintenance of a CPA action, when the person sought to be charged is committing acts designed to further prohibited deceptive practices. We perceive that the State presses this agency issue in order to be able to assert CPA actions against franchisors for acts committed by franchisees completely independent of any coercion or actions of the franchisor. Even if the facts of this case were to be different, we would be reluctant to recognize that vast a judicial expansion of the scope of the CPA\u2019s provisions. Though the foreign cases we mention, <em>infra, </em>appear to indicate otherwise, it could be argued that a franchise relationship is somewhat inconsistent with an agency relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">. The relationship between an attorney and client or broker and client is an example of the principal/independent contractor variety. <em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 510 n. 27, 520 A.2d 717 (1987). One important consequence of the distinction between independent contractors and servants is that the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>normally does not apply to the principal/independent contractor relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 520 A.2d 717.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">. This case involved a gas station customer who was injured due to alleged negligence in the, repairing of his car by a mechanic. The customer sued the mechanic, his gas station employer, a \u201cjobber,\u201d and Chevron. The claim against the jobber was based on an agency theory \u2014 that the gas station and its employees were servants of the jobber. A lease agreement between the station and the jobber was introduced to establish that the gas station was subject to the jobber\u2019s actual control. The Court held that the jobber\u2019s exercise of control over the gas station and its servants flowed partly from its status as a jobber, and partly from its status as a landlord. Lease provisions governing the operation of a gas station in the areas of business hours, cleanliness, lighting, and the number of junked cars allowed on the premises did not, in the Court\u2019s view, establish the degree of control required for the existence of a master/servant relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\">. The existence of an agency relationship is not necessarily incompatible with a franchise. <em>See, e.g., Drexel v. Union Prescription Centers, </em>582 F.2d 781, 786 (3d Cir.1978) (the mere existence of a franchise agreement does not trigger, nor insulate, the parties from a master-servant relationship. The determination of agency is made by examining the nature and extent of control as defined in the franchise agreement, or by the parties\u2019 actual practice); <em>Wood v. Holiday Inns, </em>508 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.1975) (jury could find that a franchisor may be liable for acts of franchisee if there is a principal-agent relationship between them); <em>Taylor v. Checkrite, LTD, </em>627 F.Supp. 415, 416 (S.D. Ohio 1986) (the existence of a franchisor-franchisee relationship does not preclude the existence of a principal-agent relationship); <em>Singleton v. International Dairy Queen, </em>332 A.2d 160 (Del.Super.Ct.1975) (franchisor may be found to be a principal where the franchise agreement exerts sufficient control); Annot., <em>Vicarious Liability of Private Franchisors. </em>81 A.L.R.3d 764 (1977); 16 Business Organizations, <em>Glickman, Franchising </em>\u00a7 4.04[1] (1990); 62B AmJur.2d, <em>Private Franchise Contracts </em>\u00a7 406 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\">. In <em>Attorney Gen. of Maryland v. Dickson, </em>717 F.Supp. 1090, 1106 (D.Md.1989), the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">[T]he remedy ... is a remedy ... that encompass[es]---- that requirement] [that] the plaintiffs ... tender back what was received, if not consumed or worthless, and if \"tender-back\" is possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Obviously, a consumer cannot \u201ctender back\u201d an inspection. Neither can a consumer \"tender back\u201d unnecessary repairs. Thus, while we do not adopt the <em>Dickson </em>finding, even under it restitution was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\">. This is not to be confused with the allegations of fictional repairs we discuss in relation to Count 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. The provision contained in the ARFA that requires parties to perform affirmatively by giving written estimates is distinguishable from the CPA (and our prior holding herein) which prohibits certain practices. The former require the furnishing of correct information; the latter forbids the withholding of correct information or furnishing of incorrect information. Additionally, the ARFA requires that the affirmative information be given \u201cupon request.\u201d The CPA, and our holding in respect to it, does not depend upon a consumer request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">.
