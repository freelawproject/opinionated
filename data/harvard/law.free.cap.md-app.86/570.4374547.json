Co. (Consumers) appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granting a motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff below, Patricia Ann Smith, appellee. Smith filed suit against Consumers to recover $10,000 accidental death and dismemberment benefits payable under a group policy insuring the life of her husband, Joseph M. Smith. The Court denied Consumer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Smith. In this appeal, we are asked to interpret in a group insurance policy the term \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d and determine whether it includes injury occurring while the insured is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>engaged in proscribed behavior, <em>i.e., </em>driving while legally intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On November 9, 1986, Joseph Smith was killed in a single car accident when the car he was driving left the roadway, struck a telephone pole and overturned. The police investigation revealed that the decedent\u2019s vehicle was travelling in excess of 60 miles per hour when it left the roadway. The post mortem examination further revealed that the decedent had a .20 percent blood alcohol concentration, indicating that he had been operating his vehicle while intoxicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The decedent was insured under a Group Term Life Insurance and Group Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Policy with Consumers Life Insurance Co. This insurance policy provides for death benefits and double indemnity benefits in the event of \u201can accidental, bodily injury which results directly and independently of all other causes\u201d and not from any of the excepted risks, <em>i.e., </em>suicide, intentionally self-inflicted injury, infection or disease, and war. Consumers paid the $10,000 death benefits but, because the decedent\u2019s death occurred during the operation of his motor vehicle while intoxicated, Consumers denied payment of the accidental death benefit on the ground that the death was not accidental within the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">We are asked to determine whether the appellant, by refusing payment of certain benefits, breached its contract with the insured. The standard for appellate review of the grant of a motion for summary judgment is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>trial court erroneously granted summary judgment where there exists a genuine issue as to material facts in which case the movant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md.Rule 2-501(a). The function of the summary judgment procedure is \u201cmerely to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried, and, if there is none, to cause judgment to be rendered accordingly.\u201d <em>Porter v. General Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 413, 396 A.2d 1090 (1979). Moreover, all duly shown facts which would be admissible in evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom must be considered most favorably to the party opposing the motion. <em>Washington Homes, Inc. v. Interstate Land Dev. Co., </em>281 Md. 712, 718, 382 A.2d 555 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The evidence regarding the insured\u2019s death is undisputed. The insured died as a result of an automobile accident when he operated his vehicle while intoxicated and collided with a utility pole. \u201cWhere there is no real dispute as to facts which are pertinent to the question of coverage which are shown by evidence properly admissible the construction is for the court.\u201d <em>Truck Insurance Exchange v. Marks Rentals, </em>288 Md. 428, 433, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980). The record in this case presents no real dispute as to the facts which are pertinent to the question of coverage. Therefore, the \u201cquestion is one of the construction of the contract in the light of the language employed in the contract, the subject matter and the surrounding circumstances. When these are clear, it is the province of the court, rather than of the jury, to construe the contract.\u201d <em>Ebert v. Millers Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Md. 602, 610, 155 A.2d 484 (1959). The Court of Appeals has observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">[t]he jury\u2019s function in the interpretation of documents then will arise wherever, in view of the surrounding circumstances and usages offered in evidence, the meaning of the writing is not so clear as to preclude doubt by a reasonable man of its meaning. If the meaning after taking the parol evidence, if any, into account is so clear that no reasonable man could reach more than one conclusion as to the meaning of the writing under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>stances, the court will properly decide the question of fact for itself as it may any question of fact which is equally clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><em>Montauk Corp. v. Seeds, </em>215 Md. 491, 497, 138 A.2d 907 (1958), quoting S. Williston, 4 <em>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 616 at 660-63 (3d ed. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In order to see whether there existed a dispute as to material facts, we must determine first whether the terms of the contract are ambiguous. If the terms are unambiguous, we may construe the insurance contract as a matter of law. <em>Winterwerp v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>277 Md. 714, 717, 357 A.2d 350 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The pertinent clause in the case <em>sub judice </em>reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">Upon receipt by the Insurance Company of due proof that an Employee while insured under the policy has received <em>an accidental bodily injury, which results directly and independently of all other causes, </em>and as a result of the injury, has suffered any of the following losses after the date on which the injury was received, and that the loss suffered by the Employee <em>did not result from any of the Risks Excepted, </em>the Insurance Company will pay the amount of the benefit provided for the loss suffered ... RISKS EXCEPTED: The insurance provided by the policy does not cover, and no payment will be made for, any loss which results directly or indirectly from: (1) <em>suicide or intentional self-inflicted injury </em>while sane; (2) <em>infection </em>... or <em>disease; </em>(3) war, declared or undeclared, or any act of war. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Several well-established principles govern the construction of insurance contracts in Maryland. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486 (1985). In an insurance contract, as in any other contract, the intention of the parties is determined primarily by the terms of the contract. To ascertain the parties\u2019 intention, the instrument must be considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals opined that \u201clanguage which is merely general in nature or imprecisely defined is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>not necessarily ambiguous.\u201d <em>Truck Ins., </em>288 Md. at 433, 418 A.2d 1187. On the subject of ambiguity G.J. Couch, 2 <em>Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>(2d ed. 1959) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxLh\">\u00a7 15:84. \u2014 Test in determining existence of ambiguity. The test to be applied by the court in determining whether there is ambiguity is not what the insurer intended its words to mean, but what a <em>reasonably prudent person </em>applying for insurance would have understood them to mean. The criterion is ambiguity from the standpoint of a layman, not from that of a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 416-18 (emphasis added). <em>See also, C &amp; H Plumbing v. Employers Mutual Casualty Co., </em>264 Md. 510, 515, 287 A.2d 238 (1972). Applying this test we believe that the word \u201caccident\u201d is not ambiguous to a reasonably prudent person.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Court of Appeals has consulted <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary, Random House Dictionary, </em>or, less often, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>to determine the ordinary and accepted meaning of a word. <em>Pacific Indemnity, </em>302 Md. at 388, 488 A.2d 486. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>11 (3d ed. unabr. 1986) defines \u201caccident,\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnX2\">an event or condition occurring by chance or arising from unknown or remote causes ... lack of intention or necessity ... an unforeseen unplanned event or condition ... usu. sudden event or change occurring without intent or volition through carelessness, unawareness, ignorance or a combination of causes and producing unfortunate result____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>15 (6th ed. 1990) also defines \u201caccident\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">In its most commonly accepted meaning, or in its ordinary or popular sense, the word may be defined as meaning: a fortuitous circumstance, event, or happening ... an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens ... an unusual or unexpected result attending the operation or performance of a usual or necessary act or event ... any unexpected personal injury resulting from any unlooked for mishap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>or occurrence ... an undesigned, a sudden and unexpected event ... <em>INSURANCE CONTRACT. </em>An accident within accident insurance policies is an event happening without any human agency, or, if happening through such agency, an event which, under circumstances, is unusual and <em>not expected by the person to whom it happens. </em>A more comprehensive term than \u2018negligence,\u2019 and in its common signification the word means unexpected happening without intention or design____ (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In the instant policy, the term \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d is further qualified by the clause, \u201cwhich results directly and independently of all other causes.\u201d Since we need to construe the instrument as a whole, we must determine whether this qualification makes the term \u201caccident\u201d ambiguous to a reasonably prudent layperson; we hold that the qualifying language does not render the term ambiguous. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\u201cThat a term cannot be precisely defined so as to make clear its application in all varying factual situations does not mean that it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Allstate v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496, 229 A.2d 70 (1967). In interpreting the contractual terms \u201cwe have no right to relieve one of the parties from disadvantageous terms by process of interpretation nor may we make a new contract under guise of construction.\u201d <em>C &amp; H Plumbing, </em>264 Md. at 512, 287 A.2d 238. Moreover, enumerating specific excepted risks (suicide, intentionally self-inflicted injury, infection, disease and war) logically indicates appellant\u2019s intention to be limited to those exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The holding in <em>Winterwerp, </em>277 Md. at 718, 357 A.2d 350, that there is \u201cno hard and fast rule\u201d for resolving whether certain language is ambiguous, is pertinent here. \u201cEach case must, in the final analysis, stand or fall upon its own facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Appellant asserts that, as a matter of public policy, the beneficiary should not recover because the Maryland Legislature has acted to deter a person who has consumed alcohol from driving on Maryland\u2019s highways. Md.Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.). The Court of Appeals has held that \u201cunless a statute, a regulation, or public policy is violated,\u201d the first principle of construction of insurance policies in Maryland is to apply the terms of the contract. <em>Pacific Indemnity, </em>302 Md. at 388, 488 A.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We find nothing in the enactments of the General Assembly relative to insurance to indicate that we are expected as a matter of public policy to deny recovery to a beneficiary of an accident insurance policy because the insured drove a vehicle while intoxicated. If insurance companies desire to avoid liability on such ground, they are free to insert a clause in their policies to that effect. Such a clause would be valid and binding. J.A. Appleman, IB <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 511 at 394-95 (rev. ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In <em>Freeman v. Crown Life Ins. Co., </em>580 S.W.2d 897, 899 (1979) the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas addressed the public policy issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">The only evidence upon which appellee relies to rebut the presumption that Mr. Freeman\u2019s death was accidental is the stipulation that at the time of the collision he was driving while intoxicated. It is contended that because such an act is a criminal act inherently involving substantial risk of harm, serious bodily injury and death are the readily foreseeable consequences of such conduct and are therefore not accidental within the contemplation of the insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The <em>Freeman </em>Court concluded, 580 S.W.2d at 901:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">Upon public policy considerations, some courts have denied recovery of accidental death benefits where the insured was killed while in the commission of a serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>crime, on the grounds that such a recovery would allow one to profit from his own wrong and would encourage crime. See Annot., 43 A.L.R.3d 1120; 1125, Sec. 3. But the weight of authority and the trend of recent decisions is to allow an innocent beneficiary to recover unless the policy was obtained in contemplation of the illegal conduct. <em>Ibid, </em>Sec. 4, p. 1126, et seq. <em>See also Stats v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co., supra. </em>Such a result does not violate the policy consideration first stated, because the beneficiary has been guilty of no wrongdoing. The second consideration is not valid, for as observed in <em>Home State Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, </em>175 Okl. 492, 53 P.2d 562 (1936), it is unrealistic, to say the least, to assume that any significant number of policy holders would go out and seek death in unlawful pursuits in order to mature their policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The logical extension of appellant\u2019s argument concerning putting into motion \u201ca chain of events that are the natural and foreseeable consequences of the initial action\u201d is that such a test could arguably be applied to the most hazardous or the most inane pursuits. In oral argument, appellant urged that it may be foreseeable \u2014 and, hence, not accidental \u2014 that one is injured or killed as a result of running a red light or stop sign, or driving a long distance conscious of his or her fatigue. It suggested that so long as proceeding through the red light or stop sign was intentional, the fact that the result was unintentional is of no moment. It makes the same argument with respect to one who intentionally starts to drive a long distance knowing that he or she is severely fatigued. This is simply too expansive an interpretation of the holdings in the authorities cited by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We hold, under the facts here extant, that the insurer is liable, notwithstanding that the insured may have been injured as a result of violating the law, \u201c[since] it does not appear that the policy was obtained in contemplation of such violation and the danger consequent thereon.\u201d Appleman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 511 at 391. <em>See also Zurich General Acci</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>dent &amp; Liability Ins. Co., etc. v. Flickinger, </em>33 F.2d 853, 855-56 (4th Cir.1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">ACCIDENTAL MEANS v. ACCIDENTAL RESULT</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Appellant next contends that, in deciding the case <em>sub judice, </em>this court must distinguish between \u201caccidental means\u201d and \u201caccidental result\u201d, a distinction first recognized in Maryland in the case of <em>Life Insurance Co. v. </em>Plummer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 181 Md. 140, 28 A.2d 856 (1942). Appellant asserts that the policy at issue \u201cimplicitly incorporates this aspect of Maryland law\u201d requiring the decedent\u2019s beneficiary to establish that death was both unintentional and unforeseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Appellant relies on <em>Plummer, </em>and <em>Home Beneficial Life Insurance Co. v. Partain, </em>205 Md. 60, 106 A.2d 79 (1954),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the policy language differs from the language in the case before us. In both cases, the Court of Appeals found that the insurance was not against accidental death, but against death by accidental means, and denied recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Adopting the distinction between accidental means and accidental result, the Court of Appeals in <em>Plummer </em>relied on <em>Landress v. Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>291 U.S. 491, 54 S.Ct. 461, 78 L.Ed. 934 (1934). The insurance policy in <em>Landress </em>allowed recovery if death should result \u201cfrom bodily injuries effected directly and independently of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>all other causes through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d The Court of Appeals referred specifically to a portion of Justice Stone\u2019s opinion that highlights the importance of the words used in an insurance policy: \u201cBut it is not enough, to establish liability under these clauses, that the death or injury was accidental in the understanding of the average man ... for here the <em>carefully chosen words </em>defining liability distinguish between the result and the external means which produces it.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>181 Md. at 143, 28 A.2d 856 (emphasis added), quoting <em>Landress, </em>291 U.S. at 495-96, 54 S.Ct. at 462. Justice Stone went on to conclude that a policy which includes the words accidental means \u201cis not against an accidental result\u201d and that \u201c[t]he stipulated payments are to be made only if the bodily injury, though unforeseen, is effected by means which are external and accidental.\u201d <em>Landress, </em>291 U.S. at 496, 54 S.Ct. at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We acknowledge that the language of the <em>Partain </em>and <em>Plummer </em>policies, \u201cbodily injury effected solely by violent, external and accidental means,\u201d is similar to the language of the policy <em>sub judice; </em>it is not identical, however. The policy at issue here does not specifically state that injury or death must result from accidental \u201cmeans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The direct and proximate cause of death of the insured was an automobile accident; he did not die from intoxication. Moreover, no evidence was presented to the trial court in the instant case that the decedent intended to injure himself or commit suicide. The police and autopsy reports state that the decedent died in an \u201caccident.\u201d The fact that the decedent ingested alcohol does not make his death intentional, planned, foreseen or expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In <em>Partain, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[i]n this case there is no room for doubt that the death of the insured was not expected by either participant in the scuffle; and consequently the death itself was accidental.\u201d <em>Partain, </em>205 Md. at 65, 106 A.2d 79. The Court of Appeals held in <em>Plummer </em>that \u201c[fjt is beyond question that the death was accidental, for the term, \u2018accidental\u2019 means that which happens without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>intention or design, and which is unexpected, unusual and unforeseen.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>181 Md. at 142, 28 A.2d 856, citing <em>United States Mutual Accident Assn. v. Barry, </em>131 U.S. 100, 121, 9 S.Ct. 755, 762, 33 L.Ed. 60, 67 (1889). Moreover, while intoxication may be dangerous and expose the drinker to a risk, it does not bar recovery under an accidental life insurance provision. \u201cIntentional, unnecessary exposure to risks, as well as the negligent creation of risks to one\u2019s own safety, may not prevent the result from being accidental.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>96 N.J. Super. 520, 233 A.2d 416, 420 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The policy itself failed to specifically exclude from its coverage any injury or death caused by driving while intoxicated; such a provision would have eliminated appellant\u2019s grounds for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The applicable policy provisions specifies in plain, unambiguous, easily understandable language that coverage exists for the type of accident in which the decedent was involved; therefore, we hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\">. If at the time of testing, the alcohol blood level is .10 percent or more, it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the person was intoxicated. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-307(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. In <em>Plummer, </em>the insured died after his dentist administered a dose of anesthetic preliminary to performing the operation. The Court held there was no evidence to show that a mishap or mistake had occurred in the use of anesthetic and thus death had not been caused solely by \u201cexternal, violent and accidental means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 28 A.2d 856.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\">. In <em>Partain, </em>the insured met his death during an altercation with another individual. During the scuffle, Partain was pushed backward, fell, and died from the impact of hitting his head on a stone. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 106 A.2d 79. The Court found that death was a foreseeable consequence of provoking a fight and denied recovery under the insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
