J.</author>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Petitioners Hofsess-Olson, LLC, dba Myrtle Creek Family Funeral Home, and Fred S. Olson, its manager and director, seek judicial review of an order of the State Mortuary and Cemetery Board determining that petitioners committed 88 violations of state and federal funeral service regulations, arising out of petitioners\u2019 pricing and billing practices. The board revoked petitioners\u2019 licenses and fined them $500 for each violation, for a total of $44,000. On review, petitioners advance eight different assignments of error, ranging from a challenge to the authority of the board to enforce federal funeral service regulations at all to arguments about the propriety of the board\u2019s interpretation and application of state and federal funeral service regulations in various particulars. We reject each of petitioners\u2019 assignments of error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">A. <em>Regulatory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">To understand the board\u2019s order and our resolution of the parties\u2019 contentions about it requires some background regarding the statutory and administrative framework for the regulation of funeral services.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The regulation of the funeral industry began as a purely state concern. The Oregon legislature created a State Mortuary and Cemetery Board, which was authorized to regulate the licensing and practice of embalming and funeral services, as provided in ORS chapter 692. Among other things, the legislature required licensees not to engage in misrepresentation in the conduct of business or in obtaining a license. ORS 692.180(l)(a). It also required licensees to refrain from engaging in fraudulent or dishonest conduct related to the operation of a funeral service practice, the operation of an embalming practice, or the operation of a cemetery or crematorium. ORS 692.180(l)(b). The legislature further authorized the board to investigate any complaint concerning a licensee and, if the board finds that the licensee violated any applicable industry standards, authorized the board to impose a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>violation, suspend or revoke the license, or refuse to grant or renew a license. ORS 692.180(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Meanwhile, the United States Congress enacted the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1982, 15 USC \u00a7 45 (1982), which prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices,\u201d 15 USC \u00a7 45(a)(1), and directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to make rules and regulations to prohibit such practices, 15 USC \u00a7 46(g). In response to that directive, in 1984, the FTC produced what has come to be known as \u201cthe Funeral Rule.\u201d 16 CFR \u00a7 453 (1984). The rule became effective in April 1984. It defines what acts constitute \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d in the context of the funeral services industry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cIn selling or offering to sell funeral goods or funeral services to the public, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a funeral provider to fail to furnish accurate price information disclosing the cost to the purchaser for each of the specific funeral goods and funeral services used in connection with the disposition of deceased human bodies, including at least the price of embalming, transportation of remains, use of facilities, caskets, outer burial containers, immediate burials, or direct cremations, to persons inquiring about the purchase of funerals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(a). The FTC Funeral Rule also establishes \u201cpreventive requirements\u201d designed to prevent a funeral provider from committing unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The rule declares that any funeral provider that complies with those preventive requirements is not engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices. <em>Id. </em>Among the preventive requirements listed in the rule are that providers give a \u201cgeneral price list\u201d (GPL) specifying the goods and services to be provided and the prices for each:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cPreventive requirements. To prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices * * *, funeral providers must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u00abHi \u2756 H\u00ed \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201c(4) General price list</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201c(i)(A) Give a printed or typewritten price list for retention to persons who inquire in person about the funeral goods, funeral services or prices of funeral goods or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>services offered by the funeral provider. The funeral provider must give the list upon beginning discussion of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">\u201c(1) The prices of funeral goods or funeral services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">\u201c(2) The overall type of funeral service or disposition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">\u201c(3) Specific funeral goods or funeral services offered by the funeral provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">\u00ab\u00edH * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">\u201c(5) Statement of funeral goods and services selected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">\u201c(i) Give an itemized written statement for retention to each person who arranges a funeral or other disposition of human remains, at the conclusion of the discussion of arrangements.

Funeral providers may give persons any other price information, in any other format, in addition to that required by \u00a7 453.2(b)(2), (3), and (4) so long as the statement required by \u00a7 453.2(b)(5) is given when required by the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(b). In addition, the FTC Funeral Rule provides that certain practices constitute \u201cdeceptive acts or practices\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-16\">\u201cIn selling or offering to sell funeral goods or funeral services to the public, it is a deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to represent that federal, state, or local laws, or particular cemeteries or crematories, require the purchase of any funeral goods or funeral services when such is not the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>16 CFR \u00a7 453.3(d)(1). And the rule further provides a series of preventive requirements detailing what funeral providers must do to prevent such deceptive acts or practices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">\u201cTo prevent these deceptive acts or practices, as well as the deceptive acts or practices identified in \u00a7\u00a7 453.3(a)(1), 453.3(b)(1), and 453.3(c)(1), funeral providers must identify and briefly describe in writing on the statement of funeral goods and services selected (required by \u00a7 453.2(b)(5)) any legal, cemetery, or crematory requirement which the funeral provider represents to persons as compelling the purchase of funeral goods or funeral services for the funeral which that person is arranging.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">16 CFR \u00a7 453.3(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In response to the FTC Funeral Rule, in 1985, the Oregon legislature adopted amendments to ORS 692.180 specifying that \u201c[violation of* * * regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission regulating funeral industry practices\u201d constitutes an additional cause for disciplinary action by the State Mortuary and Cemetery Board against its licensees. ORS 692.180(l)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Meanwhile, the board adopted administrative rules to implement both the state and federal statutes governing the \u201cDeath Care Industry.\u201d As pertinent to this case, those rules provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">\u201cEvery licensee or agent of a licensed facility of the Oregon State Mortuary and Cemetery Board (Board) shall abide by the accepted standards of the Death Care Industry and the minimum standards, including but not limited to the following standards of practice set forth by the Board.

In a similar vein, the board adopted rules requiring licensees to preserve records for its review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201c(6) All licensees, licensed facilities and funeral service practitioners shall keep a detailed, accurate, and permanent record of all transactions that are performed for the care and preparation and final disposition of human remains.

Olson is a licensed funeral service practitioner. Myrtle Creek is licensed to operate a funeral establishment, and Olson is its manager and part owner. Since beginning its operations in 1999, Myrtle Creek has maintained GPLs, which list prices for commonly provided goods and services. The GPLs have been updated several times over the years. One of Olson\u2019s co-owners prepared the list for 1999, and Olson created the lists for the years through 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Those GPLs listed prices for basic professional services of funeral director and staff; vehicle transfer from place of death; additional per mile cost for vehicle transfer from place of death; services vehicle; container for cremation and temporary container; graveside service only; memorial service with no casket present; funeral service; viewing or visitation; cremation process; shipping of cremated remains with shipping container; \u201cdirect cremation\u201d with container provided by purchaser; and direct cremation with container provided by funeral home. \u201cDirect cremation\u201d is a \u201cpackage\u201d that includes basic care and handling of remains, the cremation process, removal from the place of death within a 50-mile radius, a temporary cardboard container for the cremated remains, and other specific goods and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>In addition to goods and services provided directly by the funeral home, Myrtle Creek also advanced funds to customers for certain goods and services, such as obituaries and death certificate filing fees. Myrtle Creek passed those costs on to the consumer, designating them as cash advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">When a customer came to Myrtle Creek for services, Olson gave the customer the GPL if the customer requested a price list. At the time services were arranged, Olson frequently \u2014 but not always \u2014 listed the requested services on a Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected (SFGSS), a form used to describe the goods and services provided by the funeral home and the amount being charged. Olson had the customer sign the SFGSS. About 15 percent of the time, Olson had the customer sign the SFGSS <em>before </em>the prices were listed on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On one occasion, a Myrtle Creek customer, Smith, and her daughter, Dickey, met with Olson to arrange for cremation of Smith\u2019s deceased husband. Olson listed a charge of $875 for \u201cdirect cremation\u201d on the SFGSS. With the addition of other items, including some cash advances, the SFGSS total was $1,094. Smith signed the SFGSS, but Olson failed to give her a completed copy when he entered into the agreement for services with her. Before submitting Smith\u2019s bill to the Veterans Administration (VA) for payment of benefits, Olson added a charge of $250 for the cremation process and another charge of $250 for transportation of remains, even though both of those services were already included in the \u201cdirect cremation\u201d charge. Moreover, $250 was in excess of the amount authorized by the GPL. Olson crossed out the total of $1,094 and changed it to $1,594. Olson did not show the additional charges to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The VA sent Smith a copy of the SFGSS that Olson had submitted to it, and Smith noticed the additional charges and complained to the board about them. Subsequently, after the VA\u2019s payment of $550, Olson sent Smith dunning letters on two separate occasions requesting payment of the balance owing, which he represented to be $1,044.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Smith\u2019s daughter, Dickey, contacted the board and complained about Olson adding charges to the SFGSS. In response to the complaint, the board\u2019s compliance manager, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Nelson, inspected Myrtle Creek\u2019s records. She noted that Smith\u2019s file had been altered with correction fluid in several respects, and at that time it reflected a payment by the VA and a balance owed by Smith of $794.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">During Nelson\u2019s inspection of petitioners\u2019 records, she came across documents concerning the provision of cremation and related goods and services for a customer by the name of Rider. The SFGSS regarding Rider that was submitted to the VA for reimbursement included a $625 charge for basic services, a $320 charge for transfer of remains to the funeral home, $125 for refrigeration, $300 for cremation, and $20 for a black plastic urn, for a total of $1,390 before cash advances were added. When Nelson later asked for additional documents from petitioners, however, petitioners presented her with a different document than the one that had been submitted to the VA, one that did not list itemized charges and instead billed a total of only $870.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The investigation ultimately led to the discovery of possible numerous violations, including many incidents in which petitioners charged customers separately for each service, rather than the lower, \u201cdirect cremation\u201d package price listed on the GPL for the same services, resulting in a higher cost to the customer. The investigation also revealed many incidents in which petitioners charged customers more for services than the prices stated on the applicable GPL. The overcharges ranged from $35 to $150 per customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In addition, there were four incidents in which petitioners billed customers twice for the cremation process and a cremation tray, once in the \u201cdirect cremation\u201d package charge, and again separately. Petitioners also charged more for the additional cremation process than was listed on the applicable GPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Finally, the investigation revealed one incident in which petitioners charged a customer $75 for a cremation tray, with the notation on the SFGSS that the service was \u201cRequired by State,\u201d although a cremation tray was not required by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Following the investigation, the board sent petitioners notices of proposed disciplinary action, charging numerous violations of the federal and state regulations of the funeral services industry. The matters were later consolidated into a single proceeding. Following a hearing, the board issued an order finding the foregoing facts. On the basis of those facts, the board further concluded that petitioners had committed 88 violations. Specifically, the board concluded that (1) petitioners failed to give Smith a completed copy of the SFGSS in violation of the FTC Funeral Rule requirement that customers be given itemized written statements for services to be provided, 16 CFR \u00a7 453.2; (2) petitioners misrepresented the charges for the Smith cremation when they billed the VA more than the actual charge, in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(a), prohibiting misrepresentations; (3) petitioners double-billed the VA for the Smith cremation process work, in violation of the same law; (4) petitioners also double-billed for the transfer of Smith\u2019s remains, in violation of the same law; (5) petitioners twice dunned Smith for a greater amount than earlier had been agreed, in violation of the misrepresentation prohibition in ORS 692.180(l)(a) and the fraudulent or dishonest conduct prohibition in ORS 692.180(l)(b); (6) petitioners altered records in the Smith transaction, in violation of OAR 830-030-0090(2)(b)(C) and OAR 830-040-0000(9)(b); (7) petitioners charged for providing a cremation tray, supposedly because it was \u201cRequired by State,\u201d when the state imposed no such requirement, in violation of both the false statement prohibitions in the FTC Funeral Rule, 16 CFR \u00a7 453.3(d)(1), and the similar prohibitions in ORS 692.180(l)(a) and (b); (8) petitioners double-charged for cremation trays and cremation processes on eight different occasions, in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(a) and (b); (9) petitioners, on 34 different occasions, charged more for other goods and services than the GPLs provided, in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(a) and (b); (10) petitioners, on 37 occasions, improperly itemized charges to customers for goods and services at a higher cost than the GPL price, in that they charged for services that were already part of the direct cremation package, in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(a) and (b); and (11) petitioners altered records regarding the Rider transaction, in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(b) and (g). For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>88 violations that the board concluded petitioners had committed, the board assessed a civil penalty of $44,000 ($500 per violation) and also revoked petitioners\u2019 licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In their petition for judicial review, petitioners assert eight assignments of error. The assignments range from challenging the authority of the board to enforce the FTC Funeral Rule to the board\u2019s supposed errors in interpreting that rule, as well as the state statutes and regulations pertaining to the regulation of the funeral services industry. We address each assignment in turn, although \u2014 for reasons of readability and coherence \u2014 we address them in a slightly different order from the one that petitioners offer in their brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A. <em>Second Assignment: Board Authority to Enforce the FTC Funeral Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">As we have noted, the board concluded that, in two instances, petitioners violated the FTC Funeral Rule \u2014 by failing to give Smith a completed copy of the SFGSS and by falsely stating that a cremation tray was required by state law. In their second assignment of error, petitioners contest those two violations on the ground that the board erred in \u201cassuming to itself the authority to enforce and interpret federal law.\u201d According to petitioners, neither the Oregon legislature nor the board has adopted the FTC Funeral Rule as state law. In petitioners\u2019 view, that means that the board lacks authority to enforce the rule. The board responds that the legislature expressly provided that violation of the FTC Funeral Rule constitutes a violation of ORS 692.180. The board is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">As we have noted, in 1984, the FTC adopted its Funeral Rule. In response to the adoption of that rule, in 1985, the Oregon legislature amended ORS 692.180(l)(h) to provide that \u201c[violation of * * * regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission regulating funeral industry practice\u201d constitutes a violation of state law. In addition, OAR 830-030-0090(l)(c) expressly provides that every licensee of the board is required to comply with the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>FTC Funeral Rule and that violations of the rule \u201cmay be cause for board action.\u201d To avoid the potential constitutional problem of \u201cprospective delegation,\u201d we interpret the 1985 amendment and its implementing rules to refer to the FTC Funeral Rule as it was then written and not as an attempt to adopt rules that will change from time to time as the federal government changes its rules. <em>See Advocates for Effective Regulation v. City of Eugene, </em>160 Or App 292, 311, 981 P2d 368 (1999) (\u201cA state statute, for example, cannot incorporate future federal regulations not yet promulgated at the time of enactment; the effect of doing so is to delegate the power to amend the statute to the federal regulatory authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">It is clear that, under the applicable statutes and administrative rules, when the board takes a licensee to task for violating the FTC Funeral Rule, the board is enforcing state law. We reject petitioners\u2019 second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">B. <em>Third Assignment: Price List and Statement Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The board concluded that petitioners violated the FTC Funeral Rule and, in consequence, ORS 692.180(l)(h), by failing to provide one of their customers, Smith, with an SFGSS, that is, a statement of goods and services to be provided. In their third assignment, petitioners argue that, even assuming that the board can enforce the FTC Funeral Rule, the board misinterpreted that rule in holding that it requires funeral services providers to supply customers with a GPL and an SFGSS. According to petitioners, the FTC Funeral Rule merely sets out a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d stating that, if a provider chooses to supply customers with a GPL and an SFGSS, the provider will have complied with the law. In petitioners\u2019 view, the federal rule permits providers to negotiate freely with individual customers to reach a price that accommodates their needs, irrespective of the existence of any GPL that the licensee may have created for its own purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">As we have noted, the FTC Funeral Rule begins by defining what constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices, 16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(a), and then describes various \u201cpreventive requirements,\u201d 16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(b). The rule does state that \u201c[a]ny funeral provider who complies with the preventive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>requirements * * * is not engaged in the unfair or deceptive acts or practices defined here.\u201d 16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">It is on that last statement that petitioners rely for their contention that the \u201cpreventive requirements\u201d are not really requirements, but rather, a \u201csafe harbor.\u201d If that statement were all that the FTC Funeral Rule provided, petitioner might have a point. From a strictly logical perspective, merely because compliance with a regulatory provision establishes that the law has <em>not </em>been violated does not mean that a failure to comply with that provision necessarily means that the law <em>has </em>been violated. (Such an argument would suffer from the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The flaw in petitioners\u2019 argument, however, is that the FTC Funeral Rule says more than that. First, the \u201cpreventive requirements\u201d are just <em>that </em>\u2014 requirements, not suggestions. Second, and more important, the rule provides that, \u201c[t]o prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices[,] * * * funeral providers <em>must,\u201d </em>among other things, supply a \u201cgeneral price list,\u201d 16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(b)(4), and a \u201cstatement of funeral goods and services selected,\u201d 16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(b)(5). (Emphasis added.) Third, confirming the mandatory nature of the \u201cpreventive requirements\u201d is the fact that the FTC Funeral Rule provides that funeral providers may give customers \u201cprice information in any other format,\u201d but only <em>\u201cin addition to that required by \u00a7 453.2(b)(2), (3), and (4) so long as the statement required by \u00a7 453.2(b)(5) is given when required by the rule.\u201d </em>16 CFR \u00a7 453.2(6) (emphasis added). Thus, the rule leaves no doubt that the requirements to provide a price list and billing statement are mandatory and that the failure to do so constitutes a violation. Petitioners\u2019 arguments to the contrary cannot be reconciled with the wording of the FTC Funeral Rule. We therefore reject their third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">C. <em>First Assignment: The Mandatory Nature of GPLs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In their first assignment of error, petitioners contend that the board erred in determining that, when they (1) double-charged for cremation services, (2) charged more for goods and services than the GPL prices for those goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>and services on 34 occasions, and (3) charged more for direct cremation services than the GPL prices for those services on 37 occasions, petitioners engaged in misrepresentation or dishonesty in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(a) and (b). The board, petitioners contend, erroneously \u201cappears to have assumed that the funeral services provided * * * were subject to a regulated price structure.\u201d To the contrary, they argue, the applicable regulations require no more than the provision of a GPL upon a customer\u2019s request. If a customer requests the GPL, petitioners contend, then it may serve as the basis for discussions about prices for goods and services. But nothing in the applicable rules, petitioners insist, requires that the charges conform to those listed on the GPLs.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Petitioners\u2019 argument in support of this assignment of error is a variation of the argument concerning the SFGSSs that we just rejected. It is predicated on the notion that the reference in the FTC Funeral Rule to providing GPLs to customers is part of a \u201csafe harbor\u201d and is not actually a requirement of funeral service providers. As we have noted, however, that is a view that cannot be squared with the explicitly mandatory nature of the FTC Funeral Rule. We reject the first assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">D. <em>Fourth Assignment: Overcharging the VA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The board found that, on three occasions, petitioners submitted statements to the VA that showed charges in excess of those on the applicable GPLs and invoices given to customers, in violation of ORS 692.180(l)(a) and (b). Petitioners, in their fourth assignment of error, contend that the board erred. The precise nature of the error is not clear to us. Petitioners assert that they simply did what was \u201cnecessary to qualify the customer for the Veterans Administration benefit, and both the customer and the Veterans Administration wanted the deceased veteran to get the benefit he was due.\u201d The fact that the statements sent to the VA were in excess of the statements shown to the customers for the same services, in petitioners\u2019 view, is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The argument thus appears to rest on the same assumption that supplies the underpinning of the previous assignments \u2014 namely, that funeral services providers are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>free to charge for their goods and services at rates that may vary from customer to customer and without regard to what is stated in the GPLs and SFGSSs. As we have already concluded, that assumption is incorrect. We reject the fourth assignment without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">E. <em>Fifth Assignment: Dunning Letters</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The board found that, on two occasions, petitioners sent dunning letters to a customer demanding payment in an amount larger than what had previously been agreed. Petitioners argue that there are \u201cmitigating factors,\u201d including that the customers \u201cnever paid a dime for the services\u201d and the fact that there is no evidence that they would actually \u201chave accepted more than they were due if the billing letters had produced fruit.\u201d Moreover, they contend, the matter should be remanded to the board for reconsideration of the penalty imposed for those violations, should this court determine that the board erred in finding other violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">There appears to us to be no cognizable basis for reversing on this assignment of error. Petitioners do not challenge the board\u2019s findings for want of evidence. Nor do they assert that the violations that the board found were erroneous as a matter of law. Petitioners instead appear to ask us to reweigh the evidence to take into account certain \u201cmitigating factors.\u201d That is the board\u2019s job, however, not ours. We reject the assignment without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">F. <em>Sixth Assignment: Alteration of Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In their sixth assignment of error, petitioners contend that the board erred in determining that they violated OAR 830-030-0090(2)(b)(C) and OAR 830-040-0000(9)(b) when they altered invoices in their records. OAR 830-030-0090(2)(b)(C) prohibits \u201caltering a funeral service, cemetery or crematory record; including but not limited to, changing words/letters/numbers from the original document to mislead the reader of the record.\u201d OAR 830-040-0000(9)(b) prohibits a funeral establishment from \u201c[a]lter[ing], canceling] or obliterating] entries in permanent records for the purpose of falsifying any record required by this chapter to be made, maintained or preserved.\u201d OAR 830-040-0000(6) states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201c[a]ll licensees * * * shall keep a detailed, accurate, and permanent record of all transactions that are performed for the care and preparation and final disposition of human remains.\u201d The rule then describes what shall be included in the record, \u201cas a minimum,\u201d and lists such information as the name of the decedent, the date of death, the purchaser of services, the place where the remains are to be interred, the name of the embalmer, and documentation of permission to embalm or cremate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Petitioners contend that, because that list does not expressly refer to financial arrangements between the licensee and the customer, there is no requirement that such information be kept as a part of the permanent record and that the SFGSS is not a \u201cfuneral service, cemetery or crematory record.\u201d Accordingly, in petitioners\u2019 view, altering the SFGSS does not constitute a violation of OAR 830-030-0090(2)(b)(C) or OAR 830-040-0000(9)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Petitioners overlook the fact that, although billing statements are not expressly listed in OAR 830-040-0000(6) among the minimum requirements for the record, the list does not <em>preclude </em>other items from being a part of the \u201cpermanent record of all transactions\u201d performed for the care and preparation and final disposition of human remains. The SFGSSs that petitioners maintained for each customer were kept as a part of their record and clearly were part of the \u201cfuneral service, cemetery or crematory record\u201d that licensees were prohibited from altering by both OAR 830-030-0090(2)(b)(C) and OAR 830-040-0000(9)(b). The board did not err in determining that petitioners\u2019 conduct in altering the SFGSSs prior to sending them to the VA and prior to the compliance officer\u2019s inspection violated those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">G. <em>Seventh Assignment: Cremation Trays</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In their seventh assignment of error, petitioners contend that the board erred in determining that they violated the FTC Funeral Rule when they noted on one customer\u2019s SFGSS that a cremation tray was \u201cRequired by State.\u201d The rule provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201cit is a deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to represent that federal, state, or local laws, or particular cemeteries or crematories, require the purchase of any funeral goods or funeral services when such is not the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">16 CFR \u00a7 453.3(d)(1). Petitioners contend that cremation trays <em>are </em>in fact required by state law under OAR 830-030-0000(3) and (5), and OAR 830-030-0040(5). Petitioners reason: \u201cIt is easy to imagine the sanitary and other complications that would result if bodies were cremated without being in some sort of container.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Although the cited rules refer to cremation containers or trays, contrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, they are apparently not used during the cremation process itself, but rather for holding the remains before and after cremation. <em>See </em>OAR 830-030-0040(5) (requiring removal of metal disc from cremation container prior to cremation and placement of metal disc in cremation chamber); OAR 830-030-0050 (after cremation, all residue of the cremation process shall be removed from the cremation chamber and placed within a container or tray \u201cthat will ensure against co-mingling with other cremated remains\u201d). Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, there is no state law requiring that the customer purchase a cremation tray.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">H. <em>Eighth Assignment: Penalties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In their eighth and final assignment of error, petitioners contend that the board erred in imposing a $500 fine for each violation and revoking the licenses of each petitioner. ORS 692.180(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cIf the board finds any of the causes described in this section in regard to any person, licensee or applicant or the holder of a certificate of authority, <em>the board may impose a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation, suspend or revoke a license to practice </em>or to operate under this chapter or refuse to grant or renew a license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">(Emphasis added.) The imposition and choice of penalty for violation of laws governing funeral service providers and funeral homes is a matter within the board\u2019s discretion. Petitioners identify no basis for asserting that, in imposing a $500 fine for each violation and revoking their licenses, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>board abused its discretion. We conclude, accordingly, that the board did not err. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
