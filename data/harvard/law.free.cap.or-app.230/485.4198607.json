She assigns error to the denial of her motion to suppress drug evidence, arguing that the police conducted an unlawful stop. We agree and vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped after the car\u2019s driver made an illegal turn. Defendant appeared \u201cnervous,\u201d and the officer asked defendant for her name and date of birth to perform a warrant check. That check revealed that defendant was on probation for a drug offense. The officer returned to the car, asked defendant to get out of it, and asked for consent to search her purse, which defendant gave. The ensuing search produced drug evidence that defendant sought to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"> Under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, a \u201cstop\u201d occurs \u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) whenever an individual believes that (a), above, has occurred and such belief is objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 409-10, 813 P2d 28 (1991). A \u201cstop\u201d of the second type occurs \u201cwhenever a person <em>subjectively </em>believes that a law enforcement officer significantly has restricted or interfered with that person\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement <em>and </em>such a belief is <em>objectively reasonable </em>under the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 535, 964 P2d 1007 (1998) (emphasis in original). A belief is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d if \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have believed that the officers significantly had restricted his liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The state concedes that \u201cunder this court\u2019s current case law, this court would conclude that defendant was stopped when the officer obtained defendant\u2019s name and date of birth and had that information run through dispatch.\u201d <em>See State v. Highley, </em>219 Or App 100, 108, 180 P3d 1230 (2008); <em>State v. Rider, </em>216 Or App 308, 172 P3d 274 (2007), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>345 Or 595 (2008). Properly understood, the state\u2019s concession is that, under <em>Highley </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Rider, </em>it was objectively reasonable for defendant to believe that the officer stopped her by requesting identifying information from her and running a warrant check. Although we are not bound by the state\u2019s concession, we agree that <em>Highley </em>and <em>Rider </em>control that issue, and, accordingly, we accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">However, that does not end our inquiry. For a <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d stop to have occurred, we must also determine whether defendant subjectively believed that she was stopped. Because the trial court did not address that factual issue, we remand the case for the court to do that. Its resolution of the issue will determine whether defendant\u2019s conviction should be reinstated or her motion to suppress granted. <em>See State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 28, 200 P3d 149 (2008), <em>rev allowed, </em>346 Or 257 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
