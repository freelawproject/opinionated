J.</author>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">On wife\u2019s appeal in this dissolution case, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s property division, in which the court declined to award to wife one-half of husband\u2019s beneficial interest in his mother\u2019s revocable trust. <em>Githens and Githens, </em>227 Or App 73, 75, 204 P3d 835 (2009) (holding that husband\u2019s interest in the trust was too speculative to be considered \u201cproperty\u201d that is subject to division in a dissolution case). Respondents \u2014 husband and Moffett, a witness who was subpoenaed to testify at trial \u2014 have jointly filed a statement of costs and disbursements. They also jointly petition for their attorney fees. As we explain below, we allow husband\u2019s statement of costs and disbursements, but deny the petition for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. At the time of the dissolution, husband and wife had been married for 23 years. They owned no real property, but owned a modest amount of personal property. Husband was, however, a beneficiary of half of his mother\u2019s revocable trust, which held all of her assets. During the dissolution proceedings, wife\u2019s position was that she was entitled to a share of his interest in the trust, as part of the property division. In an attempt to ascertain the value of the assets in the trust, she issued two subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>to Moffett, husband\u2019s sister and cobeneficiary of the trust. Moffett moved to quash those subpoenas, and the trial court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The trial court declined to award wife a portion of husband\u2019s interest in the trust. Accordingly, the only property to divide was husband and wife\u2019s personal property. In part, because husband received more of the personal property than did wife, wife received an equalizing judgment of approximately $30,000. She also received an award of spousal support, given the disparity in their earning potentials: Husband is required to pay wife $500 per month for the first year and then $750 per month indefinitely. Husband is also required to pay support for their child, who lives with wife. The judgment of dissolution named only husband and wife in the case caption. Moffett never sought to intervene in the dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In her notice of appeal, however, wife added Moffett to the case caption as \u201cOther-Respondent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wife stated in the notice that she was including Moffett as a \u201cpart[y] to this appeal\u201d because of the assignment of error pertaining to the trial court\u2019s decision on Moffett\u2019s motion to quash. The case proceeded to briefing, and husband and Moffett filed a joint answering brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">As we have noted, we agreed with husband and affirmed the trial court\u2019s property division. One judge on the three-judge panel dissented. Designating \u201cRespondents\u201d as the prevailing parties, we allowed costs, to be paid by wife, and deferred an award of attorney fees subject to a subsequent motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Husband and Moffett then filed a joint statement of costs and disbursements in the amount of $405, although it appears that husband actually paid those costs. They also filed a joint petition for their attorney fees incurred on appeal pursuant to ORS 107.105(5), which authorizes an appellate court to award attorney fees in a dissolution appeal. In the petition, husband requests attorney fees in the amount of $29,793.50, and Moffett requests $5,995.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Wife objects, urging us to make no award of attorney fees to husband or to Moffett.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Regarding Moffett\u2019s request, wife contends that Moffett is not a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of ORS 107.105(5), and that, accordingly, this court has no authority to make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Regarding husband\u2019s request, wife contends that we should not exercise our discretion to award husband his attorney fees for two reasons. First, wife contends that her argument on appeal \u2014 that a beneficial interest in a revocable trust is divisible property on dissolution \u2014 was objectively reasonable. She notes that it was a case of first impression in Oregon and that her position garnered a lengthy dissenting opinion. Second, she asserts that principles of fairness and equity weigh against awarding husband his attorney fees. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>wife\u2019s view, it would be inequitable to require her to expend her entire equalizing judgment to pay husband\u2019s attorney fees, especially in light of the fact that she has incurred approximately the same amount of attorney fees as husband. She requests that we make findings pursuant to ORAP 13.10(7) in support of our decision whether to award attorney fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the event that we determine that husband is entitled to an award of attorney fees, she does not contest the reasonableness of the amount that husband requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In their reply, husband and Moffett contend that, when wife named Moffett in the notice of appeal, Moffett became a \u201cparty\u201d entitled to attorney fees under ORS 107.105(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We begin with Moffett\u2019s request for attorney fees and the question whether a person who was not a party to the dissolution proceeding is entitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal of the dissolution judgment. ORS 107.105 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c(1) Whenever the court renders a judgment of marital annulment, dissolution or separation, the court may provide in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c(a) For the future care and custody, by one party or jointly, of all minor children of the parties born, adopted or conceived during the marriage * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\"><em>\u00ab* </em>* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201c(d) For spousal support, an amount of money for a period of time as may be just and equitable for one party to contribute to the other * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\"><em>\u00abat </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">\u201c(e) For the delivery to one party of such party\u2019s personal property in the possession or control of the other at the time of the giving of judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u201c(5) If an appeal is taken from the judgment or other appealable order in a suit for annulment or dissolution of a marriage or for separation and the appellate court awards costs and disbursements to a party, the court may also award to that party, as part of the costs, such additional sum of money as it may adjudge reasonable as an attorney fee on the appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">That statute authorizes an appellate court to award costs to a \u201cparty\u201d in a dissolution of marriage. It also gives the court discretion to include, as part of those costs, a reasonable attorney fee award. The question is whether the term \u201cparty\u201d includes the recipient of a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The wording of the statute itself strongly suggests that such an individual is not a \u201cparty\u201d within the meaning of the statute, which in context appears to refer to the actual parties to the dissolution proceeding, <em>i.e., </em>the husband and the wife. ORS 107.105(l)(d), for example, refers to an award of spousal support \u201cfor one party to contribute to the other,\u201d clearly referring to the husband and the wife to the dissolution proceeding. <em>See also </em>ORS 107.105(l)(a) (referring to \u201cchildren of the parties\u201d) and ORS 107.105(l)(e) (providing for delivery of personal property of \u201cone party\u201d that is in the hands of \u201cthe other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Other provisions of ORS chapter 107 employ the term \u201cparty\u201d in a similar fashion. ORS 107.095(l)(a), for example, authorizes the court to order that \u201ca party\u201d pay the clerk of the court sufficient money to enable \u201cthe other party\u201d to prosecute or defend the suit. ORS 107.095(l)(e) authorizes the court to enter an order restraining \u201ceither party or both\u201d from encumbering or disposing of their property. ORS 107.095(l)(f) similarly authorizes the court to enter an order for the temporary use of real or personal property \u201cof the parties or either of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In <em>Holm and Holm, </em>323 Or 581, 587, 919 P2d 1164 (1996), the Oregon Supreme Court held that the term \u201cparty,\u201d as used in ORS 107.105(5), may be understood to include \u2014 in addition to the husband and the wife \u2014 a grandparent who has been granted a petition to intervene in the dissolution proceeding. The basis for the court\u2019s decision, however, was that, under ORCP 33 A, the effect of granting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>petition to intervene is to permit the moving party \u201c <em>\u2018to become a party </em>to an action between other persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holm, </em>323 Or at 586-87 (quoting ORCP 33 A) (emphasis in original). The court adhered to the requirement of the statute that only a \u201cparty\u201d to the dissolution proceeding may be awarded attorney fees under ORS 107.105(5). <em>Id. </em>at 587; <em>accord Shofner and Shofner, </em>147 Or App 1, 3, 934 P2d 641 (1997) (applying the reasoning in <em>Holm </em>and concluding that a stepfather who intervened to modify a dissolution judgment to allow him visitation with his stepchild was a \u201cpart/\u2019 for purposes of ORS 107.105(5), entitling him to his attorney fees on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Individuals who are the subjects of subpoenas are not \u201cparties\u201d to the proceeding in which the subpoenas have been issued. The discovery provisions of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure draw a distinction between \u201ca party\u201d and the nonparty \u201cperson from whom discovery is sought,\u201d ORCP 36 C, or \u201ca deponent who is not a party,\u201d ORCP 46 A(l)(b). ORCP 43 D, regarding subpoenas <em>duces tecum, </em>provides that \u201c[a] person <em>not a party </em>to the action may be compelled to produce books, papers, documents, or tangible things and to submit to an inspection thereof as provided in Rule 55.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ORCP 55, in turn, similarly draws a distinction between \u201cthe <em>party </em>serving the subpoena\u201d and \u201cthe person\u201d or \u201cthe witness\u201d to whom the subpoena is directed. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">That is not to say that the recipient of a subpoena could not become a \u201cparty\u201d to a dissolution proceeding. Depending on the circumstances, the recipient could move to intervene at trial under ORCP 33, or on appeal, <em>see Nakashima v. Board of Education, </em>204 Or App 535, 543-45, 131 P3d 749 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>344 Or 497, 185 P3d 429 (2008) (appellate courts have inherent authority to allow motions to intervene on appeal). If the petition were granted, as the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Holm, </em>the person would become a \u201cpart/\u2019 for the purposes of ORS 107.105(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In this case, Moffett was served with a subpoena. As we have noted, simply receiving a subpoena does not automatically make the recipient a \u201cparty\u201d to the underlying action. She did not elect to move to intervene, either at trial or on appeal. She is simply not a \u201cparty\u201d within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of ORS 107.105(5). Accordingly, we lack authority to award her costs of any kind, including her requested attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We turn then to husband\u2019s request for attorney fees. ORS 20.310 provides generally for an award of costs and disbursements to a prevailing party on appeal. As we have noted, ORS 107.105(5) provides that we \u201cmay\u201d award, as part of the costs, a reasonable attorney fee. ORS 20.075(1) guides our exercise of discretion and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cA court shall consider the following factors in determining whether to award attorney fees in any case in which an award of attorney fees is authorized by statute and in which the court has discretion to decide whether to award attorney fees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201c(a) The conduct of the parties in the transactions or occurrences that gave rise to the litigation, including any conduct of a party that was reckless, willful, malicious, in bad faith or illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201c(b) The objective reasonableness of the claims and defenses asserted by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201c(c) The extent to which an award of an attorney fee in the case would deter others from asserting good faith claims or defenses in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201c(d) The extent to which an award of an attorney fee in the case would deter others from asserting meritless claims and defenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u201c(e) The objective reasonableness of the parties and the diligence of the parties and their attorneys during the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">\u201c(f) The obj ective reasonableness of the parties and the diligence of the parties in pursuing settlement of the dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\"><em>a* </em>Hi * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">\u201c(h) Such other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">We must exercise our statutory authority to award attorney fees in a dissolution of marriage case in an equitable manner. <em>Haguewood and Haguewood, </em>292 Or 197, 212-14, 638 P2d 1135 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>With those principles in mind, in this case, we decline to exercise our discretion to award husband the nearly $30,000 he requests in attorney fees. We do so because both parties seem equally unable to bear substantial litigation costs. <em>See id. </em>at 213 (financial resources of the parties on dissolution is a consideration for the court in deciding whether to award attorney fees). Husband\u2019s requested amount of attorney fees is not insubstantial; in fact, it approximates the equalizing judgment that wife received on dissolution. Given that the purpose of a property distribution in a dissolution proceeding is to attempt to put the parties on a relatively equal footing and that both husband and wife have incurred substantial litigation costs, that purpose would not be served by requiring wife to pay both parties\u2019 attorney fees on appeal. Even though wife is receiving spousal support from husband, <em>see id. </em>(support orders are relevant in considering the parties\u2019 financial resources for purposes of deciding whether to award attorney fees), the amount is modest and does not justify requiring her to pay both parties\u2019 attorney fees on appeal. Furthermore, wife\u2019s position on appeal was not objectively unreasonable: The issue was one of first impression in this state, and it was resolved by a divided panel over a lengthy dissenting opinion. For those reasons, we agree with wife that this is not an appropriate case in which to exercise our discretion to require either party to bear the other\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Given our holding in this case, it is necessary for us to change our prevailing party designation. Because Moffett was not a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of ORS 107.105(5), she was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d on appeal; husband is the only prevailing party in this appeal. Accordingly, we deny Moffett her petition for costs, including her attorney fees. We allow husband\u2019s costs and disbursements, but we deny his petition for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Husband\u2019s statement of costs and disbursements in the amount of $405 allowed; husband and Moffett\u2019s petition for attorney fees denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\"> Wife\u2019s notice of appeal originally named Moffett as \u201cWitness-Respondent.\u201d Moffett was eventually included in the case caption on appeal as \u201cOther-Respondent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-14\"> ORAP 13.10(7) provides, in part, that \u201c[a] party to a proceeding under this rule may request findings regarding the facts and legal criteria that relate to any claim or objection concerning attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
