One of mother\u2019s assignments of error is that the judgments do not comport with the requirements of ORS 419B.476(5), because they do not explain why placement with mother is not appropriate. We agree that the judgments are defective, for an even more fundamental reason. The judgments are essentially boilerplate recitations and, at various points, incorporate by reference certain \u201cattached report(s).\u201d For example, the judgments state that the court \u201cfinds that the attached reports(s) from Department of Human Services / Child Welfare Division do accurately set forth the ward\u2019s school attendance; length of attendance at each school,\u201d and that \u201cDepartment of Human Services / Child Welfare Division has made diligent efforts to place the child with a suitable relative, set forth in the report(s) attached hereto and the record herein.\u201d No reports are attached to the judgments, and it is impossible to determine what reports the court intended to incorporate. In fact, the state concedes on appeal that the \u201creport(s)\u201d to which the judgments refer might not even be part of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Those defects in the judgments preclude meaningful review in this appeal. We cannot determine what the trial court relied on, or whether we should defer in any way to the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations. For that reason, we reverse and remand the judgments so that the trial court can remedy those defects. <em>Cf. State ex rel DHS v. M. A., </em>227 Or App 172, 183, 183 n 10, 205 P3d 36 (2009) (reversing and remanding judgment that failed to comply with ORS 419B.476(5) and noting that \u201cthe court did not incorporate by reference or otherwise adopt the caseworker\u2019s court report; in any event, that alone would have been insufficient in this case to satisfy the requirements of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
