J.</author>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for, <em>inter alia, </em>felony murder, ORS 163.115(l)(b), assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s demurrer and its refusal to give defendant\u2019s requested special jury instruction. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in both respects because the state failed to allege in the indictment, and the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it was required to find, that defendant must have acted with a culpable mental state of at least criminal negligence in causing the death of the victim. As explained below, we conclude that the felony murder statute, ORS 163.115(l)(b), does not require that the state allege and prove that the defendant acted with any particular culpable mental state in causing the death of the victim; rather, the defendant\u2019s commission or attempted commission of the predicate felony establishes, as a matter of law, the requisite <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the victim\u2019s death. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The following facts are not in dispute. Sometime during the night of April 3 or the morning of April 4, 2004, defendant broke into the victim\u2019s home, robbed her of several green marijuana plants and various household items, and attempted to rape and sexually abuse her. The following evening the victim was found dead, lying face down on the floor next to her bed. Her long john pants had been pulled down to one ankle and her T-shirts had been pulled up to breast level. A bed sheet was tied around one of the victim\u2019s legs and then loosely tied to her bedpost.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The cause of the victim\u2019s death was determined to be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to emphysema.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim suffered from severe COPD, which was acutely exacerbated by the burglary, attempted rape, and attempted sexual abuse, and ultimately led to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Based on those events, a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with, <em>inter alia, </em>felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>murder, ORS 163.115(l)(b) (Count l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">\u201cExcept as provided in ORS 163.118 and 163.125, <em>criminal homicide constitutes </em>murder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u00ed\u00edij; ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\u201c(b) When it is committed by a person, acting either alone or with one or more persons, who commits or attempts to commit any of the following crimes and in the course of and in furtherance of the crime the person is committing or attempting to commit, or during the immediate flight therefrom, the person, or another participant if there be any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u00ab *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201c(C) Burglary in the first degree as defined in ORS 164.225[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d provisions are set out in ORS 163.005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">\u201c(1) A person commits criminal homicide if, without justification or excuse, the person <em>intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence </em>causes the death of another human being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">\u201c(2) \u2018Criminal homicide\u2019 is murder, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or aggravated vehicular homicide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>As relevant here, the indictment alleged that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">\u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally commit the crime of Burglary in the First Degree, and in the course of, and in furtherance of, the crime which the defendant was committing, and attempting to commit, defendant caused the death of [the victim], a human being, who was not a participant in said crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Before trial, defendant demurred to the felony murder count. In particular, defendant asserted that \u201cthe facts stated do not constitute an offense,\u201d ORS 135.630(4), because they did not allege \u201cthat [defendant] acted with any mental state in connection with the death of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Defendant reasoned as follows: (1) Felony murder under ORS 163.115(l)(b) is a species of \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d\u2014 that is, there can be no felony murder unless there is a \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d; (2) a person can commit \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d under ORS 163.005(1) only if he or she \u201cintentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence causes the death of another human being\u201d; and (3) thus, a defendant cannot be convicted of felony murder unless the state pleads and proves that the defendant caused the death of the victim with a culpable mental state of at least criminal negligence. In sum, defendant contended that the indictment failed to allege felony murder under ORS 163.115(l)(b) in this case because, although the indictment alleged that defendant had intentionally committed the predicate crime of burglary, it failed to allege that he had caused the death of the victim with a culpable mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The state responded that the felony murder statute does not require that the state plead and prove that the defendant acted with any culpable mental state in connection with the death of the victim; rather, the state is required to plead and prove only that the defendant acted with a culpable mental state in committing, or attempting to commit, the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s demurrer. The court explained its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u201cFelony murder is a form of murder that is committed during the course of certain [enumerated] crimes, including burglary and robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">* * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cIf they didn\u2019t cause the death, then it\u2019s not felony murder. * * * I don\u2019t think they have to double allege that it was intentional burglary along with an intentional, reckless, knowingly, or with criminal negligence [homicide].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">After the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the state had not offered evidence that defendant acted with a culpable mental state in causing the victim\u2019s death. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Before the case was submitted to the jury, defendant requested a special jury instruction that would, as pertinent here, have required the jury to find that defendant \u201cknowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence caused the death of [the victim].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court declined to give that instruction and did not instruct the jury that it must find that defendant acted with a culpable mental state in causing the victim\u2019s death. Rather, the court instructed the jury that it could convict defendant if it found, in addition to the other required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>elements, that \u201c[defendant] caused the death of [the victim].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Defendant timely excepted to that instruction, and to the court\u2019s failure to give his requested instruction. Defendant reiterated that the jury could not convict him of felony murder unless it found that he had acted with a culpable mental state in causing the victim\u2019s death. The jury ultimately found defendant guilty of felony murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his demurrer and its refusal to give his requested special jury instruction on felony murder. The parties primarily renew their contentions raised before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Before turning to the particulars of the parties\u2019 contentions on appeal, it is important to understand the historical context of the applicable statutes \u2014 and, specifically, the felony murder rule embodied in ORS 163.115(l)(b). The legislature adopted ORS 163.005 and ORS 163.115 in 1971 as part of an overall revision of the criminal code. <em>See </em>Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7\u00a7 87-88, 84-85 (July 1970). \u201cCriminal homicide\u201d was a new offense created during the 1971 revision and, thus, had no preexisting history in Oregon law. <em>See </em>Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 87(C), 84 (July 1970) (Commentary).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">At the time that the 1971 omnibus revisions were adopted, the felony murder rule had been codified in Oregon for over a century. The felony murder rule was first codified in Oregon in 1864 as part of both the first-degree and second-degree murder statutes. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1864, ch 43, \u00a7\u00a7 502-03. In 1864, the first-degree and second-degree murder statutes provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cSec. 502. If any person shall, purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, <em>or in the commission or attempt to commit any rape, arson, robbery or burglary, kill another, </em>such person shall be deemed guilty of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u201cSec. 503. If any person shall purposely and maliciously, but without deliberation and premeditation, <em>or in the commission or attempt to commit any felony, other than rape, arson, robbery or burglary, kill another, </em>such person shall be deemed guilty of murder in the second degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">General Laws of Oregon, Crim Code, ch XLIII, \u00a7\u00a7 502-03, p 527 (Deady 1845-1864) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">As early as 1879, the Supreme Court held that the felony murder provision of the first-degree murder statute did not require that the defendant act purposely in regard to killing the victim if the defendant killed the victim in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>commission or attempt to commit one of the felonies enumerated under that statute. <em>State of Oregon v. Brown, </em>7 Or 186, 198 (1879). Rather, the court explained, the intent to kill was \u201cincontrovertibly implied\u201d from the state\u2019s proof of the defendant\u2019s participation in the felony and the death resulting from that participation. <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant, with two other persons, entered a pawnshop in Portland, assaulted the shop owner, and took items from his safe. <em>Id. </em>at 195. While attempting to escape, the defendant fired at an officer but missed; his bullet struck a tree, glanced off, and killed a little boy. <em>Id. </em>The defendant demurred to the indictment, arguing that it did not allege that the defendant acted purposely with respect to the death of the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 196-97. The defendant also requested a jury instruction that would have required the jury to find that it was \u201c \u2018necessary that the killing be purposely done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. The trial court denied the demurrer and declined to give the requested instruction; the jury convicted the defendant and sentenced him to death. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed. The court first upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s demurrer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cIn an indictment for murder in the first degree under our code it is necessary to allege that the killing was done purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, except in cases where the killing was done in the commission or attempt to commit any rape, arson, robbery or burglary, in which cases it is not necessary to allege in the indictment that the killing was done either purposely or with deliberate and premeditated malice. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201cWhen a homicide takes place in the commission of a robbery it is not necessary, in order to constitute murder in the first degree, that the one perpetrating it should purposely kill the person slain, and where purpose is not required to constitute the crime it need not be alleged in the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 198. The Supreme Court also sustained the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction and affirmed the court\u2019s instruction to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c \u2018Under this indictment it is not necessary to prove expressly either a purpose to kill, or deliberate and premeditated malice. The indictment having alleged the killing in the perpetration of a robbery, it is only required that the robbery and the killing, in the manner alleged, during the robbery, be proven to make out the case. In such a case, and under such proof, <em>the intent to kill and the deliberate and premeditated malice are incontrovertibly </em>implied.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 204 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court explained its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cThe defendant was accused in the indictment of having killed [the victim] in the commission of a robbery, and if the evidence given on the trial satisfied the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that such was the fact, then no purpose or intention to kill was required to be proven in order to constitute murder in the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Following <em>Brown, </em>Oregon courts consistently construed the felony murder rule, incorporated in both the first- and second-degree murder statutes, to contain no distinct or independent <em>mens rea </em>requirement in relation to the death of the victim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Branch, </em>244 Or 97, 100, 415 P2d 766 (1966) (\u201c[A] malignant purpose is established by proof of the defendant\u2019s other felony * * *.\u201d); <em>State v. Dorland, </em>161 Or 403, 404, 89 P2d 595 (1939) (\u201c[I]t is not necessary for the indictment to allege or the state to prove that [the killing] was done purposely or with deliberate and premeditated malice. It is sufficient if it be alleged and proved that the killing was done while the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempt to commit any of [the enumerated felonies][.]\u201d); <em>State v. Morris, </em>83 Or 429, 445, 163 P 567 (1917) (affirming correctness of instruction that, if the state proves that the defendant committed larceny, \u201cthe intent to kill is implied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Those holdings comported with the overarching purpose of the felony murder rule \u2014 that is, \u201cto relieve the state of the burden of proving premeditation or malice whenever the victim\u2019s death [was] caused by the killer while the killer [was] committing another felony.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>244 Or at 99-100. Consistently with that purpose, even deaths that were caused accidentally during the commission or attempt to commit a felony constituted murder under the felony murder rule. <em>See, e.g., State v. Wilson, </em>182 Or 681, 691-92, 189 P2d 403 (1948) (holding that the accidental discharge of the defendant\u2019s gun during the commission of a robbery constituted first-degree murder under the felony murder rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In short, as of the time the legislature adopted the 1971 criminal code, including ORS 163.115(l)(b), Oregon\u2019s long-established felony murder rule operated to impose liability for all homicides occurring during the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a felony without the necessity of proving the relation between the homicide and the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Rather, the defendant\u2019s commission of or attempt to commit the predicate felony established as a matter of law the requisite <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the causation of the victim\u2019s death. <em>See, e.g., Morris, </em>83 Or at 445.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We will address the legislative history of ORS 163.115(l)(b) in detail below, but it bears present, preliminary emphasis that nothing in that 1971 legislative history suggests that the legislature intended to change the \u201cincontrovertibly implied intent\u201d feature of Oregon\u2019s felony murder rule as consistently judicially applied for over a century. Rather, the legislative history reveals the opposite. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>for the last 38 years, since 1971, Oregon courts \u2014 albeit without expressly addressing the particular arguments now presented for our consideration \u2014 have continued to treat felony murder as requiring no distinct or independent <em>mens rea </em>with respect to causation of the victim\u2019s death. <em>See, e.g., State v. Quinn, </em>290 Or 383, 405 n 8, 623 P2d 630 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005) (under ORS 163.115(l)(b), \u201cthe jury need only find the intent necessary for burglary, intent to kill is not an element of felony murder\u201d); <em>State v. Burnell, </em>129 Or App 105, 109, 877 P2d 1228 (1994) (\u201cThe felony murder statute * * * requires an intent to commit the underlying felony, but has no <em>mens rea </em>causation of death requirement.\u201d); <em>State v. Sparklin, </em>61 Or App 608, 611, 658 P2d 571, <em>aff'd, </em>296 Or 85, 672 P2d 1182 (1983) (\u201cThe implied malice in the felony murder concept has been recognized in the common law and now legislatively to be an appropriate method of establishing the culpable mental state for intentional homicide.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Against that backdrop, we turn to the substance of the parties\u2019 contentions on appeal: Did the 1971 criminal code so alter Oregon\u2019s felony murder rule as to abrogate the imputed <em>mens rea </em>feature, thereby requiring the state to plead and prove that the defendant acted with a distinct <em>mens rea </em>with respect to causing the death of the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The answer lies in the proper construction and application of ORS 163.115(l)(b), and, particularly, its proper interrelationship with the \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d provisions contained in ORS 163.005(1) and (2). Accordingly, we apply the principles of statutory construction explained in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), beginning with the text in context. After examining the text and context, even if we do not perceive an ambiguity in the statute\u2019s text, we will consult legislative history that has been proffered by a party where that legislative history appears useful to our analysis. ORS 174.020(3); <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Defendant, as noted, contends that the legislature fundamentally altered the felony murder rule when it revised the criminal code in 1971, so as to require the state to plead and prove that, in causing the victim\u2019s death, the defendant acted with a culpable <em>mens rea </em>distinct and independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>from the <em>mens rea </em>pertaining to the defendant\u2019s commission or attempted commission of the predicate felony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That proposition rests on the combination of two features of the 1971 legislation that continue to be embodied in the current statute. First, ORS 163.005, the general \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d statute, which had no direct antecedent in Oregon homicide laws, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">\u201c(1) A person commits criminal homicide if, without justification or excuse, the person <em>intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence </em>causes the death of another human being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201c(2) \u2018Criminal homicide\u2019 is murder, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or aggravated vehicular homicide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">(Emphasis added.) Second, ORS 163.115, the general murder statute, which includes the felony murder provision, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201c(1) Except as provided in ORS 163.118 and 163.125, <em>criminal homicide constitutes murder:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">\u201c(b) When it is committed by a person, acting either alone or with one or more persons, who commits or attempts to commit any of the following crimes and in the course of and in furtherance of the crime the person is committing or attempting to commit, or during the immediate flight therefrom, the person, or another participant if there be any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">\u201c(C) Burglary in the first degree as defined in ORS 164.225[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant, invoking the emphasized aspects of those statutes, asserts that (1) felony murder is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>type of \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d; (2) to constitute \u201ccriminal homicide,\u201d the defendant must cause the death of the victim with a <em>mens rea </em>of at least criminal negligence as to that death; and (3) consequently, a defendant cannot commit felony murder unless the defendant acts with at least criminal negligence in causing the death of the victim in the course of and in furtherance of the predicate felony that the defendant committed or attempted to commit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The state responds that the 1971 legislature intended to adhere to Oregon\u2019s long-established formulation of felony murder. The state emphasizes that the text of ORS 163.115(l)(b) is devoid of any language of any distinct, independent <em>mens rea </em>requirement in connection with causing the death of the victim. Further, the state notes that the statute does not require the defendant to have <em>personally </em>caused the death of the victim, viz., a defendant may be criminally liable under ORS 163.115(l)(b) even if an accomplice or co-felon causes the death of the victim. Thus, the state posits, the legislature did not intend for the defendant to act with a particular <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the victim\u2019s death in order to be held accountable for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The state further remonstrates that the criminal homicide provisions in ORS 163.005(1) and (2) do not support defendant\u2019s contentions. According to the state, although subsection (1) provides that a person commits criminal homicide if the person \u201cintentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence\u201d causes the death of another human being, nothing in that statute mandates that those are the <em>only </em>ways to commit criminal <em>homicide </em>\u2014 viz., the legislature did not intend subsection (1) to be the exclusive means of committing criminal homicide. In support of that contention, the state argues that subsection (2) defines \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d to include \u201cmurder\u201d and, accordingly, any of the subspecies of murder listed in ORS 163.115(1) and, specifically, ORS 163.115(l)(b), constitute \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d regardless of whether the particular murder statute requires that a defendant act with a culpable mental state with respect to the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The parties\u2019 contending constructions of the statutes are both plausible. As we have consistently emphasized, the threshold of \u201cplausibility\u201d \u2014 and, thus, of statutory ambiguity \u2014 is undemanding. <em>See Godfrey v. Fred Meyer Stores, </em>202 Or App 673, 686, 124 P3d 621 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 672 (2006) (\u201c[T]he threshold of ambiguity is a low one. It does not require that competing constructions be equally tenable. It requires only that a competing construction not be \u2018wholly implausible.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Owens v. MVD, </em>319 Or 259, 268, 875 P2d 463 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">There is, to be sure, a straightforward syllogistical appeal to defendant\u2019s proposed construction. Most simply: Felony murder is a species of \u201cmurder\u201d; murder is a species of \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d; \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d requires that a defendant act with a culpable <em>mens rea </em>in causing the victim\u2019s death; therefore, a defendant cannot be guilty of felony murder unless the defendant acted with a culpable mental state with respect to the causation of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Conversely, and particularly given the context of the historical application and development of the felony murder doctrine in Oregon, the state\u2019s proposed construction is also plausible. Unlike other provisions of the murder statute, ORS 163.115, which expressly refer to a culpable mental <em>state </em>\u2014 see, <em>e.g., </em>ORS 163.115(l)(a) (criminal homicide constitutes murder when it is committed \u201cintentionally\u201d), ORS 163.115(l)(c) (murder \u201c[b]y abuse\u201d when the death is, <em>inter alia, </em>caused \u201crecklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d) \u2014 the felony murder provision, ORS 163.115(l)(b), includes no express <em>mens rea </em>requirement. Viewed in the context of the historical understanding of the felony murder rule in Oregon, it is not \u201cwholly implausible\u201d that that omission was deliberate. That is, no distinct culpable mental state was specified because the requisite <em>mens rea </em>as to causing the victim\u2019s death is imputed, as a matter of law, from the defendant\u2019s commission or attempted commission of the predicate felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Because it appears useful to our analysis, we turn to the parties\u2019 proffered legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As noted, ORS 163.005 and ORS 163.115 were enacted as part of the 1971 Legislative Assembly\u2019s comprehensive revision of Oregon\u2019s criminal code. That revision began with the creation, in 1967, of the Crhninal Law Revision Commission. <em>State v.

As the Supreme Court recently reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201c \u2018The Commission divided responsibility for drafting the revised criminal code among three subcommittees. Those subcommittees produced drafts of the code and submitted those drafts, together with commentaries on them, to the Commission, which produced a final draft of the proposed code and presented the final draft and commentary to the legislature.

In contrast, ORS 163.005(2), rather than defining the scope of \u201ccriminal homicide,\u201d broke \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d into three species: murder, manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>That legislative history substantiates defendant\u2019s understanding of the proper operation of, and interplay between, ORS 163.005(1) and (2). <em>See </em>230 Or App at 49-50 n 12. That is, subsection (1) is a definition section prescribing the common requisites of all types of criminal homicide, including felony murder as a subspecies of murder, and subsection (2) does not function as a sort of alternative definitional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The question remains, however: What was, and is, the effect of ORS 163.005 on the operation of the felony murder rule, as codified at ORS 163.115(l)(b)?

The Model Penal Code\u2019s felony murder statute required that the defendant cause the death of the victim \u201crecklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,\u201d with a rebuttable presumption that the defendant acted with such recklessness and indifference if the defendant was engaged or was an accomplice in the commission of or attempt to commit a felony. <em>See </em>II Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 210.2(l)(b), 13 (1980) (Model Penal Code).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By requiring a minimum culpable mental state of recklessness as to causing the death of the victim, the Model Penal Code \u201cabandon[ed] felony murder as a separate basis for establishing liability for homicide.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 210.2, comment 6 at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">New York, on the other hand, took a less \u201cliberal\u201d approach to the felony murder doctrine. The New York statute retained the historical feature of imputing <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the victim\u2019s death from the defendant\u2019s commission or attempted commission of the predicate felony, <em>see, e.g., People v.

Platt of the University of Oregon School of Law, one of the authors of the Code, <em>see State v.

Tape Recording, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No 2, Oct 22,1969, Tape 85, Side 1 (statement of Professor George M. Platt, University of Oregon School of Law). Professor Platt explained that the availability of an affirmative defense was important due to the harsh nature of the felony murder rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cI think it should be a part of the homicide and certainly the murder statute because <em>we have approached the outer limits of the </em>mens rea <em>requirements with respect to murder in the felony-murder doctrine. In effect what we have is strict liability </em>when one who sets out to commit a lesser felony with no <em>mens rea </em>\u2014 with no mental element of intending to kill anyone \u2014 winds up as a murderer. <em>Now that in most cases will still continue to be the case because of the way we\u2019ve got it drafted </em>but there will be a door through which the very unusual defendant will be able to exit from the charge of murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Tape Recording, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No 2, Nov 14,1969, Tape 87, Side 1 (statement of Professor Platt) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In sum, the Commission\u2019s proposed approach, which the legislature adopted, was to continue to follow the existing \u201cimputed <em>mens rea\u201d </em>formulation with the sole qualification of the circumstantially limited affirmative defense, under which a defendant bears the burden of proving five cumulative elements. <em>See </em>ORS 163.115(3)(a) - (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The legislative history of the 1971 criminal code, specifically ORS 163.005(1) and ORS 163.115(l)(b), shows that the enactment of the former was not intended to impose a requirement that a distinct and independent <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the causation of the death be pleaded and proved under the latter. Rather, the two provisions can, and must, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>harmonized in such a way that (1) under ORS 163.005(1), all types of \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d require that a defendant act with a culpable <em>mens rea </em>with respect to causing the victim\u2019s death; and (2) for that particular subspecies of criminal homicide that is \u201cfelony murder,\u201d the requisite culpable <em>mens rea </em>pertaining to the death is established, as a matter of law,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> by the defendant\u2019s commission or attempted commission of the predicate felony.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Given that understanding of the applicable statutes, the trial court did not err either in denying defendant\u2019s demurrer to the felony murder charge or in declining to give defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> COPD is a reduction in the ability to exchange gases and oxygenate the blood.

New Jersey courts have interpreted its felony murder statute as not requiring any <em>mens rea </em>(apart from that imputed by virtue of the commission of or attempt to commit the underlying felony) in connection with causing the death of the victim. <em>See, e.g., State v.
