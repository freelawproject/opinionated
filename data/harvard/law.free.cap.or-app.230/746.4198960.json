He advances two assignments of error. He first contends that the trial court\u2019s \u201cunreasonable, myopic and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness\u201d and its \u201csingle minded obsession with pushing this case to trial\u201d amounted to an abuse of discretion when the court denied his last-minute motion from his third, newly retained counsel for a continuance of the trial. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on that matter, pausing only to comment that <em>ad hominem </em>attacks on trial judges are not helpful. <em>See Tahvili v. Washington Mutual Bank, </em>224 Or App 96, 108, 197 P3d 541 (2008) (\u2018We have repeatedly, in both published opinions and public professional fora, condemned <em>ad hominem </em>attacks on trial judges as offensive and improper.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erred in admitting a laboratory report testing a sample of defendant\u2019s urine, over defendant\u2019s objection that the criminalist who performed the tests did not testify. The evidence related to one of the DUII convictions and to the reckless driving conviction. The state concedes the error of that ruling under <em>State v. Birchfield, </em>342 Or 624, 157 P3d 216 (2007). We agree that the trial court erred in admitting the lab report.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Convictions on Counts 3 and 4 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
