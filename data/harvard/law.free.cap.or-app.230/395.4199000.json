On appeal, she assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence obtained through what she argues was an unlawful search of the motel room where she was living. The trial court ruled that the search was lawful because police officers had probable cause to arrest two people whom they observed loading the copper wire into a car and then entering the room, and that exigent circumstances justified police in entering the motel room to arrest those people. For the reasons that follow, we agree. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The following facts are either undisputed or taken from the trial court\u2019s findings and supported by constitutionally sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). Portland Police Officer McKinlay responded to a call reporting that two people were loading copper wire into a car parked in front of a motel in Portland. The motel was \u201csomewhat dilapidated\u201d and located in a \u201chigh-crime area.\u201d McKinlay, wearing a police uniform and driving a marked police car, drove to the motel and saw two people leaning over a car that matched the one that the caller had described. When he got out of his police car and approached them, they immediately turned and walked toward the motel, leaving the car door open. McKinlay yelled at them to stop. One of the people turned and made eye contact with him, but both continued to walk into a motel room, closing the door behind them. In what he presumed to be their car, McKinlay saw a large coil of copper wire stripped of its plastic sheathing and partially covered by a blanket. He also noticed a large amount of plastic sheathing scattered around a dumpster approximately 75 feet away. He testified that, based on his experience with metal theft cases, he knew that people who steal copper wire commonly remove its sheathing to increase its resale value. He therefore believed that the wire was stolen and that he had probable cause to make an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Two officers arrived to provide back-up. Officer Jeardeau walked to the back of the motel to watch for people trying to escape while McKinlay and the other officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>knocked on the motel room door. Someone opened the door slightly, handed the officers a lawyer\u2019s business card, and told them to leave. The officers knocked again, and again someone opened the door slightly. The occupants yelled obscenities at the officers. McKinlay tried to put his foot in the door to keep it open, but someone inside slammed it closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">At that point, the officers at the door heard Jeardeau yell that somebody was trying to escape through a back window. McKinlay surmised (in his words) that the officers \u201cneeded to make entry in order to prevent their escape.\u201d The officers kicked down the door. Inside the room, which was registered to defendant, they found a large quantity of copper wire as well as spool, wire strippers, and bolt cutters. Some of the equipment was marked with PGE stamps. One of the officers called PGE and learned that copper wire and bolt cutters had recently been stolen from a PGE lot in Beaverton. The officers arrested all eight people inside the motel room, including defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Defendant was charged with theft in the first degree, ORS 164.057. The trial court, relying primarily on <em>State v. Wesson, </em>40 Or App 99, 594 P2d 429 (1979), denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence derived from what defendant alleged was an unlawful search of the motel room. First, the court concluded that, based on what McKinlay observed outside the motel room, \u201cthe officers had reasonable and subjective probable cause to believe that there was a metal theft crime in progress.\u201d Second, the court concluded that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry into the motel room was justified by exigent circumstances, specifically, \u201cthe possibility of escape, which was confirmed when one of the officers who was in the back yelled that there was, in fact, a person * * * trying to escape through the bathroom window.\u201d Defendant was then tried by jury and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress, arguing, first, that McKinlay\u2019s observations did not give rise to probable cause because he did not know that the wire was stolen and, second, that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry into the motel room was not justified by exigent circumstances. The state, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>response, argues that McKinlay had probable cause to arrest the people whom he observed in the parking lot and that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry into the motel room was justified to prevent the suspects\u2019 escape. Whether the facts supported by constitutionally adequate evidence require granting a motion to suppress is a question of law. <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 10, 115 P3d 908 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">As an initial matter, although we agree with the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusions, we agree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Wesson </em>is misplaced. In <em>Wesson, </em>officers saw two men standing next to a car that was parked illegally with its doors open, surrounded by stereo equipment; when an officer asked one of the men to stop, he looked at the officer and then walked into a house. 40 Or App at 101. Noting that our case law defined \u201cprobable cause\u201d as \u201c \u2018a well warranted suspicion\u2019justifying a reasonable [person] in the belief that a certain set of facts exists,\u201d we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cthe improper parking of the car with its doors left open, the defendant\u2019s presence in the immediate vicinity of the car, the officers\u2019 appearance in uniform and in a marked patrol car, and the defendant\u2019s retreat from the area despite an officer\u2019s request that he halt are facts rising to the level of \u2018well warranted suspicion.\u2019 Having probable cause to arrest, the officer had a right to enter the house to effect the arrest. ORS 133.235(5). Since defendant was aware the officer was after him, the officer had authority to enter the house without a warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Wesson, </em>40 Or App at 103 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Although the facts in <em>Wesson </em>are similar to the facts in the present case, we no longer define \u201cprobable cause\u201d as \u201ca well warranted suspicion.\u201d <em>See State v. Verdine, </em>290 Or 553, 557, 624 P2d 580 (1981) (\u201c[A] suspicion, no matter how well founded, does not rise to the level of probable cause.\u201d). Further, shortly after we decided Wesson, the Supreme Court held that probable cause to arrest may justify the issuance of a warrant, but does not in itself justify officers in making a forced entry into a suspect\u2019s home. <em>State v. Olson, </em>287 Or 157, 164-65, 598 P2d 670 (1979). Instead, to justify a warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>entry into a residence in order to make an arrest, police must demonstrate both probable cause to arrest and exigent circumstances (or some other exception to the warrant requirement) justifying the entry. <em>Id.; State v. Roberts, </em>75 Or App 292, 295, 706 P2d 564 (1985). Here, we conclude, both probable cause and exigency existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">A law enforcement officer has probable cause to arrest a person if the officer believes that the person has committed a crime and the officer\u2019s belief is objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>State v. Vasquez-Villagomez, </em>346 Or 12, 23, 203 P3d 193 (2009). In evaluating the objective reasonableness of an officer\u2019s belief, we examine the totality of the circumstances, including the officer\u2019s training and experience, although such training and experience by itself does not suffice. <em>State v. Jacobs, </em>187 Or App 330, 333, 67 P3d 408 (2003). If, under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the officer\u2019s belief is reasonable, the arrest is lawfully grounded in probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In the present case, there is no dispute that McKinlay believed that the crime of theft had been committed; the only question is whether that belief was objectively reasonable. The state argues that it was, because (1) a caller reported that people were loading copper wire into a car at a specified location; (2) when McKinlay arrived at the location, he saw two people leaning over a car that matched the one that the caller had described; (3) when McKinlay approached the people as they were walking away from the car and asked them to stop, one turned and made eye contact with him, but both continued into the motel room, closing the door behind them; and (4) McKinlay saw copper wire in the car and wire sheathing in the dumpster, which, based on his specific and relevant experience, he believed was consistent with the crime of metal theft. Defendant, however, argues that McKinlay did not know that the wire was stolen \u2014 he only suspected as much \u2014 and that that is not enough to give rise to probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We conclude that McKinlay\u2019s belief that the people he saw near the reported car had committed the crime of metal theft was objectively reasonable. It is true that neither a general invocation of his \u201ctraining and experience,\u201d without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>more, nor the fact that the suspects did not want to talk to him, would, alone, create probable cause to believe that the suspects had committed a crime. However, we examine the totality of the circumstances. Here, McKinlay testified to direct, relevant experience with metal theft and how it is typically accomplished. The evidence that he saw in plain view was consistent with that crime having been committed by the automobile\u2019s occupants. And, while it is conceivable that the facts might have had an innocent explanation, we cannot think of one that is not extremely far-fetched \u2014 that is, improbable. The trial court therefore properly concluded that McKinlay had probable cause to arrest the people he saw enter defendant\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"> We also conclude that there were exigent circumstances. \u201cAn exigent circumstance is a situation that requires the police to act swiftly to prevent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall a suspect\u2019s escape or the destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 126, 806 P2d 92 (1991). In the present case, we agree with the trial court that the officers\u2019 entry was justified by exigent circumstances when \u201cone of the officers who was in the back yelled that there was, in fact, a person * * * trying to escape through the bathroom window.\u201d We note two important factors that compel this conclusion. First, Jeardeau, who alerted the officers at the front door about the escape attempt, was watching the back of the motel from the other side of a six-foot-high fence enclosing an area at the rear of the motel. From that vantage point, he could see a back window of defendant\u2019s room, but if an occupant had fled from that window, and the occupant was more nimble than Jeardeau, Jeardeau could not have detained him without giving chase. Thus, the situation here does not require us to decide, and we do not decide, whether exigent circumstances justifying entrance into a residence exist when police officers are positioned so as to guarantee that no escape is possible. Second, it is true that an occupant did begin to attempt an escape and, seeing Jeardeau, decided not to do so before completing his exit from the window. But the only information that Jeardeau communicated to the officers at the front door \u2014 that is, to the officers who actually effected the entry \u2014 was that an occupant was attempting to escape. They knew that fact before they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>entered and, in fact, McKinlay testified that he had entered <em>because </em>he was alerted to an ongoing escape attempt. McKinlay, then, reasonably believed, based on Jeardeau\u2019s report, that a suspect was escaping; under such circumstances, Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, does not require that \u201cpolice officers wait at the threshold while a suspect flees.\u201d <em>State v. Cota, </em>66 Or App 650, 665, 675 P2d 1101, <em>rev den, </em>297 Or 124 (1984) (Rossman, J., dissenting). The officers\u2019 entry was justified by probable cause and exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
