He asserts that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on those charges and in admitting his codefendant\u2019s redacted statements without an opportunity for cross-examination, in violation of his confrontation right under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issues presented here are very similar to those in <em>State v. Navarrete-Pech, </em>230 Or App 157, 213 P3d 1262 (2009), and, because defendant was tried jointly with the defendant in <em>Navarrete-Pech, </em>the evidentiary record is identical. In this case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA, but that it did err in admitting his codefendant\u2019s testimonial statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We further conclude that that error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On May 12, 2006, defendant drove to an apartment complex in Portland with three passengers in his vehicle. One of the passengers was defendant\u2019s codefendant at trial, Navarrete-Pech (codefendant). The other two passengers were never arrested, and are referred to by their nicknames, \u2018Yucca\u201d and \u201cChacua.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chacua left the vehicle when it arrived and was not involved in the assaults or attempted murder. Yucca left the vehicle shortly after Chacua did and began speaking with three individuals \u2014 the victim, Jaime, and Kiler \u2014 who were sitting on the apartment stairs, drinking beer. Yucca talked to them about a past fight, but they responded that they did not know what he was talking about. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Yucca told either Kiler or the victim that he looked like a man who had hit him in the head with a bottle during the previous fight. Yucca then returned to the vehicle, where defendant and codefendant were waiting. Shortly thereafter, Yucca, defendant, and codefendant returned to the apartments and approached the victim, Jaime, and Kiler. Yucca asked for a beer and, simultaneously, punched the victim in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Jaime responded by punching Yucca and shoving him. After being shoved, Yucca was located about 10 feet away from the victim and Jaime, who were standing close to each other. Yucca pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the victim and Jaime. Jaime threw his beer bottle at Yucca and taunted him. Yucca then stated to the victim, \u201cMother fucker, I told you I\u2019d whoop your ass.\u201d At that point, according to the victim, either defendant or codefendant tried to \u201cget involved\u201d but was prevented from doing so by the victim\u2019s friends, who had come out of one of the apartments after the altercation began.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Jaime continued to argue with Yucca, while the victim began moving toward the doorway of the apartment. Codefendant then told Yucca, \u201c[J]ust kill him and let\u2019s go\u201d or \u201c[S]hoot him.\u201d Yucca fired in the direction of the victim and Jaime, and a bullet struck the victim in the arm. After the shooting, defendant and codefendant ran to defendant\u2019s vehicle. Shortly thereafter, Yucca arrived at the vehicle. Defendant drove away with Yucca and codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Both defendant and codefendant were subsequently arrested, and the pistol used in the shooting was found in defendant\u2019s car at the time of his arrest. Defendant and codefendant were interviewed by Detectives Halpin and Hergert of the Portland Police Bureau, respectively. Defendant admitted that the pistol was his. He told Halpin that he had given it to Yucca earlier in the day because Yucca \u201cwanted it\u201d and he thought Yucca \u201ccould handle it.\u201d Defendant also told Halpin that they had gone to the apartment complex because Chacua wanted to get some cocaine there and that defendant was \u201cstanding right there\u201d at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Codefendant acknowledged to Hergert that, while Chacua had gone to the apartments to get drugs, Yucca, defendant, and he went there to fight some men with whom Yucca had previously fought. Codefendant also described Yucca\u2019s initial departure from the vehicle and Yucca\u2019s return to the vehicle where he and defendant were waiting. Codefendant stated that, when Yucca returned, Yucca told them that he had found the person at the apartment complex whom he was looking for (the man whom he had fought with previously and who had broken a bottle over his head) and told them, \u201c[L]et\u2019s go fight [the men on the stairs.]\u201d Codefendant said that they agreed and followed him back to the apartments. Codefendant told Hergert that both he and defendant knew that Yucca had brought the pistol to the apartments, because Yucca had shown it to them in defendant\u2019s vehicle as they drove to the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Defendant and codefendant were charged with attempted murder, second-degree assault, and third-degree assault on the theory that they aided and abetted Yucca\u2019s crimes. Yucca was not arrested or charged. Hergert and Halpin testified at trial, and their testimony included statements made by both defendant and codefendant, neither of whom testified. Defendant and codefendant objected to the introduction of each others\u2019 statements as a violation of their federal confrontation right. The court allowed the testimony, but ordered that statements by codefendant that specifically referred to defendant be redacted and, similarly, that any statements by defendant that specifically referred to codefendant be redacted. Both defendant and codefendant repeatedly objected to the redaction, arguing that redaction would not be effective. The court concluded that the redacted statements would not violate defendant\u2019s or codefendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses and overruled their objections. The pertinent portions of codefendant\u2019s statements to Hergert, as redacted, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201c[Codefendant] said that he was at his house, and that there were three other guys there with him[.] * * * [A]ll four of them left his location, four guys, in a green vehicle[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201c[Codefendant] said they were heading over there to the apartments because they had some problems with guys in the apartments, that the four of them left his house earlier that day, and that they were going to go over there and fight these guys, but that, again, Chacua * * * was not going to get involved in the fight[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">\u201c* * * [Codefendant said that Yucca] shows them a gun that he has on the way over [to the apartment complex.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">* * * [T]hey all see this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201c* * * [W]hen asked, \u2018Why are you guys going over there[?]\u2019 his response was, \u2018to fight.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201c[Codefendant said that] when they get there * * * [Yucca] goes to the apartment complex, and that he comes back and tells them those guys are there, and that, says, you know, \u2018Let\u2019s go get them,\u2019 and so they agree to go fight and what they\u2019re going to do, he says, is going to fight, throw punches, and throw bottles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201cAnd, again, it\u2019s going to be three of the four, all of them but Chacua, because Chacua knows both sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u00ab* * * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">\u201c[Codefendant said] next [Yucca] fires the gun one time, and that several of them run back to the vehicle \u2014 to the vehicle they arrived in, but that, again, Chacua, the one person who was not going to get involved, stays behind. Does not leave with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">\u201c[When asked why codefendant and the several other people were going there to the fight, codefendant said the victim] was bragging about beating up [Yucca] the other day, that they had an altercation a few weeks prior, that this guy was bragging about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">* sji * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">\u201c[When asked whether he agreed to Yucca\u2019s request that they go fight the men on the stairs, codefendant said,] \u2018Several of them do. Yes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">The pertinent portions of defendant\u2019s statements to Halpin, as redacted, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-15\">\u201c[When asked who accompanied him to the apartment complex, defendant answered] that he and three others went there because one of the other individuals wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>get some more coke, and one of them said that they could get it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">\u201c[When asked what happened next, defendant] said that a person named Chacua had left the vehicle to get some coke, and that the other three of them waited in the car, and they waited there for about a half an hour[.] * * * Yucca[ ] got tired of waiting, and so he left, and he went to look for Chacua, and then Yucca came back to the car, and he was commenting that he had just seen an individual that he had had a problem with in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\u00ab* * * [Defendant] at first told us that he waited in the car, and that the others went. * * * [T]hen he admitted that, no, he had gone with them and there was a fight and a shooting, and he said he was standing right there at the time of the shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201c[Defendant] said that they\u2019d gone over to this guy that Yucca had had the problem with, and that Yucca had punched this guy, and another guy present, named Jaime, started fighting with Yucca, and hit Yucca with a bottle, and then Yucca pulled a gun out of his pocket and he shot the person that he originally had a problem with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">* * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201c[When asked if defendant admitted that he and several other people went over to the victim, defendant said,] Yeah.\u2019 He said, \u2018yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018We went over to [the victim.]\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">\u201c[When asked what happened after the shooting, defendant answered] \u2018[w]e took off, except Yucca stayed behind[.]\u2019 * * * They ran to his car to leave, but one of the guys was saying to wait for Yucca, and so they waited 10 or 15 seconds, and Yucca came, and then they took off, and he said at that point there were three of them in the car because Chacua was still behind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, both defendant and codefendant moved for judgments of acquittal on all charges, arguing that the evidence introduced \u2014 which, in their view, proved only that they were present at the scene of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>crimes committed by Yucca \u2014 was insufficient to support their convictions as accomplices. The court denied their motions, and the jury convicted defendant and codefendant of attempted murder, second-degree assault, and third-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In defendant\u2019s first three assignments of error, he asserts that the trial court erred in denying his MJOA on the attempted murder, second-degree assault, and third-degree' assault charges, respectively. He makes one argument that is common to all three assignments, and two distinct arguments that apply only to the third-degree assault. The argument common to all three is that the state failed to prove that defendant had the requisite intent or that he engaged in any conduct that assisted Yucca.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">With respect to the third-degree assault only, defendant first argues that, even if he engaged in conduct that assisted Yucca, he could not be convicted of third-degree assault on an aiding and abetting theory. Defendant notes that third-degree assault, as defined by ORS 163.165(l)(e), requires that the assailant be \u201caided by another person actually present * * He argues that the conduct of the aiding person is \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d to the crime and thus does not give rise to liability for aiding and abetting. <em>See </em>ORS 161.165(2) (a person is not criminally liable for conduct of another constituting a crime if the \u201ccrime is so defined that the conduct of the person is necessarily incidental thereto\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Defendant also argues that, if he in fact aided and abetted Yucca, he is criminally liable only for Yucca\u2019s conduct, not the circumstances surrounding that conduct. Specifically, defendant contends that he is not criminally liable for the fact that Yucca was aided by another person actually present. Thus, he contends, he is liable, at most, only for fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Neither of the latter two arguments are preserved. Defendant argued at trial that ORS 163.165(l)(e) requires two or more active participants in an assault in order for it to constitute third-degree assault. Because Yucca was the sole active assailant in this case, defendant contended, no third-degree assault occurred and, consequently, defendant could</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>not be liable for aiding and abetting a third-degree assault. Defendant did not argue, as he does on appeal, that any aiding conduct he engaged in was necessarily incidental to the crime. Nor did he argue that he could be held liable only for Yucca\u2019s conduct and not the fact that Yucca was aided by another person. Because defendant failed to raise those arguments at trial, they are unpreserved, and we do not consider them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (\u201c[A] party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s preserved sufficiency of the evidence argument. As we summarized in <em>State v. Groves, </em>221 Or App 371, 378, 190 P3d 390, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 415 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal to determine whether there is evidence in the record from which a rational factfinder, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and drawing all reasonable inferences in the state\u2019s favor, could find the defendant guilty. Although a factfinder may draw reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence, it may not engage in speculation or guesswork. We review all of the evidence admitted at trial, whether properly admitted or not, so our disposition of defendant\u2019s [contention that some evidence was improperly admitted at trial] does not affect our review here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">(Citations omitted.) In the context of accomplice liability, \u201cmere presence\u201d or \u201cacquiescence alone\u201d are not sufficient to establish aiding and abetting, but \u201cthe least degree of concert or collusion between accomplices suffices * * <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Holloway, </em>102 Or App 553, 557, 795 P2d 589 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>We conclude that there is ample evidence that defendant served as an accomplice and actively assisted Yucca in committing these crimes. Defendant\u2019s statements, according to Halpin\u2019s testimony, establish that defendant went with Yucca to confront the victims, stayed with him during the confrontation, and waited for him in the vehicle afterwards. The testimony of the victim and Gongora, a resident of the apartment complex, corroborates that defendant accompanied Yucca and establishes that either codefendant or defendant tried to \u201cget involved.\u201d Codefendant\u2019s statements, as related by Hergert in his testimony, demonstrate that (1) Yucca and defendant went to the apartments to fight someone as retaliation for an earlier altercation; (2) Yucca showed them the pistol while driving to the apartments; (3) Yucca returned to the vehicle and told them that he had found the man he was looking for; (4) Yucca asked them to accompany him \u201cto fight\u201d; (5) they agreed to do so and followed Yucca back to the apartments; and (6) defendant served as the getaway driver for Yucca. Considered as a whole, that evidence is sufficient to support a finding that defendant aided Yucca by providing backup during the altercation and acting as the getaway driver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence also supports the inference that defendant had the requisite intent to aid Yucca. We conclude that the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in admitting the redacted statements of his codefendant, Navarrete-Pech. According to defendant, the redaction of any explicit reference to him in codefendant\u2019s statements was ineffective and, therefore, because codefendant did not testify, the admission of the statements violated his right to confront adverse witnesses. The state responds that the admission of the redacted statements did not violate defendant\u2019s confrontation right because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the redacted statements are not incriminating \u2014 that is, the redacted statements were not themselves incriminating, because they implicated defendant only when considered in light of other evidence introduced at trial. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that their admission violated defendant\u2019s confrontation right under the principles expressed in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004), and <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 US 123, 88 S Ct 1620, 20 L Ed 2d 476 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a criminal defendant has the right to confront witnesses against him or her. In <em>Bruton, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that admitting the confession of a non-testifying codefendant in a joint trial violates a defendant\u2019s confrontation right if those statements implicate the defendant, because the defendant is denied the opportunity to cross-examine the codefendant. 391 US at 136-37. In <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 US 200, 211, 107 S Ct 1702, 95 L Ed 2d 176 (1987), the Court established that a defendant\u2019s confrontation right is not violated by the admission of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confession where the statement is \u201credacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence[.]\u201d The Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Richardson </em>after noting that the redacted confession was not incriminating to the defendant until it was \u201clinked with evidence introduced later at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208. In other words, the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit the introduction of a codefendant\u2019s confession if the confession is incriminating to the defendant only when viewed in the context of other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>Gray v. Maryland, </em>523 US 185, 192, 118 S Ct 1151, 140 L Ed 2d 294 (1998), the Court held that the admission of the redacted statements of a nontestifying codefendant that contained an obvious indication of deletion \u2014 in that case, replacing the defendant\u2019s name with the word \u201cdeleted\u201d \u2014 violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation right. The Court, in distinguishing the case from <em>Richardson, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cThe inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant, and which involve inferences that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><em>Gray, </em>523 US at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In applying those cases in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>199 Or App 305, 312-13, 111 P3d 784, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 701 (2005), we concluded that the defendant\u2019s confrontation right was violated by the admission of the redacted statements of a non-testifying codefendant. In <em>Johnson, </em>the codefendant\u2019s confession repeatedly referred to the defendant specifically and described his criminal conduct in detail. In the redacted version that was admitted at trial, the defendant\u2019s name was replaced with the terms \u201cthe other individual\u201d and \u201cthe other person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313. We noted that the redacted version did not eliminate \u201c \u2018any reference to [the defendant\u2019s] existence\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdirectly and frequently implicated [the] defendant in the crime of felony murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312 (quoting <em>Richardson, </em>481 US at 211). We further noted that, as prohibited by <em>Gray, </em>the redacted statements contained obvious indications of deletion because \u201c[e]very individual in the confession is named with one conspicuous exception, and the fact of that individual\u2019s anonymity is reemphasized with every use of some antecedentless pronoun or generic term.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>199 Or App at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In this case, codefendant\u2019s statements were redacted in a way that referred to defendant\u2019s existence and described his criminal conduct in detail, <em>see Richardson, </em>481 US at 211, with actual names replaced with generic terms in phrases like \u201cwe all\u201d saw the pistol and \u201cthree of the four, all of them but Chacua\u201d agreed to go fight. Codefendant stated that \u201c[s]everal\u201d of them agreed with Yucca\u2019s plan of fighting the men on the stairs. Considering that codefendant stated that Chacua was not involved in the fight and had gone along only to get drugs, that statement unquestionably implicated defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Moreover, like the ineffective redaction in <em>Johnson, </em>every individual in codefendant\u2019s statements \u2014 with the exception of defendant \u2014 was named. Codefendant\u2019s statements, as redacted, make it clear that three men were with him when they arrived at the victim\u2019s apartment complex: Chacua, who was not involved in the altercation; Yucca, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>one who actually fired the pistol; and another, conspicuously unidentified man who provided backup for Yucca with codefendant. As defendant argues, it was obvious from the redacted statement that defendant was that conspicuously unidentified individual who, along with codefendant, aided Yucca in the assaults and attempted murder. The redactions in this case have the fundamental flaw identified in <em>Johnson </em>\u2014the use of terms like \u201cothers\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d combined with the use of proper names or nicknames for every other individual alerts the jury to the fact that someone\u2019s \u2014 defendant\u2019s\u2014 name has been deleted. <em>See Johnson, </em>199 Or App at 313. As the Court stated in <em>Gray, </em>\u201credaction that replaces a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious indication of deletion * * * falls within <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>protective rule.\u201d 523 US at 192. We conclude that the trial court erred in admitting codefendant\u2019s redacted statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"> Having concluded that defendant\u2019s confrontation right was violated, we further conclude that the error was not \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 681, 106 S Ct 1431, 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986) (stating the federal standard for harmless error). In determining whether an error was harmless, we consider the importance of the improperly admitted evidence in the state\u2019s case, whether the evidence was cumulative, whether the evidence was corroborated by properly admitted evidence, and the overall strength of the state\u2019s case. <em>See State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 550, 135 P3d 260 (2006) (concluding that constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt based on those factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The defense theory was that defendant was merely present while Yucca committed the assaults and attempted murder. Halpin\u2019s properly admitted testimony established that defendant gave Yucca a pistol, drove him to the apartments, was present during the assault and shooting, waited for him afterward, and drove him home. Properly admitted testimony of the victim and Gongora confirmed that defendant was present at the assault and shooting and that he may have tried to \u201cget involved\u201d in some unspecific way.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In contrast, codefendant\u2019s improperly admitted statements established that everyone in the vehicle besides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Chacua went to the apartments with the purpose of fighting, that Yucca showed everyone in the vehicle the pistol, that Yucca asked defendant to accompany him back to the apartments to fight the man he had found there, and that defendant did so. The codefendant\u2019s statements were important to the state\u2019s case because they tended to show that defendant\u2019s actions aided Yucca and that defendant acted with the intention of aiding him. That is, the statements were central to the state\u2019s theory that defendant was an accomplice to Yucca, and not just a bystander. Moreover, the improperly admitted evidence was neither cumulative of, nor corroborated by, other evidence. Codefendant\u2019s statements provided unique evidence at trial and conflicted, at least in part, with defendant\u2019s own account of what he knew in advance and what his intent was in transporting and accompanying Yucca.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In short, the state\u2019s case, without codefendant\u2019s improperly admitted statements, was not strong. Defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the altercation and his provision of a pistol and transportation to Yucca are evidence of aiding and abetting only if the state can demonstrate that defendant acted with the intention of aiding in Yucca\u2019s commission of the underlying crimes. Codefendant\u2019s statements supported the state\u2019s theory that defendant intended to aid Yucca when defendant provided him with a pistol, transportation, and backup during the altercation. Because \u201cmere presence\u201d and \u201cacquiescence alone\u201d are not sufficient to establish aiding and abetting, <em>see Holloway, </em>102 Or App at 557, codefendant\u2019s testimony was critical to the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Although the jury could have concluded from the properly admitted evidence that defendant aided Yucca, it is reasonably possible that it also relied on \u2014 or relied instead on \u2014 codefendant\u2019s erroneously admitted statements in reaching that conclusion. <em>See State v. Graves, </em>224 Or App 157, 166, 197 P3d 74 (2008) (concluding that error was not harmless where \u201ctestimonial statements admitted in violation of [the] defendant\u2019s right of confrontation were not entirely cumulative and instead added new, significant, and incriminating details to the state\u2019s case-in-chief\u2019). Thus, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting codefendant\u2019s statements in violation of defendant\u2019s confrontation right was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Cf. Van </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Arsdall, </em>475 US at 681 (affirming conviction despite constitutional error because error was harmless). Accordingly, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s convictions for attempted murder, second-degree assault, and third-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> Defendant also asserts that the court erred in entering a judgment of conviction on the attempted murder charge without a unanimous jury verdict and in imposing Measure 11 sentences on the attempted murder and second-degree assault charges because he was convicted of those crimes on an aiding and abetting theory. Because we reverse and remand for a new trial on the confrontation issue, we do not need to reach those assignments of error, which would afford the same or lesser relief \u2014 a new trial and resentencing, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> We address the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s MJOA because the relief for an erroneously denied MJOA \u2014 entry of a judgment of acquittal \u2014 is more complete than the remedy of remanding for a new trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Peterson, </em>183 Or App 571, 574, 53 P3d 455 (2002) (\u201c[Djeciding the statutory claim would not obviate the need to examine the constitutional claims, which offer more complete relief.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> Yucca was referred to as \u201cYucca,\u201d \u201cShorty,\u201d and \u201cShooter\u201d in the briefs and at various stages of this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> When the victim was asked for clarification on how defendant or codefendant tried to \u201cget involved,\u201d the victim responded that he did not know \u201cwhether he was trying to get in there to take the gun away, or to hit Jaime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> At trial, defendant relied heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 82 P3d 130 (2003), which he also cites in his brief on appeal. At trial, <em>Pine </em>was the subject of significant discussion with the court; defendant asserted that the case stands for the proposition that, for a third-degree assault to occur, two or more assailants must directly participate in causing the injury. Defendant does not renew that contention on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> We distinguish defendant\u2019s role of providing backup for Yucca from \u201cmere presence\u201d or \u201cacquiescence alone,\u201d as described in <em>Holloway, </em>102 Or App at 557, because in this case, defendant\u2019s presence as backup actually encouraged Yucca: Yucca had found the men that he wanted to fight, but he was outnumbered, and rather than confront them alone, he returned to the vehicle where his friends were waiting. It was only after defendant agreed to accompany Yucca to fight the men that Yucca returned to the apartments and punched and shot the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
