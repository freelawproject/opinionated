ORS 163.200. She appeals, arguing that the trial court should have granted her motion for a judgment of acquittal because the state failed to prove that her son was significantly likely to be seriously harmed by the conditions of the home. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Hedrick, a compliance officer with the City of Salem\u2019s public health authority, responded to a report by a patrol officer about the condition of defendant\u2019s home. Defendant lived in the residence with her husband and their 11-year-old son. When Hedrick arrived to inspect the home, defendant was at work, but her husband and son were there. During his inspection, Hedrick observed what he considered to be unsanitary conditions, in that there was clutter built up throughout the home. In some places, the clutter was piled six feet high. Although the home smelled musty and mildewy, there were no signs of rodents or other pests.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Hedrick also observed several fire hazards. The massive amount of clutter piled up throughout the home \u2014 boxes of paper and clothing \u2014 was all flammable. Hedrick considered the home to have a very heavy \u201cfuel load.\u201d Some of the clutter was near electrical outlets that were overloaded, which he confirmed by touching the cords and outlets and feeling that they were warm to the touch. There were no working smoke alarms, and, given the amount of clutter in the home, no one could have escaped in a timely manner in the case of a fire. Hedrick concluded that the home violated the local public health ordinance and posted the property as a health hazard. He then cited defendant and her husband for public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Because he believed that the conditions of the home were unsafe for an 11-year-old, Hedrick also called the police. Detectives Carney and McCarley responded, and, with defendant\u2019s husband\u2019s consent, they walked through the home and took photographs. As had Hedrick, the detectives observed fire hazards: An extension cord ran from the house out to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>chicken coop in the backyard; the cord was providing electricity for a space heater that was sitting on top of stacks of straw. In a back bedroom, an iron was sitting on an ironing board; it was partially plugged into an electrical outlet but was not turned on.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">When the detectives entered the kitchen, they observed that clutter covered every flat surface, although one side of the kitchen sink was available for use. The refrigerator was stocked with food, but, when the detectives opened the door, they smelled an odor of sour milk. The garbage can was overflowing. The doors to the garage and to the backyard were blocked by clutter.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The detectives then went upstairs, where defendant\u2019s son\u2019s bedroom and bathroom are located. The stairway railing was loose. As it was throughout the rest of the house, clutter covered every surface in his bedroom. His bathroom was also filled with clutter, and the bathtub was being used for storage. He was able, however, to access the toilet, sink, and shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">After they investigated the home, the detectives called defendant and asked her to return to her home. When she arrived, they arrested her and her husband for criminal mistreatment of their son. There was nothing about their son\u2019s appearance that caused the detectives concern; the arrest was based solely on the condition of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Defendant and her husband were jointly charged with one count of second-degree criminal mistreatment for \u201cwithhold[ing] necessary and adequate physical care.\u201d Defendant\u2019s husband pleaded guilty to the charge, and he agreed to testify on behalf of the state at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The case was tried to a jury. The state\u2019s witnesses included Hedrick, Carney, McCarley, and defendant\u2019s husband, who testified to the foregoing facts. At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that the condition of her home constituted withholding necessary and adequate physical care. The trial court denied the motion. The jury found defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal. She maintains that the condition of her home did not constitute \u201cwithholding] necessary and adequate physical care\u201d because, in her view, the legislature intended only to criminalize care by a caregiver \u201cthat poses a significant likelihood of serious harm\u201d to the dependent person. She insists that the state failed to prove that the condition of her home posed a significant likelihood of serious harm to her son, given that the home was free of pests and controlled substances and that he was well fed and appropriately clothed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The state disputes that the legislature intended to prohibit only care that poses a significant likelihood of serious harm. Defendant\u2019s proposed construction of ORS 163.200, the state argues, inserts a standard that simply is not there. Instead, the state asserts, that statute is broadly worded and prohibits even less egregious conduct \u2014 that is, the statute \u201crequires that a [caregiver] attend to the safety or well-being of [the dependent person] by providing the things that cannot be done without * * * in a \u2018fully sufficient\u2019 manner.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, the condition of defendant\u2019s home demonstrated that she failed in that regard. In any event, the state contends, the high risk of fire and the inability to escape in a timely manner demonstrated that defendant\u2019s care did in fact pose a significant likelihood of serious harm to her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The parties\u2019 dispute centers on the meaning of \u201cwithholds necessary and adequate * * * physical care,\u201d as used in ORS 163.200. In construing a statute, we examine the statutory text in its context, any relevant legislative history, and, if necessary, relevant canons of construction, to ascertain the intention of the legislature that enacted it. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). In our examination of the statutory text, we give terms that are undefined in the statute their plain and ordinary meanings. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We also consider any prior judicial construction of the statute. <em>See State v. Murray, </em>343 Or 48, 52, 162 P3d 255 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We begin with the statute\u2019s text. ORS 163.200 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of criminal mistreatment in the second degree if, with criminal negligence and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">\u201c(a) In violation of a legal duty to provide care for another person, the person withholds necessary and adequate food, physical care or medical attention from that person[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In turn, a person acts with \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d when the person \u201cfails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that * * * the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to be aware of it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d ORS 161.085(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Defendant does not dispute that she had a legal duty to provide care for her son. <em>See </em>ORS 163.200(3) (\u201cAs used in this section, \u2018legal duty\u2019 includes but is not limited to a duty created by familial relationship, court order, contractual agreement or statutory or case law.\u201d). She also appears to acknowledge that, if the condition of the home does constitute withholding necessary and adequate physical care, she acted with criminal negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The only issue, then, is the meaning of the phrase \u201cwithholds necessary and adequate * * * physical care.\u201d Because those terms are not defined by the statute, we give them their plain and ordinary meanings. A person \u201cwithholds\u201d something when he or she \u201chold[s] back: keep[s] from action\u201d or \u201cdesist[s] or refrain[s] from granting, giving, or allowing.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2627 (unabridged ed 2002); <em>accord State v. Schneider, </em>229 Or App 199, 207-08, 211 P3d 306 (2009). The ordinary meaning of \u201ccare,\u201d as relevant to its use in ORS 163.200(l)(a), is \u201cserious attention; <em>esp </em>: attention accompanied by caution, pains, wariness, personal interest, or responsibility\u201d and \u201cCHARGE, SUPERVISION, MANAGEMENT : responsibility for or attention to safety and well-being.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 338 (italics and capitalization in original). The type of care required by the statute, however, is \u201cphysical\u201d care, which means \u201cof or relating to the body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1706. Therefore, a caregiver violates ORS 163.200(l)(a) if he or she refrains from attending to the dependent person\u2019s bodily safety and well-being. We previously have held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201c[t]hat attention necessarily includes attention to dangers in the body\u2019s environment.\u201d <em>State v. Damofle</em>/<em>Quintana, </em>89 Or App 620, 624, 750 P2d 518, <em>rev den, </em>305 Or 671 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The phrase \u201cphysical care,\u201d as used in ORS 163.200, encompasses a broad range of conduct. <em>See Damofle</em>/<em>Quintana, </em>89 Or App at 625 (acknowledging the breadth of that statute but nevertheless rejecting a constitutional vagueness challenge because its wording is sufficiently clear to provide fair notice as to the conduct it prohibits). The legislature included a limiting adjective phrase, however \u2014 that is, the statute prohibits withholding physical care that is \u201cnecessary and adequate.\u201d \u201cNecessary,\u201d as used in this context, means physical care \u201cthat cannot be done without: that must be done or had : absolutely required : ESSENTIAL, INDISPENSABLE.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1511 (capitalization in original). In turn, \u201cadequate\u201d means physical care that is \u201cequal to, proportionate to, or fully sufficient for a specified or implied requirement; <em>often </em>: narrowly or barely sufficient: no more than satisfactory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 (italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Therefore, based on the plain and ordinary meanings of the terms, and our reasoning in <em>Damofle </em>/ <em>Quintana, </em>a caregiver \u201cwithholds necessary and adequate * * * physical care\u201d in violation of ORS 163.200 when he or she fails to meet sufficiently the essential needs of the dependent person with respect to bodily safety and well-being, bearing in mind that that includes attention to the dangers in the body\u2019s environment. (The parties cite no legislative history that relates to the legislature\u2019s intended meaning of the disputed statutory phrase, and we have found none.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">With that construction in mind, we turn to the evidence in this case to determine whether, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, it was sufficient for a rational factfinder to find all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998) (stating the standard for reviewing a denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We begin with the evidence of a present risk of fire in the home, because it is dispositive. The home was filled with so many piles of flammable material that Hedrick\u2014 concerned about such a heavy \u201cfuel load\u201d and that some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>clutter was near overloaded electrical outlets \u2014 deemed the home to be a health hazard. Furthermore, the chicken coop in the backyard contained a space heater placed on top of stacks of straw, which is even more highly flammable material. There was also no mechanism for warning the home\u2019s occupants in the event of a fire; the home had no working smoke alarms. Even if there were, the evidence established that the amount of clutter was so massive that it would impede any timely escape. In fact, two of the doors from the house \u2014 one that led to the garage and another to the backyard \u2014 were completely blocked with clutter, preventing anyone from using them as a means of escape. We conclude that that evidence of fire hazards was sufficient for the jury to find that defendant failed to give sufficient attention to her son\u2019s bodily safety and well-being and that doing so constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Because we have concluded that the evidence of fire hazards, on its own, was sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction, we do not need to determine whether the evidence of other conditions in the home was adequate to demonstrate that defendant withheld necessary and adequate physical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
