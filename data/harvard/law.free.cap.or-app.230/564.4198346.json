Sometime after that discovery, but more than eight years after the construction was substantially complete, plaintiffs brought this action against defendants, alleging breach of contract and negligence due to construction defects. Defendants moved for summary judgment on both claims, arguing that the contract claims were filed after the six-year statute of limitations had run and that the negligence claims were barred because one party to a contract cannot bring a tort action against the other party unless that action arises from the breach of some standard of care that is independent of the terms of the contract. The court granted defendants\u2019 motions. We hold that the contract claims were barred by the statute of limitations, but that the tort claims survive summary judgment because they are based on the alleged violation of a regulatory standard that is independent of the contract. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">First, we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs\u2019 contract claims are barred by the six-year statute of limitations set forth in ORS 12.080(1). Plaintiffs argue that a 10-year statute of limitations applies to construction defect claims under ORS 12.135 and that, even if the applicable period is six years, that limitations period did not begin until plaintiffs discovered or should have discovered the water leakage. After briefing in this case was complete, we rejected indistinguishable arguments in <em>Waxman v. Waxman &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>224 Or App 499, 504-12, 198 P3d 445 (2008). For the reasons stated in that case, we agree with the trial court that the applicable statute of limitations for plaintiffs\u2019 contract claims is six years from the date of breach and that no discovery rule applies. Because plaintiffs did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>bring this action within that time, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"> We turn to plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error regarding their negligence claims. We begin with an overview of the legal principles that apply to the viability of tort claims by one party to a contract against the other party. Obligations specified in the terms of a contract are \u201c \u2018based on the manifested intention of the parties to a bargaining transaction,\u2019 \u201d while obligations in tort, or \u201cduties,\u201d are \u201c \u2018imposed by law\u2014 apart from and independent of promises made and therefore <em>apart from the manifested intention of the parties </em>\u2014 to avoid injury to others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conway v. Pacific University, </em>324 Or 231, 237, 924 P2d 818 (1996) (quoting W. Page Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 92, 655, 656 (5th ed 1984)) (emphasis in <em>Conway). </em>In other words, a contract details the specific obligations that each party agrees to undertake with respect to the other and, if one party fails to meet an obligation, that breach results in contract liability. <em>Conway, </em>324 Or at 237; <em>Georgetown Realty v. The Home Ins. Co., </em>313 Or 97, 106, 831 P2d 7 (1992). \u201cThat is so whether the breach of contract was negligent, intentional, or otherwise.\u201d <em>Georgetown Realty, </em>313 Or at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"> For the injured party to have a tort claim, however, that party must allege the breach of a standard of care that is independent of the contract and without reference to its specific terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the court explained in a frequently cited passage from <em>Georgetown Realty, </em>313 Or at 106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201cWhen the relationship involved is between contracting parties, and the gravamen of the complaint is that one party caused damage to the other by negligently performing its obligations under the contract, then, and even though the relationship between the parties arises out of the contract, the injured party may bring a claim for negligence if the other party is subject to a standard of care independent of the terms of the contract. If the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>claim is based solely on a breach of a provision in the contract, which itself spells out the party\u2019s obligation, then the remedy normally will be only in contract, with contract measures of damages and contract statutes of limitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">In most cases, the \u201cindependent standard of care\u201d derives from a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the contracting parties. We have also held, however, that a standard of care expressed in a statute is considered to be independent of the terms of the contract. <em>Butterfield v. State of Oregon, </em>163 Or App 227, 235, 987 P2d 569 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 252 (2000) (action based on violation of Fair Labor Standards Act sounds in tort); <em>see also Griffin v. Tri-Met, </em>318 Or 500, 507, 870 P2d 808 (1994) (ORS 659.425(1), prohibiting employment discrimination based on disability, imposes \u201clegal duty that is imposed by law, other than a duty arising from contract or quasi-contract\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Initially, plaintiffs argue that these precepts do not apply in construction defect cases, our opinion in <em>Jones v. Emerald Pacific Homes, Inc., </em>188 Or App 471, 71 P3d 574, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 125 (2003) to the contrary notwithstanding. They point to <em>Newman v. Tualatin Development Co. Inc., </em>287 Or 47, 597 P2d 800 (1979). In <em>Newman, </em>one group of plaintiffs (the \u201cprivity plaintiffs\u201d) had purchased homes directly from the defendant (builder); the other group (the \u201cnonprivity plaintiffs\u201d) was composed of subsequent, downstream purchasers. Both groups brought an action against the defendant, alleging breach of warranty and negligent construction. <em>Id. </em>at 49. The trial court certified the proceeding as a class action. The defendant took an interlocutory appeal, arguing that the action was not appropriate for class certification because, among other reasons, the privity plaintiffs\u2019 chances of success were minimal. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. Despite the existence of a contract between the privity plaintiffs and the defendant, the trial court affirmed the certification, concluding that, \u201cfrom the evidence considered and the state of the law, plaintiffs\u2019 chances of prevailing do not appear so minimal that they should be precluded from proceeding as a class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. From that statement, plaintiffs here infer that the court approved a negligence claim based on faulty construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>despite the existence of a contract and the absence of a non-contractual standard of care. Nothing in the <em>Newman </em>opinion, however, indicates that the court\u2019s statement, insofar as it applied to the privity plaintiffs\u2019 chances of success, referred to their negligence claim as opposed to their contract claim, and, in any event, the court might have meant that the privity plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim could possibly succeed based on some unique aspect of the parties\u2019 relationships or some other noncontractual standard of care. It is also noteworthy that <em>Newman </em>preceded <em>Georgetown Realty </em>by 13 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Harris v. Suniga, </em>344 Or 301, 180 P3d 12 (2008), another case in which the Supreme Court held that a homeowner could bring a negligence action against builders without alleging a noncontractual standard of care. The plaintiff in <em>Harris, </em>however, was a nonprivity owner with no contractual relationship to the builder; <em>Harris, </em>therefore, has no bearing on the question whether a party that <em>is </em>in contractual privity with a builder can bring a tort claim without alleging the breach of some standard of care independent of the contract. In sum, we decline to retreat from <em>Jones, </em>where we held that a homeowner who has a contractual relationship with a builder cannot bring an action against the builder in tort without establishing that the builder is obligated to a standard of care that is independent of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">As mentioned above, the noncontractual standard of care is most often imposed by the nature of the relationship between the parties, or, in the terms that the court generally uses, a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d As we explained in <em>Jones, </em>188 Or App at 478,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cparties to a contract are in a \u2018special relationship\u2019 imposing a heightened duty of care and thereby creating potential tort liability when one party delegates to the other the authority to make important decisions with the understanding that the authority is to be exercised on behalf of and for the benefit of the authorizer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Supreme Court has identified several categories of relationships into which most \u201cspecial relationships\u201d fall, including those between lawyers, physicians, architects, and engineers and their clients; between principals and agents; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>between trustees and beneficiaries; and, in some instances, between insurers and their insureds. <em>Id. </em>at 477. But whether a relationship between contracting parties is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d is a functional, rather than formal, inquiry; it depends on the nature of the parties\u2019 contracts and their dealings with one another. <em>Id. </em>at 478. \u201c[T]he crucial aspect of the relationship is not its name, but the roles that the parties assume in the particular interaction where the alleged tort and breach of contract occur.\u201d <em>Strader v. Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>179 Or App 329, 334, 39 P3d 903, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 190 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\">In the present case, plaintiffs argue that whether a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exists is a question of fact and that, therefore, the parties\u2019 disagreement regarding whether such a relationship existed precluded summary judgment. <em>See generally </em>ORCP 47 C; <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 407, 939 P2d 608 (1997) (summary judgment not appropriate unless there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law). We disagree. Where, as here, the relevant facts are not in dispute, this court may decide, as a matter of law, whether those facts establish a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Strader, </em>179 Or App at 335 (affirming grant of summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor on the basis that the defendant insurer and the plaintiff insured were \u201cnot in the kind of relationship that gives rise to a standard of care independent of the contract terms\u201d). Although there may be disputed facts that bear on the relationship in the present case, plaintiffs have not identified them.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Instead, they rely on the affidavit of plaintiff Janice Abraham, in which she states that plaintiffs \u201ctrusted\u201d defendants to build their \u201cdream\u201d home \u201cfree from defects\u201d; that plaintiffs \u201crelied\u201d on defendants\u2019 \u201cassurances that the home was free from defects\u201d; that plaintiffs \u201cdelegated responsibility\u201d to defendants \u201cto ma[k]e decisions regarding the construction budget, construction means and methods, Building Code compliance and construction cost savings\u201d; that plaintiffs \u201centrusted\u201d defendants \u201cwith responsibility to oversee the financial aspects of the building of [their] home\u201d; that plaintiffs \u201crelied\u201d on defendants\u2019 \u201ccost estimates\u201d for the project; that defendants \u201cpromised\u201d to use their \u201cbest skills, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>efforts, and judgment\u201d to further plaintiffs\u2019 interests; and that defendants \u201cexercised independent judgment on [plaintiffs\u2019] behalf concerning\u201d all of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">As defendants correctly point out, using particular adjectives to describe an arm\u2019s-length contractual relationship between parties does not transform that relationship into a \u201cspecial\u201d one. That determination is based on function, rather than form, and depends not on the words that the parties choose to describe their dealings but on the role that each plays. Here, plaintiffs have failed to show that they had \u201cdelegate[d] * * * authority [to defendants] to make important decisions with the understanding that the authority [was] to be exercised on behalf of and for the benefit of\u2019 plaintiffs. <em>Jones, </em>188 Or App at 478. Rather, plaintiffs contracted with defendants for the construction of a home according to plaintiffs\u2019 specifications, for a fee. All change orders and subcontractor bids had to be approved by plaintiffs. In other words, each party acted on its own behalf, for its own benefit. Plaintiffs have thus failed to show that they were in a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Plaintiffs fare better with their argument that \u201c[t]he broad rule stating that parties to a contract may be liable to one another in tort does not require the existence of a special relationship\u201d; rather, they read the case law to require only a standard of care independent of the contract, which standard can derive not only from a special relationship but also from rules such as the ones included in the Oregon Building Code. As we have discussed above, we have held that a standard of care expressed in a statute is also a standard that is independent of the terms of the contract. <em>Butterfield, </em>163 Or App at 235; <em>see also Griffin, </em>318 Or at 507. The same characterization applies to administrative rules. <em>See, e.g., Shahtout v. Emco Garbage Co., </em>298 Or 598, 601, 695 P2d 897 (1985) (administrative rule states standard of care); <em>Eduardo v. Clatsop Community Resource, </em>168 Or App 383, 391, 4 P3d 83 (2000) (city building code establishes standard of care).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In the present case, plaintiffs have alleged, as part of their general negligence claim, that defendants\u2019 failure to meet the standard of care set out in the Oregon Building Code caused damage to their property. They have also</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>alleged a separate claim for \u201cnegligence <em>per se.\u201d </em>Negligence <em>per se, </em>however, is not a distinct cause of action; it is a negligence claim based on violation of a standard of care set out by statute or rule. <em>Gattman v. Favro, </em>306 Or 11, 15 n 3, 757 P2d 402 (1988). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Shahtout, </em>298 Or at 601:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\u201cWhen a plaintiff (or a defendant seeking to prove negligence on plaintiffs part) invokes a governmental rule in support of that theory, the question is whether the rule, though it was not itself meant to create a civil claim, nevertheless so fixes the legal standard of conduct that there is no question of due care left for a factfinder to determine; in other words, that noncompliance with the rule is negligence as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">To state a negligence claim based on \u201cnegligence <em>per se\u201d </em>the plaintiff must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201callege that (1) defendants violated a statute [or rule]; (2) that plaintiff was injured as a result of that violation; (3) that plaintiff was a member of the class of persons meant to be protected by the statute [or rule]; and (4) that the injury plaintiff suffered is of a type that the statute [or rule] was enacted to prevent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\"><em>McAlpine v. Multnomah County, </em>131 Or App 136, 144, 883 P2d 869 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 507 (1995) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Plaintiffs have made the necessary allegations. They allege that defendants violated administrative rules; that the violation caused them damage; that the purpose of the Oregon Building Code is, among other things, to protect people in their position from the effects of substandard construction; and that they have suffered the kind of injury that the code was designed to prevent. The assertion regarding the purpose of the building code is correct as a matter of law. ORS 455.020, the statute authorizing promulgation of the building code, provides, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">\u201c(1) This chapter is enacted to enable the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to promulgate a state building code to govern the construction * * * of buildings and other structures * * *. The state building code shall establish uniform performance standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>providing reasonable safeguards for health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the residents of this state <em>who are occupants and users of buildings[.Y</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">(Emphasis added.) Further, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel states in an affidavit that she has \u201cretained unnamed qualified experts who are available and willing to testify to admissible facts and opinions creating questions of fact regarding [defendants\u2019] violations of the Oregon Building Code[ ] and the property damage [they] caused to the home.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs have created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants have breached a standard of care that is independent of any contract and that is not merely the duty to avoid unreasonable risk of foreseeable harm. <em>See </em>ORCP 47 E. For that reason, the court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on their claim of negligence based on violation of the building code.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Reversed and remanded on negligence claim; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-6\"> Plaintiffs brought this action in their capacity as trustees of a trust that owns the house. Defendant Keith Lucas, dba Keith Lucas Development Properties, was the general contractor. Defendant Kevin Mayo, dba KGM Construction, was the framing contractor. Several other defendants are not parties to this appeal. For convenience, we refer to the parties as \u201cplaintiffs\u201d and \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> When a contract expressly or implicitly incorporates the general \u201cduty to take reasonable measures to avoid foreseeable risks, that standard of care is not considered to impose an independent tort duty. <em>Jones v.
