We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence following a conviction by examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the [violation] had been proved\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Paragon, </em>195 Or App 265, 267, 97 P3d 691 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The following facts are undisputed. Defendant was driving east on Highway 30 near Sauvie Island, Oregon, when he came upon construction workers blocking traffic. The construction workers had blocked the eastbound lane with trucks and flags, and a tractor-trailer carrying a large piling was passing through the work area. Instead of stopping, defendant crossed the double yellow line to get around the trucks, and he was stopped by Officer Volker. Volker testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cI was patrolling the Sauvie Island work zone for speeders and other people who violated federal workers in the zone that day. There are cones that mark the zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201cThere [are] speed signs that say \u2018reduced speed,\u2019 * * * and, at this point, I was sitting off to the side of the road watching traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201cThe traffic had stopped because the workers were bringing a new piling in, [a] huge piling on a semi-truck, and they had \u2014 on either side of the road- \u2014 they had two vehicles blocking the westbound lanes and two vehicles blocking the eastbound lanes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">\u201cOn these vehicles, they had flags out * * * so no traffic was traveling through the work zone at this time because of the big semi-truck bringing the piling in before taking it down to the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cAt this time, I heard workers screaming. I looked over and saw a white vehicle go around the two trucks with flags out, traveling eastbound, crossing the double yellow line, and continue[ ] eastbound, until I stopped him at the bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cI contacted the driver, identified as [defendant] * * * by the Oregon Driver\u2019s License, and he told me, * * * T slowed down for the big truck, at least. I didn\u2019t know * * * why the other trucks were blocking the road.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cThe construction workers were really upset about this and they were distraught because they were in the roadway working and they didn\u2019t want to get hit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">On cross-examination, defendant asked Volker about the work zone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Were you aware of any safety zones that are exclusively marked for pedestrians in that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201cDEPUTY VOLKER: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">\u2021 ifc \u2021 5i&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: [Are] there clear markings that set this zone area apart within that roadway for the exclusive use of pedestrians?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">\u201cDEPUTY VOLKER: It is a construction safety zone that is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: But, it \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">\u201cDEPUTY VOLKER: [I]t is a highway work zone. There are people going to be in the roadway and that\u2019s what a highway work zone is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to prove * * * all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the elements of the offense of Driving Through a Safety Zone.\u201d Specifically, defendant argues that \u201cthere was no evidence in the record that there was a safety zone in the area for defendant to have driven through.\u201d The state responds that \u201cthe record supports defendant\u2019s conviction for driving through a safety zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">A person commits the offense of driving through a \u201csafety zone\u201d if that person drives into an area \u201cofficially set apart * * * for the exclusive use of pedestrians\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cThe driver of a vehicle commits the offense of driving through a safety zone if the driver at any time drives through or within any area or space officially set apart within a roadway for the exclusive use of pedestrians and which is protected or is so marked or indicated by adequate signs as to be plainly visible at all times while set apart as a safety zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">ORS 811.030(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Defendant asserts that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the area he drove into was a \u201csafety zone\u201d because (1) the area was not \u201cmarked for the exclusive use of pedestrians\u201d and (2) \u201cvehicular traffic was permitted through the work zone as a general matter.\u201d Accordingly, defendant concludes, \u201c[o]n the record before the court, no rational finder of fact could have concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence or otherwise, that defendant had driven through a safety zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The state first responds that, \u201c[t]he evidence supports an inference that a safety zone existed within the highway work zone because the area at issue was set apart within the roadway, protected, and marked by adequate signs.\u201d The state also argues that, \u201c[b]ecause some of the highway workers present in the highway work zone qualified as pedestrians, and because the record supports an inference that they controlled access to the zone, that area could be considered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>designated for the exclusive use of pedestrians as described in ORS 811.030.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The parties\u2019 arguments frame an issue of statutory construction. Specifically, we must construe the phrase, \u201cfor the exclusive use of pedestrians.\u201d In construing a statute, we first look to the statute\u2019s text in context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 175, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). A \u201cpedestrian\u201d is defined by statute as \u201cany person afoot or confined in a wheelchair.\u201d ORS 801.385. In contrast, the words \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d are terms of common usage and are not statutorily defined. Consequently, we define those words according to their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175. The word \u201cexclusive\u201d is defined as \u201climiting or limited to possession, control, or use (as by a single individual or organization or by a special group or class).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>793 (unabridged ed 2002). The word \u201cuse\u201d is defined as \u201cthe privilege or benefit of using something.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2523. Thus, as statutorily defined, an area set apart \u201cfor the exclusive use of pedestrians\u201d is an area where the \u201cprivilege or benefit of using\u201d is limited to a single group \u2014 pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Here, the evidence establishes that at least one vehicle \u2014 a tractor-trailer carrying a large piling \u2014 was authorized to enter the work area. The driver of that tractor-trailer was not a \u201cperson afoot\u201d or \u201cin a wheelchair\u201d when he or she entered the work area and had the privilege or benefit of the use of the work area. Accordingly, the evidence establishes that the work area was not \u201cset apart * * * for the exclusive use of pedestrians\u201d as the definition of a \u201csafety zone\u201d requires. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence before the trial court, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was not sufficient as a matter of law to allow any rational trier of fact to find by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant violated ORS 811.030.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> Although defendant did not move for a judgment of acquittal to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence, \u201csuch a motion is not necessary so long as a defendant clearly raises the issue in closing argument.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Mack, 219 Or App 119, 123, 183 P3d 191, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 301 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\"> The state, municipality, or political subdivision has the burden of proving the charged violation by a preponderance of the evidence. ORS 153.076(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> In contrast to a \u201csafety zone,\u201d a \u201chighway work zone\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201can area identified by advance warning where road construction, repair or maintenance work is being done by highway workers on or adjacent to a highway, regardless of whether or not highway workers are actually present.\u201d ORS 811.230(l)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
