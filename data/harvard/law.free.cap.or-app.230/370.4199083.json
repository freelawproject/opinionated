J.</author>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for unlawful manufacture of marijuana. ORS 475.856. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during what he contends was an unlawful search. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We take the facts from the trial court\u2019s undisputed findings. During a \u201cflyover,\u201d Detective Mogle observed several marijuana plants growing on a piece of property later identified as defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The next week, Mogle and four other detectives went to defendant\u2019s property to investigate. They did not have a search warrant. Defendant\u2019s eight-acre property is entirely surrounded by a seven-strand barbed-wire fence. To enter the property, the detectives opened a closed wire gate that has a chain and a lock that was hanging open. Although defendant testified that he had posted \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs, the detectives did not see any such signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The detectives entered defendant\u2019s property in two separate vehicles, drove up to defendant\u2019s residence, and parked. They knocked on the door and called for defendant, who was not actually present on the premises at that time. The detectives then \u201cbegan randomly walking around the property.\u201d They went to an area of the property that was not observable from the residence or the road leading to the residence. There, while \u201cmeandering\u201d around the property, the detectives came upon a greenhouse that was covered by opaque plastic. Although they did not enter the greenhouse, they peered inside and saw several marijuana plants. Defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful manufacture of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence of the marijuana plants growing in the greenhouse. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, concluding that defendant did not adequately manifest an intention to exclude the public from his property. Defendant then pleaded guilty to the charged offense, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his pretrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He argues that the detectives entered his property unlawfully because it is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence, signed, and has a wire gate that was closed. Alternatively, defendant argues that, even if the detectives\u2019 entry onto the premises was lawful, their \u201cmeandering\u201d around the property was not. The state responds that the trial court correctly concluded that defendant did not adequately manifest his intent to exclude the public from his property; thus, the state asserts, the detectives\u2019 entry was lawful. In response to defendant\u2019s alternative argument, the state argues that it was \u201creasonable\u201d in this case for the detectives to look for defendant beyond the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s alternative argument, because it is dispositive. The issue is whether, in \u201cmeandering\u201d around defendant\u2019s property after knocking on the residence door and getting no answer, the detectives invaded an interest protected by Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Article I, section 9, protects \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.\u201d Under that provision, a \u201csearch\u201d is an intrusion by the government into the protected privacy interest of an individual. <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 206, 729 P2d 524 (1986). Not all government intrusions trigger protection under that provision, however. For example, if police officers observe an item from a lawful vantage point, that conduct does not amount to a \u201csearch\u201d because no privacy interest is violated. <em>State v. Ainsworth, </em>310 Or 613, 617, 801 P2d 749 (1990); <em>see also State v. Pierce, </em>226 Or App 336, 343, 203 P3d 343 (2009) (citing <em>Ainsworth).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Police are in a location lawfully if an individual expressly or impliedly consents to it. \u201cAn officer\u2019s right to go to the front door of a house is based on implied consent to allow visitors to take reasonable steps to make contact with the occupant.\u201d <em>State v. Gabbard, </em>129 Or App 122, 128, 877 P2d 1217, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 131 (1994). A person does not impliedly consent, however, to police conduct that violates social or legal norms of behavior. <em>State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>157, 170, 759 P2d 1040 (1988). \u201c[T]he intrusion to which an occupant impliedly consents is limited. * * * By impliedly consenting to one form of intrusion, an occupant does not necessarily consent to being subjected to other forms of scrutiny as well.\u201d <em>State v. Portrey, </em>134 Or App 460, 465, 896 P2d 7 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In this case, assuming for the sake of argument that there is a basis for implying that defendant consented to the detectives approaching the door of his residence and attempting to make contact with him, there is simply no basis on this record for implying an invitation for the detectives to, as the trial court found, \u201cbeg[i]n randomly walking\u201d around the remainder of his property. In the absence of a basis for implying such an invitation, the detectives\u2019 actions constituted a trespass, and their observations resulting from that trespass are subject to suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><em>State v. Ohling, </em>70 Or App 249, 688 P2d 1384, <em>rev den, </em>298 Or 334 (1984), is instructive in that regard. In <em>Ohling, </em>the officers went to the front door of the defendant\u2019s house in an attempt to notify the owner of a rural piece of property that they had a warrant to search a portion of the property for growing marijuana plants. <em>Id. </em>at 251. When the officers knocked on the front door, they could hear a stereo playing, but there was no answer. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52. The officers then went to the back of the house to see if they could locate someone but found several marijuana plants instead. <em>Id. </em>at 252. Noting that the officers\u2019 \u201caction was a trespass unless it was privileged or had [the] defendant\u2019s express or implied consent,\u201d <em>id., </em>we held that \u201cthe officers were not in a place where they had a right to be when they saw the marijuana\u201d because they did not have the defendant\u2019s implied consent to go to the back of the house, <em>id. </em>at 253, 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Somfleth, </em>168 Or App 414, 8 P3d 221 (2000). The officers in that case, acting on a tip from an unknown informant but without a warrant, entered the defendant\u2019s property through a gate from a public alley and walked along a path to the backyard. As they passed the open side door of the garage, one of the officers saw the defendant operating what appeared to be a methamphetamine lab. <em>Id. </em>at 417. We concluded that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>because the defendant had not manifested an expectation that casual visitors would use either the side garage door or the back door of the residence, the officers\u2019 entry through the gate into the backyard was a trespass and that, accordingly, the officers\u2019 observations into the garage were made from an \u201cunlawful vantage point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In this case, as in <em>Ohling </em>and <em>Somfleth, </em>the detectives\u2019 observations of defendant\u2019s marijuana plants inside the greenhouse were not made from a lawful vantage point. Accordingly, their observations amounted to an unlawful search in violation of Article I, section 9. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
