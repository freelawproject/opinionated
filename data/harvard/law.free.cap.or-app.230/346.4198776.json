The judgment states that child is within the jurisdiction of the court based on three allegations in the dependency petition, one of which the Department of Human Services (DHS) proved and two of which father admitted. On appeal, father challenges the judgment only with respect to the allegation that DHS <em>proved </em>\u2014 i.e., that \u201cfather has a history of substance abuse, which if active, would endanger the welfare of the child.\u201d In father\u2019s view, that allegation is on its face an insufficient basis for establishing dependency jurisdiction, because it does not allege that child is <em>currently </em>endangered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that the allegation is insufficient and that the judgment must be reversed with respect to that allegation. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Randall, </em>96 Or App 673, 675-76, 773 P2d 1348 (1989) (\u201cAlthough we agree with the state that a parent\u2019s use of controlled substances is a proper consideration in determining whether a child should be made a ward of the state, that allegation is insufficient by itself to establish that the child\u2019s welfare is endangered. The petition must also include some factual allegation showing how the parent\u2019s drug usage endangers the welfare of the child over whom the court is asserting jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment establishing dependency jurisdiction based on allegations admitted by father.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> Father also contends that DHS did not, in fact, prove that father\u2019s marijuana use put child at risk. We need not reach that issue, given our disposition of father\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
