ORS 475.894. On appeal, she assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence that, she argues, derived from an unlawful stop in violation of her rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state, in response, argues that defendant\u2019s encounter with the officer did not become a stop, and therefore a seizure for purposes of triggering constitutional protection, until after the officer had developed reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed a controlled substance, at which point the stop was, for that reason, lawful. We vacate the judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The undisputed facts are as follows. Marion County Sheriffs Deputy Hickam was on a drug saturation patrol in Salem when he saw a man riding a bicycle toward a restaurant. Hickam recognized the man and approached him in the restaurant parking lot. The man told Hickam that he had come to the restaurant to meet a \u201clady friend\u201d named Stacy. The man consented to a search. Hickam found methamphetamine in the man\u2019s backpack, whereupon he arrested him and put him in the back seat of the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Hickam was standing at the open back door of the patrol car and talking to the man when defendant rode her bicycle into the parking lot and approached the entrance to the restaurant, approximately 20 feet from the patrol car. Hickam recognized her as \u201cStacy,\u201d the person whom the arrested man intended to meet. Hickam asked her, \u201cHey, can I talk to you for a second?\u201d and motioned with his hand for her to \u201ccome over to talk.\u201d He used a normal tone of voice and did not physically interfere with defendant or impede her movement. Defendant stopped her bicycle and \u201ckind of stood with her bicycle in her hands and looked back towards [Hickam] and said, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201d She then \u201ckind of walked her bike to the front of [the] patrol vehicle.\u201d Hickam walked up to meet defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Based on defendant\u2019s bloodshot, glassy eyes and dilated pupils, Hickam believed that she was under the influence of a stimulant. He did not, however, believe the influence of the stimulant was sufficient to justify a further investigation, nor did he believe that she had committed any other crime. Nonetheless, he asked defendant if \u201cshe had an ID on her that [he] could take a look at.\u201d Defendant told him her name and date of birth, which Hickam wrote down. He then asked defendant if she had \u201cany drugs, weapons, [or] anything illegal on her.\u201d When defendant said that she did not, Hickam asked if he \u201ccould check her person and pockets for any drugs.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want you touching me, but I will show you.\u201d She began to show Hickam the contents of her pockets. In the process, she attempted to extract and conceal a plastic baggie containing a white substance. Hickam saw it and believed that it was methamphetamine. He then took defendant\u2019s wrist, and the baggie fell from her hand. Hickam arrested defendant. The substance was later determined to be methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence, contending that Hickam, by his own testimony, did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity until he saw the baggie and that his interaction with her before that time amounted to a stop. The court denied her motion, and she was subsequently tried on stipulated facts and convicted of possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">On appeal, ORS 138.040(l)(a), defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress, renewing the argument that she made to the trial court. The state, in response, argues that Hickam\u2019s actions were not sufficient to transform a \u201cmere conversation\u201d into a stop until he grabbed her hand after seeing the baggie. We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress for errors of law, accepting as true all express or implied findings of fact for which constitutionally sufficient evidence exists. <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 10, 115 P3d 908 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant that Hickam unlawfully stopped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Not every encounter between law enforcement officers and citizens constitutes a \u201cseizure\u201d of the citizen under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Article I, section 9. In <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 16-17, the Supreme Court described three general categories of encounters between police officers and citizens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u201cThe first category, \u2018mere conversation\u2019 encounters, encompasses consensual interactions between police officers and citizens that require no justification and that do not implicate Article I, section 9. The second category, temporary restraints of a person\u2019s liberty for investigatory purposes\u2014 or \u2018stop[s]\u2019 under ORS 131.615(1) (1995) \u2014 constitutes a type of \u2018seizure\u2019 of a person under Article I, section 9, that must be justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The third category, arrests, also constitutes a \u2018seizure\u2019 of a person under Article I, section 9, and must be justified by probable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">(Citations omitted; brackets in Hall; citing <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 407, 813 P2d 28 (1991).) The determination that a person has been seized \u201crequire[s] a fact-specific inquiry into the totality of the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 408. In <em>Holmes, id. </em>at 409-10, the Supreme Court held that a person is stopped</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) whenever an individual believes that (a), above, has occurred and such belief is objectively reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Here, Hickam testified that he did not develop reasonable suspicion of criminal activity until he saw the baggie when defendant was emptying her pockets. The issue is therefore whether, before that time, defendant believed that she was not free to simply walk away from the encounter and, if so, whether, under the circumstances, \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have believed\u201d that. <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 536, 964 P2d 1007 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The circumstances here do not differ meaningfully from those in <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 200 P3d 149 (2008), <em>rev allowed, </em>346 Or 257 (2009). In that case, a police officer asked the defendant, without reasonable suspicion, if she had anything illegal in her purse, and she said no. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>officer then asked if he could look inside her purse, and the defendant consented. The officer looked inside her purse and found methamphetamine. The conversation between the defendant and the officer was relaxed and nonconfrontational. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. We concluded that \u201ca person who knows that he or she is being investigated by a police officer during an encounter could reasonably believe that, for that reason, his or her freedom of movement has been restrained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In the present case, when defendant arrived at the parking lot, she observed her friend being detained in the back of the police car. Hickam, a uniformed and armed police officer, then motioned for defendant to come over. That act in and of itself did not constitute a stop. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 19. However, he then inquired about identification and wrote down her name and date of birth, from which she could reasonably conclude that he intended to pursue further investigation of her. Under the circumstances, that act might have amounted to a stop. <em>See State v. Parker, </em>227 Or App 231, 238, 205 P3d 65 (2009) (where one officer requested the defendant\u2019s identifying information while another officer was using the computer, a reasonable person could conclude that he or she was the subject of a records check). We need not decide whether it did, however, because Hickam then asked if defendant had \u201cany drugs, weapons, [or] anything illegal on her,\u201d and, when she said no, he asked for permission to search her. Although defendant\u2019s conversation with Hickam was in a normal tone of voice, it was a conversation between a citizen and an armed, uniformed police officer, who had detained her friend in the back of the marked patrol car and who had requested and had written down defendant\u2019s identifying information. As in <em>Ashbaugh, </em>the request to search occurred after defendant denied possessing contraband or weapons. Under those circumstances, a reasonable person could believe that the officer did not accept her denial, wanted to conduct a further investigation, and would not permit her simply to walk away.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">From the current record, we are unable to determine whether defendant believed that she was free to leave, although the fact that she did not leave even though she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>knew she had methamphetamine in her pocket suggests as much. We therefore remand to the trial court for that determination. If the trial court finds that defendant believed that she was free to leave, the court should reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction. If the court determines that defendant believed that she was not free to leave, however, the evidence found on defendant must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\"> Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b740-5\">LANDAU, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmF\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">I agree with the majority that this case is indistinguishable from <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 200 P3d 149 (2008), <em>rev allowed, </em>346 Or 257 (2009), and that, in consequence, the case must be remanded for findings about whether defendant, in fact, subjectively believed that she was free to leave the scene. I write separately for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">First, as I stated in my concurring opinion in <em>Ashbaugh, </em>if it is necessary to remand for findings on whether defendant felt free to leave, it is not necessary for us to opine whether, if she did, such a subjective belief was objectively reasonable. It is the state\u2019s burden to demonstrate such a belief, and, if the state cannot meet that burden, then the matter is at an end, rendering any opinion about the reasonableness of such a belief merely advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Second, apart from that, I have come to have reservations about whether <em>Ashbaugh </em>was correctly decided. It strikes me that the decision cannot easily be harmonized with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 410, 813 P2d 28 (1991), in which the court stated that \u201claw enforcement officers remain free to approach persons on the street or in public places, seek their cooperation or assistance, <em>request or impart information, </em>or question them without being called upon to articulate a certain level of suspicion in justification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As I understand it, under our decision in <em>Ashbaugh </em>and in subsequent decisions, we have concluded that, while it may be permissible for law enforcement officers to ask a person for identification, it is not permissible for those officers to do anything with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>very information without reasonable suspicion that the person giving it has engaged in criminal activity. That makes little sense to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">I also have come to question whether remanding for findings as to a defendant\u2019s subjective understanding in this and similar cases can be reconciled with basic principles of preservation of error. In this case, for example, defendant did not argue to the trial court or to us that it is error to determine whether she was stopped without first finding whether she subjectively believed that she could not leave and, if she did, that such a believe was objectively reasonable. She did not ask us for a remand for such a finding. But we are granting that relief nevertheless. I imagine trial courts will be more than a little frustrated to find us remanding for findings that defendants never requested from them in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In fairness to the majority, granting that relief is what <em>Ashbaugh </em>requires. And, in fairness to the majority in <em>Ashbaugh, </em>the tensions that I have described are due in no small part to what appears to be some inconsistency in <em>Holmes </em>itself. Perhaps the Supreme Court will sort that out when it reviews <em>Ashbaugh. </em>In the meantime, <em>Ashbaugh </em>is controlling. I therefore concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
