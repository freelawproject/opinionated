(Zzeeks), doing business as one of approximately 4,500 franchises of Domino\u2019s Pizza, LLC (Domino\u2019s). Plaintiff subsequently filed this negligence action against Mathias, Zzeeks, and Domino\u2019s. Domino\u2019s, in turn, moved for summary judgment on the ground that the facts were insufficient to establish its vicarious liability for the acts of its franchisee\u2019s employee. The trial court agreed, granted the motion, and entered a limited judgment in favor of Domino\u2019s. Plaintiff appeals that limited judgment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">For purposes of this appeal, the question is not whether Mathias was negligent; Domino\u2019s assumes that he was. The issue, rather, is whether plaintiffs evidence at the summary judgment stage would permit a reasonable juror to find Domino\u2019s vicariously liable for that negligence. ORCP 47 C. To better frame that issue, and to provide context for the pertinent facts in the summary judgment record, we begin with a general discussion of the principles of vicarious liability, as recently described in <em>Vaughn v. First Transit, Inc., </em>346 Or 128, 206 P3d 181 (2009). The first question, for purposes of vicarious liability, is whether the relationship in question is one of \u201cagency\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cAt common law, \u2018agency\u2019 was defined as a relationship that \u2018results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act <em>on behalf and subject to his control, </em>and consent by the other so to act.\u2019 <em>Hampton Tree Farms, Inc. v. Jewett, </em>320 Or 599, 617, 892 P2d 683 (1995) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). The \u2018agent\u2019 is the person in that relationship who acts on behalf of the other, the \u2018principal.\u2019 <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 1 (1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u2756 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cEven the ability to control in detail another\u2019s actions does not alone create an agency relationship; to qualify as an agent, one must also agree to act \u2018on [another\u2019s] behalf.\u2019 Thus, for example, a subordinate employee is not the agent of a supervisor simply because the supervisor has full control over the employee\u2019s work activities. Instead, both the subordinate and the supervisor are agents of their common employer, on whose behalf they have agreed to work. <em>See Restatement (Third) of Agency </em>\u00a7 1.01 comment g (giving examples). In sum, to be an \u2018agent\u2019 \u2014 using the well-defined legal meaning of that term \u2014 two requirements must be met: (1) the individual must be subject to another\u2019s control; and (2) the individual must \u2018act on behalf of the other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\"><em>Vaughn, </em>346 Or at 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In <em>Miller v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>150 Or App 274, 945 P2d 1107 (1997), we considered how general agency principles applied in the context of a franchise relationship. We ultimately endorsed the reasoning set forth in <em>Billops v. Magness Const. Co., </em>391 A2d 196 (Del 1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cIf, in practical effect, the franchise agreement goes beyond the stage of setting standards, and allocates to the franchisor the right to exercise control over the daily operations of the franchise, an agency relationship exists. 391 A2d at 197-98.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-9\"><em>Miller, </em>150 Or App at 280. Thus, to determine whether the franchisee (and its employees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) are the agents of the franchisor, we look to whether the franchisor controls the day-to-day operations of the franchisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">If the relationship at issue is one of agency, the next question, for vicarious liability purposes, is what <em>type </em>of agency. Again, the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Vaughn </em>is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201cUnderstanding agency law in the context of vicarious liability requires an understanding of two types of agents: employees (or \u2018servant\u2019 agents) and agents who are not employees (sometimes referred to as \u2018nonservant\u2019 agents). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u2018All servants are agents and all masters, principals. However, all principals and agents are not also masters and servants.\u2019 <em>Kowaleski v. Kowaleski, </em>235 Or 454, 457, 385 P2d 611 (1963). The common law distinguishes between the two types of agents using a \u2018right-to-control\u2019 test. An agent is an employee if the principal has the right to control the physical details of the work being performed by the agent; in other words, the principal directs not only the end result, but also controls <em>how </em>the employee performs the work. <em>Schaff v. Ray\u2019s Land &amp; Sea Food Co., Inc., </em>334 Or 94, 100, 45 P3d 936 (2002). In contrast, when the agent retains control over the details of the manner in which it performs its duties, that agent is a nonemployee agent. <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 220 comment e.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cDistinguishing between employees and agents who are not employees is important for vicarious liability purposes, because a principal\u2019s liability for the torts of its agents varies based upon the type of agent. In general, a principal is liable for all torts committed by its employees while acting within the scope of their employment. <em>Minnis </em>[v. <em>Oregon Mutual Ins. Co., </em>334 Or 191, 201, 48 P3d 137 (2002)]. But a principal ordinarily is <em>not </em>liable in tort for physical injuries caused by the actions of its agents who are not employees. <em>Jensen v. Medley, </em>336 Or 222, 230, 82 P3d 149 (2003). Rather, a principal is vicariously liable for an act of its nonemployee agent only if the principal \u2018intended\u2019 or \u2018authorized the result [ ]or the manner of performance\u2019 of that act. <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 250; <em>see also Jensen, </em>336 Or at 231 (principal liable for acts of nonservant agents only if those acts \u2018within the actual or apparent authorization of the principal\u2019). In other words, for a principal to be vicariously liable for the negligence of its nonemployee agents, there ordinarily must be a connection between the principal\u2019s \u2018right to control\u2019 the agent\u2019s actions and the specific conduct giving rise to the tort claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">346 Or at 137-38 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In light of those standards, we turn to the evidence in the summary judgment record, which we evaluate in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the nonmoving party. <em>Vaughn, </em>346 Or at 132. Domino\u2019s franchises, including Zzeeks, are delivery-oriented businesses, the hallmark of which is timely delivery. Domino\u2019s goal is that its franchises will deliver pizzas within 30 minutes from the time that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>order is received. The scope of Zzeeks\u2019s delivery service is set forth in Domino\u2019s \u201cStandard Franchise Agreement,\u201d which Zzeeks and Domino\u2019s executed in July 2002. That agreement grants Zzeeks an exclusive delivery area in which to operate and \u201coffer delivery service to all customers\u201d located within that area. \u201cWhen making deliveries, [Zzeeks and its] employees must strictly comply with all laws, regulations, and rules of the road and due care and caution in the operation of delivery vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The franchise agreement also addresses \u201cOperating Requirements\u201d for Zzeeks. Under that section of the agreement, Zzeeks agrees to \u201ccomply with all specifications, standards and operating procedures and rules * * * relating to * * * (d) methods and procedures relating to receiving, preparing and delivering customer orders.\u201d In that regard, the agreement also incorporates certain \u201cstandards and operating procedures\u201d set forth in a \u201cManager\u2019s Reference Guide,\u201d a document that addresses various aspects of franchise operation in exhausting detail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The \u201cStandards\u201d section of the Manager\u2019s Reference Guide provides a number of detailed requirements pertaining specifically to delivery drivers. Those requirements include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201cB. Driver Safety</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201c1. No keys are to be left in an unoccupied vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c2. Age limit for Hiring</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201cNo one under the age of eighteen (18) years shall be permitted to operate a motor vehicle while in the course and scope of employment at any Domino\u2019s Pizza location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201c3. MVR Standard!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">The MVR standards are \u201cMotor Vehicle Record\u201d requirements that must be satisfied by Domino\u2019s Pizza delivery drivers. Subparagraphs a. through c. of the \u201cMVR Standard\u201d paragraph provide that all personnel must have their driving records (maintained by a governmental authority) verified \u201cat the start of employment and at a minimum of every six months thereafter\u201d; state that \u201c[f]ranchisees who do not meet MVR requirements will not deliver pizza and other related products\u201d; indicate that copies of \u201cMVRs will be maintained in the Team Member\u2019s personnel file\u201d; and set forth minimum driving history requirements \u2014 two years for drivers who are 18 years old and one year for drivers who are 19 or older.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The MVR standards continue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cd. No one will be allowed to drive a personal vehicle for Domino\u2019s Pizza without proof of insurance and a valid state driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201ce. Any Team Member involved in product delivery that does not comply with this Standard may only work for Domino\u2019s Pizza in a non-driving capacity and then only after signing a \u2018Non-Driving Agreement.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cf. No one will be allowed to drive for Domino\u2019s Pizza with a \u2018suspended,\u2019 \u2018provisional,\u2019 \u2018court restricted,\u2019 \u2018revoked,\u2019 \u2018learners permit\u2019 or \u2018junior\u2019 license. In the event of a \u2018probationary\u2019 license, a Team Member will be allowed to drive if the history requirement is fulfilled. Additional endorsements are acceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201cg. No vehicle will be allowed to be used for business purposes for Domino\u2019s Pizza unless the vehicle passes a periodic inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201ch. No team Member may operate a motor vehicle in the furtherance of the company\u2019s business unless that person possesses a valid state driver\u2019s license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">The next subparagraph under \u201cMVR Standard\u201d provides specific criteria that must be met by each driver. For example, a driver cannot have \u201cmore than two (2) violations in the past two (2) years (e.g.: speeding, failure to yield, fail to obey traffic signal/device, fail to stop, improper turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>improper lane change, careless driving, follow too close, operated not restrained by safety belt).\u201d Certain offenses automatically disqualify delivery drivers for three years from the date of the violation, such as leaving the scene of an accident, reckless driving, hit and run, and vehicular homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Paragraph 4 of the \u201cDriver Safety\u201d subsection of the Manager\u2019s Reference Guide concerns the use of seat belts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201ca. When driving or riding in a vehicle on the clock for Domino\u2019s Pizza, personnel are required to wear seat belts at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cb. No Team Member can be transported in an area of a vehicle where seat belts are NOT available, i.e. truck bed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Paragraph 5 of that subsection provides that \u201c[r]adar detectors are not permitted in any vehicle used while in the scope of employment for Domino\u2019s Pizza.\u201d Paragraph 6, the final paragraph of the \u201cDriver Safety\u201d subsection, is titled \u201cPeriodic vehicle inspection.\u201d It provides that \u201c[a]ll delivery vehicles whether company or personal, used for delivery, must be inspected prior to hire and on a periodic basis,\u201d and specifically lists what the inspection must cover, including, among other things, headlights, taillights, windshield wipers, backup lights, horn, brake pressure, and the exhaust system. \u201cAny vehicle, which does not pass the inspection, is not to be used during the course and scope of employment.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[insurance is to be valid and current at all times and must be inspected prior to hire and a minimum of twice a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Subsection C. of the Manager\u2019s Reference Guide addresses \u201cMobile Phone Use.\u201d Although that subsection is separate from Driver Safety, it indirectly addresses the safe operation of delivery vehicles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201c1. No Team member during work hours for Domino\u2019s Pizza shall drive a vehicle while using a mobile telephone. The only exception is a \u2018hands-free mobile telephone\u2019 which permits the team member to talk and listen without the use of either hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">\u201c2. A team member may use a hands-free mobile phone while the vehicle is in motion to activate, deactivate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>or initiate a one touch call and if the team member uses the highest degree of care while doing so. In all other circumstances the team member must pull over at a legal, safe location to place the call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">\u201c3. All mobile phones must be turned off while at a gas station. If the phone is turned on, a static electric charge could occur, which could ignite the gas fumes and cause a fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In addition to the above-described requirements regarding driving safety, the \u201cStandards\u201d also provide that \u201csafe driving lessons in Book One must be successfully completed by every Team Member who delivers pizzas.\u201d The Book One standards cover subjects such as defensive driving techniques, rights of way at intersections, planning routes, etc. The delivery driver in this case, Mathias, had watched a Domino\u2019s training video before starting his employment with Zzeeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Under the franchise agreement, Domino\u2019s also retains the right to conduct inspections of Zzeeks\u2019s operations and business records. To the extent that Domino\u2019s discovers violations of its standards and operating procedures, it has the right to terminate the franchise agreement if those violations are not cured within seven days after Zzeeks receives notice. Moreover, \u201c[i]n the event that the conditions [at Zzeeks] or operations at [Zzeeks], in [Domino\u2019s] judgment, present a threat of imminent danger to public health or safety, [Domino\u2019s] may require the immediate cessation of operations at the Store upon delivery of a Notice of Immediate Cessation of Operations and Termination (the \u2018Notice\u2019) to [Zzeeks].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Despite the detailed operating procedures that must be followed by Zzeeks, the franchise agreement nevertheless states that \u201cthe parties to this Agreement are independent contractors\u201d and that \u201cthe relationship created by this Agreement and the relationship between us is not a fiduciary relationship nor one of principal and agent.\u201d Under the terms of the agreement, Domino\u2019s has \u201cno relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>with [Zzeeks\u2019s] employees and ha[s] no rights, duties, or responsibilities with regard to their employment by [Zzeeks].\u201d The agreement further states that Zzeeks \u201cshall be solely responsible for recruiting, hiring, training, scheduling for work, supervising and paying the persons who work in the Store and those persons shall be your employees, and not our agents or employees.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">With those facts in mind, we turn to the relevant question on appeal: whether, on the record before us, a reasonable juror could find Domino\u2019s vicariously liable for the negligent driving of its franchisee\u2019s employee. As explained above, that question involves three subparts: (1) Is the relationship between Domino\u2019s and Zzeeks one of agency? (2) If so, what type of agency relationship does Domino\u2019s have with <em>Zzeeks </em>\u2014 i.e., an employee or nonemployee relationship? And (3) If Zzeeks is a nonemployee agent, did plaintiff come forward with sufficient evidence of a \u201cconnection between [Domino\u2019s] \u2018right to control\u2019 [Zzeeks\u2019s] actions and the specific conduct giving rise to the tort claim.\u201d <em>Vaughn, </em>346 Or at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We begin our analysis with the first of those three inquiries: Whether the summary judgment record, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, demonstrates that Zzeeks was Domino\u2019s\u2019 agent under the common law. As explained above, to be an \u201cagent\u201d for purposes of imposing vicarious liability, \u201ctwo requirements must be met: (1) the individual must be subject to another\u2019s control; and (2) the individual must \u2018act on behalf of the other person.\u201d <em>Vaughn, </em>346 Or at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In this case, Domino\u2019s has not put in issue the second of those <em>requirements </em>\u2014 i.e., that Zzeeks was acting \u201con behalf of\u2019 Domino\u2019s. Rather, the thrust of Domino\u2019s argument below and on appeal is that, on this summary judgment record, no reasonable juror could find that Zzeeks was subject to the control of Domino\u2019s. In short, our case law says otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>In <em>Miller, </em>we set forth a test for determining whether a franchisor had a sufficient \u201cright of control\u201d over its franchisee such that the franchisee was its agent. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201cThe kind of actual agency relationship that would make [the franchisor] vicariously liable for [the franchisee\u2019s] negligence requires that [the franchisor] have the right to control the <em>method </em>by which [the franchisee] performed its obligations under the Agreement. The common context for that test is a normal master-servant (or employer-employee) relationship. <em>See, e.g., Jenkins v. AAA Heating, </em>245 Or 382, 386, 421 P2d 971 (1966); <em>Chard v. Beauty-N-Beast Salon, </em>148 Or App 623, 628, 941 P2d 611 (1997). The relationship between two business entities is not precisely an employment relationship, but the Oregon Supreme Court, in common with most if not all other courts that have considered the issue, has applied the right to control test for vicarious liability in that context as well. <em>See Peeples v. Kawasaki Heavy Indust., Ltd., </em>288 Or 143, 603 P2d 765 (1979). We therefore apply that test to this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><em>Miller, </em>150 Or App at 279 (emphasis in original). We noted that the Supreme Court in <em>Peeples </em>had held that, where \u201cthe record as a whole supported a finding that the distributor had the right to control the dealer\u2019s conduct in providing warranty service * * *[,] the trial court properly submitted the issue of the distributor\u2019s vicarious liability [for negligent service work] to the jury.\u201d 150 Or App at 279. We then observed that other courts had applied the \u201cright-to-control\u201d test in the franchise context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cA number of other courts have applied the right to control test to a franchise relationship. The Delaware Supreme Court, in <em>Billops v. Magness Const. Co., </em>391 A2d 196 (Del 1978), stated the test as it applies to that context:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201c \u2018If, in practical effect, the franchise agreement goes beyond the stage of setting standards, and allocates to the franchisor the right to exercise control over the daily operations of the franchise, an agency relationship exists.\u2019 391 A2d at 197-98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">\u201cThis statement expresses the general direction that courts have taken and is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Peeples. </em>We therefore adopt it for the purposes of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Miller, </em>150 Or App at 279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We then compared the Delaware court\u2019s decision in <em>Billops </em>to an Alabama case, <em>Wood v. Shell Oil Co., </em>495 So 2d 1034 (Ala 1986), in an effort to discern \u201cwhen a franchisor has retained a right not only to set standards but also to control the daily operations of the franchisee.\u201d 150 Or App at 280. After comparing the facts of those cases, we distilled the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201cThe essential distinction between <em>Wood </em>and <em>Billops </em>is the extent to which the franchisor retained control over the details of the franchisee\u2019s performance. In <em>Wood, </em>the franchisor required only that mechanical work be done in a workmanlike manner. In <em>Billops, </em>however, the franchisor issued a manual that described the methods by which the franchisee was to carry out its responsibilities in considerable detail. The agreement in <em>Wood, </em>thus, could only be read as providing standards that the franchisee had to meet, while the agreement in <em>Billops </em>could be read as retaining the right to exercise control over the franchisee\u2019s daily operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">150 Or App at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">We next examined the franchise relationship in <em>Miller </em>in light of that principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cThe facts of this case are close to those in <em>Billops. </em>For that reason, we believe that a jury could find that [the franchisor] retained sufficient control over [its franchisee\u2019s] daily operations that an actual agency relationship existed. The Agreement did not simply set standards that [the franchisee] had to meet. Rather, it required [the franchisor] to use the precise methods that defendant established, both in the Agreement and in the detailed manuals that the Agreement incorporated. Those methods included the ways in which [the franchisee] was to handle and prepare food. [The franchisor] enforced the use of those methods by regularly sending inspectors and by its retained power to cancel the Agreement. That evidence would support a finding that [the franchisor] had the right to control the way in which [the franchisee] performed at least food handling and preparation.

According to Domino\u2019s, franchise relationships \u2014 to the extent that they are agency relationships at all \u2014 are treated as nonemployee agency relationships under Oregon law; hence, a franchisor is vicariously liable only where the franchisor controlled the specific instrumentality or method that caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Cf. Miller, </em>150 Or App at 281 (concluding that the plaintiff had created a genuine issue of material fact regarding vicarious liability where there was evidence that the franchisor \u201chad the right to control [the franchisee] in the precise part of its business that allegedly resulted in plaintiffs injuries\u201d). Plaintiff, meanwhile, contends that <em>\u201cMiller </em>does not require courts to focus solely upon the control exercised by a franchisor over the specific instrumentality or method that caused the injury.\u201d Under plaintiffs reading of <em>Miller, </em>this court should apply a broader standard of vicarious liability akin to that applicable in the master-servant context.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Frankly, <em>Miller </em>is not entirely clear on the question whether the franchise relationship in that case was treated as an employee relationship or as a nonemployee agency relationship. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that the \u201cright to control\u201d is considered at various stages of the vicarious liability analysis: first, in determining whether an agency relationship exists at all (Is the purported agent subject to the principal\u2019s control?); second, in determining whether the agent is an employee or nonemployee agent (Does the purported principal have the right to control the physical details of the purported employee\u2019s work?); and third, in the case of a nonemployee agent, in determining whether the principal intended or authorized the result or manner of performance of the act (Did the principal have the right to control the physical details of the part of the business that injured the plaintiff?).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In <em>Miller, </em>we observed that \u201c[t]he relationship between two business entities is not precisely an employment relationship,\u201d but that Oregon courts have applied the \u201cright-to-control\u201d test in that context as well. 150 Or App at 279. Although our discussion of the \u201cright to control\u201d test was consistent with a conclusion that the franchisee in <em>Miller </em>was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>employee agent, our analysis that followed suggested otherwise. In determining whether there existed a jury question on the issue of vicarious liability, we focused not on whether the tort was committed within the course of employment but rather on whether there was a connection between the principal\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d and the specific conduct giving rise to the tort claim: \u201cThus, as in <em>Peeples, </em>there is evidence that [the franchisor] had the right to control [the franchisee] <em>in the precise part of its business that allegedly resulted in plaintiffs </em>injuries.\u201d 150 Or App at 281 (emphasis added). That is the standard typically applicable to <em>nonemployee </em>agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In <em>Miller, </em>this court essentially skipped over the question whether the franchisee was an employee of the franchisor in that case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addressing that question here, however, we are mindful of the court\u2019s observation in <em>Miller </em>that \u201cthe relationship between two business entities is not precisely an employment relationship.\u201d 150 Or App at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The test for determining whether an agent is an employee is predominantly driven by the \u201cextent to which the purported employer has the right to control the performance of services by the individual.\u201d <em>Schaff, </em>334 Or at 99-100. \u201c [T]here is no simple measure of the extent to which an employer may control a worker in the performance of his task without creating a master-servant relationship,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018control over performance remains the principal test.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100 (quoting <em>Jenkins v.

Other factors may bear on the analysis as well, namely the <em>Restatement </em>factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c \u2018(1) A servant is a person employed to perform services in the affairs of another and who with respect to the physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>conduct in the performance of the services is subject to the other\u2019s control or right to control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">\u201c \u2018(2) In determining whether one acting for another is a servant or an independent contractor, the following matters of fact, among others, are considered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201c \u2018(a) the extent of control which, by the agreement, the master may exercise over the details of the work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c \u2018(b) whether or not the one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c \u2018(c) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the employer or by a specialist without supervision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c \u2018(d) the skill required in the particular occupation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c \u2018(e) whether the employer or the workman supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">\u201c \u2018(f) the length of time for which the person is employed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\u201c \u2018(g) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">\u201c \u2018(h) whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">\u201c \u2018(i) whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relation of master and servant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">\u201c \u2018(j) whether the principal is or is not in business.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-15\"><em>Kowaleski, </em>235 Or at 460-61 <em>(quotingRestatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 220).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">In this case, Domino\u2019s set standards regarding many (if not most) of the daily operations of Zzeeks and retained the right to inspect Zzeeks and terminate the franchise relationship for violations of its standards. That control, however, must be viewed in the context of the particular relationship at issue. In the context of a franchise agreement, the franchisor always can be expected to establish certain standards for uniformity of operations; it is that uniformity \u2014 and the expectations that are associated with the franchisor\u2019s trade name \u2014 that make the franchise valuable. <em>See generally </em>Dean T. Fournaris, <em>The Inadvertent Employer: Legal and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Business Risks of Employment Determinations to Franchise Systems, </em>27 SPG Franchise LJ 224 (2008). Apart from that type of exercise of control, the undisputed evidence establishes that Domino\u2019s <em>did not </em>retain the right to control Zzeeks in the way that an employer controls an employee. The franchise agreement itself provides that the parties to the agreement are independent contractors. It further provides that \u201cit is not [Domino\u2019s\u2019] responsibility or duty to operate the Store\u201d and that Domino\u2019s \u201cdoes not have the legal right to direct [Zzeeks\u2019s] employees in the operation of the Store.\u201d Although those terms in a franchise agreement are not dispositive of whether the franchisee is an independent contractor rather than an employee, they are evidence of an independent contractor relationship. <em>Schaff, </em>334 Or at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Other aspects of the franchise relationship are patently inconsistent with the traditional employer-employee relationship and, in our view, dispositive. Under the franchise agreement, Domino\u2019s does not compensate Zzeeks as its employee; rather, Zzeeks \u201cagree[s] to pay [Domino\u2019s] a royalty fee of five and one-half percent (5-1/2%) of the weekly royalty sales of the Store\u201d in exchange for the right to use Domino\u2019s\u2019 trademark and uniform business format. Zzeeks bears responsibility under the franchise agreement for site development and construction, has the ability to advertise and promote itself, and ultimately has the right to assign away its rights or otherwise transfer its ownership interest in the franchise. Given the complex nature of the franchise relationship between these two businesses, no reasonable juror could conclude on this record that Zzeeks was Domino\u2019s\u2019 \u201cemployee.\u201d And for that reason, we conclude as a matter of law that Zzeeks was, at most, a <em>nonemployee </em>agent of Domino\u2019s. <em>Cf. Schaff, </em>334 Or at 103 (where \u201cfacts and any reasonable inferences that a jury could draw from those facts would not support a conclusion that the putative employer had the right to control the putative employee\u2019s work performance, then there is no triable issue of fact, and a defendant is entitled to have the issue decided as a matter of law\u201d); <em>Wallowa Valley Stages, Inc. v. Oregonian Pub. Co., </em>235 Or 594, 600, 386 P2d 430 (1963) (\u201cWhether or not a given person is the servant or the contractor of another is ordinarily a question of law, where the facts are clear.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>As the court explained in <em>Vaughn, </em>\u201ca principal ordinarily is <em>not </em>liable in tort for physical injuries caused by the actions of its agents who are not employees.\u201d 346 Or at 137 (emphasis in original). \u201cRather, a principal is vicariously liable for an act of its nonemployee agent only if the principal \u2018intended\u2019 or \u2018authorized the result [ ] or the manner of performance\u2019 of that act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 250). Thus, \u201cfor a principal to be vicariously liable for the negligence of its nonemployee agents, there ordinarily must be a connection between the principal\u2019s \u2018right to control\u2019 the agent\u2019s actions and the specific conduct giving rise to the tort claim.\u201d 346 Or at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><em>Vaughn, </em>like this case, involved a plaintiff who was injured as the result of allegedly negligent driving by a principal\u2019s nonemployee agent. The plaintiff in <em>Vaughn </em>was injured while riding on an airport shuttle bus, and she filed an action against the bus driver, Zavoral, and the shuttle bus company, First Transit, Inc. The defendants asserted that they were immune from liability as agents of the Port of Portland under the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA), and the trial court and this court agreed. The Supreme Court, however, reversed on the ground that the Port would not have been vicariously liable for the defendants\u2019 negligence at common law and, thus, the defendants were not \u201cagents\u201d of the Port for purposes of the OTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In determining whether the defendants shared the Port\u2019s immunity under the OTCA, the court framed the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201c[F]or the Port to be vicariously liable under the OTCA for First Transit\u2019s (or Zavoral\u2019s) negligence \u2014 and for plaintiffs to be limited to bringing an action against the Port <em>only </em>\u2014 defendants <em>must be able to show that the Port had the right to control the physical details of the manner of performance of the conduct giving rise to the tort </em>\u2014 Zavoral\u2019s <em>driving.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">346 Or at 141 (emphasis added). The court ultimately held that the defendants had not made that showing at the summary judgment stage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201cDefendants argue that [their] contract [with the Port] \u2018leaves First Transit with very little discretion over how to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>[run the shuttle bus operation]\u2019 and point to several provisions in the contract that give the Port control over various aspects of the shuttle bus business. <em>Plaintiff responds that the contract does not demonstrate that the Port maintained the right to control the physical details of the conduct giving rise to the claim, namely, the driving of First Transit\u2019s employees. See Jensen, </em>336 Or at 231, 236-38 (discussing principal\u2019s liability for actions of nonservant agents and focusing on specific allegedly wrongful conduct).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201cWe agree with plaintiff. Although the Port retained the right to reject unilaterally any of First Transit\u2019s employees, including its operations manager, that provision is not equivalent to one expressly retaining the right to control the day-to-day performance of those employees. The contractual provision instead appears to be a way for the Port to protect its interests if First Transit hires (or, more likely, fails to fire) an employee whom the Port thinks is particularly incompetent. We recognize that the contract does provide other limits on First Transit\u2019s hiring; for example, First Transit was obligated to ensure that all its drivers were properly licensed. However, those general hiring standards do not serve to grant control to the Port over the day-to-day performance of First Transit\u2019s employees. The performance standards, as they relate to the drivers, are general requirements that First Transit \u2018provide high quality customer service\u2019 and assure \u2018the neat appearance, courtesy, efficiency, and conduct\u2019 of its employees. <em>For the Port to be vicariously liable for the negligent driving of First Transit\u2019s employees, the Port would have to have the same right to control that driving as it would have over the driving of its own employees.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">346 Or at 141-42 (emphasis added). Thus, the court concluded that the contract itself did not \u201cprovide that the Port has the right to control the physical manner in which First Transit employees carried out their driving duties\u201d and did not \u201csupport the conclusion that First Transit or its employees, including Zavoral, were acting as agents of the Port for purposes of imposing vicarious liability on the Port for the alleged negligence of First Transit\u2019s shuttle bus drivers.\u201d Id</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The ultimate question in this case is similar to that in <em>Vaughn: </em>Whether a jury could conclude on this record that Domino\u2019s had the right to control the physical details of the conduct that injured plaintiff \u2014 namely, the manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Mathias carried out his driving duties. Although this presents a much closer case than <em>Vaughn </em>on that question, we nonetheless conclude that plaintiffs evidence falls short of creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Plaintiff contends that, as distinguished from the facts in <em>Vaughn, </em>Domino\u2019s established stringent controls regarding drivers, their vehicles, and delivery times. Plaintiff sets forth a long list of those \u201ccontrols\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201c(1) Drivers must be 18 years old and carry a state issued driver\u2019s license; (2) Drivers must have proof of insurance; (3) Drivers\u2019 Motor Vehicle Records need to be verified at the start of employment and at a minimum of every six months; (4) Drivers cannot have more than two violations in the past two years; (5) An employee who does not meet the standards may only work in a non-driving capacity and then only after signing a \u2018Non-Driving Agreement\u2019; (6) Drivers cannot drive with \u2018suspended,\u2019 \u2018provisional,\u2019 \u2018court restricted,\u2019 \u2018revoked,\u2019 \u2018learners permit,\u2019 or \u2018Junior\u2019 license; (7) Drivers and riders must wear seat belts; (8) Drivers cannot leave keys in unoccupied vehicles; (9) Tobacco use is not permitted by any driver while on the clock; (10) Drivers cannot use cell phone unless it is a \u2018hands free\u2019 device; (11) Driver Reference Book is required at the driver station; (12) Only team members in full uniform are permitted to deliver orders to customers; (13) Delivery drivers must wear a properly working watch when delivering product; (14) Drivers cannot look for an address when delivering a pizza; (15) Drivers must leave the store within sixty (60) seconds of being given a pizza and deliver it within nine (9) minutes; (16) Drivers can only drive certain types of vehicles, but not motorcycles; (17) Franchises can be terminated for failure to follow driving standards; and (18) Domino\u2019s conducts periodic and surprise inspections of franchise vehicles and delivery drivers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Although each of those \u201ccontrols\u201d touches on the delivery process, none of them gives Domino\u2019s the right to control <em>the physical details of the manner of driving. </em>The franchise agreement specifically provides that Zzeeks, not Domino\u2019s, is responsible for supervising the conduct of Zzeeks\u2019s employees. The fact that Domino\u2019s sets age or other hiring limits on drivers is a separate issue from the physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>details of driving; plaintiff alleges that he was injured because of Mathias\u2019s driving, not because of any negligence regarding Zzeeks\u2019s hiring process. Similarly, the fact that Domino\u2019s requires its franchisee\u2019s delivery drivers to undergo driving training does not establish control over the physical details of driving, once that training is complete. Again, plaintiff does not contend that Mathias\u2019s participation in a training program (or inadequate training program) was the conduct that injured plaintiff. Rather, plaintiffs theory is that Domino\u2019s is vicariously liable for Mathias\u2019s negligent driving, and plaintiffs evidence must establish more than the fact that Domino\u2019s set hiring and training standards for delivery drivers or standards for delivery vehicles. <em>See </em>Vaughn, 346 Or at 141 (general hiring standards, including licensing standards, and the right to reject the agent\u2019s employees, are not equivalent to a provision expressly retaining the right to control the day-to-day performance of the agent\u2019s employees\u2019 driving duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Nor are we persuaded that a jury could find that Domino\u2019s exposed itself to vicarious liability simply by establishing general driving safety standards, such as the requirement that drivers obey the rules of the road, or even the more particularized requirements that drivers use seatbelts and not use cell phones while driving. Setting those standards for a franchisee\u2019s employees and having the right to actually control how the franchisee\u2019s employees perform the physical details of driving are two different things. <em>Miller, </em>150 Or App at 274 (contrasting franchise agreement that \u201ccould only be read as providing standards that the franchisee had to meet\u201d with an agreement that \u201ccould be read as retaining the right to exercise control over the franchisee\u2019s daily operations\u201d). On that point, the facts in <em>Miller </em>provide a helpful contrast. In <em>Miller, </em>the negligent conduct at issue pertained to food handling and preparation. The franchisor, McDonald\u2019s Corp., established the ways in which its franchisee handled and prepared food, and McDonald\u2019s enforced the use of those particular methods through regular inspections and the right to cancel the agreement. 150 Or App at 281. Here, however, Domino\u2019s did not establish particularized driving standards regarding the physical details of driving, such as prescribing the route that Zzeeks\u2019s employees must take. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Domino\u2019s required that its franchisee\u2019s drivers generally obey the rules of the road and drive safely \u2014 generalized standards that allowed day-to-day control over the driving operations to remain with Zzeeks, the franchisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">In sum, the franchise agreement specifically provides that Zzeeks controls the day-to-day performance of its delivery drivers, and that Domino\u2019s has no right to control the conduct of those drivers. The fact that Domino\u2019s has the ability to protect its interests under the franchise agreement by terminating or suspending the franchisee\u2019s operations for violations of driving-related standards does not undermine that unambiguous allocation of control in the franchise agreement. Because the evidence in this summary judgment record establishes that Zzeeks \u2014 and not Domino\u2019s \u2014 had the right to control the physical details of the manner of performance of Mathias\u2019s driving, the trial court was correct to grant summary judgment in favor of Domino\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> Plaintiffs wife also asserted claims in this action, but those claims do not present separate issues.

In <em>Peeples, </em>the Supreme Court held that a distributor could be vicariously liable for the dealer\u2019s negligent servicing of a motorcycle where the evidence demonstrated that the distributor had \u201cthe contractual right to control the manner in which the dealer performed warranty service on Kawasaki motorcycles.\u201d 288 Or at 149-50. Thus, the focus for vicarious liability purposes was on whether the dealer had the right to control the particular conduct that injured the plaintiff, even though the court described the relationship between the two businesses in employer-employee terms: \u201cThere was evidence from which the jury could find that the dealer, acting as the distributor\u2019s employee, routinely checked and, if necessary, adjusted the chain and sprocket assembly before delivering a new motorcycle to a customer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
