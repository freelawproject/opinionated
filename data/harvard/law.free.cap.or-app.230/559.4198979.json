DMV, </em>228 Or App 689, 209 P3d 405 (2009). In that case, he appealed the suspension of his driver\u2019s license, arguing that the suspension was based on a breath test that was unlawfully obtained because the police officer who administered the test exceeded his authority by threatening to obtain a blood or urine sample if petitioner refused. We agreed that the test was unlawfully obtained and held that, if the unauthorized threat in fact induced petitioner\u2019s consent to the breath test, the results could not be used against him. Because the administrative law judge (ALJ) made no findings of fact as to whether the threat induced petitioner\u2019s consent, however, we reversed and remanded for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>at 699. In his petition for reconsideration, petitioner argues that, when an administratively imposed penalty is based on a legally unauthorized procedure, the penalty is invalid as a matter of law. In response, the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV) concedes that point. We accept DMVs concession, and we therefore allow the petition for reconsideration and modify our former opinion accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We briefly recite the facts and relevant procedural history. Following his arrest for driving while under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010, petitioner refused to consent to a breath test or to blood or urine tests. Deputy Romans informed petitioner that he would get a warrant for petitioner\u2019s blood and urine. Petitioner then responded, \u201cI will give a breath test.\u201d DMV suspended petitioner\u2019s driving privileges based on his breath test results. ORS 813.410(1). Following an administrative hearing, the ALJ issued a final order suspending petitioner\u2019s license for one year. ORS 813.420(4); ORS 813.430(2). The circuit court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On appeal, petitioner argued, first, that ORS 813.100(2) prohibits a police officer from administering a breath test after a driver has once refused to take the test, even if the driver, in response to the officer\u2019s renewed request, subsequently reconsiders and agrees. Concluding that our opinion in <em>State v. Kirsch, </em>215 Or App 67, 168 P3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>318 (2007), controlled on that issue, we rejected petitioner\u2019s first argument. <em>Hays, </em>228 Or App at 692-95. Second, petitioner argued that his decision to take the breath test was impermissibly coerced because it was given in response to the deputy\u2019s threat to obtain a warrant for his blood and urine, something that the deputy was not legally authorized to do. We agreed that the deputy\u2019s threat was unlawful because \u201cit violates the legal standard expressed or implied\u2019 by ORS 813.130 and ORS 813.131, <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. [v. Dept. of Human Res.], </em>297 Or [562, 565, 687 P2d 785 (1984)], and any consent thereby induced is not lawfully obtained.\u201d <em>Hays, </em>228 Or App at 699. However, because the ALJ made no findings of fact as to whether the threat actually caused petitioner to consent to the breath test, we reversed and remanded with instructions for the circuit court to remand to DMV for reconsideration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Petitioner now argues that, when an administratively imposed penalty is based on a legally unauthorized procedure, the penalty is invalid as a matter of law. DMV responds that our conclusion regarding the unlawful nature of the deputy\u2019s actions is incorrect, arguing, as it did on appeal, that the deputy complied with all of the statutory prerequisites for license suspension and that \u201c[w]hether [the deputy] then provided <em>additional </em>information to petitioner should not affect that conclusion.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) DMV concedes, however, that \u201cif \u2014 as this court has held\u2014 [the deputy\u2019s] unlawful threat violated [statutory proce dures], the suspension order necessarily must be set aside; in other words, petitioner need not demonstrate that the unlawful threat \u2018caused\u2019 his consent.\u201d We now reaffirm our conclusion that the deputy\u2019s actions were unlawful, but we accept DMVs concession regarding the need to establish causation. The deputy threatened \u201cto perform an act that the law does <em>not </em>permit [an] officer to perform,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe threat itself exceeds the officer\u2019s authority; it violates the \u2018legal standard expressed or implied\u2019 by ORS 813.130 and ORS 813.131.\u201d <em>Hays, </em>228 Or App at 699 (quoting <em>Planned Parenthood Assn., </em>297 Or at 565) (emphasis in original). Petitioner need not prove that the unlawful threat induced his consent to the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We base that conclusion on two factors. First, ORS 813.410(5)(e) provides that a license suspension \u201cis valid\u201d if\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>among other things \u2014 the driver failed a breath test after being \u201cinformed under ORS 813.100 of rights and consequences as described under ORS 813.130.\u201d Although that statement (\u201cif the driver is informed according to the statute, the breath test failure requires suspension\u201d) does not necessarily, as a matter of pure logic, imply its converse (\u201cif the driver is <em>not </em>informed according to the statute, the failure does <em>not </em>lead to suspension\u201d), the latter statement is strongly implied nonetheless. Second, in <em>Moore v. Motor Vehicles Division, </em>293 Or 715, 724, 652 P2d 794 (1982), the Supreme Court (in <em>dictum) </em>stated, \u201cAn administratively imposed penalty based on [a legally unauthorized] procedure would be invalid.\u201d In light of the foregoing, we allow the petition for reconsideration and now hold that the suspension of petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified; reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
