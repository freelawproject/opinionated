J.</author>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for three counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, three counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, ORS 163.575, and three counts of harassment, ORS 166.065. Defendant raises multiple assignments of error, challenging (1) the trial court\u2019s admission of letters that defendant wrote to his niece and her mother to show defendant\u2019s intent, motive, and absence of mistake or accident in touching his step-niece\u2019s breasts and buttocks; (2) the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s demurrer based on defendant\u2019s contention that the \u201ctouching of breasts\u201d and \u201ctouching of buttocks\u201d do not constitute \u201csexual conduct\u201d under the statute defining that term for purposes of ORS 163.575; (3) the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal based on the same contention raised in defendant\u2019s demurrer; (4) the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on \u201creasonable doubt\u201d; and, finally, (5) the nonunanimous guilty verdicts on three of the counts. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s second through fifth assignments of error and, as explained below, conclude that the letters that defendant wrote to his niece and her mother were properly admitted as evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d with respect to the three counts of endangering the welfare of a minor. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">For purposes of our review of the admission of the letters, the following circumstances and testimony at trial are material. On the afternoon of August 28,2005, defendant visited his half-sister and her family. At the time, the family consisted of mother (defendant\u2019s half-sister); father; J and K, mother\u2019s daughters from a previous marriage, 12 and nine years old, respectively; M, father\u2019s 11-year-old daughter from a previous marriage; and S, a four-year-old daughter of the couple\u2019s present marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Both M and J testified at trial. M\u2019s version of the facts was as follows: When defendant arrived at the girls\u2019 home that afternoon, M, K, and S were swimming while J was helping mother make dinner. After the family had dinner, M and J took showers and returned to their shared bedroom. While M was behind the bedroom door preparing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>get dressed, defendant, without knocking, stuck his head in the room, looked at M, and gave her \u201ca little smirk.\u201d J and M told defendant to \u201cget out,\u201d but defendant did not leave the room until M attempted to shut the door while defendant\u2019s head was still in the doorway.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Later, notwithstanding M\u2019s protests, defendant picked out M\u2019s school clothes for the next day, including her bra and underwear. Defendant also took pictures of the girls\u2019 \u201cbutts\u201d and \u201cbutt cracks\u201d and then deleted them. Defendant told the girls that, if they did not let him take pictures of them, \u201che would come back when [they] were asleep and take pictures of [them].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">At some point, defendant showed M a condom from his wallet and told her \u201cyou will need this later.\u201d Defendant also told the girls that he had had sex with his girlfriend three times previously that day. Defendant tried to guess M\u2019s and J\u2019s breast size and asked to touch J\u2019s breasts, but she refused. At one point, defendant sat behind M on the bed while she was on the floor and began massaging M\u2019s shoulders. Defendant told M that he was \u201creally good at giving back rubs\u201d and that \u201csometimes when he gives girls back rubs and when he touches their breasts, * * * they get orgasms.\u201d M told defendant to stop more than once before defendant ceased massaging her.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">According to M, defendant physically touched her several times. While M was reaching up onto the top bunk bed to grab something, defendant pulled down her pants two to three inches, causing M\u2019s underwear to come down. Defendant later swatted M\u2019s buttocks as she and J were both walking out of their bedroom. Defendant also grabbed M\u2019s breasts two or three times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first touching occurred when M was sitting on the floor, and defendant was lying on the bed behind her. Defendant reached over after he started massaging her shoulders and grabbed M\u2019s breasts with both hands and then let go. The second touching occurred when M was preparing to stand up from the floor, and defendant grabbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>and squeezed her breasts with both hands from behind. The third touching occurred when M was standing in front of the mirror; defendant stood behind M, reached over her shoulders, and grabbed her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">J\u2019s testimony added to, or differed from, M\u2019s testimony as follows: According to J, defendant took pictures not only of M\u2019s \u201cbutt,\u201d but also \u201cdown her shirt\u201d and \u201cup her shorts.\u201d J observed defendant \u201cpull[ ] [M\u2019s] pants like down to her knees and her underwear almost came down.\u201d J confirmed that she saw defendant \u201cslap[ ] [M] on the bottom\u201d but saw defendant \u201cgrab[ ]\u201d M\u2019s breasts twice, not three times. Each time defendant grabbed M\u2019s breast, he \u201ctwist[ed] it\u201d \u201creally quick\u201d and said \u201c[t]hat\u2019s pay back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">J also testified that, when defendant told the girls that he \u201cwanted to judge [their] breast size,\u201d she refused and put her arm over her chest. According to J, defendant pulled J\u2019s arm back to make her shirt tighter while looking at her breasts. Defendant also told the girls that \u201che likes girls with smaller breasts that could fit into his hand\u201d and that \u201che knew girls that had orgasms when you lick the nipples a certain way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Father testified that, at some point after dinner, he overheard defendant make an inappropriate comment about orgasms to M and J, and he \u201cescorted\u201d defendant from the house \u201c[b]ecause a[n] 11 and 12 year old shouldn\u2019t be subjected to somebody talking about orgasms.\u201d After forcing defendant to leave, father asked the girls what had happened. M told father that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201ctouched her butt, kind of pulled down her pants * * * a little bit when she was getting up on the bunk bed to try to get her purse or something off the top bunk, that he exposed part of her butt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">\u201cThat he had touched one or both of her breasts at a given time during the course of the hour and a half, two hours he was there. That she was sitting down on the bed or on the floor or somehow rather or other he had basically pulled her over to sit her on his lap.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>J confirmed that she had observed those events. Those disclosures led father to call 9-1-1, and Deputy Harrell from the Yamhill County Sheriffs Office responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">M gave a condensed report of the events of the afternoon to Harrell. M later gave a more detailed report to Detective Steele from the Yamhill County Sheriffs Office that largely reiterated what she had told Harrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Steele also interviewed defendant. Defendant admitted that he told the girls that \u201csome girls [have] orgasms when [they] get their nipples stimulated,\u201d and that he walked into the bedroom while M was changing, but maintained that \u201che didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d Defendant denied showing the girls a condom and claimed that \u201cthey must have been looking inside his wallet.\u201d Defendant said that he did not think he told the girls that they would need a condom later.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">As to discussing breast size with the girls, defendant explained that there was a Victoria\u2019s Secret bag in the room, and that he asked the girls who had the \u201cexpensive stuff.\u201d According to defendant, J showed him a Victoria\u2019s Secret bra, and he told her it \u201clooks kind of small for you.\u201d J then asked defendant why he would say that, and defendant indicated that he was a \u201cgood judge of breast size.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Defendant denied intentionally taking pictures of the girls\u2019 buttocks or up M\u2019s shirt. According to defendant, the camera had a three-second delay and the girls were moving when he was trying to take the pictures, which resulted in some pictures of the girls\u2019 backsides. Defendant maintained that the camera lacked a memory card so that he could take only one photo at a time and had to delete it before he could take another.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Regarding any physical contact, defendant maintained that he and M \u201cwere wrestling\u201d and involved in \u201chorseplay.\u201d Defendant told Steele during the police interview that he would \u201cgrab the girls around the upper body while he stood behind them, and that he would at times take them to the ground and * * * tickle them.\u201d Defendant admitted that he \u201ccould have felt [M]\u2019s breasts\u201d during the horseplay and that \u201cit could have happened, I just don\u2019t remember <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>it. * * * I can see how it could have happened.\u201d He acknowledged that M \u201ccould have thought she was touched by me when we were wrestling and playing around.\u201d Regarding M\u2019s buttocks, defendant maintained that he did not remember pulling M\u2019s pants down, but \u201cprobably did smack her on the butt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Defendant was charged by indictment with three counts of first-degree sexual abuse for touching the breasts and buttocks of M;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> three counts of endangering the welfare of a minor for knowingly inducing, causing, or permitting J to witness defendant\u2019s aforementioned sexual conduct;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and four counts of harassment committed by subjecting M, J, and K to offensive physical conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Defendant\u2019s theory at trial was that his touching of M was innocent and constituted \u201chorseplay.\u201d Defendant contended that he and the children were \u201chaving a good time\u201d and \u201cplaying around.\u201d Defendant noted that he never asked the girls to touch him and that he never had an erection in the children\u2019s presence. Defendant contended that the circumstances at the girls\u2019 home were \u201cnot conducive to sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>abuse\u201d \u2014 both girls were together all the time, it was light outside, defendant never showed any signs of arousal, and defendant never asked the girls to keep anything from their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">To counter defendant\u2019s claim that his touching of <em>M </em>was innocent, the state sought admission of a number of letters that defendant had written to both <em>J </em>(and mother) while he was incarcerated on a prior conviction. Those letters and the bases upon which the trial court admitted them into evidence are the focus of our analysis. Accordingly, we recount those matters in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Defendant first began writing his niece J when she was 11 years old, apparently in response to a letter that mother sent defendant enclosing pictures of the children. The subject of defendant\u2019s letters to J gradually shifted from somewhat benign content to explicitly sexual matters. For example, as the correspondence continued, defendant asked J what she had done with a boy and how far she had gone: \u201ckissing? more th[an] kissing? are you still a virgin?\u201d Defendant inquired as to how J dressed, what size bra she wore, and what type of underwear she wore, \u201cpant[ies]? Thongs? G-strings? low cut?\u201d He also suggested that the two go camping alone sometime so they could \u201cget to know each other Better or something.\u201d Defendant threatened to \u201crun * * * off\u2019 any boys that J was \u201csuckin any face\u201d with and to \u201cplant a Foot in [the] ass\u201d of any boy who was \u201cnot treating [J] good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Much of the content of the letters centered on defendant\u2019s requests that J send him photographs of herself. Defendant told J that the correctional facility rules prohibited her from sending photographs of her \u201c[nipples], Pubic Hair, Vagina, or Butt Hole,\u201d and forbade pictures of \u201cSexual acts,\u201d but that she could wear a \u201cBikini\u201d or a \u201cG-string.\u201d Defendant inquired as to whether J would send him photos of her in her \u201cBathing [suit],\u201d in her \u201cunderwear\u201d and \u201cbra,\u201d \u201cin a bubble Bath Covered By Bubbles,\u201d with her best friend and photos of just her best friend. In a letter to mother, he asked mother to buy J a camera so that she could take photos of herself and send them to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Defendant also asked J how old M was and to \u201ctell her I said Hi.\u201d He asked J about her \u201cbest friend,\u201d inquiring how old she was, if she talked to J about defendant, and, if so, \u201cwhat [does] she think about me?\u201d He also inquired as to what J\u2019s best friend looked like and asked J to describe the friend\u2019s eye color, hair color, height, and weight, \u201cand anything else you can think of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Before trial, defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the letters. Defendant contended that the letters were inadmissible because they were not relevant under OEC 401,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, alternatively, that the letters were more prejudicial than probative under OEC 403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant argued that, because the letters were written to J (and mother), neither of whom was an alleged victim of the first-degree sexual abuse charges, \u201cthe letters are not relevant and would very likely mislead the jury, and confuse the issues for the jury as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">At the pretrial conference, defendant added an objection under OEC 404(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant argued that the state was offering inadmissible character evidence for purposes of OEC 404(3), because the letters pertained to defendant\u2019s \u201cdisposition or propensity to commit certain crimes, wrongs or acts.\u201d According to defendant, \u201calthough evidence regarding a person\u2019s propensities may have probative value in determining conduct on a particular occasion, [it] is deemed to be outweighed by the nature of misleading the jury and unfairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>prejudicing a party.\u201d Defendant raised a continuing objection to the admissibility of the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The state responded that the letters were admissible for several nonpropensity purposes: <em>First, </em>the state contended that the letters were admissible to establish defendant\u2019s \u201cintent,\u201d <em>viz., </em>that the letters were admissible to prove that defendant\u2019s purpose in touching M was, in fact, sexual, rather than benign.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>Second, </em>the state argued that the letters showed an \u201cabsence of accident or mistake.\u201d That is, \u201cwhen [defendant] did go to his sister\u2019s house [he] did not accidentally or mistakenly touch the sexual parts of [M].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em>Third, </em>the state argued that the letters established defendant\u2019s \u201csexual predisposition\u201d toward these particular victims (J and M), as well as \u201ctoward girls of that age\u201d generally, because defendant wrote the letters to J when she was age 11 to 12, and, \u201cby the time * * * defendant gets to the home, [M] is the same age that [J] was when he was writing her those letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\"><em>Finally, </em>the state contended that the letters established defendant\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d because they \u201care clear evidence that [defendant] is grooming [J] for future criminal victimization.\u201d According to the state, defendant\u2019s motive was to \u201ccontinufe] to groom [J]\u201d by \u201ccommitt[ingj these sexual abuse crime[s] on [M] * * * in the presence of [J].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">After examining the letters, the trial court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">\u201csome of the * * * provisions that are talking about an unusual sexual interest as far as the threats and the attire and so forth * * * might be relevant. But I don\u2019t see how grooming of [J] * * * would be relevant to the sexual acts on [M] and no act, physical act that was given to [J].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">\u201cSo far I don\u2019t have any physical sexual act that was done to [J] that would be warranted in some type of grooming.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">The court deferred ruling on the admissibility of the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The state ultimately proffered the letters as evidence in its case-in-chief during J\u2019s testimony. The trial court admitted all the letters into evidence as relevant to prove defendant\u2019s intent, motive, and absence of mistake or accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201c[T]hose letters do show, at least they can infer a <em>sexual intent </em>towards [J].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\u201c* * * [W]hat is charged * * * is that [J] is being induced knowingly, [defendant] did unlawfully and knowingly induce, cause or permit [J] to witness an act of sexual conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u201cAnd why he would be doing that or the reason for it, those letters do explain some reason why he would be subjecting [M] and having questions to her and a discussion with her and the aspects about the condom, * * * all those kinds of things and taking pictures of her, it does go back to <em>his intent and motive </em>and those letters are evidence of some <em>intent or motive.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\u201c[The letters] do show <em>sexual intent </em>of the defendant to [M] and in relationship to some of the contact, contact and questions to [M], It does show what his <em>motive </em>would be as far as bringing all of that into play during the course of the discussion and the conversation with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201cAnd it also goes back into the aspect of why he would be talking about an orgasm or any other aspect or condom or other description of what he was talking about and that goes back to his <em>motive </em>in relationship to his physical acts toward the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">\u201cThe objection is overruled. The letters are admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Defendant reiterated that the letters were nonetheless unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403 and OEC 404(3). In response, the trial court ordered the state to excise any reference to defendant\u2019s incarceration at the time he wrote the letters. Additionally, the trial court determined that, as excised, the letters were not more prejudicial than probative under OEC 403 or OEC 404(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\">\u201c[0]ne of the reasons this is not more prejudicial than probative is that the issue of [defendant\u2019s] <em>intent and the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>motive as to why he was engaged in certain conduct, whether it was an accident or whether it was sexually inclined, </em>is a particularly relevant issue in this [case], these letters do bear on that, and that\u2019s why I found it is not more prejudicial than probative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The state presented testimony by an expert pertaining to \u201cgrooming\u201d behavior. With respect to touching-related conduct, the state\u2019s expert testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">\u201cthe offender may do a lot of wrestling or physical touching with a child that is suppose[d] to indicate * * * accidental touching, accidentally in the process of this wrestling or playing around, oh, my hand * * * touched your bottom or touched your private parts, your breasts. I didn\u2019t mean it. And so the child kind of learns to ignore the touching in that context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201cThe offender may make statements, comments to the child maybe about their body, about sexual body parts, may[be] they talk about their own sexual activity, kind of drawing a child into their confidence and saying things that we would recognize as inappropriate, but a child may just feel like this adult is giving me a lot of attention, they trust me, they are talking about this personal stuff, this is pretty cool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\u201cSome offenders will get kids to watch pornography with them or other inappropriate kinds of movies or pictures. Sometimes they will tell them that what I am doing, if they are doing something sexual, is to help educate you so that you\u2019ll know how to behave with somebody when you get older.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">\u201cThey give[ ] lots of different rationales to kids who are very trusting, and who generally are taught to believe and follow the directions of the adults in their lives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The state\u2019s expert testified that grooming typically follows a progression, so that if the child does not report the offender\u2019s actions, those actions progress to increasingly invasive types of touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The state\u2019s expert agreed that letters of a sexual nature written to an 11- or 12-year-old certainly could qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>as grooming behavior. In this case, defendant\u2019s conduct in asking J \u201cif she [was] a virgin or if she had a boyfriend,\u201d were typical entry-level questions in grooming behavior. The expert agreed that requesting photos of a child also \u201ccertainly can be\u201d considered grooming behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The jury ultimately found defendant guilty of the three counts of first-degree sex abuse based on defendant \u201c[t]ouching [M]\u2019s [b]reast\u201d twice (Counts 1 and 2), and \u201c[t]ouching [M]\u2019s [b]uttocks\u201d (Count 3); three counts of endangering the welfare of a minor based on J twice \u201cwitnessing the touching of [M]\u2019s breast\u201d (Counts 4 and 5), and \u201c[J] witnessing the touching of [M]\u2019s buttocks\u201d (Count 6); and three counts of harassment, based on defendant\u2019s conduct of \u201c[p]ulling [d]own [M]\u2019s pants\u201d (Count 7), \u201c[r]ubbing [M]\u2019s shoulders\u201d (Count 8), and \u201c[h]olding [J] [w]hile [l]ooking at [h]er [b]reast\u201d (Count 9).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of the letters that defendant wrote to J and mother. Defendant primarily reiterates his contentions raised before the trial court, arguing that the letters were proffered only to demonstrate that \u201cdefendant acted in conformity with his predisposition to young girls\u201d and, thus, were inadmissible under OEC 401, OEC 403, and OEC 404(3). Specifically, defendant contends that the letters were not admissible for <em>any </em>purpose. In support of that contention, defendant emphasizes that (1) the letters were sent to <em>J </em>(and mother), not <em>M; </em>and (2) the factual dispute at trial centered on whether defendant had the requisite mental state in touching <em>M. </em>Defendant thus argues that, because the state prosecuted defendant for sexually touching M to arouse or gratify his own \u201csexual desire,\u201d \u201cletters written to other people have no logical relevance to defendant\u2019s intent while he played with [M] months later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The state responds that the trial court properly admitted the letters for nonpropensity purposes of \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cmotive\u201d under OEC 401 and OEC 404(3) and asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that the letters could have been properly admitted as evidence of \u201cplan.\u201d Finally, as an alternative basis for affirmance, the state argues that OEC 404(4) prohibited the court from excluding the evidence under OEC 403.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">As we will proceed to explain, we conclude that the letters were, in fact, probative of defendant\u2019s conscious \u201cmotive\u201d in touching M in J\u2019s presence. Further, regardless of any reference to OEC 404(4), the trial court did not err in determining that the admission of that evidence comported with OEC 403. Accordingly, the letters were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As noted, OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of <em>motive, </em>opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">A three-part test applies when a party seeks to introduce prior bad acts evidence to prove motive under OEC 404(3): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>State v. Johnson, </em>313 Or 189, 195, 832 P2d 443 (1992) (footnotes omitted; bracketed material added). Defendant does not dispute that the state satisfied the second step in the test. Defendant focuses instead on the first and third steps.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>\u201c(1) The evidence must be independently relevant for a non-character purpose [such as, in this case, proof of motive]; (2) the proponent of the evidence must offer sufficient proof that the uncharged misconduct was committed and that defendant committed it; and (3) the probative value of the uncharged misconduct evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the dangers or considerations set forth in OEC 403.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The first requirement of the <em>Johnson </em>test mandates that the evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts be relevant for a noncharacter purpose \u2014 in this case, \u201cmotive.\u201d Defendant contends that the state\u2019s intention in presenting the letters was to unfairly impugn his character. The state responds that the letters are relevant to prove defendant\u2019s motive in committing the three counts of endangering the welfare of a minor. According to the state, the letters, in combination with the testimony of the state\u2019s expert, \u201cpermitted an inference that before defendant visited the [girls\u2019] house * * *, he had begun grooming [J] for subsequent sexual conduct.\u201d The state argues that that evidence of predicate grooming is, in turn, relevant to show that defendant\u2019s motive \u2014 his conscious purpose \u2014 in touching M sexually in J\u2019s presence was to perpetuate the grooming of J. That is, that defendant acted for the purpose of \u201cdesensitizing] [J] of any negative feelings she might have about such touching, and to gauge [J]\u2019s reaction to sexual activity before drawing her into actual sexual contact with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Motive is \u201ca cause or reason that moves the will and induces action, an inducement which leads to or tempts the mind to commit an act.\u201d <em>State v. Hampton, </em>317 Or 251, 257 n 12, 855 P2d 621 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See generally State v. Bracken, </em>174 Or App 294, 302-03, 23 P3d 417, <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 162 (2001) (addressing admissibility of evidence to establish \u201cmotive\u201d as distinct from \u201cintent\u201d under OEC 404(3)). Accordingly, to be relevant for the non-propensity purpose of \u201cmotive,\u201d the letters must have some tendency to show that defendant had a cause or reason to \u201cknowingly * * * [i]nduce[ ], cause[ ] or permit[ ]\u201d J to \u201cwitness an act of sexual <em>conduct\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., to witness the touching of M\u2019s breasts and buttocks in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification. ORS 163.575(l)(a) (describing the offense of \u201cendangering the welfare of a minor\u201d); ORS 167.060(10) (defining the term \u201csexual conduct\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.575).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Defendant contends that evidence of a sexual inclination or desire toward J was irrelevant to his culpability for the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor. In support of that contention, defendant argues that ORS 163.575 does not require defendant to have any sexual motivation towards the victim (here, J); rather, defendant asserts, that statute merely requires that a defendant knowingly engage in an act of sexual conduct in front of the victim \u2014 regardless of the defendant\u2019s purpose, including any sexual feelings or motivations towards the victim. <em>See </em>230 Or App at 625 n 3 (quoting ORS 163.575). Thus, defendant contends, motive is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Defendant\u2019s understanding of ORS 163.575 is correct, but his conclusion is not. Motive <em>qua </em>motive is not an element of the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor; a defendant may be culpable under ORS 163.575 regardless of whether he or she acted for some sexual purpose pertaining to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">That said, however, proof of a defendant\u2019s sexual interest in the victim <em>can </em>be relevant \u2014 and, here, was relevant \u2014 in determining whether the defendant engaged in an \u201cact of <em>apparent sexual stimulation or gratification,\u201d </em>ORS 167.060(10) (emphasis added), with another (here, M) in the victim\u2019s (J\u2019s) presence. Specifically, evidence of a pattern of grooming behavior directed against J made it more likely that defendant \u2014 rather than merely benignly or incidentally touching M in J\u2019s presence \u2014 touched M in a fashion tantamount to an \u201cact of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification,\u201d ORS 167.060(10), so as to expose J to such conduct in an effort to \u201cdesensitize\u201d J to sexual touching so that she would ultimately be more susceptible to defendant\u2019s future sexual advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Here, the state presented evidence from which a jury could conclude that defendant, by way of the letters, was grooming J for future sexual victimization. The state\u2019s expert testified in great detail as to what constitutes \u201cgrooming.\u201d The expert confirmed that writing letters of a sexual nature to an 11- or 12-year-old \u201ccertainly\u201d could be seen as grooming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>behavior. In particular, the expert stated that defendant\u2019s statements to J asking if she was a \u201cvirgin\u201d and if she had a boyfriend were \u201ctypical entry level questions that are grooming behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The state\u2019s expert did not testify as to whether sexually touching one child in front of another child could constitute \u201cgrooming.\u201d Nonetheless, defendant did not argue to the trial court \u2014 and does not argue on appeal \u2014 that, to demonstrate relevance, the state was required, as a foundational matter, to present expert testimony that defendant\u2019s touching of M in front of J could constitute continued \u201cgrooming\u201d of J. <em>See State v. Leach, </em>169 Or App 530, 537, 9 P3d 755 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 632 (2001) (declining to address whether the state was required to present expert testimony that the defendant\u2019s comments to the victim constituted \u201cgrooming\u201d because the defendant failed to contend before the trial court or on appeal that such testimony was required to demonstrate relevance).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Absent such a foundational challenge, and, given the very low threshold of relevance, we cannot say that the trial court erred in determining that a logical relationship existed between the letters and defendant\u2019s motive to expose J to his touching of M in an \u201cact of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification.\u201d <em>See </em>Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 401.03, 141-42 (5th ed 2007) (\u201cThe determination of relevance * * * allows the trial court to draw upon its own experience, knowledge, and common sense in determining whether a logical relationship exists between offered evidence and the fact to be proven.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the first part of the <em>Johnson </em>test was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The third part of the <em>Johnson </em>test requires that the letters\u2019 probative value \u201cnot be substantially outweighed by the dangers or considerations set forth in OEC 403.\u201d 313 Or at 195. Evidence is properly excluded under OEC 403 if its \u201cprobative value\u201d is \u201csubstantially outweighed by,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d Evidence is \u201cunfairly prejudicial\u201d if it appeals to the preferences of the factfinder for reasons that are unrelated to its capacity to establish a material fact. <em>State v. Barone, </em>328 Or 68, 87, 969 P2d 1013 (1998), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1135 (2000). We review a trial court\u2019s ruling under OEC 403 for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Williams, </em>313 Or 19, 29-30, 828 P2d 1006, <em>cert den, </em>506 US 858 (1992). This court \u201cgenerally defers to the trial court\u2019s decision whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the potential for prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the letters over his OEC 403 objection, because the court did not conduct the four-step inquiry established in <em>State v. Mayfield, </em>302 Or 631, 645, 733 P2d 438 (1987) (a trial court is required to (1) \u201cassess the proponent\u2019s need\u201d for the proffered evidence; (2) \u201cdetermine how prejudicial the evidence is\u201d; (3) balance the proponent\u2019s need for the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice; and (4) make a ruling to admit all, part, or none of the proffered evidence). <em>See State v. Sewell, </em>222 Or App 423, 428, 193 P3d 1046 (2008) , <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>225 Or App 296, 201 P3d 918 (2009) (trial court errs if it fails to make a record showing that it engaged in the four-step <em>Mayfield </em>analysis). Defendant argues that \u201cthe record provides none of the deliberation that <em>Mayfield </em>mandates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The state responds that it is evident from the totality of the record that the trial court did, in fact, engage in the requisite <em>Mayfield </em>analysis, even if it did not explicitly express its ruling in <em>Mayfield\u2019s </em>rubric. The state also raises, for the first time on appeal, an alternative basis for affirm<em>ance </em>\u2014 viz., that OEC 404(4) prohibited the court from excluding the letters under OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Defendant, in turn, contends that OEC 404(4) did not prohibit the court from excluding the evidence under OEC 403, because OEC 404(4) violates the state and federal equal protection clauses and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state remonstrates that defendant\u2019s constitutional challenges to OEC 404(4) are not properly before us because they were not preserved, and, in any event, neither the state nor federal constitutions required OEC 403 balancing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Because the parties\u2019 contentions regarding OEC 404(4) have constitutional implications, we address whether the trial court erred in admitting the letters over defendant\u2019s OEC 403 objection before addressing whether OEC 404(4) would, nevertheless, have precluded the court from excluding the letters on that basis. <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 564, 687 P2d 785 (1984) (\u201cThis court follows the principle that constitutional issues should not be decided where there is an adequate statutory basis for a decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling comported with <em>Mayfield. </em>We recognize that <em>Mayfield </em>established an \u201capproved method of analysis\u201d that should guide trial courts in their decision-making under OEC 403. <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 235, 809 P2d 81 (1991). In this case, however, \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that the court did not expressly follow the <em>Mayfield </em>analysis,\u201d the record establishes that, in deciding to admit the letters, the trial court considered the matters prescribed in <em>Mayfield. State v. Meyers, </em>132 Or App 585, 588, 889 P2d 374 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The trial court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201c[0]ne of the reasons this is not more prejudicial than probative is that the issue of [defendant\u2019s] intent and the motive as to why he was engaged in certain conduct, whether it was an accident or whether it was sexually inclined, is a particularly relevant issue in this, these letters do bear on that, and that\u2019s why I found it is not more prejudicial than probative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The court went on to conclude that, under OEC 403, the state was required to excise from the letters any reference to defendant\u2019s incarceration at the time he wrote the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Although the court\u2019s statements are not extensive, the totality of the attendant circumstances indicate that the court did engage in the \u201c \u2018conscious process of balancing the costs of the evidence against its benefits\u2019 \u201d that <em>Mayfield </em>requires. <em>State v. Pinnell, </em>311 Or 98, 112, 806 P2d 110 (1991) (quoting Wright &amp; Graham, 22 <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 5214, 263-64 (1978)). First, the court\u2019s finding, that the letters were \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d to defendant\u2019s motive or intent and to whether the touching was an accident or mistake, manifests the court\u2019s opinion that the state\u2019s need for the proffered evidence was particularly significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Second, and strikingly, the trial court did not admit the letters wholesale and indiscriminately; instead, the court excluded some content in the letters regarding defendant\u2019s incarceration. That exclusion evinces a conscious, nuanced consideration of the unfairly prejudicial potential of certain aspects of the letters\u2019 content.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">This case represents a close discretionary call. To be sure, admission of the letters presented the possibility that jurors would draw impermissible propensity-related inferences from the evidence. Indeed, it is possible that, if presented with the matter in the first instance, we might have struck the discretionary balance differently. But, ultimately, that is immaterial. What <em>is </em>material is that the trial court\u2019s determination was within the range of legally permissible outcomes. <em>See State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (\u201cabuse of discretion\u201d means that the court\u2019s decision was not \u201cwithin the range of legally correct discretionary choices\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In sum, the trial court, in admitting the letters with certain redactions, permissibly exercised its discretion in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>manner that comported with <em>Mayfield </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>Accordingly, the court did not err.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> At times, M stated that defendant grabbed her breasts \u201ctwo times,\u201d but ultimately described three separate incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-6\"> ORS 163.427 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-10\"> ORS 163.575 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor if the person knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">\u201c(a) Induces, causes or permits an unmarried person under 18 years of age to witness an act of sexual conduct * * * as defined by ORS 167.060[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">In turn, \u201csexual conduct\u201d is defined as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u201chuman masturbation, sexual intercourse, or any touching of the genitals, pubic areas or buttocks of the human male or female, or the breasts of the female, whether alone or between members of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">ORS 167.060(10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b667-16\"> ORS 166.065 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-17\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of harassment if the person intentionally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ave\">\u201c(a) Harasses or annoys another person by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-18\">\u201c(A) Subjecting such other person to offensive physical contact[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> OEC 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> OEC 403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.
