We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-32\">The merchandise at bar is woven fabric concededly in chief weight of wool<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>and allegedly in chief value of asbestos. It was classified as \u201cWoven fabrics, of wool,\u201d TSUS 336.50, by virtue of headnote 7 to schedule 3, which provides that \u201cWith respect to fabrics provided for in part 3 * * * of this schedule, provision for fabrics in chief value of wool<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall also apply to fabrics in chief weight of wool,\u201d and it is claimed as \u201ccloth * * * of asbestos, or of asbestos and any other spinnable fiber,\u201d TSUS 518.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">The Customs Court initially conceded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-6\">If read without reference to other provisions of the tariff schedules, * * * [item 518.21] would cover the instant merchandise, if in chief value of asbestos, under the provision for cloth of asbestos; otherwise, under the provision for cloth of asbestos and other spinnable fibers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">Parenthetically, we note that item 336.50 covers the instant merchandise just as aptly, \u201cIf read without reference to other provisions of the tariff schedules Thig question, then, is how to harmonize two seemingly discordant provisions. This the Customs Court did by reading item 518.21 in conjunction with headnote 1 (ii) of schedule 3, which excepts therefrom \u201casbestos fibers, or yarns, fabrics, or other articles containing asbestos in significant amounts, i. e\u201e articles in which asbestos is used' in sufficient amounts to impart its peculiar characteristics or properties to the article (see part IF of ' schedule 5) * * It conceded that there is ho corresponding provision in part IF of schedule 5 itself, but reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-10\">* * * the cross reference in schedule 3 is an indication that Congress intended that yarns, fabrics or other articles containing asbestos in significant amounts, as defined in the headnote, should be classified in schedule 5, part IF, but that yarns, fabrics or textile articles containing insignificant amounts of asbestos should be classified in schedule 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">In additional support of its holding that \u201cThe criterion [for inclusion under item 518.21] is not chief value, but the characteristics or properties of asbestos imparted to the article,\u201d the Customs Court quoted from relevant portions of the Tariff Classification Study and from the legislative history of headnote 7 to schedule 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">The court then disposed of appellant\u2019s two constitutional arguments, which were and are that the enactment of headnote 7 to schedule 3 violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment because it was contained in a rider which \u201chad absolutely no relation to the title of the act under which it was enacted into law\u201d and that headnote 1 (ii) to schedule 3 is \u201cvoid for vagueness.\u201d Noting that \u201cmixed legislation is often enacted,\u201d the court held that \u201cThere is no restriction in the Constitution limiting Congress to one subject of legislation in each bill * * As for the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d argument, the Customs Court questioned the applicability of the doctrine to tariff statutes but concluded that, in any event, headnote 1 (ii) sets a standard which can be understood reasonably well by those to whom it is directed and that it therefore would not be constitutionally infirm even if the doctrine were held applicable to tariff statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-17\">Finally, the Customs Court indicated that among the \u201cpeculiar characteristics\u201d of asbestos to which the statute might have reference are incombustibility, nonconduetivity, high specific gravity, and resistance to chemicals and moths. Turning to the evidence on these subjects, which had been adduced by both parties, the court held that the above characteristics had not been imparted to the importations and/or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>creased therein relative to otherwise similar fabrics not containing asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">We will discuss the issues presented by this appeal in slightly different order than they were discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">I. <em>Constitutionality of the Enactment of Headnote 7</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Appellant seems to be making two separate arguments on this score: First, that the text of a piece of legislation must be logically related to its title, and, second, that unrelated provisions may not be included in one piece of legislation. Appellate concedes that there are no such restrictions specifically set forth in the Constitution, but urges us to read one or both of them into the general provision of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Since it never has been the law that the enactment <em>by Congress </em>of mixed legislation or of legislation the substance of which is unrelated to its title is unconstitutional, see, e. g., Hadden v. The Collector, 72 U.S. 107, 18 L.Ed. 518 (1886), and since appellant\u2019s principal argument seems to be that these restrictions have been generally adopted by the several states in their respective state constitutions, this seems to be one of those cases in which it is argued that a practice, once considered constitutional, <em>has become </em>unconstitutional because of our society\u2019s increasingly demanding conception of \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d Cf. Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 27, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949). It may be that the time has indeed come for the Supreme Court to re-examine such old cases as Hadden v. The Collector, supra. However, we ourselves see nothing pernicious in the practices appellant has asked us to condemn, nor has the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for Congress\u2019s inclusion in the Organic Act of the Philippines of <em>express </em>provisions such as appellant would have us read into the due process clause persuaded us that such limitations on the power of the legislature are a necessary element of the fundamental law of every civilized country. Furthermore, we, too, are aware that Congress often passes mixed legislation and legislation which bears no relationship to its title, and we would be reluctant indeed to cast all such legislation (or, at least, all such <em>recent </em>legislation) into doubt without a far stronger showing of consensus among scholars of the law and political science than appellant has made here. Compare Wolf v. Colorado, supra, at 29-30, 69 S.Ct. 1359. Accordingly, we hold that the enactment of headnote 7 of schedule 3 did not violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-12\">II. <em>Constitutionality of Headnote 1(H)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">Appellant argues that headnote 1 (ii) of schedule 3, quoted supra, \u201cdoes not set a reasonable standard whereby the importer can determine whether he has complied with the statute\u201d and that it \u201cleaves him to the whim of the Customs Bureau * * Although appellant makes much of the alleged indefiniteness of the term \u201csignificant amounts,\u201d that term is defined for purposes of this headnote as \u201csufficient amounts to impart its [i. e., asbestos\u2019s] peculiar characteristics or properties to the article,\u201d and it is really on the intelligibility of that phrase that appellant\u2019s arguments must stand or fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">The Government emphasizes the word \u201creasonably\u201d in the opinion below, arguing that \u201cAbsolute precision is not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>quired\u201d in the drafting of statutes in general and the tariff schedules in particular. Rather, to quote American Communications Ass\u2019n, C. I. O. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 412, 70 S.Ct. 674, 691, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-5\">The applicable standard * * * is the practical criterion of fair notice to those to whom the statute is directed. The particular context is all important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">While the Government concedes that the controverted terms are not \u201cabsolutely precise,\u201d it argues that, \u201cin the context herein, they are not \u2018so vague as to furnish no valid rule or standard\u2019 * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Additionally, the Government makes two further arguments of general applicability to the Tariff Schedules. First, it argues that the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine applies only to criminal statutes and to civil statutes providing for the exaction of a penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, it argues that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process standards should be held inapplicable to the power of Congress to determine the terms upon which <em>merchandise </em>may enter the United States, just as it has been held inapplicable to the power of Congress to determine the terms upon which <em>people </em>may enter the United States. See Boutilier v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 387 U.S. 118, 87 S.Ct. 1563, 18 L.Ed.2d 661-(1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">It may be conceded that headnote 1 (ii) to schedule 3 is not a model of legislative drafting, and it may even be hoped that this litigation will lead to its amendment. However, we recognize that, if the objective of headnote 1 (ii) was to exclude from schedule 3 those articles in which asbestos served <em>any </em>functional role, it would not have been easy to have phrased the headnote in terms of exact proportions or a single, rigorously accurate test. There are too many variables to be considered, not the least of which is that asbestos apparently has a plurality of \u201cpeculiar characteristics or properties,\u201d each one of which may be imparted to a given substance at a different level of asbestos concentration. We have previously recognized that unreasonable precision cannot be expected in the drafting of the tariff schedules, Amity Fabrics, Inc. v. United States, 435 F.2d 569, 58 CCPA 73, C.A.D. 1006 (1970) , Arthur J. Fritz &amp; Co. v. United States, 452 F.2d 1399, 59 CCPA, 6 Cust. Bull &amp; Dec. No. 3 at 20, C.A.D. 1036 (1971) , and the mere fact that there may be marginal cases in which it is difficult to determine whether amounts of asbestos were used which were \u201csignificant\u201d in the statutory sense does not establish that the language is unconstitutionally ambiguous. Compare United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 618, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954), and United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947). Additionally, to paraphrase the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Harriss, </em>\u201cif this classification can be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction of the schedules, this Court is under a duty to give the schedules that construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-15\">The \u201cpeculiar characteristics or properties\u201d of asbestos which appear to be potentially relevant in cases of this sort are incombustibility, nonconductivity, high density, and resistance to chemicals, moths, and dyes. The opinion below examines appellant\u2019s evidence concerning the extent to which the properties were added to otherwise identical cloths by the addition of the asbestos and the manufacturer\u2019s purpose in adding the asbestos. We fully approve the manner in which the lower court evaluated appellant\u2019s evidence. In effect, it held that the \u201cpeculiar characteristics or properties\u201d of asbestos had not been imparted to an article unless the asbestos was present in sufficient quantity to serve a commercial purpose. Cf. Varsity Watch Co. v. United States, 34 CCPA 155, 162-163, C.A.D. 359 (1947), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>and John S. Connor, Inc. v. United States, 54 Cust.Ct. 213, 219, C.D. 2536 (1965). We think that this construction of headnote 1 (ii) is a reasonable construction and that, flexible as it is, it is sufficiently definite to pass muster under the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine. It is, after all, quite akin to the de min-imis rule and no vaguer than many other concepts with which we must deal. Thus we do not reach the Government\u2019s arguments that the draftsmen of the tariff schedules were, in any event, exempt from both the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine in particular and the requirements of due process in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">III. <em>Harmonization of TSUS Items 336.50 and 518.21</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Whether or not appellant proved that the imports at bar were in chief value of asbestos, it seems reasonable to assume that it is possible to produce fabric which <em>is </em>in chief weight of wool and in chief value of asbestos. At first blush such fabric would seem to be provided for twice in the schedules, and it therefore was incumbent upon the Customs Court to harmonize the two competing provisions in some fashion. This it did by reading the two items in conjunction with \u201cAll relevant headnotes,\u201d as required by R. H. Macy &amp; Co. v. United States, 57 CCPA 115, 118, 428 F.2d 856, 859, C.A.D. 988 (1970), and general headnote 9, which states that the term \u201cof\u201d means \u201cwholly or in chief value of\u201d the named material <em>\u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.) While the result arrived at by the Customs Court is not wholly free from doubt, we think that it is reasonable in view of the express language of the schedules and is supported by the Classification Study and by the legislative history of headnote 7 to schedule 3, quoted at length in the opinion below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">IV. <em>Effect of the Asbestos</em></p>\n<p id=\"aua-dedup-0\">Accordingly, we turn to the final questions, whether there was evidence to support the lower court\u2019s resolution of the factual issues and, if so, whether its resolution thereof was clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence. United States v. F. W. Myers &amp; Co., 45 CCPA 48, 52, C.A.D. 671 (1958). The Customs Court held that appellant had not shown that the addition of approximately 8% asbestos to a woven fabric otherwise consisting of wool and nylon in the ratio of 3.6 to 1 by weight had served any commercial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">Appellant argues that \u201cThe record shows that a fabric with 8% asbestos is more flame retardant and moth resistant than a similar cloth without any asbestos content\u201d and that \u201cthe addition of 8% asbestos substantially increases the weight of the fabric and lends greater heat resistance and insulation to the fabric.\u201d We think that, at least with respect to flame retardance and moth resistance, these statements are probably accurate. However, the question is not whether the addition of the asbestos made <em>any </em>difference; it is whether the addition made <em>enough </em>difference to be commercially significant. On that point there is ample evidence, set forth at length in the opinion below, that the addition of the asbestos was not commercially significant except insofar as it arguably entitled the importations to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>much lower import duty than otherwise identical cloth without the asbestos would have been entitled to. Indeed, we are left with the strong impression that the possibility that this cloth would be entitled to the lower duty rate provided for \u201ccloth * * * of asbestos\u201d was the sole reason that the asbestos was used in the cloth. While there is nothing morally reprehensible about arranging one\u2019s affairs so as to minimize customs duties, the possibility of obtaining a lower rate is not itself a \u201ccommercial purpose\u201d such as is involved here. Appellant has not persuaded us that the Customs Court erred in holding that the asbestos in these importations served no other \u201ccommercial purpose.\u201d Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">BALDWIN, J., concurs in result only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">WORLEY, C. J., took no part in the decision of this ease.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1250-19\">. While there was considerable controversy below over the exact composition, the Customs Court found the exportation to contain \u201cby weight approximately 70.4 per cent reprocessed wool, 21.8 percent nylon and 7.8 percent asbestos.\u201d The exact figures are important only in computing relative values; the fabric was in chief weight of wool by all measurements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">. General headnote 9, Definitions, provides that, \u201cunless the context otherwise requires,\u201d the term \u201cof,\u201d when used between the description of an article and a ma-t\u00e9rial, \u201cmeans that the article is wholly or in chief value of the named material</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">. In Posados v. Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., 279 U.S. 340, 49 S.Ct. 333, 73 L.Ed. 729 (1929), cited to us by appellant, the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agt-dedup-0\">The purpose [of provisions barring mixed legislation and legislation the subject of which is unrelated to the title] is to prevent the inclusion of incongruous and unrelated matters in the same measure and to guard against inadvertence, stealth and fraud in legislation. When bills conform to such requirements, their titles serve conveniently to apprise legislators and the public of the subjects under consideration.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">. The Government implicitly assumes that the exaction of a penalty is not to be equated with the exaction of ordinary duties or taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">. The Government also argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-7\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that by incorporation of General Interpretative Rule 9 (f) (i) into item 518.21, and by incorporation of headnote 7 into item 336.50, the competition were between \u201cdoth in chief value of asbestos\u201d and \u201cwoven fabrics in chief weight of wool,\u201d the weight criterion of item 336.50 \u201cprovides for the article with the greatest degree of accuracy and certainty\u201d (United States, etc. v. Simon Saw &amp; Steel Co., 51 CCPA 33, 41, C.A.D. 834 (1964)), and \u201cwoven fabrics\u201d is more specific than \u201ccloth\u201d since \u201ccloth\u201d is a generic term which encompasses \u201ca woven, knitted or pressed fabric * * *.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, College Edition (1962), p. 276.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1254-13\">While we do not find it necessary to rely on this argument, we think it has considerable merit and might well have carried the day for the Government even in the absence of other considerations present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
