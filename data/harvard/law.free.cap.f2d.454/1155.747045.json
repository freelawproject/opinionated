We </em>grant his motion and summarily remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-16\">In the complaint which he attempted to file in the court below, Rocha sought $10,000 damages and a mandatory injunction against the respondents, officials of the Louisiana State Prison, where he is incarcerated. He alleged that he has been denied adequate medical treatment for accidental injuries sustained in the prison, and that he is being subjected to unwarranted disciplinary action without due regard for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-17\"> The district court refused to allow the complaint to be filed, stating that it did not present a federal question, but rather one that should be adjudicated in state court. This ruling is clearly incorrect since, as Rocha stated in his pleadings below, the action is founded on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 et seq. See Woolsey v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 321. Even if the State of Louisiana provided a remedy for the relief Rocha seeks, federal jurisdiction can be invoked prior to seeking relief in State court. Jones v. Decker, 5th Cir. 1970, 436 F.2d 954, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-18\">Accordingly, and without passing upon the merits of the allegations of the complaint, we grant Rocha\u2019s motion for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>The cause is remanded to the district court for appropriate findings and conclusions, and a trial on the merits if deemed necessary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1218-19\">.
