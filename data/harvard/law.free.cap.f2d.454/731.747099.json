He claims his conviction should be reversed on the ground that he was unlawfully entrapped as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-28\">Lo Buono\u2019s appeal briefs presented two theories. First, he argues that the issue of entrapment should have been decided by the judge, not the jury. On oral argument he admitted the federal cases all go against him on this theory. Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>We agree and see no reason to change the law of this circuit. Pulido v. United States, 425 F.2d 1391 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Lo Buono\u2019s second theory is that the evidence required a finding of entrapment as a matter of law. After a defendant introduces evidence of entrapment the burden shifts to the government to prove predisposition. Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958). We hold the facts were such that the jury could have found the appellant to be a voluntary seller rather than an entrapped one. Their verdict shows the jury found the government proved predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
