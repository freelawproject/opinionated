Lyle Woodhall died on January 20, 1964, leaving Mrs. Woodhall as his sole heir and executrix. For 1964, Mrs. Woodhall filed a joint income tax return as surviving spouse. She also filed a fiduciary income tax return for the estate for part of 1964. For 1965, she filed an individual tax return and a fiduciary return.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined deficiencies against Mrs. Woodhall for the years 1964 and 1965. The ground was that she had not declared as income certain amounts which came to her from the sale of her husband\u2019s interest in a partnership. Mrs. Woodhall petitioned the Tax Court for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>declaration that she did not owe the deficiencies. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Mrs. Woodhall appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">From January 1958 until his death, Woodhall was equal partner with his brother, Eldon Woodhall, in a lath and plaster contracting business known as Woodhall Brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In December 1961, the brothers executed a written buy-sell agreement, which provided that \u201cupon the death of either partner the partnership shall terminate and the survivor shall purchase the decedent\u2019s interest in the partnership.\u201d The price was to be determined according to a formula set out in the agreement. The formula defined accounts payable and included certain valuations for fixed assets, inventory, accounts receivable and other assets. It is the accounts receivable item that generates this controversy over Mrs. Wood-hall\u2019s income for 1964 and 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Because the partnershp reported income on a cash basis, Woodhall had not paid taxes on his share of the accounts receivable which were outstanding at the time of his death. Mrs. Woodhall, in filing her tax returns as an individual and as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate, did not report as income the amounts allocated to the accounts receivable. Instead Mrs. Woodhall\u2019s tax returns stated that no gain had been realized by the sale of her husband\u2019s partnership interest because the tax basis of the interest was the fair market value at the time of death and this was the same as the sale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">The issue presented is whether portions of payments received by Mrs. Woodhall, as executrix of the estate and as surviving spouse, constitute income in respect of a decedent under \u00a7 691(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and are therefore subject to income taxes to the extent that such portions are allocable to unrealized receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Generally, the sale of a partnership interest is an occasion for determining the character of gain or loss \u201cto the transferor partner\u201d as provided by \u00a7 741. In the case at bar, however, there was technically no \u201ctransferor partner\u201d to accomplish the sale. The Woodhall Brothers partnership terminated automatically upon the death of Woodhall by operation of the buy-sell agreement, as well as under common law. Mrs. Wood-hall, as executrix of the estate and as holder of a community property interest, was the transferor.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">A tax regulation recognizes that \u00a7 741 applies when the sale of the partnership interest results in a termination of the partnership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question arises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>whether a termination of the partnership by operation of a written agreement of the parties upon the death of one partner has the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 741 explicitly deals with this question. The House report reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cTransfer of an interest in a partnership (\u00a7\u00a7 741-743, 751)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">(1) General rules. \u2014 Under present decisions the sale of a partnership interest is generally considered to be a sale of a capital asset, and any gain or loss realized is treated as capital gain or loss. It is not clear whether the sale of an interest whose value is attributable to uncollected rights to income gives rise to capital gain or ordinary income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">(2) Unrealized receivables or fees . In order to prevent the conversion of potential ordinary income into capital gain by virtue of transfers of partnership interests, certain rules have been adopted . . . which will apply to <em>all </em>dispositions of partnership interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahp-dedup-0\">A decedent partner\u2019s share of unrealized receivables and fees will be treated as income in respect of a decedent. Such rights to income will be taxed to the estate or heirs when collected</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">The term \u2018unrealized receivables or fees\u2019 is used to apply to any rights to income which have not been included in gross income under the method of accounting employed by the partnership. The provision is applicable mainly to cash basis partnerships which have acquired a contractual or other legal right to income for goods or services.\u201d House Report No. 1337, to accompany H.R. 8300 (Pub.L. 591), 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 70-71 (1954) (emphasis added); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 4096.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">The Senate report is similar, with only technical amendments which do not alter the basic statement of purpose in the House report. Senate Report No. 1622, to accompany H.R. 8300 (Pub.L. 591), 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 396 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">Mrs. Woodhall\u2019s approach to the issue was much different. On the sale of her husband\u2019s partnership interest, she attempted to elect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to establish the tax basis as the fair market value on the date of her husband\u2019s death. By this means, the sale price would be the same as the fair market value; there would be no gain and so no income to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">Mrs. Woodhall contends that the payments she received for the accounts receivable do not come within \u00a7 691(a), pertaining to income in respect of a decedent. Section 691(f), she points out, makes cross-reference to \u00a7 753, for application of \u00a7 691 to income in respect of a deceased partner. Section 753, in turn, refers to \u00a7 736 which provides<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that payments by a partnership for a deceased partner\u2019s interest in unrealized receivables shall be considered income in respect of a decedent under \u00a7 691. Mrs. Woodhall argues that a payment by a surviving partner is distinct from a payment by a partnership. Thus, she would have us interpret \u00a7 753, in conjunction with \u00a7 736, exclusively. In effect, this means that no payment other than one by a partnership which continues after one partner\u2019s death could constitute income in respect of a deceased partner. We reject this reading of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The approach suggested by Mrs. Woodhall is not an appropriate characterization of the transfer of funds to her. Reading \u00a7 691 in the light of \u00a7 741, it is clear that Congress intended that the money Mrs. Woodhall received as an allocation from the unrealized accounts receivable be treated as income in respect of a decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has just recently ruled that accounts receivable of a partnership shared in by a successor in interest of a deceased partner constituted income in respect of a decedent. Quick\u2019s Trust v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 444 F.2d 90 (8th Cir. 1971.) The instant case is substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We hold that the Commissioner rightly determined deficiencies against Mrs. Woodhall in the tax years 1964 and 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In addition to this primary issue, Mrs. Woodhall contends that, if the receivables were taxable to her, then she should be allowed an off-setting deduction for her husband\u2019s share of the unpaid payables outstanding at the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">Mrs. Woodhall is not entitled to any deduction in respect of a decedent based on the accounts payable. Section 691(b) (1) permits deductions only \u201cwhen paid.\u201d Eldon Woodhall, as the surviving partner, assumed all the partnership liabilities and, in fact, paid them. Since Mrs. Woodhall did not pay the liabilities, she cannot deduct them.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. T.C. memo, 1969-299.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. (1) General rule.
