Moore was hired on April 18, 1955, and Shaughnes-sey began work on May 2, 1955.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Effective August 13, 1965, the Company abolished Moore\u2019s position. Likewise, as of January 3, 1966, it abolished Shaughnes-sey\u2019s position also. Both men had worked as non-agreement employees, i. e., non-union and without individual employment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-14\">On February 1, 1968, the merger between Penn Central and the New York Central Railroad became effective. Thereafter, on February 26, a letter was posted to each of the Company\u2019s then current non-union employees advising them that pursuant to the merger the Company had agreed to provide its nonagreement employees with the same rights and privileges secured for its union employees by the May 20, 1964 collective bargaining agreement then in effect. By order of the I. C. C. this extension in the coverage of the 1964 agreement had been made prerequisite to Commission approval of the merger. <em>See </em>327 I.C.C. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-15\">It is plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, despite the Company\u2019s election to abolish their positions, they remain non-agreement \u201cemployees\u201d of Penn Central within the meaning of the I. C. C. order. By this action they seek a court order requiring the Company to afford them \u201cthe benefits of the Agreement of May 20, 1964 . . . \u201d or, alternatively, a judgment against Penn Central \u201cin an appropriate monetary sum.\u201d After answering plaintiffs\u2019 complaint the Company moved for a summary judgment, setting forth by means of several affidavits and a memorandum what it considered to be the controlling considerations of the court\u2019s decision. Ultimately, \u201cfor the four reasons set forth . . . \u201d in the Company\u2019s memorandum, the court granted the motion for a summary judgment and ordered dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action. Plaintiffs appeal that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-18\">To obtain a summary judgment the defendant had to demonstrate that \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>gether with . . . affidavits, if any, show[ed] that there [was] no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see </em>Kress, Dunlap &amp; Lane, Ltd. v. Downing, 286 F.2d 212, 214-215 (3d Cir. 1960); Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co. v. Consolidated Fisheries Co., 190 F.2d 817, 824 (3d Cir. 1951). <em>See also </em>Poller v. Columbia Brdcstg. Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 467, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962). This could be alternatively established by evidence indicating either that there was no issue of material fact presented or that although such an issue might exist resolution of that issue favorably to the plaintiff would not control the court\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. </em>Neff v. World Pub. Co., 349 F.2d 235, 239 (8th Cir. 1965). <em>See generally </em>35B C.J.S. Federal Civil Procedure \u00a7 1142(b). By the memorandum accompanying its motion for summary judgment the defendant asserted that: (1) plaintiffs\u2019 claim, to the extent it requested damages, was barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations did not establish them as employees of the Company after their positions were abolished; (3) the I. C. C. order had not applied to plaintiffs even assuming that they were, in fact, \u201cfurloughed\u201d employees; and (4) plaintiffs had not been affected by the merger and, therefore, were not covered by the terms of the merger agreement concerning non-agreement employees. To dispose of this appeal we must consider each of these alternative grounds separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">We do not agree that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, at least in part, is barred by the controlling statute of limitations. The statutory provision cited by defendant is \u00a7 16(3)(f) of Title 49. This section provides that a complaint seeking enforcement of an I. C. C. order for the payment of money must be filed within one year from the effective date of that order. The order which plaintiffs here seek to have enforced, however, is not <em>per se </em>such an order. <em>Compare </em>Missouri Pac. Rr. Co. v. Austin, 292 F.2d 415, 417 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1961). <em>See also </em>Wisconsin Bridge &amp; Iron Co. v. Illinois Terminal Co., 88 F.2d 459, 461-462 (7th Cir. 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">Secondly, the Company contends that summary judgment is appropriate since, assuming the truth of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, their complaint does not allege facts sufficient to establish plaintiffs as \u201cemployees\u201d of defendant at the time the I. C. C. order issued. Specifically, it is urged that a \u201cwritten contract or [a] contract of employment for a definite term\u201d must be alleged to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 action. We do not believe that such an allegation is necessary given the assertion that a custom or practice existed under which the particular employer furloughed employees when a reduction of work force was necessitated. <em>Compare </em>N. L. R. B. v. Atkinson Dredging Co., 329 F.2d 158, 162 (4th Cir. 1964); Marlin-Rockwell Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 116 F.2d 586, 588 (2d Cir. 1941).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">Defendant\u2019s third alternative ground is that the I. C. C. order did not apply to furloughed employees, regardless of whether such a status could be sustained by the plaintiffs. We think this issue should be resolved on a complete record and not on the conflicting affidavits now on file. It is apparent that the order was meant to include defendant\u2019s employees at least \u201cto the extent contemplated by \u00a7 5(2) (f) of the [Interstate Commerce] Act,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2) (f). And as noted by the Supreme Court: \u201c[W]here the term \u2018employee\u2019 has been used in statutes without particularized definition it has not been treated by the courts as a word of definite content.\u201d <em>See </em>United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n., 310 U.S. 534, 545-546 n. 29, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940). Nor are we willing to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>that plaintiffs were not affected by the merger within the meaning of the I. C. C. order. <em>Compare </em>Brogan v. Pennsylvania Rr. Co., 211 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Ill. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">From our review of the pleadings, exhibits and affidavits filed in this case we cannot sustain the district court\u2019s conclusion that as a matter of law there was presented \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d We think the claim, no matter how tenuous in defendant\u2019s view, must be resolved after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The order of the district court granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1286-19\">. Plaintiffs allege that Shauglmessey was \u201chired\u201d on. April 15, 1955, but did not report for work until May 2 because he was on active duty with the Navy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">. The Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[sjeniority arises only out of contract or statute.\u201d Trailmobile Co. v. Whirls, 331 U.S. 40, 53 n. 21, 67 S.Ct. 982, 988, 91 L.Ed. 1328 (1947). However, we do not construe this as being restricted to <em>ivritten </em>contracts only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
