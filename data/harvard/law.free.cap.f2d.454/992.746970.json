Alternatively, counsel sought a presen-tence study to develop additional information as to whether appellant could profit from a youth commitment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sentencing judge denied both requests, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-22\">[T]he victim of the robbery in the instant offense was killed under circumstances surrounding the offense which were therefore of a very serious nature. Defendant Ward has apparently been on drugs for some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-23\">His choice of companions and activities has been such that he can be characterized as having street corner sophistication. In the Court\u2019s opinion the defendant Ward requires a program of discipline, guidance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>control firmer and more strict than provided by the Youth Correction, or Youth Act commitment. The Court will therefore sentence him under the applicable penalty provision rather than under the Youth Corrections Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The judge then imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a term of four to twelve years. He added that he would recommend that appellant \u201cbe sent to an institution where they usually send youth offenders such as Petersburg, Virginia, or some institution of that type.\u201d The judgment of conviction included such a recommendation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but appellant remains in confinement in an adult penal facility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sentence has been appealed, and appellant moves for summary reversal and a remand for re-sentencing. We remand the record to the District Court for much-needed elucidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">The Youth Corrections Act provides that \u201c[i]f the court shall find that the youth offender <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will not derive benefit from treatment under [the Act], then the court may sentence the youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we emphasized in United States v. Waters,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> however, \u201cthe court must affirmatively find that the youth offender will <em>not </em>benefit from rehabilitative treatment before the offender can be sentenced as an adult pursuant to the statute governing the offense for which he was convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We pointed out that \u201cthe trial judge [is not precluded] from exercising his sound discretion to deny such rehabilitative treatment to those youths in the exceptional case where the judge determines that the special youth treatment afforded by the Act would be of no value.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But, as we hastened to explain, \u201cthis discretion is circumscribed by the findings of fact in the individual case which the District Judge is required to make either explicitly or implicitly,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the judge may resort to an adult sentence <em>\u201conly if </em>the applicable facts in the individual case meet the statutory requirements.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">It follows, in the case at bar, that \u201c[o]nly if the court found that the appellant youth offender would <em>not </em>derive benefit from 'rehabilitative treatment under the Youth Corrections \u2022 Act did the District Court have discretion to sentence appellant under the regular adult statutory provision.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And as <em>Waters </em>makes plain, the balance Congress has struck for cases not meeting that requirement is not to be disturbed through the expedient of a judicial weighing of the supposed values of youth commitments and adult sentences.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>We are unable, however, to ascertain from the present record just what conclusion the judge reached as to appellant\u2019s susceptibility to benefit from a commitment and treatment under the Act. There was, of course, no express finding in that regard, and implications either way can readily be drawn from what the judge said. The judge\u2019s view that appellant needs a program sterner than such a commitment would afford does not negate the possibility that appellant nonetheless might be helped significantly by just such a commitment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That is the more so when considered in light of the judge\u2019s subsequent recommendation that appellant be sent to a youth-type institution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On the other hand, whatever service the recommendation might otherwise have done as an implied finding of benefit derivable from treatment under the Act is beclouded by the judge\u2019s earlier declaration that appellant\u2019s situation demands something different from what the Act offers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We cannot identify with satisfactory assurance the finding which the judge\u2019s discussion was intended to embrace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">With this degree of ambiguity, we ask the sentencing judge, as we must, to illuminate his reasoning. Only if we are more explicitly informed as to what the judge had in mind can we discharge our responsibilities on an intelligent basis. We accordingly remand the record to the District Court for prompt clarification, and reserve our ruling on the pending motion in the meantime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">.
