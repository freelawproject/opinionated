We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-24\">Appellant is currently serving a five year sentence for larceny of an automobile, having been convicted upon trial by jury. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in Burroughs v. State, Fla.App.1969, 221 So.2d 159. A motion to vacate sentence pursuant to Rule 1.850, Fla.R.Crim.P., 33 F.S.A., was denied. Burroughs v. State, Fla.App.1970, 235 So.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-25\">In his habeas petition filed below appellant enumerates some 36 grounds for relief. A review of the records of proceedings in the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>courts reveals that state remedies have not been exhausted as to all issues raised. Those allegations concerning double jeopardy, police brutality, mental coercion, and non-sequestration of witnesses have not been presented any state court. To avoid piecemeal litigation this Court has consistently required that state remedies be exhausted as to all issues raised in a federal habeas corpus petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Meacham v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 187; Garrett v. State of Texas, 5th Cir. 1970, 435 F.2d 709; Harrison v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 633; Wheeler v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Since the record before this Court shows that the appellant has failed to avail himself of post-conviction remedies open to him under Florida law, i. e. filing a Rule 1.850 motion in his sentencing court, we believe that the ruling of the district court is correct. See Johnson v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1971, 448 F.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">The judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
