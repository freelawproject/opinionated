But, as we noted in Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed.2d 25 (1961), the question \u201cdoes not become easier of solution with the years.\u201d This case is no exception. Plaintiff King Research, Inc. sells a comb and brush cleaner under its trademark SHIP-SHAPE, and relying on the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq., claims that defendant Shulton, Inc. has infringed by using SHIP SHAPE as a mark on a hair spray for men. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Richard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>H. Levet, J., found no infringement, in an opinion reported at 324 F.Supp. 631 (19711.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Although the ease is a close one, we agree with Judge Levet.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Plaintiff manufactures a comb and brush cleaner, which it has sold under its mark SHIP-SHAPE since about 1949.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The product is apparently distributed primarily in large packages to beauty parlors and barber shops for their own use or for resale to customers, although the item is also marketed in smaller packages to drug wholesalers for drug stores and to rack jobbers for supermarkets and variety stores. For the years 1968 and 1969, plaintiff\u2019s sales of SHIP-SHAPE comb and brush cleaner were $140,000 and $150,000, respectively. Plaintiff does sell some toiletry products, but all have been marketed under marks other than SHIP-SHAPE: STAX for a hair dressing and conditioner; DANDRICIDE for an anti-dandruff rinse; DY-ZOFF for a hair color stain remover; and LOVE &amp; KISSES for a hand cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Defendant Shulton, Inc. manufactures and distributes well-known lines of men\u2019s toilet articles. For over 30 years, it has used the trademark OLD SPICE and other marks, consisting of sailing ships under various names, on several cosmetics and grooming aids for men. It first marketed SHIP SHAPE hair spray for men on a national basis in 1967. For the years 1968 and 1969, defendant\u2019s gross sales of the product were $338,000 and $362,000, respectively. Prior to using the mark SHIP SHAPE, defendant conducted a search that turned up two of plaintiff\u2019s registrations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But, as the district court found, 324 F. Supp. at 634, \u201cdefendant considered the goods in plaintiff\u2019s two registrations to be entirely different from defendant\u2019s proposed hair spray for men.\u201d Not unexpectedly, plaintiff disagreed and in June 1967 commenced this action. A month later, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. Judge Harold R. Tyler, Jr., denied the motion, holding that \u201cthere is no substantial likelihood of public confusion between the soap or detergent marketed by plaintiff for cleaning brushes and combs\u201d and defendant\u2019s hair spray.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a non-jury trial on the merits over three years later, Judge Levet reached basically the same conclusion. 324 F.Supp. at 636-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">Prior to 1961, this area of the law had been in a state of considerable flux, at least in this circuit, and our decisions were something less than wonderfully consistent both in their approach and in the results reached.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *Finally, in <em>Pola</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>roid Corp., supra, </em>287 F.2d at 495, Judge Friendly made an extensive listing of criteria useful in assessing a prior owner\u2019s claim that a non-competitor\u2019s use of a mark constitutes an infringement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag6\">[T]he prior owner\u2019s chance of success is a function of many variables: the strength of his mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks, the proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap, actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant\u2019s good faith in adopting its own mark, the quality of defendant\u2019s product, and the sophistication of the buyers. Even this extensive catalogue does not exhaust the possibilities \u2014 the court may have to take still other variables into account. American Law Institute, Restatement of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 729, 730, 731.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The decision in <em>Polaroid </em>went off on plaintiff\u2019s laches but the quoted list of relevant considerations was specifically approved in Triumph Hosiery Mills, Inc. v. Triumph International Corp., 308 F. 2d 196, 198 (2d Cir. 1962) (\u201cTriumph\u201d women\u2019s stockings not protected against \u201cDistinction by Triumph of Europe\u201d women\u2019s foundation garments). In Chandon Champagne. Corp. v. San Mari-no Wine Corp., 335 F.2d 531, 536 (2d Cir. 1964) (\u201cDom P\u00e9rignon\u201d imported champagne not protected against \u201cPierre Perignon\u201d domestic champagne), we considered additional factors including \u201cthe serious harm an injunction would cause the defendant as against the trifling benefit to the plaintiffs.\u201d We used the same \u201cmethod of approach\u201d in Kiki Undies Corp. v. Promenade Hosiery Mills, Inc., 411 F.2d 1097 (2d Cir. 1969), cert, dismissed, 396 U.S. 1054, 90 S.Ct. 707, 24 L.Ed.2d 698 (1970) (\u201cKiki\u201d women\u2019s undergarments protected against \u201cKiki\u201d tights, swimwear and sportswear).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Applying these rough criteria here, we find that plaintiff is not entitled to relief. The strength of the mark SHIPSHAPE is only moderate. Although there is a high degree of similarity between the two marks standing alone, the packaging techniques used in the two products are sharply different. Plaintiff\u2019s product, like a detergent, is sold in a large box; defendant\u2019s hair spray, like shaving cream, is packaged in a cylindrical aerosol can. See 324 F. Supp. at 637. As to \u201cproximity,\u201d plaintiff would get a middling to high rating if its product were designed and marketed solely as a comb and brush cleaner. But the product is more than that. On the four-ounce carton, plaintiff emphasizes that SHIP-SHAPE \u201cCleans paint brushes, too!\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On its two-pound box, plaintiff asserts that SHIP-SHAPE \u201cSafely cleans \u2018like new\u2019 Brushes-Combs, Paint Brushes, Plastic Aprons &amp; Capes, Chrome Furniture, Plastic Upholstery [and] Venetian Blinds.\u201d Plaintiff rates low on the likelihood that it will some day bridge the gap and sell hair spray for men under the mark SHIP-SHAPE, in view of the fact that its own sales of toiletry articles to date have been under other names. Cf. <em>Kiki Undies, supra, </em>411 F.2d at 1100. Similarly, plaintiff made no real showing of actual confusion, see 324 F.Supp. at 638, although in light of the relative unsophistication of the buyers (particularly the retail customers), the possibility of confusion would remain if the products were sold in similar packages. The question of defendant\u2019s bad faith in adopting the contested mark is close. To be sure, defendant went ahead with its plans to market men\u2019s hair spray under the mark, knowing it to be identical to one used by plaintiff. But the reference to \u201ccomb and brush cleaner\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s registration, sandwiched in between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201cdishwashing compound\u201d and \u201cegg cleaner,\u201d hardly conjures up images of personal grooming. Moreover, in view of defendant\u2019s extensive use of various ship trademarks in the past, its choice of SHIP SHAPE was not illogical, cf. <em>Chandon Cham/pagne Corp., supra, </em>335 F.2d at 536, nor is there persuasive evidence that defendant, well-known in its own field, attempted to \u201cpass-off\u201d its product as plaintiff\u2019s, see <em>Triumph Hosiery Mills, Inc., supra, </em>308 F.2d at 199. Accordingly, plaintiff gets only a fair rating in this category. In addition, there is no indication that the quality of defendant\u2019s product is such that it may hurt the reputation of plaintiff\u2019s mark. Finally, on the record presented, plaintiff rates low on the question of the benefits it would obtain from the granting of injunctive relief as against the possible harm such relief would cause defendant, which has invested substantially in promoting the mark on its hair spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Admittedly, these conclusions are imprecise, as all such rough judgments must be. Having made them, we must confess that we are not overwhelmed by the sudden blinding light of the justness of one party\u2019s cause. But putting these impressions all together, we are unable to say that the experienced trial judge was wrong in refusing plaintiff relief. We do wish to make clear, however, that our ruling is based upon the present dress and marketing techniques of defendant\u2019s hair spray. If defendant\u2019s product were to be marketed in packages creating a greater danger of confusion, plaintiff might be able to succeed in another action. See <em>Chandon Champagne Corp., supra, </em>335 F.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Plaintiff also argues that the district court committed reversible error in sustaining an objection to a question put to one of defendant\u2019s officers in cross-examination. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">. Plaintiff also unsuccessfully claimed dilution of its mark, see N.Y. General Business Law \u00a7 368-d (McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 20, 1968), and unfair competition. These claims are not pressed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. Plaintiff has three registrations of the mark. The earliest, No. 433,967 (in a \u201cfanciful rope design\u201d), is not involved in this litigation. The remaining two, Nos. 607,415 and 723,978, differ with respect to the presence of a hyphen between the two words SHIP SHAPE. Defendant does not use a hyphen at all. But the parties have stipulated that neither will contend \u201cthat the appearance or nonappearance\u201d of the hyphen will have any effect on their rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\">. The relevant registration found, No. 607,415 states that it covers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">Hand dishwashing compound, machine dishwashing compound, comb and brush cleaner, egg cleaner used in hand cleaning of eggs and also used for machine cleaning of eggs, and hatchery tray machine cleaning compound, in class 52.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">The registration not uncovered by defendant, No. 723,978, is substantially similar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b129-18\">.
