The Contractor has filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-20\">This diversity suit involved a two-week trial to the Court without jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-21\"><em>The Contract </em>\u2014 Contentions\u2014Court <em>Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-22\">The original construction contract price was $7,600,000.00. Pertinent provisions, for purposes of this opinion, became operative on June 8, 1966, when work commenced. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-23\">\u201cWithin fifteen months after acceptance (June 8, 1966) of said notice to proceed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-24\">\u201c(a) commercial and office space is to be substantially completed as a shell area and be ready for customization by others in accordance with plans and specifications,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-25\">\u201c(b) garage floor areas shall be substantially completed with 20% of said garage area being reserved for Contractor storage and usage,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-26\">\u201c(c) approximately 175 apartment suites on a contiguous block of lower floors shall be substantially completed and ready for final decoration by others,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>\u201cSubstantial completion of the entire Work shall be accomplished in eighteen (18) months after acceptance of said notice to proceed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">Substantial completion was defined as meaning \u201cwhen the Work is ready for occupancy for its intended purposes, except for customization for tenants and \u2018punch list\u2019 items to be completed by Contractor.\u201d By its terms, unless relieved by excusable delays, substantial completion should have been accomplished by December 8, 1967. The Contract provided further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-5\">\u201cIf the Contractor is delayed at any time in the progress of the Work by any act or neglect of the Owner, the Architect, or any employee, agent or contractor of either, or by deletions, alterations, or additions ordered in the Work, or by labor disputes, fire, accidents, severe weather conditions, unusual delay in transportation or any other causes beyond the Contractor\u2019s control, then the times herein fixed for the completion of the Work shall be extended for a period equivalent to the time lost by reason of any one of the causes aforesaid. <em>The Contractor shall promptly notify the Owner in writing of the facts relating to any of the above described causes of delay and Contractor\u2019s estimate of the revised dates of completion of the Work.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">The Owner contends that it is entitled to damages by reason of failure of the Contractor to meet either the partial completion or substantial completion dates in the contract schedule. It contends that the building was not completed until November of 1968. The Owner seeks damages for lost rentals, additional interest payments charged, defective work, temporary housing of tenants and other losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">The Contractor counterclaimed, alleging that by reason of excusable delays the building was substantially completed on June 1, 1968. The Contractor sought a total judgment of $1,029,947.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">The trial court found that: (1) the Owner, at pretrial, asserted that the Contractor was required to complete the building in December, 1967, and that it was not completed until November, 1968; (2) the parties agreed upon a procedure with respect to changes in the work (deletions, alterations, or additions) which involved, in each instance, a \u201cQuotation\u201d from the Contractor setting forth the number of additional calendar days to be extended beyond the original Contract period for completion of the work, directed to the Owner\u2019s Architect, who approved extensions of time total-ling 185 calendar days; (3) in addition to the extensions of time approved by the Owner\u2019s Architect, the Contractor was entitled to 30 calendar days by reason of labor disputes and severe weather conditions; and (4) that substantial completion of the work occurred on June 8, 1968, except for noncustomized apartment units on floors 40 and 41 which were not completed until October 11, 1968, but that the Owner did not 'offer evidence of any loss of rental damage thereby. The Court had previously ruled that the Owner was entitled to a set-off of $28,170.00 representing the measure of damages for failure of the Contractor to comply with Bulletin 15 relating to work to be performed on concrete balconies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">\n<em>Partial and Substantial Completion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">The Owner complains that the trial court erred in failing to make any findings relating to \u201cpartial completion\u201d, i. e., the occupancy aimed for within the 15 month period. The parties understood that both the \u201cpartial\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d completion schedules were extremely tight and that the construction schedule required clockwork precision in order to accomplish these objectives. These schedules were strictly tied to the original plans and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">Max Ratner, the Owner\u2019s Architect, acknowledged that major changes were made from the original plans and specifications, with particular reference to the third floor and the upper floors. These changes affected both structural and mechanical engineering changes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Ratner acknowledged that many of the changes affected the sequence of the work, thus creating delays. The Contractor had undertaken a \u201ccritical path scheduling\u201d study before submitting its bid on this project. This involves breaking a construction job down into its smallest working components and scheduling the work in proper sequences. The importance of meeting a \u201ccritical path schedule\u201d is evident. Chat Paterson, Vice-President of the Owner, testified that the Owner, too, relied upon its own critical path schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">There is substantial evidence in this voluminous record that: (a) \u201cpartial completion\u201d was accomplished through the 20th floor by December 11, 1967, some three months behind the contract schedule; (b) the major change relating to the third floor had occurred during this time; and (c) the Contractor had requested some 78 days extension of time, relating entirely <em>to </em>changes in the scope of the work which, together with delays during the first 15 months resulting from strikes and weather conditions, are justified in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">The trial court properly treated and considered damages only in relation to the \u201csubstantial completion\u201d covenants of the Contract. The Court found that substantial completion was not required of the Contractor until July 1, 1968. We hold that this finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">\n<em>Extensions of Time</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">The overriding dispute in this case involves the extensions of time which the Contractor was entitled to. The trial court found that the Owner\u2019s Architect, Ratner, had approved extensions of 185 days, exclusive of 30 days delay resulting from labor disputes and severe weather conditions \u2014 or a total of some 215 days extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">The Owner contends that the Contractor was not entitled to any extensions of time beyond some 30 days resulting from labor disputes and severe weather conditions. In justification, the Owner argues that: (a) the extensions requested were for customization work, the accomplishment of which was not germane to substantial completion; (b) this customization work, for the most part, was not performed until after the date on which the Court found that substantial completion had occurred; and (c) the extensions of time were understood by the parties to be concurrent and not tacked onto one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">We first observe that all references in the Contract referred to as \u201ccustomization\u201d work were those in the <em>original </em>plans and specifications, not customization work resulting from changes effected after the Contract was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">There is a most damaging vacuum in this record reflecting upon the Owner. The Owner contends that its Architect, Max Ratner, had no authority to grant extensions of time. Pointing to the Contract language designating the Architect as the Owner\u2019s agent to \u201creview and act\u201d in an advisory capacity for the Owner relating to construction changes, the Owner disavows the Architect\u2019s authority to grant extensions of time. Thus, the Owner argues that the Contractor did not notify the Owner of claims for additional time except for some 30 days delay resulting from strikes and severe weather conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-13\">\n<em>Extension of Time Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-14\">The parties effected a specific procedure for Change Orders from the original plans and specifications. The Owner\u2019s Architect issued a \u201cBulletin\u201d detailing a change directed to the Contractor requesting a \u201cQuotation\u201d from the Contractor. This was, in legal effect, a call for a bid. The Contractor would then issue a \u201cQuotation\u201d setting forth a change in Contract price, if any, together with a specific request for additional days to complete the Contract as a result of the changes. The record reflects that the Contractor requested extensions of some 300 days involving about 80 formal \u201cQuotations\u201d and some 30 Field Order Changes. The \u201cQuotations\u201d were, in legal effect, offers on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>the part of the Contractor to undertake the requested changes, subject to specific price changes, if any, and additional days to complete the work. These \u201cQuotations\u201d were submitted direcly to Ratner, the Architect, and reviewed by Chat Paterson, Vice-President of the Owner, and one Kromer, an on-the-job architect employed by Ratner. Kromer testified that he and Ratner jointly agreed on each Quotation. He and Ratner both testified that they were in a position only to recommend extensions to the Owner, but that the ultimate determination was between the Owner and the Contractor. But Ratner also said that the decisions on the Quotations would be made by the Owner and \u201cratified\u201d by him. Herbert Wasserman, an officer of the Owner, testified that he was in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with Ratner and Paterson concerning contract price changes and that he did review some Quotations. The Quotation forms were prepared by the Contractor. Each contained a portion for approval or disapproval for execution by the Owner, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">APPROVAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">The undersigned hereby approves the above proposal for Item(s)_ above for a total net increase/decrease/no change in the contract price of - Dollars ($--). Item(s) (of calendar days) above are not approved. You are requested to prepare an amendment of the Agreement dated May 5, 1966 in accordance with the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"alt-dedup-0\">MAX RATNER, ARCHITECT</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4o\">By -</p>\n<p id=\"ALu\">Dated _</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">In every instance Ratner completed that portion of the Approval dealing with the change in contract price. In a few instances Ratner expressly allowed or disallowed extensions of time. In the great majority of the Quotations Ratner did not make any entries relating to extensions. He testified that by not acting, he indicated his disapproval, or, perhaps more accurately, that the extensions were matters to be determined by the Owner and the Contractor. The Contractor relied upon the lack of express disapproval as a grant of the requests for extensions. After Ratner returned the \u201cQuotation\u201d forms to the Contractor, an amendment or \u201cChange Order\u201d reflecting .the deletions, alterations or additions was prepared by the Contractor and thereafter executed by the Contractor. Paterson then executed on behalf of the Owner. The two interim Denver lending banks also executed them. The \u201cChange Orders\u201d did not refer to extensions of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-16\">The trial court found that Ratner was authorized by the Owner to act as its architect and agent in supervising the work, in issuing the Bulletins for changes, and in approving or disapproving the Quotations including the extensions of time. The trial court found that the extensions of time approved by Ratner totalled 185 calendar days. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-17\">Lacking express disapproval as contemplated on the face of the form, the Contractor relied upon Ratner\u2019s inaction as approval. Here the silence can be attributed to both Ratner and Paterson, the Owner\u2019s representatives on the job. When the relations between the parties justify the offeror\u2019s expectation of a reply or where a duty exists to communicate either an acceptance or rejection, silence will be regarded as an acceptance. Laredo Nat. Bank v. Gordon, 61 F.2d 906 (5th Cir. 1932); Suitter v. Thompson, 225 Or. 614, 358 P.2d 267 (1960); Tanenbaum Textile Co. v. Schlanger, 287 N.Y. 400, 40 N.E.2d 225 (1942); and Lechler v. Montana Life Ins. Co. of Helena, Mont., 48 N.D. 644, 186 N.W. 271 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-18\">We do not find any inconsistency on the part of the Contractor in directing requests for extensions of time resulting from labor disputes and severe weather conditions to the Owner\u2019s Denver office rather than to the Architect. These requests did not relate to deletions, alterations or additions in the building plans and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>The procedure established by the parties constituted confirmation by the Owner of the authority exercised by Ratner and Paterson. Rogers v. Beiderwell, 175 Kan. 223, 262 P.2d 814 (1953); Davis v. Bush <em>&amp; </em>Lane Piano Co., 124 Or. 585, 265 P. 417 (1928); Sando v. Kalberg, 138 Wash. 247, 244 P. 576 (1926); Blackwell v. Kercheval, 27 Idaho 537, 149 P. 1060 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">\n<em>Customization</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">The Owner insists that of the 185 days of extensions allowed by the Court based upon Change Orders, all but 43 days dealt with \u201ccustomization\u201d work only. Applying Article 2 of the Contract, the Owner thus argues that substantial completion of the work should have been accomplished on or about February 24, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">It is true that a great deal of the work changes related to \u201ccustomization\u201d. It is also true that many of the Change Orders bore dates as late as June of 1968. There is substantial evidence, however, that most of the work reflected by these Change Orders had been completed pri- or to date of their execution. Kromer, who was employed by Ratner, issued Construction Progress Estimates. He testified that the building was 97.3 percent completed on May 31, 1968, and 98.3 percent completed on June 30, 1968. There is a great deal of evidence of delay in execution of the Change Orders by the Owner and the interim lending institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">The Owner\u2019s argument that the Contractor was not entitled to extensions of time resulting from \u201ccustomization\u201d Change Orders is without merit. The contract reference to \u201ccustomization\u201d related only to that type of work reflected in the original plans and specifications. The parties were aware that changes could affect the program work schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">The testimony of Richard N. Green, a Construction Consultant, is corroborative of Ratner\u2019s grant of some 185 days extensions and significant in relation to the \u201cclockwork\u201d scheduling of work components required to accomplish the original contract completion schedules. Green\u2019s study took into consideration the plans and specifications, the computerized Critical Path Scheduling program, all Bulletins, formal Change Orders, Field Change Orders, related correspondence, Daily Progress Reports and Monthly Pay Requests. He computed some 394 days involving requests for extensions. He eliminated those of an \u201coverlapping\u201d nature and those which were not critical. He did not consider delays resulting from labor disputes or severe weather conditions. He arrived at a total of 180 days extension of time to which the Contractor was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">There were unexplained delays on the part of the Owner relating to approval of Change Orders, selections of customization items such as ceramic tile, fixtures and accessories, color selections, etc. These delays did in fact change the scope of the work. Indecision on the part of the Owner with respect to tenant paint color selections was such, as early as July or August of 1967, that painters were moving from one floor to another in the building, completely out of program sequence. Some important work had to be re-done because the original plans and specifications did not comply with city codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">\n<em>The Cross Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">The Contractor appeals from the trial court\u2019s allowance of a $28,170.00 set-off against the Contractor for non-compliance with the standard required under Bulletin #15 relating to balcony finishes on apartments above the 17th floor. There is substantial evidence to support the Court\u2019s finding in this regard. The Contractor contends that there was no admissible evidence of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">At the time of trial the defects in the concrete finish had not been rectified. The Owner sought bids covering the claimed defects, a schedule of which was submitted to the Contractor. The record reflects that the lowest bid received was predicated upon an inspection and submittal by a Mr. R. W. Graves, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>who was not available to testify at trial. However, a Mr. McHenry of the same firm did testify. He updated the Graves bid by 7%. He testified at some length concerning the bids. The Contractor did not offer any evidence regarding the costs of repairs. We hold that although the bids admitted in evidence were hearsay, they were admissible under the Business Records Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732(a). Hearsay may have affected the weight of these documents, but not their admissibility. The Court\u2019s set-off was predicated upon the lowest bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment against the Owner. We deny the Contractor\u2019s cross-appeal from the trial coui't\u2019s allowance of a set-off of $28,170.-00 to the Owner representing repairs to the concrete balconies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs in this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
