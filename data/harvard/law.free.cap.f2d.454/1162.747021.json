The defendant, Mayor of Memphis, upon learning that there was a vacant office in the Memphis City Hall made it available to a group described as \u201cMemphians for Patriotism,\u201d and announced that the office would be available to other patriotic groups. The plaintiff, Selective Service Counseling and Information Association, sought the use of the office which was denied by the Mayor because he did not consider the plaintiff organization \u201cworthwhile and in the community interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs instituted this action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The plaintiffs claim that the Selective Service Counseling and Information Association should be granted equal rights to the use of the office in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">After hearing the District Court concluded that under Tennessee law the Mayor was not permitted to allow a non-governmental organization to occupy space in a municipal building absent statutory or charter authority giving it the right to do so. This issue was not presented by any of the pleadings in the case. The Trial Court\u2019s decision was based entirely upon Tennessee Law, although there is some passing reference to the plaintiffs\u2019 Civil Rights in the order for injunction. We neither accept or reject the District Judge\u2019s conclusion that occupancy of an office in the Memphis City Hall by Memphians for Patriotism was a violation of the laws of the. State of Tennessee. It does appear that this case presents an issue which may be controlled by the laws of the State of Tennessee. Under those circumstances the District Judge should have dismissed the action and permitted the parties to resort to the state courts for any relief because: \u201cA state court decision here, however, could conceivably avoid any decision under the Fourteenth Amendment and would avoid any possible irritant in the federal-state relationship.\u201d Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 86, 87, 90 S.Ct. 788, 790, 25 L.Ed.2d 68 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
