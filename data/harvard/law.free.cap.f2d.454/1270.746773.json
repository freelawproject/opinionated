The amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>complaint pleaded both negligent design and strict liability. The accident occurred in the State of Iowa and both parties agree that Iowa law controls. Plaintiff asserts that she was a passenger on a Honda motorcycle being operated on a public highway which collided with a 1964 Buick Skylark automobile. She claims her left leg came into contact with a wheel cover on the rear wheel of the car. She asserts that the wheel cover consisted of unshielded metal flanges or flippers which protruded outward from the base of the cover. These spun when the wheel rotated rapidly. When her leg contacted these metal protrusions as a result of the accident, the suit alleges she received a severe mangling type laceration to her lower calf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">The district court directed a verdict at the close of <em>all </em>of the evidence. The court ruled: (1) that the State of Iowa has not adopted the rule of strict liability, (2) that the defendant was not accountable to the injured party for negligent design since there was no foreseeable duty of care extending to her, and (3) that the collision between the motorcycle and the auto constituted an intervening cause thereby insulating the conduct of the manufacturer. We reverse and remand the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">The collision took place on May 23, 1967, on the open highway near Webster City, Iowa. The driver of the Buick was proceeding in the same direction behind the motorcycle on which plaintiff was a passenger. The evidence shows as the automobile passed the motorcycle the car\u2019s right rear side came into contact with the handlebar of the cycle. It is plaintiff\u2019s claim that this collision caused her left leg to be thrown into the opening of the rear wheel well containing the protruding spinning blades of the hubcap. She received a severe lacerating injury to the outside of the lower leg just above the ankle. Her doctor described the injury as a \u201cMangling type injury with multiple lacerations of the foot.\u201d The bone was so severely severed that only some soft tissue held her leg together. Her father came to the scene of the collision and discovered the Buick\u2019s right rear hubcap with human flesh and blood on it. The highway patrolman verified the blood on the hubcap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">The wheel cover was designed with the two ornamental blades protruding some three inches from the base of the cover itself. The flippers serve only the purpose of aesthetic design. These spinners or flippers were recessed two and one-eighth inches within the outer perimeter of the car\u2019s body shell. Within the five square feet of the car\u2019s rear wheel well there was no covering or protection from the blades. When the vehicle moved at a speed of 40 m. p. h. the blades revolved at 568 r. p. m. or nine and one-half revolutions per second. Plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, who held a Ph.D. in agricultural engineering and theoretical applied mechanics, testified that the protruding blades moving at high speeds in an unshielded area constituted an unsafe design to persons who might come within their vicinity. Defendant\u2019s design experts testified to the contrary observing that the area was recessed within the body shell of the vehicle and therefore not considered dangerous. Defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to show that plaintiff\u2019s leg was actually cut by the hubcap in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">Before passing directly on the issues raised here, we feel constrained to restate certain principles relating to motions for directed verdicts. Judge San-born observed in Barnett v. Terminal R. Ass\u2019n of St. Louis, 200 F.2d 893 (8 Cir. 1953), cert, denied, 345 U.S. 956, 73 S.Ct. 938, 97 L.Ed. 1377:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-9\">\u201cIt is safe to say that in a case such as the one before us, it is unwise for a trial judge to direct a verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. We think that, even though the trial court is of the opinion that the evidence will not support a verdict for the plaintiff, the court should ordinarily reserve its ruling on a motion for a peremptory instruction until after verdict. That course will usually hasten the ultimate termination of the litigation and best serve the interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>both parties. The jury\u2019s view of the sufficiency of the evidence may coincide with that of the court. If it does not, the court, despite the verdict, can enter judgment for the defendant. An appeal from such a judgment, entered after verdict, will usually terminate the controversy one way or the other, and avoid a retrial with its resulting delay, trouble and expense and the possibility of a second appeal. Compare, Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., 340 U.S. 573-574, 71 S.Ct. 428, 95 L.Ed. 547.\u201d 200 F.2d at 896.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">We suggest adherence to this procedure is the better approach absent exceptional circumstances not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">Turning to the merits of this case, we shall meet the issue of proximate cause first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">The evidence as to whether the protruding flippers were the cause for the severe injury rests on circumstantial proof. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s doctors is based solely on their assumption of the truth as to the mechanism to be proved, i. e., that the leg came in contact with the protruding blades. The doctors\u2019 testimony does establish that the alleged defect, the protruding flippers, <em>could </em>cause the severe injury sustained. Without additional proof we would agree with defendant that causality was not proven to a reasonable degree of certainty sufficient to allow the jury to pass on the question. On the other hand, defendant\u2019s proof that the footrest on the motorbike was a few inches higher than the location of the blades is not conclusive. The evidence showed that the first contact between the automobile and the motorbike was with the side of the car and the cycle\u2019s handlebar. There was expert opinion the jury could believe that on impact the rear of the motorcycle would have a tendency to swing into the automobile. As brought out on cross-examination plaintiff\u2019s foot could be dislodged on impact from the bike\u2019s footrest which the jury could find would put it in contact with the protruding blades. Circumstances of the initial impact, the movement of the vehicles thereafter, the evidence as to the detachment of the hubcap from the automobile, proof of blood and flesh on the hubcap, and the kind of laceration the young lady received are all important in determining' the question of the sufficiency of the evidence. A commonplace proposition of Iowa law, as so noted in the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure, is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">\u201cAn issue may be proven by circumstantial evidence; but this evidence must be such as to make the theory of causation reasonably probable, not merely possible, and more probable than any other theory based on such evidence. Generally, however, it will be for the jury or other trier of the facts to say whether circumstantial evidence meets this test.\u201d Rules of Civil Procedure, 58 Iowa Code Ann., Rule 344(f)16 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-11\">Applying this rule to the present facts, we find that reasonable blinds could differ as to whether plaintiff sufficiently substantiated the causal nexus of the alleged defect with the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">The trial court held that the collision between the motorcycle and the automobile was an intervening cause as a matter of law, thereby insulating General Motors\u2019 liability for the alleged defective design. We disagree. See Ford Motor Co. v. Zahn, 265 F.2d 729 (8 Cir. 1959). This ruling overlooks this court\u2019s position as to the issue of proximate cause where there exists a \u201csecond accident.\u201d In Larsen v. General Motors Corp., 391 F.2d 495 (8 Cir. 1968), this court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-13\">\u201cWe, therefore, do not think the automobile industry is being singled out for any special adverse treatment by applying to it general negligence principles in . . . (2) holding that the intended use of an automotive product contemplates its travel on crowded and high speed roads and highways that inevitably subject it to the foreseeable hazards of collisions and impacts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-15\">The Iowa Supreme Court has viewed the issue of intervening cause and proximate cause as generally one of fact for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>triers of fact. In Walton v. Eckhart, 354 F.2d 35 (8 Cir. 1965), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-4\">\u201cIn Iowa the jury determines both the existence of an intervening efficient cause and whether it has insulated the negligence of the defendant and replaced it as the proximate and actionable cause of the injury. See Johnson v. Baker, 254 Iowa 1077, 120 N.W. 2d 502, 506 (1963) and cases there cited; Blessing v. Welding, 226 Iowa 1178, 286 N.W. 436 (1939); McClure v. Richard, 225 Iowa 949, 282 N.W. 312 (1938).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-5\">\u201cThis proposition was aptly expressed by Judge Graven in Chicago &amp; North Western Ry. Co. v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. R. Co., 179 F.Supp. 33, 55 (N.D. Ia.1959):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-6\">\u201c \u2018The whole trend of the recent decisions of the Iowa Supreme Court is to the effect that, save in exceptional . eases, the question of causal connection between the negligence of a person and the injury of which it is claimed to be a proximate cause is one to be determined by the jury and not one to be dealt with as a question of law by the Court. That Court has in its recent decisions tended to emphasize that questions as to proximate cause, independent intervening negligence, and concurrent negligence are peculiarly questions for the trier of facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37-38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">We come then to the questions of negligence and strict liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-8\">The court in granting defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict found that the wheel cover had been \u201cengineered to that degree of safety which rendered unforeseeable an injury to a person riding on the rear of a motorcycle.\u201d Passwaters v. General Motors Corp., Civil No. 20072 (N.D.Iowa Oct. 28, 1969). The law is well established that the manufacturer of a vehicle has a duty to use reasonable care in the design of the vehicle. Larsen v. General Motors Corp., supra, (negligent design of Corvair steering assembly); Carpini v. Pittsburg &amp; Weirton Bus Co., 216 F.2d 404 (3 Cir. 1954) (defectively designed brake valve on bus); Grundmanis v. British Motor Corp., 308 F.Supp. 303 (E.D.Wisc.1970) (negligently designed fuel tank on sports car); Dyson v. General Motors Corp., 298 F. Supp. 1064 (D.C.Pa.1969) (defective design of two-door hardtop roof); Brandon v. Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co., 220 F.Supp. 855 (E.D.Pa.1963), aff\u2019d 342 F.2d 519 (3 Cir. 1965) (no protective top on fork lift). The Iowa Supreme Court has recognized a manufacturer\u2019s liability for negligent design. Bengford v. Carlem Corp., 156 N.W.2d 855 (Iowa 1966); Wagner v. Larson, 257 Iowa 1202, 136 N.W.2d 312 (1965); Calkins v. Sandven, 256 Iowa 682, 129 N.W.2d 1 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">A manufacturer\u2019s liability for negligent design has generally been extended to persons outside privity and to nonusers. This court long ago observed: \u201cThe rule is now established that a manufacturer owes <em>to the public </em>a duty, irrespective of contract, to use reasonable care in the manufacture of an automobile. . . .\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Hudson v. Moonier, 94 F.2d 132, 136-137 (8 Cir. 1938), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 304 U.S. 397, 58 S.Ct. 954, 82 L.Ed. 1422, on remand, 102 F.2d 96, 100 (8 Cir. 1939), cert, denied, 307 U.S. 639, 59 S. Ct. 1037, 83 L.Ed. 1520. And as we more recently observed: \u201cWe can perceive of no significant difference in imposing a common law duty of a reasonable standard of care in design the same as in construction.\u201d Larsen v. General Motors Corp., supra, 391 F.2d at 503. In dealing with-the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of negligence against the manufacturers the court in both <em>Wagner </em>and <em>Bengford </em>relied on the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 398 (1965). The Restatement speaks of the manufacturer being liable for the \u201cfailure to exercise reasonable care in the adoption of a safe plan or design.\u201d More importantly, subsumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>within the negligence concept expressed in \u00a7 398 is the rule of foreseeability. Section 398 reads in part: \u201cliability to others whom he [the manufacturer] should expect . . . to be endangered by its [the product\u2019s] probable use. .\u201d This language would encompass plaintiffs who are outside the distributive chain. For example, the manufacturer of an automobile should expect the users of the highways to be endangered by a negligently designed brake system or steering system. The court in <em>Wagner </em>refers to \u00a7 398 as the \u201cmodern and proper rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">Relying on Schneider v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 401 F.2d 549 (8 Cir. 1968), the trial court held that a manufacturer\u2019s liability against negligent design should only be extended to the persons classified in the status of the general public by legislative enactment. This statement misconstrues the general rule relating to foreseeable harm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Schneider </em>this court ruled that a plaintiff who was bending down over an opened vent window glass on an automobile and hit his eye on a sharp corner of the glass could not recover. The panel of judges believed that this conduct was not a foreseeable action which the manufacturer could reasonably anticipate. We do not think <em>Schneider </em>controlling here. One marked distinction is that plaintiff in the present case was doing nothing different than any ordinary person might be doing under the circumstances. Moreover, in <em>Schneider </em>the court reasoned that the window vent was not being used for its intended purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here the wheel cover was obviously used as it was intended. Defendant relies on Hatch v. Ford Motor Co., 163 Cal.App.2d 393, 329 P.2d 605 (1958). In <em>Hatch </em>the California Supreme Court held there was no duty owed by a manufacturer to a six year old child who walked into a parked car\u2019s radiator ornament.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think significant the court\u2019s comment in <em>Schneider </em>where it observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-18\">\u201cThe accident in <em>Hatch </em>appears much more foreseeable than the one in the case at bar and raises a close question on the use of a <em>needlessly </em>protruding ornament as distinguished from an essential protrusion of an opened vent window.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) 401 F.2d at 558.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-19\">We conclude that although the specific injury and the manner in which it occurred may have been difficult to foresee, nevertheless the unshielded operation of propeller-like blades on the four wheels of an automobile created a high risk of foreseeable harm to the general public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The use of the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>ways by pedestrians, the frequency of travel by unprotected persons riding on bicycles, motorbikes and motorcycles is a common occurrence. We think it now settled that a manufacturer does have the responsibility to avoid design in automobiles which can reasonably be foreseen as initially causing or aggravating serious injury to users of the highway when a collision occurs. Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, \u00a7 395, Comment <em>i. </em>A vehicle cannot be made \u201caccident free,\u201d but it is now recognized that a manufacturer does hold a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care to make the car itself inherently \u201cdanger free.\u201d We thus conclude there was sufficient evidence to submit the question of negligent design to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">We turn to the issue of the manufacturer\u2019s duty under strict liability. At the time of the district court\u2019s opinion the doctrine of strict liability had not been adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The decision of the district court was handed down on October 28, 1969. On February 10, 1970, the Iowa Supreme Court first applied the rule of strict liability on a manufactured product used in the State of Iowa. Hawkeye-Security Insurance Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 174 N.W. 2d 672 (Iowa 1970). It is conceded by the defendant General Motors that this court must apply the rule of law that is in existence at the time of the appellate court\u2019s decision. See, Vandenbark v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 311 U.S. 538, 543, 61 S.Ct. 347, 85 L.Ed. 327 (1940); Traveler\u2019s Health Assn. v. F. T. C., 262 F.2d 241 (8 Cir. 1959); Grimes Savings Bank v. McHarg, 197 Iowa 1393, 199 N. W. 365 (1924). Thus, accepting the fact that strict liability is now the rule in Iowa we must judge its applicability to the instant case. The focal issue presented has not been passed on by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Iowa Supreme Court, i. e., whether a user of a highway, within a class of persons who are neither users or consumers of the product may sue the automobile manufacturer under the doctrine of strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Strict liability is generally viewed as a tort doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is distinguishable from concepts of negligence in that a plaintiff need not prove whether the defendant had exercised reasonable care under the circumstances. The acceptance of strict liability is based on policy considerations of spreading the risk to the manufacturer as the party financially best able to afford the cost of injuries. As emphasized by the Iowa Supreme Court in Hawkeye-Security:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-6\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of such liability is to insure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves. Sales warranties serve this purpose fitfully at best. . . 174 N.W.2d at 683, citing Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., 59 Cal.2d 57, 27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 900 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">It is suggested by some that strict liability more nearly approaches the tort concept of implied warranty stripped of the fictional countenances of privity, notice, disclaimer and reliance. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965), sets forth the rule of strict liability applicable to \u201cusers and consumers.\u201d The Restatement expressly refrains from taking a position on \u201cbystanders\u201d including members of the general public. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, \u00a7 402A, Comment on Caveat: <em>o. </em>Recognition of this fact has caused case law to devolve on both sides of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-22\"> As we have observed on past occasions, this court finds to its disliking the task in diversity cases of attempting to predict the course of action the highest tribunal of a state might follow under similar circumstances. Nevertheless, a decision must be made on the basis of the existing Iowa law and a judgment made as to its probable application to areas where the law has not been fully crystallized. We conclude in the present case that the Iowa court would apply the doctrine of strict liability to a person in plaintiff\u2019s status. First, the Iowa court in adopting strict liability relies on cases from California,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Illinois<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and New Jersey<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which have been key states in early application of the doctrine in product cases. Justice Traynor\u2019s opinion in the <em>Greenman </em>case is considered by many to be the foremost authority explicating the doctrine of strict liability. In amplifying the rule pronounced in <em>Greenman, </em>the California Supreme Court has recognized liability to bystanders in a position similar to plaintiff\u2019s;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ******likewise, New Jersey,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>and by federal decision, Illinois,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> have extended strict liability coverage to bystanders. Clearly, the plaintiff would be covered as a person within the vicinity of the use of the product under the test of foreseeability which is operative in these strict liability cases.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-4\">\u201c[T]he limitations inherent in the concept of foreseeability, insofar as it applies to legal responsibility and the facts of the instant case, offer no salve for defendants\u2019 wounds. An automobile manufacturer, producing millions of vehicles a year, offers them for sale to the public ultimately for daily use on the countless thoroughfares of this nation. It is, therefore, well within the realm of foreseeability that a pedestrian or other traveller lawfully upon the road will be injured due to a defect in a vehicle that in some way inhibits or forecloses its control by the driver.\u201d Lamendola v. Mizell, supra, 280 A.2d at 246.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">Second, when a federal court is faced with the problem of determining state law without decisions of the state directly controlling, the court may be guided by the law which in its opinion provides the most just<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and reasoned analysis. See Wasik v. Borg, 423 F.2d 44, 48 (2 Cir. 1970); Putman v. Erie City Mfg. Co., 338 F.2d 911, 917-923 (5 Cir. 1964). We find the reasoning of the California Supreme Court persuasive in this regard. Mr. Justice Peters observes in Elmore v. American Motors Corp., supra, 451 P. 2d at 88-89:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a_e-dedup-0\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of strict liability may not be restricted on a theory of privity of contract. Since the doctrine applies even where the manufacturer has attempted to limit liability, they further make it clear that the doctrine may not be limited on the theory that no representation of safety is made to the bystander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-14\">\u201cThe liability has been based upon the existence of a defective product which caused injury to a human being, and in both <em>Greenmcm </em>and <em>Vander-mark </em>we did not limit the rules stated to consumers and users but instead used language applicable to human beings generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-15\">\u201cIt has been pointed out that an injury to a bystander \u2018is often a perfectly foreseeable risk of the maker\u2019s enterprise, and the considerations for imposing such risks on the maker without regard to his fault do not stop with those who undertake to use the chattel. [A restriction on the recovery by bystanders] is only the distorted shadow of a vanishing privity which is itself a reflection of the habit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>viewing the problem as a commercial one between traders, rather than as part of the accident problem.\u2019 (2 Harper and James, The Law of Torts (1956) p. 1572, fn. 6.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-5\">\u201cIf anything, bystanders should be entitled to greater protection than the consumer or user <em>where injury to bystanders from the defect is reasonably foreseeable. </em>Consumers and users, at least, have the opportunity to inspect for defects and to limit their purchases to articles manufactured by reputable manufacturers and sold by reputable retailers, where as the bystander ordinarily has no such opportunities. In short, the bystander is in greater need of protection from defective products which are dangerous, and if any distinction should be made between bystanders and users, it should be made, contrary to the position of defendants, to extend greater liability in favor of the bystanders.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">The same analysis was recently made by the Texas Supreme Court in Darryl v. Ford Motor Co., 440 S.W.2d 630 (Tex. 1969);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> see also Mitchell v. Miller, 26 Conn.Sup. 142, 214 A.2d 694, 697-699 (1965); Connolly v.

See generally automobile safety requirements contained in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.21 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1337-21\">. The term \u201cforeseeability\u201d as used in tort actions has always been both a confusing concept in principle and an elastic one in application. The term is generally used to define scope of duty (2 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 18.2 at 1023 et seq. (1956)) and is sometimes confusingly used in discussing proximate or legal cause (2 Harper &amp; James, supra, \u00a7 20.5 at 1134). Iowa courts have followed the principle in \u00a7 395 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, explicating the duty that a supplier should recognize in a marketed product \u201can unreasonable risk of causing substantial bodily harm to those whom the supplier should expect to be in the vicinity of its probable use. . . . \u201d Hawkeye-Security Insurance Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 174 N.W.2d 672, 682 (Iowa 1970), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>citing Bengford v. Carlem Corp., supra, at 864. The difficulty is that \u201cforeseeability\u201d is a hazardous term to define in the abstract and, like so many other doctrines, must turn on the judgmental process. Interesting contrasts may be seen in the findings of \u201cno duty\u201d rendered in <em>Hatch </em>and <em>Schneider. </em>The <em>Schneider </em>panel implied that a sharp protruding ornament like a radiator cap (the facts of <em>Hatch) </em>might have been reasonably foreseeable as creating a risk of harm. See Schneider v. Chrysler Motor Corp., supra, 401 E.2d at 558. Today many automobile hood ornaments are flexibly attached to the body of the vehicle, thus giving credence to Justice Holmes\u2019 aphorism that the law lives by experience and not by logic. Newspaper reports indicate that people not infrequently receive facial and hand cuts on sharp edges of protruding window glass in automobiles (the facts of <em>Schneider). </em>Experience could well lead other judges to find on another day that a sharp edge on a car window does create a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm. Such an outcome could be explained by the telling exposure of the judicial mind expressed by Professor Gregory in the University of Chicago Law Review over thirty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-6\">\u201cIt all depends upon what factors in the evidence a court is willing to isolate and emphasize for the purpose of making this decision, which process in turn depends pretty much on what outcome the court wishes to achieve or thinks to be politic. This factor in the judgment process, in turn, is not usually a matter of conscious choice but may be a function of the judge\u2019s accumulated experience in and observations of the world lie lives in.\u201d Gregory, Proximate Cause in <em>Negligence </em>\u2014 A Retreat from \u201cRationalization.\u201d 6 U.Chi.L.Rev. 36, 50 (1938).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">Generally whether a duty exists is a question of law, yet when a difficult determination depends on policy values underlying the \u201ccommon affairs of life,\u201d it is generally thought that the jury is the best deviner of such values. Cf. Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, 664, 84 U.S. 657, 664, 21 L.Ed. 745 (1873). Under such a guideline perhaps the mechanics of the foreseeability test would be better left to the jurors\u2019 decision. This approach is consistent with the maxim that judges should not set aside a jury\u2019s verdict simply because they feel another result is more reasonable. Tennant v. Peoria &amp; Pekin Union Ry. Co., 321 U.S. 29, 35, 64 S.Ct. 409, 88 L.Ed. 520 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">. The district court additionally observed: \u201cTo allow Sue Passwaters to recover in this case would construe this section as one of strict liability, a doctrine not as yet recognized in Iowa.\u201d Passwaters v. General Motors Corp., supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">. Often the concept of strict liability is confused with liability that is absolute. Such confusion is understandable when one compares older editions of tort casebooks. The indexes of such books use the heading of \u201cStrict Liability\u201d in reference to cases dealing with absolute liability, e. g., Fletcher v. Rylands, 3 Hurl. &amp; C. 774, L.R. 3 H.L. 330 (1868). See F. Bolen, Cases on Torts, 634 (4 Ed. 1941).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-19\">\u201cSome quibbler may allege that this is liability without fault. It is not.
