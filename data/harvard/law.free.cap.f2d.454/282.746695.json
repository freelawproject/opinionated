Greenwood Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir., 1971, 444 F.2d 544. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Court subsequently ordered that the case be reheard en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Subsequent to the order directing that the case be reheard en banc, it has been made known to the Court that the dismissed teachers were offered reinstatement and failed to accept it. There is thus no issue left to be litigated and as to reinstatement the appeal should be dismissed as moot, Troy State University v. Dickey, 5 Cir., 1968, 402 F.2d 515, 516, quoting Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 433, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). See, also, Sears, Roebuck and Company v. Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union No. 419, AFL-CIO, 397 U.S. 655, 90 S.Ct. 1299, 25 L.Ed.2d 637 (1970); Allen v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 1969, 413 F.2d 1218, 1220 (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Therefore, that part of the panel decision reported at 444 F.2d 544, <em>swpra, </em>is hereby vacated and that aspect of the appeal is dismissed for mootness so that it will spawn no legal consequences. Allen v. Johnson, <em>supra, </em>413 F.2d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
