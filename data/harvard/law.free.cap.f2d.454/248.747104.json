The truck was unattended at the time of the theft and was parked at or near Barracks M on the Naval Operations Base, Norfolk, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-18\">Truck #21 had also been robbed on June 22, 1970, while unattended and parked in front of the WAVES barracks on the Naval Operations Base. The same John Carpenter was the operator of the truck on that date and he discovered that the lock on its \u201clock box\u201d had been smashed open. On June 22, after the theft, the area around the \u201clock box\u201d had been thoroughly, though unsuccessfully, searched for identifiable fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-19\">Within a short time after the August 5 robbery, a fingerprint of the appellant was found on a \u201cmetal island\u201d directly adjacent to the \u201clock box\u201d on Truck #21. Both the \u201clock box\u201d and the \u201cmetal island\u201d were accessible only when a heavy metal cover was raised. The thief gained entry on August 5 to the \u201clock box\u201d itself by cutting off the lock. Only the money collected by Carpenter during the morning of August 5 was in the \u201clock box\u201d since it is emptied after each day\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-20\">Bryant was charged in a two-count indictment with the thefts from Truck #21 on June 22, 1970, and on August 5, 1970. On the morning of the trial the United States moved to dismiss the first count of the indictment which charged appellant with the June 22 robbery. This motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-21\">At trial, Bryant\u2019s fingerprint which had been found on the \u201cmetal island\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>was the only evidence introduced against him. An agent of the Naval Station Police did, however, testify that no fingerprint of Bryant\u2019s had been discovered during a check of Truck #21 on June 22 following the first theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Mr. Carpenter testified as to the sum of money taken from Truck #21 on August 5. In order to establish that amount the Government; on direct examination, interrogated Carpenter as to the number of Coca-Cola dispensing machines from which he had collected money during the morning of August 5. He replied: \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too many.\u201d Carpenter was then asked how much money had been taken and he answered: \u201cI would say approximately $200.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Carpenter stated <em>correctly </em>on direct examination that the June 22 theft had occurred in front of the WAVES barracks and that the lock on the \u201clock box\u201d had been smashed open on that day. On cross-examination Carpenter, in response to unambiguous questions of defense counsel, stated <em>incorrectly </em>that the lock on the \u201clock box\u201d had been smashed open on August 5 and that the theft on that date was effected in front of the WAVES barracks. Additionally, he attempted to clarify his earlier testimony with regard to <em>how </em>he ascertained that approximately $200 had been stolen:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A. I had the amount from all the cases which I had sold.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">Q. And what is that amount ?</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">A. I don\u2019t know, because <em>I don\u2019t recall how many cases </em>I sold.</p>\n<p id=\"A_R\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Carpenter was then asked whether the sum of money stolen from Truck #21 could have been less than $100. He responded :</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">A. I don\u2019t think so, from the amount of cases I had sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">When asked whether he <em>then </em>knew that the amount of money taken was not under $100, Carpenter replied: <em>\u201cNo, </em>I\u2019d have to go back and look at my sales to see.\u201d The following colloquy between Bryant\u2019s counsel and Carpenter then ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Q. Is it fair to assume sir, you don\u2019t know how much money was in there [\u201clock box\u201d] on August 5th?</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">A. Not right at the present, but I did then. I did at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">Q. And how much was there, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">A. I don\u2019t know <em>now. </em>If you\u2019d asked me August the 5th, I could have told you.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">Obviously sensing the insufficiency of the proof as to the amount involved in the theft, the Government made a valiant effort to bolster its case by further interrogation of Carpenter but could do no more than elicit the equivocal and inconclusive statement: \u201cI would still stick with around $200, <em>possibly.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">We first consider whether appellant\u2019s fingerprint discovered near the \u201clock box\u201d was sufficient to support the conviction of the crime of larceny. Bryant\u2019s reliance on United States v. Corso, 439 F.2d 956 (4 Cir. 1971), is misplaced since that case is factually distinguishable from the one at bar. In <em>Corso, supra, </em>defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on a matchbook cover, an object easily and routinely passed from person to person. This court held that a fingerprint on such a readily movable object is of highly questionable probative value, unless it can be shown that the print could have been impressed only during the commission of the crime involved. In the instant case, however, Bryant\u2019s fingerprint was discovered on a shielded \u201cmetal island\u201d accessible <em>only </em>by lifting a heavy metal sign. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>it was established that his fingerprints were not found on or near the same \u201clock box\u201d on June 22. This evidence, in light of the inaccessibility of the \u201cmetal island\u201d and the \u201clock box,\u201d clearly indicates appellant\u2019s involvement in the August 5 robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"> The factual issue of Bryant\u2019s guilt was submitted to the jury and was resolved against him. On appeal, therefore, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Government. United States v. Horning, 409 F.2d 424 (4 Cir. 1969). Applying this standard, we find the evidence ample to support a finding that appellant\u2019s fingerprint was impressed during the theft with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> In a prosecution for larceny of property exceeding $100 in value the Government has the burden of proving that the stolen goods had the requisite value. United States v. Wilson, 284 F. 2d 407 (4 Cir. 1960). The proof must be sufficient to enable the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt this essential element of the felony charge. United States v. Horning, 409 F.2d 424, 426 (4 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The Government did not proffer what must have been readily available documentary evidence but instead relied solely upon the testimony of Carpenter to sustain its burden. Carpenter\u2019s statements as to the amount taken from Truck #21 on August 5 were equivocal at best. Briefly summarizing, on cross-examination Carpenter declared that he based his prior testimonial estimate of the sum of money taken on August 5 on the number of cases of Coca-Cola he sold on the morning of that day; he followed this statement by adding that he could not remember that number. Further, on cross-examination he stated that he did not <em>then </em>recall the amount of money stolen but that on August 5 he had possessed this knowledge. Even upon redirect examination Carpenter was uncertain as he stated that the amount taken was <em>possibly </em>$200. We hold that his testimony was not sufficient to enable the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that property in excess of $100 in value had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The Government\u2019s failure to prove that the stolen property was of the requisite value, an essential element of the felony charged, does not necessitate reversal and a new trial; even without regard to value a defendant may be convicted of the lesser included offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Horning, supra; United States v. Wilson, <em>supra. </em>The evidence adduced against Bryant is sufficient to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661 for theft of property having a value not exceeding $100. Such an offense is punishable under that statute by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year. The offense is, therefore, a misdemeanor and not a felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for a misdemeanor only, and remand with the direction that the judgment of conviction for a felony be set aside and that he be resentenced within the limits of the applicable provisions of the statute tor that he be forthwith released if it is found that he has already served the maximum penalty upon a misdemeanor conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-14\">. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin, any personal property of another shall be punished as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">If the property taken is <em>of a value exceeding $100, </em>or is taken from the person of another, by a fine of not more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both; <em>in all other cases, </em>by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment not more than one year, or both.
