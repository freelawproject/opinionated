In his motion to vacate, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the appellant has challenged the validity of his conviction on grounds that: (1) his guilty plea was coerced in that the Government threatened to use an illegally-obtained statement against him; (2) his plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered because he was not aware of the possible defenses to the charge; (3) he was mentally incompetent to enter the plea because he was withdrawing from alcohol at the time; (4) the trial court failed to determine that there was a factual basis for the guilty plea; (5) the indictment was fatally defective because it did not include all of the essential elements of the crime; and (6) his privately-retained attorney rendered ineffective service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1231-33\">.
