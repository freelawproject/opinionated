Whether income tax returns are joint is a factual issue of the intention of the parties, Sullivan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1958, 256 F.2d 4; Heim v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.A. 8, 1958, 251 F.2d 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1205-5\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The sole <em>issue on </em>this appeal is whether the taxpayer, Sidney L. Gaynes, validly executed a waiver of his right to contest the amount of his tax liability when he signed Form 870-AD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gaynes offers two reasons in support of his contention that the Form 870-AD was not validly executed. First, he says he was induced to sign the form through the misrepresentations of the responsible government agent. Second, Gaynes says that the waiver related to tax years for which he had filed a joint return, and that the signature of his wife at that time was required for valid execution of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-13\">The district court, however, found that Gaynes \u201cvoluntarily, of his own free will, executed Form 870-AD and that when he did, he had been fully advised of its legal effect and he knew what he was doing\u201d. The district court also found that Gaynes\u2019s wife in 1959 and 1960 did not intend to file joint tax returns,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Gaynes and his wife had not filed joint tax returns,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and consequently that it was unnecessary for Gaynes\u2019s wife to sign the Form 870-AD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>waiver. Because there is firm support in the record for both the factual conclusions, the findings of the district court were not clearly erroneous, and the judgment of the district court based upon those findings is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">. Form 870-AD is styled an \u201cOffer of Waiver of Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax and of Acceptance of Overassessment\u201d. By executing Form 870-AD, the taxpayer waives the right given him under Section 6213(a) of the Internal Revenue Code not to have a deficiency assessed against him for income taxes unpaid until a notice of deficiency is mailed to the taxpayer and the time for petitioning the Tax Court has expired or the Tax Court proceedings have been concluded. Under the terms of the form, the Internal Revenue Service is prevented from claiming any further deficiencies for the years involved \u201cin the absence of fraud, malfeasance, concealment or misrepresentation of material fact [or] an important mistake in mathematical calculations\u201d. In addition, the Form protects the taxpayer against the continued running of interest. See 9 Mertens, Daw of Federal Income Taxation (Rev.), \u00a7 49.139. The taxpayer may not withdraw his Form 870-AD waiver after it lias been acted upon by the Internal Revenue Service District Director. Treas. Reg. on Proc. and Admin. \u00a7 301.6213-1 (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">. The taxpayer signed his former wife\u2019s name, Rebecca Gaynes, to the 1959 return. But Mrs. Gaynes\u2019s deposition gave ample reason for the district judge to conclude that she had not impliedly consented to her husband\u2019s signature on her behalf, and that it was therefore ineffective. In responding to the questions of whether she signed and filed a joint return for the year 1959, her testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-10\">A. No I did not. In the year 1959 or for the year 1959.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-11\">Q. For the year 1959?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-12\">A. No. In 1960, February and March, lie showed me a form\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-14\">Q. \u201cHe\u201d is who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-15\">A. Sidney showed me a blank income tax form and said, \u201chere, \u2014 sign it\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-16\">I said, \u201cOf course not\u201d. He said, \u201cIf not, I will break your head open and smash your face in * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-17\">Q. Did you ever sign, in blank or otherwise, a 1959 income tax return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-18\">A. No, I never did sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-19\">Rebecca Gaynes did sign the 1960 return, but in her deposition she testified that Sidney Gaynes had threatened her with physical harm if she did not sign the return. She recounted the events of April 16, 1961:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-20\">* * * I [was] aware that that was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-21\">the last permissible day for someone to sign an income tax return that year\u2014 it was a day of terror. It started as early as we got up in the morning and proceeded all day long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-22\">\u201cYou sign it or I will break your head open. You sign it or I will smash your face in or I will kill you. You sign it or I will kill you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-23\">Describing the moment when she actually signed her name on the return, Rebecca Gaynes testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-24\">And while my husband and Millie together stood outside * * * I opened the door just a crack, still keeping the door on the chain, just enough so he could shove the tax return in to me just about two inches, just enough to obtain my signature on the bottom line; and as soon as he obtained this signature he pulled it right back and said, \u201cNow I\u2019ve got you * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
