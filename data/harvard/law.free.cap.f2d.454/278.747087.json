Defendant Atlas on September 30, 1970 owed plaintiffs $26,550,000. Through the default of Atlas the said principal balance became due and payable in June-July 1970. Just prior to a stipulation entered into by all noteholders and Atlas, the latter advised the noteholders that it intended to make a payment of $385,000 to its former parent corporation, Scientific Resources Corporation, in accord with its agreement with Scientific. Atlas refused to defer the payment. On September 30, 1970 an order was filed temporarily restraining Atlas from making such payment to Scientific or any affiliated corporation under the terms of above mentioned agreement with Scientific. On November 10, 1970 plaintiff and intervenor plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting said payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-22\">The district court found that Atlas \u201c . . .is for all practical purposes in the process of an orderly liquidation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The court further held that it would take Atlas three years to repay the above mentioned indebtedness and that the Atlas assets were already less than the amount due the noteholders. The court concluded that no substantial prejudice would result to Atlas if it retained the $385,000 and if payment were permitted it would result in irreparable harm to the noteholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The record supports the district court\u2019s findings. See United States Steel Corp. v. Fraternal Ass\u2019n. of Steel-haulers, 431 F.2d 1046, 1048 (3rd Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The judgment, enjoining defendant Atlas from issuing any checks or making any payments to Scientific Resources Corporation under the terms of the tax sharing agreement dated September 15, 1965 as amended December 31, 1966, pending final hearing on this matter, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
