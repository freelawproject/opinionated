Prior to trial, the district court granted defense counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. The government appeals. We dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-25\">The defendant had been classified 2-S until April, 1968. In the following month, he requested a 1-0 classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>from his local board and subsequently filed SSS Form 150 with it. After a personal appearance in October, the board decided not to reclassify Gustav-son 1-0 because it believed that he was not \u201c . . .a true conscientious objector through religious training and background.\u201d His subsequent appeal to the State Board was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">On February 14, 1969, Gustavson received an order to report for induction. On March 10, 1969, he reported to the induction station, but refused to submit. He was subsequently indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Prior to trial, defense counsel submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment. That motion was predicated in part on the ground that it was prejudicial for the board to have considered certain information in Gustavson\u2019s file without informing him of its consideration at the personal appearance. At Gustavson\u2019s physical examination, he wrote in a form entitled \u201cStatement of Law Violations\u201d (U.S.AREC Form 191-R), that he was arrested for assault in 1961. The local board, at the subsequent personal appearance, apparently relied on this information in concluding that Gustavson was not a \u201ctrue conscientious objector.\u201d Two hearings were held for argument on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>Counsel\u2019s arguments concerned the prejudicial nature of the board\u2019s reliance on the 1961 assault charge at the personal appearance. Defense counsel stated the issue: \u201c . . . was the proceeding fair, did Mr. Gustav-son have a chance to know what the board was doing. ...\u201d The district judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the case because he believed that Gustavson should have been informed of the board\u2019s consideration of the assault charge and thus did not receive a fair hearing before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">The government contends that this court, has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under |f 6 of the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.\u00bb In United States v. Ponto and Grochowski (Nos. 18396, 18874), 454 F.2d 657 (7th Cir.1971), this court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>held that appeal by the government under 1J6 is permitted only from a dismissal based on a defect in the indictment or in the institution of the prosecution. In the case at bar, the dismissal was not based on these deficiencies, but rather on the fairness of the procedures employed by the local board. Thus, the government may not appeal to this court under \u00a7 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">We also find that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from appealing. The judge\u2019s dismissal order was, in fact, a ruling on the merits of a defense which could have been raised at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This constitutes an acquittal from which no government appeal is permitted, rehearing en banc (Nos. 18396, 18874), United States v. Ponto and Grochowski, 454 F.2d 657 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-15\">. This case was argued before seven of the eight active members of this court on the same date that this court reheard <em>en banc </em>United States v. Ponto (No. 18396, 1971), 454 F.2d 647 ( 7th Cir. 1971), and United States v. Grochowski (No. 18874, 1971), 454 F.2d 655 (7th Cir. 1971). One active judge, Judge Stevens, who participated in the <em>en banc </em>rehearing in <em>Ponto </em>and Gro-chowski, disqualified himself in this case; Senior Judge Hastings who participated on the <em>Ponto </em>and <em>Grochowski </em>panels, did not participate in <em>Gustavson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. Defendant was not present at the first hearing. He was present at the second hearing when the case was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">. An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the United States from the district courts to a court of appeals in all criminal cases, in the following instances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">From a decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof except where a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States is provided by this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b740-11\">. The judge stated the issue before him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-12\">A classification by an appeal board after a local board has had before it information which it failed to bring to the attention of the registrant at the time of his hearing calling for his classification as a conscientious objector, which would defeat such classification and properly would defeat such classification, but failed to bring it to his attention, everything from there on in the file becomes a nullity and is of naught,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-19\">The judge also believed that a decision on this defense was capable of determination without the necessity of trial. See R. 12 (b) (1) and discussion of the Rule in United States v. Ponto, and Grochowski, rehearing enbanc Nos. 18396, 38874, 457 F.2d 657 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b740-17\">KILEY and FAIRCHILD, Circuit Judges</author>\n<p id=\"ADV\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>We concur, with the comment noted in our concurrence in United States of America v. Ponto, and United States of America v. Grochowski, (Nos. 18396, 18874) 454 F.2d 657 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b741-5\">CUMMINGS and SPRECHER, Circuit Judges</author>\n<p id=\"AQE\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">For the reasons expressed in Judge Stevens\u2019 scholarly dissent in United States v. Ponto, No. 18396, and United States v. Grochowski, No. 18874, we conclude that the district judge\u2019s order dismissing the indictment was reviewable here under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. As in <em>Poro-to </em>and <em>Grochowski, </em>Gustavson\u2019s trial never began. There had been no waiver of a jury, and no jurors had been impan-elled. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment pursuant to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was understood by all parties to be a pretrial motion and was treated as such. Plainly jeopardy never attached. In view of the majority\u2019s jurisdictional holding, we do not reach the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b741-7\">PELL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A99P\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">I dissent for the same reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in United States v.
