We vacate the judgment dismissing the action and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">The Board alleged that the General Electric Company had awarded a contract to Koch for the manufacture and installation of industrial finishing systems at a G. E. plant near Baltimore, Maryland. Koch subcontracted with Phillips Plumbing &amp; Heating Company for the installation of piping at the job site, including pretested, prefabricated pipe. The Board charged that the two unions named as defendants in this action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> engaged in secondary boycotts in violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (B) of the Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by ordering their members to refuse to install the prefabricated materials. The unions denied that their conduct constituted a boycott of Koch\u2019s products, and insisted they were engaged in primary activity against Phillips for the preservation of work traditionally performed by plumbing employees in Maryland. The unions based their defense on the following work preservation clause in their collective bargaining agreement with Phillips:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-10\">\u201c(4) (i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where in either case an object thereof is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-11\">\u201c(B) forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person, or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless such labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of section 159 of this title: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-13\">\u201cAll pipe of any size used on the job shall be cut and threaded by journeymen and apprentices either by machine or by hand and all fittings to be made up (of any size), caulked, or otherwise, fitted to any pipe, must be done on the job or in the contractor\u2019s shop by journeymen or apprentices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">The district judge, noting that Phillips had entered into a contract with Koch to install prefabricated pipes while subject to a work preservation agreement, considered that the c\u00e1se turned on the Board\u2019s right to control test \u2014 did Phillips have sufficient control over the disputed work to grant the unions what they wanted? Relying on a number of recent cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court held that the right to control test was no longer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>viable means of discerning whether union activity is primary or secondary. Accordingly, it denied the Board\u2019s application for an injunction. We vacate and remand because we believe the case has broader ramifications than the validity of the Board\u2019s rather simplistic right to control test.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">As a preface, we note that under \u00a7 10 (Z) of the Act, it is not the function of the district court to decide the merits of the unfair labor practice case, for this issue is reserved exclusively for the Board subject to review by the court of appeals. The inquiry of the district court was limited to whether the Board had reasonable cause to believe that the unions were violating the Act. Malone v. United Steel Workers of America, 432 F.2d 554 (4th Cir. 1970). We, too, must refrain from deciding the case on the merits. We hold no more than that the Board\u2019s complaint, the union's answer, and the stipulated facts establish that the Board had reasonable cause to believe the unions were violating the Act, and for that reason an injunction should issue pending final determination of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The leading cases distinguishing illegal secondary product boycotts from lawful primary action to preserve work are National Woodwork Manufacturers Association v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967), and Houston Insulation Contractors Association v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 664, 87 S.Ct. 1278, 18 L.Ed.2d 389 (1967), in which the Court found no violation of the Act. Both cases involved refusals of the unions to allow its members to install pre-fit or preeut material on construction jobs in violation of work preservation clauses in collective bargaining agreements. In <em>National Woodwork </em>the Court held that to differentiate between primary and secondary activity, inquiry must be made \u201cinto whether, under all the surrounding circumstances, the Union\u2019s objective was preservation of work for [the contractor\u2019s] employees, or whether the agreements and boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere.\u201d 386 U.S. at 644, 87 S.Ct. at 1268. \u201cThe touchstone,\u201d said the Court, \u201cis whether maintenance [of the agreement] is addressed to the labor relations of the contracting employer <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>his own employees.\u201d 386 U.S. at 645, 87 S.Ct. at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The Board insists, however, that neither <em>National Woodwork </em>nor <em>Houston Insulation </em>are controlling because they dealt with situations where the contracts and specifications did not call for prefabricated materials. The Board points out that <em>National Woodwork </em>originally involved four disputes and that in three of them the specifications required pre-eut and prefinished doors. The Board and the court of appeals held that the union\u2019s refusal to install the specified doors was a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) because the contractors had no control over this aspect of the work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The union, however, did not seek review of these decisions, and only the fourth dispute, in which the specifications did not provide for precut, prefinished doors, was heard by the Supreme Court. Consequently, the Court noted that the Board\u2019s right to control test was not an issue before it. 386 U.S. at 616 n. 3, 87 S.Ct. 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">In contrast to <em>National Woodwork, </em>the validity of the right to control test is an issue here. The Board suggests that this question has not yet been resolved by the Supreme Court, and that it is of sufficient moment, in itself, to support the plea for an injunction. While there is some merit to the Board\u2019s position, we believe that other factors justify relief under \u00a7 10 (Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">The Board alleged, and the unions denied, that there was no labor dispute between Phillips and the unions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Board also alleged, though this too was denied, that one of the unions \u201cthreatened Koch that it would not allow its members employed by Phillips to install prefabricated piping and otherwise threatened, coerced and restrained Koch unless Phillips refrained from installation [of this product].\u201d Resolution of these issues is critical in determining whether the maintenance of the work preservation clause \u201cis addressed to the labor relations of the contracting employer <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>his own employees.\u201d 386 U.S. at 645, 87 S.Ct. at 1268. In <em>National Woodwork </em>and <em>Houston Insulation, </em>the findings of the Board provided a factual basis for answering this inquiry. Here the facts necessary to settle this issue have not been fully developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">In <em>National Woodwork </em>and <em>Houston Insulation, </em>the contractors voluntarily used prefabricated materials on the job. Any increase in cost because they could not be used presumably fell on the contractors whose employees were protesting prefabrication, and, therefore, the economic struggle was between the contractors and their own employees. Since Phillips did not initiate the order for prefabrieation, it is not clear whether the additional cost, if any, would be borne by Phillips. It may be that Phillips as well as its employees will benefit from excluding prefabricated piping from the Baltimore area. The ultimate cost may fall on Koch. One of the unions intimates as much when it speculates in its brief that Koch\u2019s complaint is motivated by a desire to avoid the probable increased costs of fabrication on the job. It is likely Koch would gain nothing by cancelling its contract with Phillips because other shops in the Baltimore area are parties to collective bargaining agreements that contain similar work preservation clauses. Under the circumstances, perhaps the most realistic course open to Koch and G.E., if the unions\u2019 demands are to be met, is to discontinue shipping prefabricated products to the job site. The object of the unions\u2019 tactics, therefore, may not be to pressure Phillips who possibly stands indifferent and patiently awaits at least a modest windfall if the unions prevail. The ultimate targets of union action may be, as the Board alleges, Koch and G.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The mark of a labor dispute is the presence of economic adversaries. It is highly improbable that a bona fide labor dispute exists if both employer and employees stand to benefit from increased work on the job site. The Board, therefore, has reasonable cause to believe that no labor dispute exists between Phillips and the unions and that the unions are engaged in a product boycott forbidden by the Act. The facts necessary to decide whether the unions\u2019 conduct is primary or secondary are yet to be established, but Congress has placed the responsibility of ascertaining them and initially assessing their import on the Board, not the courts. <em>See </em>Schauffler for and on Behalf of N.L.R.B. v. Local 1291, International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, 292 F.2d 182, 187 (3d Cir. 1961). At this stage of the proceedings it is sufficient for the Board to show, as it has done, reasonable cause for believing that \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">We find no reason for denying relief to the Board in the other arguments advanced by the unions. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for the entry of an appropriate injunction under \u00a7 <em>10(l).</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">. \u201c(Z) Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of paragraph (4) (A), (B), or (0) of section 158(b) of this title, or section 158(e) of this title or section 158(b) (7) of this title, the preliminary investigation of such charge shall be made forthwith and given priority over all other cases except cases of like character in the office where it is filed or to which it is referred.
