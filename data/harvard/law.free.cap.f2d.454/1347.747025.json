This $25,000,000 trust fund was established in 1966 by the International Union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-9\">On August 7, 1970, plaintiff filed a class suit in the Circuit Court of Marion County, Indiana, on behalf of himself and all other members of the Union seeking the appointment of a receiver over the pension fund. Defendants included the Union, the members of its General Executive Board, and the members of its Pension Plan Committee. Plaintiff alleged that he was a contributor to the pension fund and that his interest therein was being jeopardized by defendants\u2019 mismanagement. He charged the several defendants with numerous acts in breach of their fiduciary duty, including: permitting the pension fund to become actuarially insolvent, misusing pension funds by investing them in highly speculative investments, failing to exercise due care and proper business judgment in handling the fund, loaning fund money to bad risk debtors without possibility of collection, permitting spurious investments (in many of which an investment consultant was personally interested), allowing $7 million in loans to become delinquent to the extent of <em>$2y2 </em>million in principal and $500,000 in interest, failing to maintain the fund on a sound actuarial basis as provided in the pension agreement, and failing to file the reports required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(b) in 1969 and in 1970. In his prayer for relief, plaintiff asked that both the Union and the pension fund be placed into receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-13\">On August 11, 1970, defendants filed a removal petition in the district court. The petition asserted that \u201cthe district court has original jurisdiction pursuant to 29 USC 185(a), 301-309, 440, 501(b) * * On the following day, the Circuit Court of Marion County appointed Merchants National Bank and Trust Company of Indianapolis as receiver of the pension fund. However, in view of the removal, on August 14, the district court entered an order enjoining the state court, the receiver and others from taking any action under the order appointing a receiver. The district court also restrained the removal of the assets of the pension fund from Indiana and as a protective measure placed certain restrictions on their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-16\">On March 11, 1971, after previously hearing testimony on March 4, the district court entered an order finding that the pension fund was \u201cactuarially unsound and functionally insolvent * * *.\u201d The court also found that a proper class action existed, and provided for notice to the class. The court froze the assets of the fund until further hearing, when the Union and pension fund were to show cause why the court should not place both of them in receivership.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>Subsequently, further evidence was submitted on behalf of plaintiff to show that the fund was mismanaged and actu-arially unsound. Thus it appeared that its mortgage loans had deteriorated to a point where $4 million was set aside to provide for deficiencies and that the fund had a 12% loss for the year ending February 28, 1969, and a 9% loss for 1970. Furthermore, the bonds required by statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the pension fund officers were cancelled effective April 6, 1971, and a subsequent extension of the bonds was to expire on April 22, 1971. Accordingly, on April 16, 1971, the court entered an agreed order retaining jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter and providing for the appointment of a monitor of the affairs of the pension fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">At the request of the defendants, on April 29, 1970, the court appointed former Senator Capehart as temporary receiver of the assets of the pension fund. The order contained a clause requiring the defendants to show cause why the temporary receivership should not be made permanent, and the matter came on for a hearing on June 22, 1971. At the hearing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel announced that he was prepared to show that the pension fund surety bond had been cancelled effective June 28, 1971. Defense counsel stated that an exorbitant premium of $176,000 was required. He then called Thomas McFadden, a representative of the New Hampshire Insurance Company, who testified that his purported signature on that company\u2019s surety bond was in fact someone else\u2019s. Thereafter, defense counsel admitted that defendants had received a notice of cancellation of the bond effective June 28, 1971. Consequently, on June 29, 1971, the court entered an order (for June 22, 1971) appointing Senator Cape-hart as permanent receiver of the pension fund, and on July 7, 1971, an order was entered directing supplemental notice to the class by publication in the Union\u2019s \u201cJourneymen Barber.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-15\">\n<em>Jurisdiction of the District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-16\">Although defendants themselves removed this ease to the district court, they now contend that it lacks jurisdiction to appoint a receiver over the pension fund. Plaintiff advances several purported jurisdictional foundations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, but since we conclude that Section 501(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(b)) is an adequate jurisdictional ground for the district court\u2019s order, we need not assess the sufficiency of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-17\">Section 501(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> imposes fiduciary responsibility upon \u201c[t]he officers, agents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>shop stewards, and other representatives of a labor organization * * * in relation to such organization and its members as a group.\u201d Subsection (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> confers jurisdiction upon any United States district court or state court of competent jurisdiction to entertain a suit by a union member alleging breach of fiduciary duties imposed by subsection (a) and to award \u201cdamages, * * * an accounting or other appropriate relief for the benefit of the labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">Defendants\u2019 argument against finding subject matter jurisdiction under Section 501(b) consists in the conclusory, unarticulated assertion that Section 501(b) could only be a touchstone for jurisdiction over the defendant International Union and not over the pension fund. Presumably defendants meant to say that the defendant members of the Pension Plan Committee are not as such within the purview of Section 501(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">The pension fund is not a collectively bargained one; its Committee has no management appointees nor joint appointees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since the fund is an exclusively union undertaking, its entire Committee would certainly seem to be \u201cofficers, agents * * * [or] other representatives of a labor organization\u201d within the sweep of Section 501(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unless some Congressional intent can be gleaned to exclude union-appointed members of a pension fund committee from the broad language of Section 501(a), they should be held to the statutory duty in the exercise of their office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">The argument against including union pension or welfare funds within the operation of Section 501(a) relies on the explicit mention of \u201ca trust in which a labor organization is interested\u201d as within the coverage of the bonding re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>quirement in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the supposedly conspicuous absence of that phrase in Section 501(a). The definitional Section (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402) clearly shows that a pension or welfare fund is \u201ca trust in which a labor organization is interested.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(\u00cd)-<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Legislative history discloses that while the McClellan amendment to the Senate version of Section 501(a) extended fiduciary responsibility to \u201ca trust in which a labor organization is interested,\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the final enactment did not employ this terminology. This absence is said to be pregnant with the meaning that Congress designedly left pension and welfare funds outside of the protection of the new fiduciary responsibility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">When language is clearly broad enough on its face to encompass a specific coverage, confidence cannot readily be reposed in an opposing argument mustered from legislative silence. As in most instances, the silence here, manifested in Congress\u2019 failure to use the same terminology as appears in Section 502(a) (note 10, <em>supra), </em>is ambiguous. We find no statement by a member of Congress that the actual variance between Sections 501(a) and 502(a) was intended to exclude pension or welfare trusts from the operation of the fiduciary principle. Quite the contrary appears. The fiduciary Section finally enacted is precisely that found in the Lan-drum-Griffin bill approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>House, and that bill in turn employs fiduciary language identical to that of the Elliot bill, for which the Landrum-Grif-fin bill was accepted by the House as a substitute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That the House version ultimately enacted was not seen as changing or restricting the coverage of the Senate bill is indicated by the statement of Congressman Elliot and other members of the House Committee on Education and Labor that the Elliot bill extended \u201cthe fiduciary principle to <em>all </em>the activities of union officials and other union agents or representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, in comparing the fiduciary Sections of the House version and the McClellan amended Kennedy-Ervin bill, Senator Morse noted that the House version broadened the fiduciary provisions of the Senate bill, imposing a general fiduciary responsibility on all union officials.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When Senator Goldwater was commenting on how the conference bill (containing the present Section 501) furthered the objectives of the McClellan Committee\u2019s work, he stated under the heading \u201cLegislation to Regulate and Control Pension, Health, and Welfare Funds\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-5\">\u201cLast year Congress enacted a bill to require filing of reports on the management of union and welfare funds. This year, using the Lan-drum-Griffin bill\u2019s language, we require bonding of officials who handle all union funds, requiring of them high standards of fiduciary responsibility.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">As one commentator has observed,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> there is a logical explanation for the terminological variance between Sections 501 and 502 which falls short of imputing to Congress the dubious intent to exclude pension and welfare funds from the embrace of Section 501. Whereas Section 501 is concerned exclusively with union \u201cofficers, agents, shop stewards and [its] other representatives,\u201d in creating a trust responsibility, Section 502 which imposes the bonding requirement covers as well \u201cevery officer, agent * * * or 0ther representative or employee * * * of a trust in which a labor organization is interested.\u201d The coverage of Section 502 extends to trust personnel who may or may not be representatives or appointees of a labor organization. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(Z). Coverage of all these trust personnel may not have been convenient or possible as a matter of draftsmanship without utilizing the term \u201ctrust in which a labor organization is interested.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus its absence from Section 501 would not imply a restriction on its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-16\">This explanation seems to have the uncomfortable concomitant that while Congress intended to impose fiduciary responsibility on union officials, agents, and representatives in their handling of members\u2019 trust funds, it was unwilling to extend the same responsibility to trust personnel generally. Of course, the basic thrust of the relevant branch of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 was to protect the membership againsi <em>union </em>abuse of its statutorily endowed power.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If we are to speculate on Congressional intent, it may well have been thought that ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>tending the federal statutory base for fiduciary responsibility to non-union trustees was too great an incursion into a traditionally state law domain and unwarranted by the union-oriented thrust of the Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In any event, in our opinion it would be far more anomalous to impute to Congress a deliberate indifference to the need for fiduciary responsibility in the highly critical area of pension and welfare trusts, while it manifestly recognized the need for such responsibility on the part of union officials in all other areas of their activity. It is precisely in the benefit plan area that fiduciary principles would most aptly apply, for not only are significant financial interests of the membership most directly affected, but also pension and welfare trusts are the traditional trust funds where fiduciary principles have always most stringently governed the relationship between administrator and beneficiary.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\"> Faced with what is at most a statutory ambiguity, we will be guided by the purpose of Section 501. The Section, as we see it, was a direct and far-reaching response to the mischief exposed and dramatized by the McClellan Committee. That mischief was the misuse of union funds and property by union officials in its every manifestation. Thus the reach of Section 501 extends to every area in which subversion of the interests of the union membership may be accomplished by union officials or representatives bent on acting in culpable derogation of those interests. Consequently, we hold that a union pension fund committee is accountable under the fiduciary principles of Section 501(a) for its handling of the fund. See Mor-rissey v. Curran, 423 F.2d 393, 399-400 (2d Cir. 1970), certiorari denied, Segal v. Morrissey, 400 U.S. 826, 91 S.Ct. 52, 27 L.Ed.2d 56; see also Tucker v. Shaw, 308 F.Supp. 1, 8 (E.D.N.Y.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\"> Since the Pension Plan Committee was subject to the duties imposed by Section 501(a), the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of Section 501(b) to entertain plaintiff\u2019s suit alleging breach of those duties.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The order of the district court appointing a permanent receiver over the pension fund was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction under Section 501(b) to award \u201cother appropriate relief for the benefit of the labor organization,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but only if the order was predicated on a proper finding that the Pension Plan Committee had breached its fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">In his order appointing a permanent receiver, the trial judge explicitly found that the members of the Pension Plan Committee had breached their fiduciary duties in the management of the pension fund\u2019s assets. This conclusion was buttressed by well-supported, specific findings of irresponsible management of the fund\u2019s assets resulting in actuarial unsoundness and functional insolvency, of dealings smacking of dishonesty,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>violating the bonding requirement of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\"> The content of the fiduciary obligation in Section 501(a) is outlined only in broad principles.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Processor Cox has authoritatively stated that \u201cThe principles stated in section 501(a) were drawn from the Restatement of Agency in an effort to incorporate the whole body of common law precedent defining the fiduciary obligations of agents and trustees with such adaptions as might be required to take into account \u2018the special problems and functions of a labor organization * * \u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Where, as here, a union undertakes to administer a pension or welfare fund, it administers the traditional trust and hence has entered the domain where common-law trust principles would seem most precisely to apply. The burden should be on the union to show that something peculiar to a labor organization\u2019s administration of these trust funds justifies modification of the traditional principles. But we are not faced with a nice dispute about the content of the governing law. At a minimum, there must be safe, honest, loyal, and conscientious management of the fund.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Because the Pension Plan Committee patently did not satisfy these most rudimentary of fiduciary duties, it breached the duties imposed by Section 501(a). Furthermore, Article II, Sections 2.01 and 2.02 of the Pension Fund Agreement require that the Pension Plan Committee apply pension funds \u201cexclusively\u201d to provide for payment to the beneficiaries and pay the cost of establishing and administering the fund and that it keep reserves adequate to maintain the fund \u201con a sound actuarial basis.\u201d Failure to meet these requirements is a failure to expend monies in accordance with a resolution adopted by a governing body under the Union\u2019s Constitution (Article VIII), and therefore clearly in breach of the fiduciary duties in Section 501(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">\n<em>Failure to Continue the June 22, 1971, Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">Defendants contend that the district court\u2019s failure to continue the June 22, 1971, hearing on why the temporary receivership should not be made permanent was a denial of due process of law or prejudicial abuse of discretion. In response to the April 29th order to show cause why the temporary receivership should not be made permanent, defendants merely filed a petition on May 20, together with a New Hampshire Insurance Company surety bond for $500,000 allegedly signed by T. J. McFadden. When the hearing on the rule to show cause took place on June 22, defendants called Thomas J. McFadden, an Indiana agent of the New Hampshire Insurance Company, as its only witness. McFadden testified that his signature on the bond was a forgery. Thereafter, defendants\u2019 counsel admitted that there was a cancellation notice for the bond effective as of June 28, 1971. Confronted by such a situation, small wonder that a continuance was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-12\">The district court expressly concluded that a continuance was denied because the defendants had been given notice of the hearing and presented no valid reason for a continuance. This conclusi\u00f3n was justifiable because defendants\u2019 counsel did not state the names of absent witnesses whose testimony might be pertinent, what testimony they might offer, nor why they were not then available. Moreover, defendants chose not to call Wisconsin insurance officials who were tendered as witnesses on June 22. Therefore, no abuse of discretion has been shown, nor was due process of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>denied. United States v. Jones, 369 F. 2d 217, 220 (7th Cir. 1966) <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">\n<em>Propriety of Permanent Receivership Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">Defendants attack the permanent receivership order because, they say, the following three conditions were not met:</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">1. They were not afforded a full trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">2. Plaintiff had a remedy at law;</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">3. There was no fraud or imminent danger of the property being diminished in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">In our view, these three conditions were satisfied. First of all, defendants concede that evidence was taken on seven different occasions before the permanent receiver was appointed. As early as March 4, 1971, the district court put defendants on notice that they must show cause why a receiver should not be appointed for the pension fund. Moreover, the order of April 29, 1971, appointing a temporary receiver, entered at the request of defendants, required them to show cause on or before June 1, 1971, why the temporary receivership should not be made permanent. The show cause order came on for hearing on June 22nd when defendants were given an opportunity to present their evidence. Instead, the only evidence they adduced on that date showed that the proposed surety bond was fraudulent. Since they had been given an adequate opportunity for a full trial, the first condition was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">Similarly, defendants have not shown why the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law. As to the third condition, evidence had been adduced by plaintiff showing mismanagement of the pension fund resulting in large losses. Finally, there was a failure to meet statutory bonding requirements. Therefore, we conclude that the district court acted well within its discretion in appointing a permanent receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">Defendants also attack the findings and conclusions in the June 29th permanent receivership order. Initially, they criticize finding 7 that the pension plan \u201cis actuarially unsound and functionally insolvent.\u201d But this finding was amply supported by testimony of John W. Flood who was in charge of the employee benefit counseling division in the Chicago office of Peat, Marwick &amp; Mitchell, accountants; and of John W. Vilberg, Chief of the Employee Welfare Fund\u2019s Division of the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of Wisconsin. Their testimony was corroborated by actuarial studies of the pension fund and by an examination report of the fund, both of which were received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-14\">Next, defendants attack findings 9-19 relating to the investment policies of the fund and the engagement and activities of its former investment consultant. These findings were supported by the testimony of E. M. Sanders, secretary-treasurer of the Pension Plan Committee; Herbert D. Elovitz, comptroller of the International Union; Mr. Vilberg; Delmayne Aleman, a former member of the Pension Plan Committee; C. O. Huff, a former member of the Union\u2019s Executive Board; Kenneth Peek, vice president and trust officer of The Indiana National Bank; Julius Harlan, secretary-treasurer of the Union\u2019s Local 715, and by various exhibits introduced by plaintiff.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> During the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>proceedings, triers of fact often change their assessment of the evidence. Therefore, despite previously expressed doubts, the district judge was entitled to conclude when appointing the permanent receiver that plaintiff had sufficiently proved his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Defendants also seek reversal of the supplemental order of July 9, 1971, directing publication of further notice to the class in the Union\u2019s \u201cJourneymen Barber,\u201d on the ground that the \u201cimpermissible findings and conclusions [in the June 29th permanent receivership order] are repeated in the July 9th supplemental order.\u201d Since we have already held that those findings and conclusions were permissible, this attack on the July 9th order must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">In closing, we express confidence that the experienced district judge will afford defendants an opportunity to alter the status of the permanent receiver when an appropriate surety bond is tendered and when the pension fund\u2019s house has been put in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">Costs will be taxed against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">The district court\u2019s June 29 and July 9, 1971, orders are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1411-11\">.
