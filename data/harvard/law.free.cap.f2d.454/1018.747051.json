SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">The question on these appeals is whether the Federal Communications Commission abused its discretion in holding that a 25-minute program broadcast by the Democratic National Committee, setting forth views on public issues in response to views previously presented by the President and presidential spokesmen in a number of broadcast appearances, gave rise to an obligation on the part of the Columbia Broadcasting System to provide comparable reply time to partisan Republican spokesmen. For reasons that follow, we reverse the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">Television has become, in recent years, a principal vehicle by which the President presents to the public his views on important issues of the day. Indeed, no single fact of our changing political life overrides the significance of the expansion of the President\u2019s ability to obtain immediate and direct access to the people through the communications media. For the words of the President, speaking as he does both in his constitutional roles of chief executive and commander-in-chief and in his extra-constitutional role as head of his party, carry an authority, a prestige and a visibility that have a counterpart in no other institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">Moreover, there is an inherent newsworthiness in anything the President says. In addition to his huge direct audiences, in most cases over all nationwide commercial television and radio networks simultaneously, all of what he says is later reported somewhere and something of what he says is reported almost everywhere. In the case of the incumbent administration, these built-in advantages of the presidency in forging public opinion have been used to an unprecedented degree. In his first 18 months in office, President Nixon appeared on network prime time (7:00 to 11:00 P.M.) television as often as Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson combined in a comparable period during their administrations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">The President\u2019s extensive use of the media cannot, of course, be faulted, for there can be no doubt that in the distillation of an informed public opinion such appearances play a very basic role. But if the words and views of the President become a monolithic force, if they constitute not just the most powerful voice in the land but the only voice, then the delicate mechanism through which an enlightened public opinion is distilled, far from being strengthened, is thrown dangerously off balance. Public opinion becomes not informed and enlightened, but instructed and dominated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">To minimize the risks of such imbalance and to preserve the essential integrity of \u201cpolitics through communication,\u201d the television networks, under the occasional prodding of the courts and the Federal Communications Commission, have attempted to achieve a balanced presentation of opposing opinions. This balancing process has extended not only to regularly scheduled news broadcasts, specials and documentaries, but also to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>provision of free time to leaders of the principal opposition party to respond to prior presidential appearances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">In this spirit, on June 22, 1970 CBS offered Lawrence O\u2019Brien, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), 25 minutes of broadcast time for presentation of views of the Democratic Party on public issues. The offer was made in light of the \u201ccumulative impact of broadcast appearances of representatives of the party in office\u201d and \u201cthe disparity between presidential appearances and the opportunities available to the principal opposition party\u201d in order to achieve \u201cfairness and balance in the treatment of public issues.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The format and content of the \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d broadcast were left to Mr. O\u2019Brien to fashion in conformity with the stated purpose of the offer. CBS did not dictate which of the particular issues discussed by the President were to be covered, the allocation of time to be made among such issues, or the spokesman to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Mr. O\u2019Brien accepted the CBS offer and the broadcast was aired on July 7, 1970. The format employed involved presentation of excerpts of previously broadcast presidential statements on various issues, followed by a critical commentary or rebuttal by Mr. O\u2019Brien as to each presidential statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Topics covered included: (1) the state of the economy; (2) the nation\u2019s crime problem; (3) civil rights for blacks and other minorities; (4) federal expenditures for defense <em>versus </em>public domestic issues; (5) air and water pollution; (6) dissent and national unity; and (7) the war in Indochina.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-14\">On July 8, 1970, the chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) requested CBS to provide free time to RNC comparable to that afforded for the July 7 broadcast.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, having received no reply,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> RNC filed a petition with the Commission requesting that \u201cthe Commission * * * make its views known to CBS that their failure to afford forthwith\u201d an opportunity to RNC to reply to the July 7 broadcast \u201cwould constitute a violation of the Fairness Doctrine and CBS\u2019s obligations as a licensee of broadcast stations.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-15\">In substance, RNC argued that a national committee such as DNC was an inappropriate spokesman \u201cto discuss specific political, economic and social issues \u2014 the \u2018gut issues.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> RNC alleged that the result was \u201ca political attack on the President and his party,\u201d rather than an \u201cissue-oriented response.\u201d Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>RNC asserted that the O\u2019Brien broadcast had injected a \u201cfresh issue not specifically treated by any Presidential speech: <em>which political party should hold power.\u201d </em><footnotemark>10</footnotemark> RNC concluded, therefore, that Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s treatment of this \u201cwhich party\u201d issue gave rise to a duty on the part of CBS, under the Commission\u2019s fairness doctrine, to afford time for RNC to present the other side of the issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">On July 23, 1970, CBS submitted a letter in opposition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a week later RMC filed its reply.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Then, on August 18, 1970, the Commission released its memorandum opinion and order<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> disposing of five fairness doctrine complaints, including that of RNC.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In granting the relief requested, the Commission specifically rejected RNC\u2019s argument that national committees are inappropriate spokesmen to respond to policy issues raised by presidential appearances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, the Commission stated a new basis for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Although the Commission agreed that \u201cCBS has acted in good faith\u201d and \u201cis to be commended for its concern,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it faulted CBS for failing \u201cto have exercised journalistic supervision to assure fulfillment of its purpose\u201d of allowing the principal opposition party an opportunity to reply to the President on major issues discussed in prior presidential appearances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission held that, since Mr. Nixon\u2019s recent speeches had \u201clargely concentrated\u201d on the Indochina war issue, CBS should have taken steps to insure that the DNC broadcast similarly concentrated on this issue and should not have permitted Mr. O\u2019Brien to devote as much time as he did to the other six issues previously discussed by the President.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In making this determination of \u201cunresponsiveness,\u201d the Commission failed to explain why it limited its consideration solely to Mr. Nixon\u2019s five speeches on Vietnam. It did not consider, for example, other presidential speeches occurring both before and after these five, other forms of presidential appearances (such as press conferences), and televised presentations by administration spokesmen other than the President.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-13\">Having found the broadcast to be \u201cunresponsive,\u201d however, the Commission then concluded that it therefore fell within the ambit of the Commission\u2019s recent <em>Zapple </em>ruling,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which held that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>where a broadcast licensee has sold time to supporters of a particular candidate during an election period, he may not decline to sell equivalent time to supporters of that candidate\u2019s opponents.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As a result, the Commission held that, although this was not a precise \u201cequal opportunities\u201d situation, since the DNC broadcast \u201cdid deal to some extent with the Cambodian issue, to which the President has made the five noted addresses,\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cfairness requires CBS to extend some time to RNC or a partisan Republican spokesman, to answer matters raised in the DNC broadcast.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">On August 20, DNC filed a petition for reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s initial opinion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In its petition, DNC urged that the July 7 broadcast was not intended by any of the parties involved as a response to the President on the war issue alone, as the Commission had \u201cerroneously\u201d assumed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> DNC contended that it had, in fact, responded to presidential appearances concerned with each of the issues discussed in the broadcast.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Attached to the petition were excerpts from the \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d broadcast and corresponding excerpts from numerous televised appearances of the President on each of the issues involved.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> DNC argued further that presidential use of television had created a serious imbalance and that the partial redress of that imbalance would be vitiated by an RNC reply to the O\u2019Brien broadcast. It expressed a fear that the networks would be inhibited from carrying such DNC broadcasts in the future or would censor them to avoid the effects of the Commission\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> RNC filed an opposition to the DNC petition on August 25,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> to which DNC responded on September 9.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>CBS also sought reconsideration of the August 18 order.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> While conceding that the O\u2019Brien broadcast was partisan, CBS argued that the broadcast had been devoted to vigorous discussion of specific issues. It pointed out that, contrary to the Commission\u2019s impression, CBS had not intended to limit the July 7 appearance to the Indochina war issue and that CBS had fully presented the views of the President and other members of his administration on all issues discussed by Mr. O\u2019Brien on that broadcast.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Consequently, CBS urged, it would be grossly unfair to require that time be provided for a reply by the President\u2019s party to a prior reply to the President, since any such requirement would give the views of the President\u2019s party double exposure.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Finally, the CBS petition cited a precedent, completely ignored in the initial Commission order, that it asserted was controlling. In the <em>Hays </em>case,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> CBS had denied a request by a Democratic Party spokesman for an opportunity to reply to a Republican response to President. Johnson\u2019s 1968 State of the Union address. The Commission rejected a Democratic complaint that CBS had violated the fairness doctrine in refusing to provide time for a second Democratic broadcast. CBS asserted that <em>Hays </em>was essentially indistinguishable from the instant controversy.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">The RNC opposition to the CBS petition for reconsideration <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> stated that the \u201cfundamental defect\u201d of the CBS petition was its \u201crefusal to recognize or accept the Commission\u2019s well-supported factual conclusion that the DNC broadcast of July 7, 1970, was partisan rather than issue-oriented.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> RNC argued that the Commission\u2019s decision was not based on any imbalance created by the DNC broadcast with regard to discussion of public issues previously raised by the President, but solely on the ground that the DNC broadcast was partisan in nature. Further, RNC implicitly admitted that <em>Hays </em>was contrary to the Commission\u2019s August 18 ruling, but apparently suggested that it be overruled.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Upon completion of the pleadings,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the Commission, on September 24, 1970, released a memorandum opinion and order denying the DNC and CBS petitions for reconsideration.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Since the parties apparently had \u201cmisconstrued\u201d its earlier ruling, however, the Commission decided to expound at greater length the reasops for that decision. The Commission made clear that the ruling was in no way based on the partisan content of the July 7 broadcast. To the contrary, in informing the public on issues raised in presidential broadcasts, \u201cthe presentation can be hard-hitting and partisan.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">The Commission conceded also that its August 18 ruling \u201cdid not take into ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>count the overall presentations of CBS on the issues covered in the July 7 DNC broadcast, and * * did not follow the general fairness doctrine pattern.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The order was founded, rather, on a \u201cspecific corollary\u201d of the fairness doctrine \u2014 a new \u201cpolitical party\u201d doctrine derived by the Commission from its <em>Zapple </em>ruling, <em>supra </em><footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Concerning the question of \u201cresponsiveness,\u201d the Commission held that appearances by Republican Party spokesmen on <em>news-type </em>programs were irrelevant in the political party situation <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As to the presidential addresses, the Commission reaffirmed its position <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> that such speeches are subject to the general fairness doctrine,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and that CBS therefore had wide latitude in fashioning counter-balancing programming.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> However, although the Commission implicitly reversed its earlier assumption that CBS\u2019 offer of time to DNC was geared specifically to Mr. Nixon\u2019s televised addresses on the Indochina war issue,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> it held that, since the President\u2019s appearances \u201chad by far concentrated on [this issue] * * * it would certainly seem that CBS \u2014 concerned to have the public informed on the issues covered by the President \u2014 would, first and foremost,\u201d direct Mr. O\u2019Brien to present his party\u2019s views on Indochina.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In essence, then, the Commission ruled that CBS, having chosen not to dictate the content of the July 7 broadcast, could hot \u201cavoid the consequences of the \u2018political party\u2019 doctrine\u201d when the O\u2019Brien broadcast ranged beyond the issues previously raised by the President.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Finally, the Commission never addressed itself to the contentions advanced by CBS concerning the <em>Hays </em>ruling. The citation of <em>Hays </em>in a footnote,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> however, indicates that the Commission intended to reaffirm <em>Hays, </em>evidently regarding it as distinguishable from the present case \u2014 although no basis for such a distinction was stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">One last matter must be mentioned before turning to our resolution of the issues presented on this appeal. Although the Commission\u2019s brief, in line with the opinions below, strenuously argued that the \u201cunresponsiveness\u201d of the O\u2019Brien broadcast gave rise to a right of reply in favor of RNC, at oral argument, to the astonishment of this court, counsel for the Commission urged that we disregard the responsiveness issue and, rather, that we uphold the Commission\u2019s order on a totally new ground \u2014 that an RNC reply is mandated simply because CBS failed to dictate to DNC the precise issues to be discussed, without regard to the actual content of the broadcast. We return to this matter below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-17\">Much of our evolving body of administrative procedure rests upon the cornerstone requirement of reasoned decision making. 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 16.12 (1958). Without such a requirement, effective judicial review would be impractical if not impossible, and administrative litigants and the public generally would be set adrift on a potential sea of unconscious preference and irrelevant prejudice. Moreover, judicial vigilance to enforce the rule of law in the administrative process is particularly crucial where, as here, the area under consideration is in a constant state of flux. Greater Boston Television Corp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>v. F.C.C., 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 394, 444 F.2d 841, 852 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\"> We do not challenge the Commission\u2019s well established right to modify or even overrule an established precedent or approach, for an administrative agency concerned with furtherance of the public interest is not bound to rigid adherence to its prior rulings.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Lodged deep within the bureaucratic heart of administrative procedure, however, is the equally essential proposition that, when an agency decides to reverse its course, it must provide an opinion or analysis indicating that the standard is being changed and not ignored, and assuring that it is faithful and not indifferent to the rule of law.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Moreover, as this court has emphasized, the Commission \u201cmust explain its reasons and do more than enumerate factual differences, if any, between * [similar] cases; it must explain the relevance of those differences to the purposes of the Federal Communications Act.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In our view, the Commission\u2019s treatment of the <em>Hays </em>case in the proceedings below was clearly violative of these basic tenets of administrative law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">The <em>Hays </em>ruling arose in the context of President Johnson\u2019s 1968 State of the Union address.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> As it had done in the preceding two years, CBS invited Republican congressional leaders to respond to the President\u2019s address. CBS did not specify which of the many issues discussed by the President should be discussed on the program, require that those issues be discussed at all, or allocate time for presentation of any particular issue. The resulting one-hour broadcast covered a full panoply of issues, devoting a considerable amount of time to some issues treated only briefly by the President, while ignoring others he had examined at length.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Indeed, the 1968 Republican broadcast covered a range of issues at least as broad as, if not broader than, the range of issues discussed in the O\u2019Brien broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">The Commission, however, sustained CBS\u2019 refusal to provide time to Democratic congressional leaders to reply to the 1968 Republican broadcast. In so doing, the Commission relied upon traditional fairness doctrine principles, stating that its role was not to substitute its own judgment for that of the broadcaster, but rather to determine whether the licensee could be said to have acted in good faith in discharging its obligation to provide a balanced presentation of opposing viewpoints. The Commission concluded that CBS had acted within the wide discretion afforded it under the fairness doctrine, and therefore held that the Republican broadcast did not give rise to any reply-to-reply rights in favor of Democratic spokesmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>The facts of these two cases have that degree of parallelism which entitles both petitioners and this court to a full explanation from the Commission, and not from its counsel on appeal, as to why <em>Hays </em>\u201cshould be jettisoned without giving credence to the charge that similar supplicants receive dissimilar dispensations.\u201d F.T.C. v. Crowther, 139 U.S.App. D.C. 137, 141, 430 F.2d 510, 514 (1970). The question before us, then, is not whether the Commission could properly abandon or distinguish <em>Hays, </em>but rather whether it has sufficiently identified and articulated its reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Although <em>Hays\u2019 </em>relevance to the instant controversy is readily apparent, the Commission failed even to mention it in its initial order of August 18. In an effort to rectify this situation and to compel the Commission to face up to <em>Hays, </em>the CBS petition for reconsideration dealt at length with the <em>Hays </em>question, asserting vigorously that <em>Hays </em>was a controlling precedent which must be squarely confronted by the Commission.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> RNC\u2019s opposition to the CBS petition implicitly acknowledged the relevance of <em>Hays, </em>but suggested that it simply be overruled.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Undaunted, the Commission persisted in its attempt to sidestep the issue entirely. Rather than face up to the apparent conflict, the Commission\u2019s opinion of September 24 relegated its \u201cdiscussion\u201d of <em>Hays </em>to a mere citation in a footnote.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In so doing, the Commission sought to reaffirm its earlier ruling, in the apparent belief that <em>Hays </em>was reconcilable with the decision here under review. The Commission made no attempt, however, to articulate the basis for reconciliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Faced with two facially conflicting decisions, the Commission was duty bound to justify their coexistence. The Commission\u2019s utter failure to come to grips with this problem constitutes an inexcusable departure from the essential requirement of reasoned decision making. The rule of law is intended to eliminate the appearance as well as the reality of arbitrariness, and if the public\u2019s faith in its administrative agencies is to be maintained, it is imperative that these agencies act in a wholly rational, logical fashion, completely free from even the appearance of bias, prejudice and improper influence. This is particularly true where, as here, the agency is functioning in the midst of a fierce political battle, where the stakes are high and the outcome can affect in a very real sense the political future of our nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">The Commission\u2019s handling of this case does not mark its finest hour. Put to the test under pressure it waffled. Unable to articulate reasons for overruling or distinguishing <em>Hays, </em>the Commission effectively ignored its own obvious precedent. Under the circumstances, its arbitrary action may not stand.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">Our reversal of the decision below, however, is not premised solely upon the Commission\u2019s mistreatment of <em>Hays, </em>for we find serious fault with other aspects of the opinion as well. In an apparent effort to' avoid a direct confrontation with its earlier ruling in <em>Hays, </em>the Commission adopted a wholly unreasonable view of the factual setting of this controversy. By selecting rigid and arbitrary blinders, the Commission failed to see beyond Mr. Nixon\u2019s five speeches on Vietnam in evaluating the \u201cresponsiveness\u201d of the O\u2019Brien broadcast. The result, of course, was an arbitrary and therefore impermissible application of the Commission\u2019s own \u201cresponsiveness\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">Congress has delegated to the Commission the responsibility to ensure that broadcast licensees \u201coperate in the public interest and * * * afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>importance.\u201d <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> As a result, a court reviewing agency action is not at liberty simply to substitute its own judgment for that of administrative officers who have kept within the bounds of their delegated powers.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> However, these powers are not boundless, and unless administrative action is tempered by judicial supervision, \u201cexpertise, the strength of modern government, can become a monster which rules with no practical limits on its discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Cognizant of the potential hazards of unbridled administrative discretion, Congress has wisely devised a scheme whereby \u201cagencies and courts together constitute a \u2018partnership\u2019 in furtherance of the public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Thus in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1970), Congress chose to codify the long-standing rule that courts must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action * * * found to be * * * arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d Our task here, then, is simply to determine whether the facts confronting the Commission rationally support its ultimate conclusion that the O\u2019Brien broadcast was \u201cunresponsive\u201d to prior presidential addresses.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-20\"> In granting RNC a right to reply to the \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d telecast, the Commission shunned all reliance on the traditional balancing principles of the fairness doctrine. Generally, the fairness doctrine requires \u201cthat discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 395 U.S. 367, 369, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1796, 23 L. Ed.2d 371 (1969). <em>See </em>Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. 1246 (1949); Applicability of the Fairness Doctrine in the Handling of Controversial Issues of Public Importance [Fairness Primer], 29 Fed.Reg. 10415 (1964). The licensee may exercise wide latitude \u201cin determining what subjects should be considered, the particular format of the programs devoted to each subject, the different shades of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>to be presented, and the spokesmen for each point of view.\u201d Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, <em>supra, </em>13 F.C.C. at 1251. The Commission\u2019s role in this area \u201cis not to substitute its judgment for that of the licensee * * * but rather to determine whether the licensee can be said to have acted reasonably and in good faith.\u201d Fairness Primer, <em>supra, </em>29 Fed.Reg. at 10416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">This <em>carte blanche </em>licensee discretion has, however, been circumscribed in certain areas where it has been felt that an \u201cequal opportunities\u201d approach might better serve the end of fairness. Thus in Section 315 of the Communications Act,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Congress declared that a station permitting use of its facilities by one candidate for public office during a campaign period must, with certain exceptions, also make its facilities available to all other candidates for the same office on a comparable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Section 315, however, applies only \u201cto campaign appearances by candidates, and not by family, friends, campaign managers, or other supporters.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 382, 89 S.Ct. at 1803. Thus to ensure that the spirit of the statutory requirement is not frustrated by discrimination in the sale of air time to the <em>supporters </em>of candidates, the Commission, in its recent <em>Zapple </em>ruling,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> held that where a station sells time to supporters of a particular candidate during an election campaign, it cannot refuse to sell time to supporters .of his opponents.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-17\">Arguing that \u201c \u2018electioneering\u2019 is a continuing process,\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the Commission ruled below that the instant controversy must be governed by principles similar to those first enunciated in <em>Zapple. </em>Thus the Commission held that, whenever a spokesman for the party in opposition utilizes his broadcast time to discuss issues not previously raised in prior presidential appearances, the President\u2019s party is entitled to reply, without regard to the overall balance that may exist if <em>all </em>televised presentations were considered. On this appeal we need not, and indeed do not, decide whether adoption of such a rule is within the powers of the Commission. We hold simply that in the context of the present case the rule has been applied by the Commission in a wholly irrational and therefore impermissible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-18\">The July 7 \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d broadcast was structured around presentation of excerpts of previously aired presidential statements on various issues, followed by critical commentary or rebuttal by Mr. O\u2019Brien as to each presidential state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>merit.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The telecast covered seven separate topics \u2014 the Indochina war, economic policy, crime, civil rights, dissent, defense spending, and the environment. With the exception of Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s treatment of the Vietnam war issue, however, the Commission deemed the broadcast \u201cunresponsive\u201d to prior presidential appearances.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the Commission considered only those speeches of the President which were televised in the period from November 3, 1969 to June 3, 1970.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> During this period, the President made six televised speeches, five of which dealt exclusively with Indochina.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">As a result, the Commission held that, since Mr. Nixon\u2019s televised speeches \u201chad by far concentrated on the Indochina war issue,\u201d the DNC broadcast should \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d have been geared to a discussion of that issue.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s remarks as to the other six issues were deemed \u201cunresponsive,\u201d thereby giving rise to a right to reply in favor of RNC. The Commission\u2019s analysis, however, grossly oversimplifies a problem of considerable complexity. That the President\u2019s speeches during a limited period of time \u201clargely concentrated\u201d on one issue does not negate the indisputable fact that the President, personally and through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>his spokesmen, had extensively expounded the administration\u2019s views in numerous televised presentations which the Commission arbitrarily ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">We fail to see the logic underlying the Commission\u2019s decision to limit its consideration solely to presidential speeches televised between November 3, 1969 and June 3, 1970. Indeed, the only discernible purpose served by such a decision is the creation of an <em>illusion </em>that Mr. Nixon had not previously addressed himself to the other six issues discussed in the O\u2019Brien broadcast. Thus the Commission never even attempted to justify its choice of June 3, 1970 as the cutoff date. The O\u2019Brien broadcast was aired on July 7, 1970, and CBS offered the time for the broadcast on June 22. This being so, we see no sense whatever in the Commission\u2019s refusal to consider a 22-minute appearance by Mr. Nixon on June 17, 1970,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> which dealt, not with Indochina, but with the economy generally and with inflation and unemployment specifically \u2014topics covered by Mr. O\u2019Brien in the \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d broadcast.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Similarly, the Commission offered no explanation for its choice of November 3, 1969 as the starting date for its analysis. The July 7 presentation was, after all, the first \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d type program to be carried by CBS during the Nixon administration other than the traditional response by Democratic congressional leaders to Mr. Nixon\u2019s 1970 State of the Union address.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Indeed, on several occasions prior to the July 7 broadcast CBS had rejected Democratic pleas for air time to reply to previously telecast presidential statements.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> By selecting November 3 as a starting date, however, the Commission excluded consideration of numerous pre-November 3 presidential appearances, many of which dealt in whole or in part with issues other than the Vietnam war.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">Moreover, the Commission\u2019s analysis of the \u201cresponsiveness\u201d issue was limited solely to an evaluation of presidential <em>speeches. </em>The opinions below made no attempt to explain why other types of presidential broadcasts \u2014 such as televised press conferences \u2014 should be ignored. In a footnote to its brief,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> however, the Commission urges that such presentations should not be taken into account, apparently because the Commission believes they are not \u201cvoluntary, live, President-initiated appearances.\u201d This suggestion not only blinks reality; it is directly contrary to the Commission\u2019s treatment of press conferences in the past. The Commission has made clear, for example, that press conference type formats are to be taken into account in evaluating the proper balance under the fairness doctrine. <em>Cf. </em>Eugene J. McCarthy, 11 F.C.C.2d 511 (1968). Moreover, in Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 40 F.C.C. 395 (1964), the Commission squarely held that press conferences are substantially within the speaker\u2019s control, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-15\">\u201c* * * [N]ot only the scheduling, but in significant part, the content and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>format of the press conference is not under the control of the network. Thus, the candidate determines what portion of the conference is to be devoted to announcements and when the conference is to be thrown open to questions.\u201d <footnotemark>82</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Thus we see no reason why press conferences should not also be taken into account in the \u201cpolitical party\u201d situation. Here, Mr. Nixon\u2019s press conferences broadcast over CBS both before<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> and during the eight-month period chosen by the Commission dealt substantially with issues other than Vietnam, including economic policy, student dissent and unity, crime, human resources and civil rights,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> all subjects covered in Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cunresponsive\u201d response.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Finally, although the Commission noted in a somewhat cursory fashion that appearances by Republican Party leaders \u201con news-type programs [do] not satisfy the fairness requirement in the \u2018political party\u2019 situation,\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> it failed wen to mention the relevance of televised presentations by <em>presidential spokesmen </em>on other than \u201cnews-type\u201d programs. If the Commission wishes to adopt a \u201cresponsiveness\u201d test in implementing its new doctrine, it must apply this test rationally, and a blanket exclusion of all appearances by presidential spokesmen is simply not rational. The President speaks in many voices, and it makes no sense to pretend otherwise. In many instances the President\u2019s confidants \u2014 the Vice President, his cabinet officers, and other administration officials \u2014 present not only their own views as individuals, but also the views of the man they represent. Indeed, at times they speak subject to the direct authorization of the President himself. Thus the Commission\u2019s absolute exclusion of all such appearances cannot be sustained as a rational exercise of administrative discretion. And this is all the more true where, as here, many of these appearances dealt specifically with issues discussed in the \u201cLoyal Opposition\u201d broadcast.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">While we do not here rule on the propriety of the Commission\u2019s new \u201cresponsiveness\u201d doctrine itself, we do note that in many instances its application, by creating a right to reply under <em>Zapple </em>even though no fairness doctrine imbalance actually exists, may have extremely harsh consequences, not only for the litigants themselves, but for society generally. It can hardly be doubted that the power of the media in shaping public opinion plays a paramount role in our present political process. Yet any misapplication of the Commission\u2019s new doctrine would seriously distort this power, providing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>President\u2019s party with \u201ctwo bites of the apple\u201d \u2014 with twice the opportunity to influence public opinion as its critics. Such a result strikes at the heart of representative democracy and imperils the very traditions upon which this nation is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">To avoid these consequences, it is imperative that the Commission exercise extreme caution in applying its new rule. A right to reply, in this context, should be granted only after an exhaustive examination of the relevant facts. The Commission, however, in constructing its new rule in an apparent effort to circumvent its earlier ruling in <em>Hays, </em>dealt with with these facts in a notably shoddy fashion, arbitrarily ignoring many critical aspects of the factual setting in which this controversy arose. The Commission\u2019s determination of \u201cnon-responsiveness\u201d cannot, therefore, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Finally, in a gallant, yet misguided, effort to \u201csave\u201d the Commission\u2019s ruling, counsel for the Commission at oral argument abruptly changed gears, urging, contrary to the primary contentions in his brief, that we uphold the ruling on a new and highly strained interpretation of the opinions below.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Apparently inspired by a belated recognition of the pervasive irrationality of the Commission\u2019s treatment of the \u201cresponsiveness\u201d issue, counsel seeks now to abandon that approach entirely, substituting instead what may fairly be termed a \u201cspecification of issues\u201d rationale. Thus it is urged that RNC\u2019s reply rights derived not from any lack of responsiveness of the O\u2019Brien broadcast but, rather, solely from the alleged failure of CBS to dictate to DNC the precise issues to be discussed, without regard to the actual content of the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">We are cited to several passages from the Commission\u2019s opinions as supportive of this new interpretation. Typical of these is the Commission\u2019s statement that the July 7 broadcast \u201cwas \u2018party-oriented\u2019 rather than \u2018issue-oriented,\u2019 because of CBS\u2019 abstention in this critical area of issues to be covered.\u201d <footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Taken out of context, such declarations may indeed seem to support the logic of counsel\u2019s position. When placed in their proper perspective, however, these statements are seen to relate to the \u201cresponsiveness\u201d approach actually adopted. Thus it is true that as a factual matter CBS\u2019 failure to \u201cexercise journalistic supervision\u201d led to the grant of reply time to RNC, but only because the resulting broadcast was itself deemed unresponsive. In other words, CBS could have avoided this result had it specified the <em>proper </em>issues to be discussed; its failure to do so <em>enabled </em>Mr. O\u2019Brien to make an \u201cunresponsive\u201d presentation.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Viewed in this manner, it is clear that the Commission did not attach to those facts the legal significance which counsel seeks now to transmogrify into dogma. These statements were mere factual descriptions, not legal doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">We therefore cannot accept counsel\u2019s new and thoroughly distorted interpretation of the opinions below. This being so, we are powerless to affirm the Commission\u2019s ruling on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>\u201cspecification of issues\u201d rationale, for it is well settled that a reviewing court \u201cmay not accept appellate counsel\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations for agency action\u201d as a basis <em>for </em>affirmance. Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed. 2d 207 (1962). The decision must stand or fall \u201csolely [on] the grounds invoked by the [Commission].\u201d S.E.C. v. Chen-ery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). See N.L.R.B. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 380 U.S. 438, 85 S.Ct. 1061, 13 L.Ed.2d 951 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Moreover, even if we were to accept as valid counsel\u2019s novel construction of the opinions below, the decision still could not be affirmed on that basis, for the \u201cspecification of issues\u201d rule would itself fail the primary test of rationality.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Under the asserted rule, had CBS prescribed in advance the precise issues Mr. O\u2019Brien actually discussed, no reply rights would have arisen. Yet it is clearly irrational to suggest that the mere failure to specify issues, by itself, somehow fundamentally alters the basic nature of the broadcast when its content remains entirely unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Whether the issue is viewed as one of fairness on the substantive issues discussed or equality of opportunity as between political parties, there is no discernible relationship between the existence of instructions to a party spokesman as to the specific issues he should discuss and the fairness of the coverage achieved. A partisan broadcast is not made more \u201cparty-oriented\u201d simply because the issues covered are selected by the spokesman rather than by the network. The question of fairness cannot so readily be divorced from the actual content of the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Finally, it is highly questionable whether the mandate to broadcasters inherent in this \u201cspecification of issues\u201d rationale to dictate, censor or restrict partisan political spokesmen in their televised presentations accords with the commands of the First Amendment. The public must be equipped to make hard choices between competing political philosophies. This end is best served when there is robust debate among the people most directly involved \u2014 the spokesmen themselves \u2014 not where the operator of a federally licensed facility must circumscribe that debate as a condition precedent to airing it at all. See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., supra. Moreover, since presidential addresses are governed solely by the fairness doctrine, and not by the \u201cspecification of issues\u201d rationale, the Commission\u2019s extension of <em>Zapple </em>is essentially a one-way street. This is particularly dangerous where, as here, application of the \u201cspecification of issues\u201d doctrine would require reply time for the party in power even though there exists neither a fairness doctrine imbalance nor a lack of responsiveness as to the particular issues discussed in the initial broadcast. Such a result is certainly contra-fairness, and raises serious questions concerning the requirement of governmental neutrality in the area of the First Amendment. <em>Cf. </em>Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 73 S.Ct. 526, 97 L.Ed. 828 (1953); Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 71 S.Ct. 325, 95 L.Ed. 267, 280 (1951). For all these reasons, then, we must reject counsel\u2019s brave last-ditch effort to salvage the Commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">The sudden promulgation of the \u201cspecification of issues\u201d justification for the ruling below is just one more step in the Commission\u2019s seemingly endless attempt throughout these proceedings \u201cto vindicate its own idiosyncratic conception of the public interest [and] of the requirements of free speech.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 395, 89 S.Ct. at 1809. Yet the need for an informed public opinion \u2014 the great driving force underlying any working democracy \u2014 is simply too great to be subjected to the vagaries of irrational and arbitrary decision making. We conclude, therefore, that the ruling below, marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>as it is by a succession of factual distortions and shifting justifications, must be reversed and the order of the Commission vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">.

The Commission's decision to limit its consideration to this particular time period may be traced to its initial decision to dispose of the R.XC complaint in conjunction with several other complaints which were in fact addressed specifically to the President\u2019s recent speeches on the Indochina war issue. Thus in the August 18 opinion the Commission stated that it liad \u201cgrouped all these complaints because * * * they all involve a common problem \u2014 the discharge by broadcast licensees of their responsibilities under the fairness doctrine in dealing with the Indochina war issue.\u201d 25 F.C.C.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"ato-dedup-0\">In the other complaints, the Committee for Fair Broadcasting, Fourteen United States Senators, and Business Executives\u2019 Move for Vietnam Peace all urged that network coverage of the presidential addresses on Vietnam (referring specifically to those speeches occurring between November 3, 1969 and June 3, 1970) required that they be given comparable time and format to present their opposing views. The Commission refused to order the networks to grant time to these complainants or to apply an equal opportunities requirement to presidential or other official appearances. The Commission did hold, however, that format should be considered in determining whether a licensee liad achieved overall fairness. Accordingly, in light of the imbalance created by the large number of presidential addresses on Vietnam, the Commission required the networks to make additional uninterrupted time available to spokesmen selected by the networks for discussion of the Indochina war issue. Thus consideration of the UNO complaint in this context may well have led the Commission to miseharneterize that complaint as one dealing particularly with the President\u2019s recent speeches on Vietnam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">.

Here the Commission has outdone itself by giving four reasons for its action\u2014 albeit different reasons at each step of the proceedings. In its initial order the Commission ruled that Columbia Broadcasting System was bound to grant time to the Republican National Committee because Chairman O\u2019Brien referred only briefly to the war in his statement and because \u201cThe Loyal Opposition\u201d was party-oriented rather than issue-oriented, thereby bringing this case within the Commission\u2019s Zapple<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ruling. C.B.S. and D.N.C. petitioned for a rehearing based upon their claim that the Commission had overlooked its own decision in <em>Hays</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In response, the Commission denied the petition for rehearing on a new ground \u2014 the failure of C.B.S. to specify which issues O\u2019Brien could raise during the broadcast. The Commission, based on the theory that \u201c \u2018electioneering\u2019 is a continuing process\u201d (A. 309), applied a \u201cspecific corollary\u201d of the fairness doctrine known as the \u201cpolitical party\u201d doctrine as contained in <em>Zapple. </em>(A. 308). The Commission stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-8\">However well-intentioned CBS was, the result here was simply the \u201cpolitical party\u201d situation which we described at the outset. It was \u201cparty-oriented\u201d rather than \u201cissue-oriented,\u201d <em>because of CBS\u2019 abstention in this critical area of issues to be covered.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">(A. 311, emphasis supplied, footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">In its brief the Commission chose to change its position yet a third time.

These circumstances, <em>viz., </em>a speech by a candidate, political editorializing, or a speech by a candidate\u2019s supporters, limit the broadcaster\u2019s discretion. <em>The FCC was not concerned with CBS\u2019 overall fairness. </em>It claimed that O\u2019Brien\u2019s presentation was not responsive and that CBS had failed to assure that it would be. Even though the FCC was cognizant that the President\u2019s numerous speeches created an imbalance on the war issue requiring presentation of the other side of the coin, CBS\u2019 fatal error, it said, was in granting time to D.N.C. for any purpose without supervision. Therefore, the only imbalance, the Commission contended, was one created by CBS in failing to give R.N.C. time to respond to D.N.C. Not satisfied with even this position as espoused in the briefs, the Commission made an eleventh-hour change in its game plan at oral argument. As Judge Wright points out, the Commission urged that we entirely disregard the responsiveness issue raised in the briefs and affirm the FCC on one ground and one ground only \u2014 failure of CBS to instruct D.N.C. on precisely which issues to raise during the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">I can neither accept nor sympathize with the manner in which the Commission has handled this litigation. They have created a debacle in seeking a sound basis for- their decision. They have been unable to bring the ease at bar within <em>Zapple </em>and have been similarly unable to distinguish it from <em>Hays. </em>Their opinions at the hearing level as well as the position urged in the briefs and at oral argument show a capricious, arbir trary and inconsistent approach to this case. The Commission cannot constantly change its position <em>quo'cumque modo velit. </em>I feel constrained to sound a trumpet in warning against such attempts by administrative agencies to play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>fast and loose with their opponents and the court. This court will not be made a party to the type of sham proceeding the FCC has attempted to create by its inconsistent changes in position. Once the FCC enunciated its position on the issue of R.N.C.\u2019s right to reply it should have possessed the courage of its convictions to uphold that position and the reasons tendered therefor, or if convinced of its error, reversed its position rather than attempting to obfuscate both the issues and the Commission\u2019s reasoning. This failure to reach any coherent approach and the constant shifting of stance by the Commission leads me, although hesitantly, to conclude that by giving one political party two bites of the proverbial apple for every one granted to the opposing political party the Commission has taken a political role of interference contrary to all of the teachings of administrative decision-making.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">.
