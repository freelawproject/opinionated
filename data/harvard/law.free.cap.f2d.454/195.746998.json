This is particularly true when the motive and the intent of the bankrupt becomes material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The Referee in this appeal went into this contention carefully and at length. Regarding it he found \u201cI am satisfied that the mathematical deductions leading to such a conclusion is not probative proof that he actually received $60,000. in assets for which he failed to account. I have heretofore treated with the bankrupt\u2019s records and find that such a mathematical deduction is conjectural from the proofs before me. There may be suspicions of the truth of the items in the financial statement but that does not, absent probative proof of loss of assets or deficiency of assets to meet liabilities, prove the actual existence of $60,000. Here again, probative proof is necessary on the part of the objecting creditor to establish a prima facie case which must be then met by the bankrupt. I must find that this specification has not been proved. In re Pioch, supra.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The Referee found that the bankrupt had relied upon his bookkeeper (recommended by his accountant) and his accountant. There was inconsistency in maintaining records both on a cash and accrual basis but the Referee determined there was no proof of intent to defraud on the part of the bankrupt. The bankrupt concluded that his accountant had made some sort of mistake and asked his accountant to explain it. The bankrupt testified the accountant \u201capparently is not willing to admit his mistake.\u201d It should be noted that the accountant, although readily available to appellant by subpoena as a witness, was never called by appellant. The latter\u2019s expert witness, also an accountant, admitted to the Referee that from the books and records of the bankrupt which he had examined the financial condition and business transactions of the bankrupt could be determined. In re Barbato, 398 F.2d 572 (3rd Cir. 1967) is factually on all fours with the present appeal. There the litigation was remanded to the district court for explicit findings and decision as to whether there had been reckless indifference to the facts by the bankrupt\u2019s statement of his outstanding obligations. The Referee explicitly found that there had been no reckless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>indifference to the facts involved by the bankrupt. The ruling was affirmed by the district judge and ended that litigation. In the instant appeal both the Referee and the district judge plainly outlined the facts and conclusions of law which are in complete accord with the existing decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We have thoroughly examined appellant\u2019s remaining contentions. We find them entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
