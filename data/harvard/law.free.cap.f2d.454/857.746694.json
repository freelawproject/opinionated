An airplane crash in New York claimed the lives of two men, and we are asked to construe the insurance policy that allegedly covered one of them, the pilot. The district court, on cross-motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>judgment, held that the policy was in effect during the accident. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">W. A. Culberson, the insured and the pilot of the private airplane, styled a Cessna 210A, purchased his airplane and an insurance policy during the same day. These transactions and the delivery of the policy took place in the State of Georgia, where Mr. Culberson resided. At that time and at the time of the crash, Mr. Culberson held a valid student pilot\u2019s license. About a month after purchasing the airplane and insurance, Mr. Culberson flew from his home in East Point, Georgia, to Morristown, New Jersey, where he picked up B. A. Mac-Lean as a passenger. It was on the next leg of the journey that the plane crashed near Oxford, New York, in a violent thunderstorm, killing both men.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Appellant Ranger Insurance Company, the insurer,' paid $10,097.12 to an aircraft lienholder under a warranty endorsement in the policy, thereby becoming the assignee of a promissory note that had been secured by Culberson\u2019s mortgage to the aircraft seller. Ranger then sued Culberson\u2019s estate on the subrogated note to recover its payment. Ranger argued that Culberson\u2019s coverage was suspended during the accident because of violations of the policy. Thereafter, the executrix of passenger MacLean sued Culberson\u2019s estate in federal court, asking $750,000 for wrongful death. Culberson\u2019s executrix filed a third-party complaint against Ranger, seeking judgment that Ranger is bound to defend or to indemnify the Culber-son estate under its policy. After the actions were consolidated by the district court, both Ranger and Mrs. Cul-berson, executrix of Culberson\u2019s estate, moved for summary judgment in both actions. F.R.Civ.Proc. 56(b). The district court granted Culberson\u2019s motions and denied those of Ranger. Ranger was held liable under the policy to defend and to indemnify the Culberson estate, and not entitled to recover its warranty payment. Ranger appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Under Georgia conflicts law, it is the place of the delivery of the insurance contract that controls in this diversity suit. Float-Away Door Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., 5 Cir. 1967, 372 F.2d 701, cert, denied, 1967, 389 U.S. 823, 88 S.Ct. 58, 19 L.Ed.2d 76; Pink v. AAA Highway Express, Inc., 1941, 191 Ga. 502, 13 S.E.2d 337, aff\u2019d, 1941, 314 U.S. 201, 62 S.Ct. 241, 86 L.Ed. 152; Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., Inc., 1941, 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477. In our case, the contract was made and delivered in Georgia to a Georgia resident, and we shall look to Georgia law. That law requires that policies be interpreted liberally and in favor of coverage. Johnson v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 1922, 154 Ga. 653, 115 S.E. 14. In addition, any lack of clarity or any ambiguity in the policy is considered the responsibility of the insurance company, for it is the company that drafts the policies and must be required to draft clearly. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-704; Cherokee Life Ins. Co. v. Baker, 1969, 119 Ga.App. 579, 168 S. E. 2d 171; Boston Ins. Co. v. Gable, 5 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 368; Float-Away Door v. Continental Casualty, <em>supra. </em>At the same time, this court has no intention of stretching for ambiguity when it is not there, and the plain meaning of the policy obviously controls. Canal Ins. Co. v. Dougherty, 5 Cir. 1957, 247 F. 2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Both parties ask this court, as they asked the district court, to construe the language of an insurance policy. The policy is a standard one, mostly printed but with additional forms and riders typewritten or checked. All additional materials were prepared by Ranger on its own stationery. The policy before us is not a paradigm of clarity, and if there be ambiguities in the construction, the constructor must allow a green light to coverage in passing upon its words. If there be a red light, it, of course, will not be ignored; but even a yellow caution brings us much nearer the green one, calling for coverage. On appeal, Ranger asks us to conclude as a matter of law that the district judge was wrong in his assessment of this policy. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>contrary, we quite agree with the district judge\u2019s assessments of both policy and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">That concluded, we pose our question for review as a matter of law: Was it the intention of the parties from the terms of the policy, as such terms would reasonably be understood by the insured, that Culberson would be covered under the circumstances that later occurred? Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-702; Stevens Industries, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 411, cert, denied, 392 U.S. 926, 88 S.Ct. 2285, 20 L.Ed.2d 1386; Loftin v. U. S. Fire Ins. Co., 1962, 106 Ga.App. 287, 127 S.E.2d 53; Royal Indemnity v. McClatchey, 1960, 101 Ga.App. 507, 114 S.E.2d 394. We must look at the policy as a totality, using the usual rules of construction of contracts, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-2419; Float-Away Door Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., <em>supra; </em>Stevens Industries, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">On appeal, Ranger argues that Culberson\u2019s coverage was \u201csuspended\u201d during the alleged transgressions of the policy. This is in accord with the accepted principle of our court that a violation of an insurance provision does not operate to cancel a policy, but only to suspend its application to any accident that occurs during the violative acts. Lineas Aereas Colombianas Expresas v. Travelers Fire Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1958, 257 F.2d 150. Specifically, Ranger\u2019s \u201csuspension\u201d argument centers around the fact that Culberson carried a passenger, admittedly in violation of the FAA regulations, and contrary to a provision that was stamped on his student certificate. From that fact, Ranger contends that coverage was suspended by any one of three clauses in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">I. THE PILOT CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">One of the provisions in Culberson\u2019s policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-8\">\u201cOnly the following pilot(s) will operate the aircraft while \u2018in flight\u2019 and while holding proper pilot certificate (s) with appropriate ratings as required by the Federal Aviation Agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-11\">\n<em>W. A. Culberson or any other private or commercial pilot having a minimum of 200 total logged hours including at least 25 hours in retractable gear aircraft.\"</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">[The italicized portion was typewritten by Ranger; the rest was printed.]</p>\n<p id=\"ayt-dedup-0\">Ranger\u2019s argument goes as follows: Culberson would be covered only \u201cwhile holding a <em>proper </em>certificate with <em>appropriate </em>ratings\u201d ; because Cul-berson flew with a passenger, his certificate was \u201cimproper\u201d and his ratings \u201cinappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Ranger begins its first argument under the Pilot Clause by contending that Culberson\u2019s certificate was not \u201cproper\u201d within the sanctions of the Pilot Clause because his carrying of a passenger violated the face of his student certificate. The certificate had the notation \u201cPassenger Carrying Prohibited\u201d stamped in two places. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">We do not read the word \"proper\u201d as requiring exact compliance with the face of the certificate. It is quite proper for an insurance company to insure a pilot for any permutation of circumstances, whether or not that permutation involves conduct that violates the certificate or the FAA regulations. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. McDaniel, N.D.Miss.1960, 187 F.Supp. 614, aff\u2019d, 5 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 926. It is the policy, not the pilot\u2019s certificate nor the FAA regulations, that sets the perimeters of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">In viewing the totality of the policy, we observe that omitted form paragraphs are parts of a written document. They serve to explain the intent of the parties, just as typewritten or handwritten statements serve to clarify or to change the sense of printed paragraphs. See Royal Indemnity v. John F. Cawrse Lumber Co., D.Or., 1965, 245 F.Supp. 707; Aetna Life and Casualty Co. v. Charles S. Martin Distributing Co., 1969, 120 Ga.App. 133, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>169 S.E.2d 695; Fireman\u2019s Fund v. McDaniel, <em>supra. </em>Ranger included an additional page of printed exclusions in Culberson\u2019s policy. The page had four exclusions, with boxes to the side that Ranger was to check if applicable to the policy. Of the four exclusions printed on the page, only two were checked by Ranger as applying to Culberson. Those two cheeked exclusions are not relevant here. One omitted exclusion reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">\u201cIt is agreed that this policy does not apply and no coverage is afforded to any insured while any aircraft insured under this policy is being operated by a Student Pilot unless said Student Pilot is under the direct supervision of a properly qualified FAA Certified Flight Instructor who shall have specifically approved each flight undertaken by the student prior to takeoff. This exclusion shall not apply to any Student Pilot after he has received his Private Pilot Certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">By failing to check that provision, we must assume that Ranger fully intended to insure a student pilot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Ranger not only omitted the exclusion that specifically forbade coverage to student pilots, but also omitted an exclusion that read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">\u201cThe following Exclusion is added to the Exclusions of the Policy: . to any Insured who operates or permits the aircraft to be operated . <em>in violation of any regulation pertaining to pilot certificates.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Ranger\u2019s failure to check that exclusion is of some consequence in its argument that an infringement of the pilot certificate is an \u201cimpropriety\u201d that negates coverage under the Pilot Clause. This omission is even more significant in light of the one extant Georgia case on the question of Pilot Clauses and noncompliance with the pilot certificate. In Grigsby v. Houston Fire and Casualty Co., 1966, 113 Ga.App. 572, 148 S.E.2d 925, the court held that the pilot\u2019s failure to complete the required number of practice take-offs and landings and his failure to obtain a current medical certification violated the terms of his pilot\u2019s certificate, and therefore suspended coverage. However, the insurance policy in <em>Grigsby </em>contained an exclusion specifically providing that there should be no coverage when the aircraft was operated \u201cin violation of any regulations pertaining to Airman\u2019s Certificates.\u201d The exclusion that Ranger chose to omit in Culberson\u2019s policy suspended coverage whenever there were operations \u201cin violation of any regulation pertaining to pilot certificates.\u201d While not precisely the same, the language and, we think, the intent of the two passages are close enough to lend weight to our concern with Ranger\u2019s omission. Ranger, through an affidavit from the vice-president of its aviation managers, argues that the omitted exclusion was intended to be applicable only to \u201cflying clubs.\u201d True or not, that is not quite relevant to our inquiry here. W\u00e9 wish to know what Culberson\u2019s reasonable expectation was when he read that exclusion page, saw two items checked as applicable, and saw the \u201cpilot certificate\u201d exclusion left unchecked as inapplicable. We feel that the words compel only one reasonable meaning, and that is that the omitted provision is intended to apply to whoever is insured. Without further explanation in the policy, Ranger cannot at this date stamp an \u201conly applicable to flying clubs\u201d into the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">In sum', if Ranger wished to suspend coverage in the event of any violation of Culberson\u2019s pilot\u2019s certificate, then it should have specifically said so in the policy. We do not read that specificity into the word \u201cproper\u201d in Ranger\u2019s behalf, and we find support for our decision in the fact that Ranger itself chose not to include easily-available form language that would have readily provided the necessary specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">The case of Roach v. Churchman, 8 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 849, does not support Ranger on this point. There is one statement by the Eighth Circuit regarding violation of a pilot\u2019s certificate, but the context of that statement makes it quite inapposite here. The policy provision in <em>Roach </em>specifically stated that a violation of the certificate would suspend coverage, a stipulation very much akin to the <em>Grigsby </em>provision and to Ranger\u2019s <em>omitted </em>exclusion. We might also note that the holding of <em>Roach </em>was that a violation of certain sections of the FAA regulations would <em>not </em>operate to suspend coverage under two separate exclusions, one that suspended coverage in case of violation of the pilot certificate and another that suspended coverage in case of \u201cunlawful purpose.\u201d We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the rationale of that holding quite in concert with our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Secondly, with respect to the Pilot Clause, Ranger insists that Culberson\u2019s admitted violation of the Federal Aviation Regulations in carrying a passenger operated to make his certificate \u201cimproper.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.3(a). Again, we cannot agree. We would assume that an \u201ceffective\u201d certificate is a \u201cproper\u201d one, however one might wish to muddle those words about. The FAA regulations provide specifically that any pilot certificate (including a student certificate) cases to be \u201ceffective\u201d only if it is \u201csurrendered, suspended, or revoked.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.9. None of the three \u201cif\u2019s\u201d attached to Culberson\u2019s certificate. The student certificate provides on its face only that the certificate <em>might </em>be revoked by the carrying of a passenger in violation of the regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ****8 Thus the fact that Culberson carried a passenger did not, <em>ipso facto, </em>revoke or suspend his certificate. <em>See </em>United States v. Eagle Star Ins. Co., 9 Cir. 1952, 196 F.2d 317, rev\u2019d on other grounds on reh., 1963, 201 F.2d 764. Mr. Culberson held a perfectly \u201cproper\u201d certificate at the time of his accident, even though his conduct was regulated by the FAA, and the certificate remained \u201cproper\u201d until it was suspended or revoked by discretionary act of the FAA. <em>See </em>Hall\u2019s Aero Spraying, Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, 5 Cir. 1960, 274 F. 2d 527; <em>see also </em>Roach v. Churchman, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">If Ranger wishes us to read the general term \u201cproper\u201d as requiring that <em>any </em>transgression of an FAA regulation should operate as an \u201cimpropriety\u201d of sufficient intent to suspend coverage, then our declining to read a general word so broadly should come as no surprise, for we have declined to do so before. Hall\u2019s Aero Spraying v. Lloyd\u2019s of London, <em>supra; accord, </em>Roach v. Churchman, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Words of exclusion in insurance policies should be given small tolerance when insurance companies choose to use words of imprecision. Indeed, the logic of Ranger\u2019s argument for exclusion would be to engraft as exceptions to coverage the violation of every proscribed peccadillo of \\ FA A* regulations. The cases cited by Range in its support go to the heart of coverage, and it cannot be that every impairo*' capillary blocks coverage. ' Almost: \u00e1i\u00ed airplane accidents involve some violation of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Even \u201ccareless flying,\u201d or simply negligence, is a violation. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.9. The <em>Roach </em>case construed a similar argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-14\">\u201cApplying this analysis, the insuring agreements become illusory in effect since few accidents occur without the aircraft's owner or pilot violating one or more of the very detailed regulations promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">431 F.2d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">To read into the general word \u201cproper\u201d all violations of the regulations would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>to hoodwink most insurance purchasers, for it would make a nullity of most coverage. Purchasers believe, and with good reason, that they have bought insurance to protect themselves from precisely those degrees of negligence or outright carelessness that FAA regulations might condemn. Insurance is procured to protect the violator, and every violation cannot nullify coverage. Any intent to use general words as a blunderbuss and every single regulation as birdshot cannot be reasonably upheld. If an insurance company has an intent to deny coverage in a specific set of circumstances, then it shbuld so delineate. <em>See </em>Moulor v. American Life Ins. Co., 1884, 111 U.S. 335, 4 S.Ct. 466, 28 L.Ed. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">\u25a0 [16] Ranger\u2019s third and final argument. with regard to the pilot clause is iat the coverage should be suspended because Culberson did not have a \u201cproper instrument flight rating.\u201d In the <em>Roach </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the Eighth Circuit was faced with a simlar argument concerning a full-fledged pilot who did not have proper \u201cinstrument flight rating\u201d because he did not complete the required number of practice flights before flying at night. We have a student pilot. The pilot clause of <em>Roach </em>specifically allowed for suspension of coverage during acts in violation of the pilot certificate. Our pilot clause does not. Yet even under the former circumstances, the <em>Roach </em>court held that a general term in the pilot clause could not be interpreted to suspend coverage during any and all violations of the Federal Aviation Regulations. We took a similar approach in <em>Hall\u2019s Aero Spraying, supra, </em>on which the Eighth Circuit relied in <em>Roach.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">But we find another element controlling the \u201cappropriate rating\u201d issue in our case. \u201cRatings\u201d of any sort are not given to student pilots, according to the regulations that we are asked to apply. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.16(d) (1) and \u00a7 61.16(b). It was therefore quite impossible for Culberson, at any time, to receive an \u201cinstrument flight rating\u201d or any other rating. And we are now asked to conclude that this fact suspended insurance coverage. Actually, what Ranger asks us to do is to invalidate the insurance policy. If the absence of flight ratings is an \u201cinappropriate\u201d rating within the ambit of the pilot clause, then, with no possibility of flight ratings of any sort, Culberson would be flying in constant violation of his policy; whatever he did would have an \u201cinappropriate\u201d rating. We refuse to hold that Cul-berson contracted to pay a premium of $553 per year for a policy that was \u201csuspended\u201d <em>ab initio. </em>When Ranger agreed to insure a student pilot, it was charged with the knowledge that he could not obtain any flight ratings whatsoever while he held that type license. Ranger is estopped from trying to raise \u201cappropriate ratings\u201d from the dead at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">The case of Lineas v. Travelers Fire Insurance, <em>supra, </em>cited by Ranger in its brief with regard to the pilot clause, is quite inapposite. In <em>Lineas, </em>a diversity action controlled by Florida law, the company insured an airplane for cargo purposes. The pilot clause of that policy provided that the airplane should be flown only by those regular pilots of the insured who held licenses issued by United States or Colombian authorities. The insured made his airplane available to a coadventurer for flights within the borders of Mexico, knowing that under Mexican law the craft would have to be registered as a Mexican airplane and would have to be piloted by Mexican pilots. The airplane crashed in Mexico, with Mexican pilots at the controls, while it was carrying passengers and no cargo. The incidents of <em>Lineas </em>operated to change fundamentally the matrix of the risks that the company had agreed to insure. The Mexican pilots who were in command when the airplane crashed were entirely outside the whole species of pilots specified in the pilot clause. In our case the pilot flying the airplane was well within the clause, specifically named in fact. The Mexican pilots of <em>Lineas </em>were not authorized to fly the plane at any time. Culberson was clearly authorized to fly the air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>plane. And, as we have discussed above, the pilot clause did not operate to forbid the carrying of passengers. Whether other provisions of the policy would suspend coverage in the event of passenger carriage remains to be explained. We refer now only to the pilot clauses of our case and of <em>Lineas. </em>We might add, however, that the ill-fated flight of <em>Lineas </em>involved a purpose entirely without the very specific purpose for which the insurance company had contracted, the carrying of cargo. In our case Culberson\u2019s flight was entirely within the purposes that Ranger agreed to cover.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we find <em>Lineas </em>inapplicable to our policy and our set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">II. EXCLUSION TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The second provision of the policy on which Ranger bases this appeal reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-6\">\u201cThis policy does not apply . to any occurrence or to any loss or damage occurring while the aircraft is operated while in flight, by other than the pilot or pilots set forth under Item 7 of the Declarations [the Pilot Clause].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Ranger argues that the accident occurred when the airplane was operated by \u201cother than the pilot set forth\u201d under the Pilot Clause, thereby suspending the coverage during such activity. However, if the pilot clause and attendant facts cannot suspend coverage, then we find it quite impossible to conclude that Item Two of the printed exclusions works the suspension that Ranger seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">It is uncontroverted that Culberson flew the airplane, and that Culberson is specifically named in the typed portion of the Pilot Clause. Exclusion Two does not incorporate by its terms all of the Pilot Clause; it refers only to those pilot(s) \u201cset forth\u201d in the clause. Exclusion Two specifically omits any reference to or incorporation of the printed part of the Pilot Clause, which is the part of the clause that included the phrase \u201cwhile holding a proper pilot certificate . . . with appropriate ratings as required by the Federal Aviation Agency.\u201d It was that printed phrase that drew our attention in our discussion of the entire Pilot Clause above. Without reference to \u201cpropriety\u201d or \u201cappropriateness,\u201d Exclusion Two simply requires that the airplane be operated only by the \u201cpilot ... set forth under Item 7 of the Declarations [the Pilot Clause].\u201d It is our conclusion that the exclusion does not apply to these facts. The airplane was at all times operated by Culberson, the specifically named pilot of the referent Pilot Clause. Under similar circumstances, we have held that a pilot specifically named is clearly covered, even if flying in violation of the regulations. Fireman\u2019s Fund v. McDaniel, <em>supra. </em>In fact, our understanding of Exclusion Two brings our case almost four-square with <em>McDaniel. </em>In <em>McDaniel, </em>as here, the name of the pilot was specifically typed into the clause, along with an \u201cother pilots\u201d phrase similar to that in the Ranger policy. As here, the student pilot in <em>McDaniel </em>carried a passenger when he crashed. In spite of the fact that the company in <em>McDaniel </em>had included almost precisely the same two exclusions that Ranger omitted here, the district court held that the specifically-named student pilot had been insured to fly the aircraft for <em>any </em>purpose. We affirmed that part of the holding. Without further provision by Ranger, <em>McDaniel </em>controls on the issue of Ranger\u2019s Exclusion Two, and that exclusion does not bar cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>erage to the named insured under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">III. EXCLUSION THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The final policy provision that Ranger contends suspended Culberson\u2019s insurance coverage provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-7\">\u201cThis policy does not apply . to any insured . . . who operates or permits the aircraft to be operated in any manner which requires a special permit or waiver from the Federal Aviation Agency, whether granted or not, unless this Policy is specifically endorsed to include such operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Ranger argues that Culberson violated a regulation by carrying a passenger [14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.3(a)], that he did not obtain a waiver from the FAA for the act of carrying a passenger [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421], and that Ranger did not endorse the carrying of a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">We conclude that Exclusion Three does not apply to suspend coverage in this instance. Even if applicable to Mr. Cul-berson under <em>McDaniel, </em>the terms of Exclusion Three were met. The policy did not require a waiver by the FAA; it required only an endorsement of \u201csuch operation\u201d by the company. We have already concluded that Ranger is to be charged with knowledge that Culberson, at his application as well as at his death, was a student pilot and no more. We then note that passenger coverage is specifically \u201cm\u201d-cluded in the policy, the \u201cin\u201d having been typed into a blank space in the policy, in capital letters, by Ranger. For that \u201cin,\u201d Culberson paid an <em>additional </em>premium of $175 per year, almost 50% more than the premium without the passenger coverage. Ranger argues that the passenger proviso relates only to the \u201cother pilots\u201d that are mentioned in the typed portion of the Pilot Clause and not to Culberson himself. We find this quite an improbable construction. There is certainly nothing in the provision itself to indicate that the \u201cin\u201d-clusion goes to one part of a conjoined sentence and not to the other. Moreover, the fact that Culberson\u2019s name is specifically typed into the clause indicates to us that the passenger proviso, which falls on the same page and in close proximity of the Pilot Clause, was fully intended to apply to Culberson. This is another one of those occasions in which a construction seems compelled by the words. If Ranger intended to convey something less by checking this proviso and charging the additional premium, then that should have been clearly stated. By \u201cin\u201d-cluding the passenger coverage provision, Ranger specifically endorsed his \u201coperation\u201d of the aircraft with a passenger aboard for the purposes of Exclusion Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">In a sense broader than the three clauses we have discussed above, we feel that Ranger contracted for precisely the matrix of risks that eventually came to fruition. Compare Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Cordova, 9 Cir. 1960, 283 F.2d 659. Ranger insured a student pilot and \u201cin\u201d-cluded passenger coverage, omitting specific exclusions that might have foreclosed the entire issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">The clumps of words in an insurance policy might seem like so much insignificant jabberwocky to those who follow insurance law, perhaps worse to those who only stumble into the field. Jabberwocky it might be. Insignificant it is not. On those clumps of words rests the intent of the insurance coverage. Some insurance policies, their riders, exclusions, folds-in and folds-out, and appendages, are festooned in such ways that mechanical knowledge is a help in unfolding and laying them out so that the policies are in physically readable form. An insured, who is presented with forms and discussion in widely varying degrees of clarity, is entitled to know the precise nature of the insurance coverage that his premiums are buying. It is all too clear that contract language, while at times a great explainer, is at times a great obscurer. It is incumbent upon insurance companies to state clearly the perimeters of their coverage to those who entrust their security to them. Partly in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>hope that that clarity might eventually come to pass, this case is affirmed. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-5\">. Culberson dealt directly only with the Guy Hill Insurance Agency, Ranger\u2019s agent. Under Georgia law the insurer is estopped to deny any misconduct or negligence by its agents, and the company is deemed to have constructive knowledge of any facts of which the agent has actual knowledge. Stillson v. Prudential Ins. Co., 1947, 202 Ga. 79, 42 S.E. 2d 121; Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Ayers, 1961, 217 Ga. 206, 121 S.E.2d 649; National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Gools-by, 1955, 91 Ga.App. 361, 85 S.E.2d 611; Barber v. All American Assurance Co. of Louisiana, 1953, 89 Ga.App. 270, 79 S.E.2d 48. In addition, the burden under Georgia law is on the insurer to prove any facts regarding misrepresentation or fraud. Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Ayers, <em>supra; </em>Lamb v. Empire Life Ins. Co., 1954, 143 Ga. 180, 84 S.E. 439; O\u2019Connell v. Supreme Conclave Knights of Damon, 1943, 102 Ga. 143, 28 S.E. 282. At no point in the record is there any evidence whatsoever that Culber-son was less than candid in his representations to Guy Hill. Culberson\u2019s application to Ranger for insurance was signed <em>only </em>by Guy Hill, not by Culber-son himself, and we have no indication in the record that Culberson even saw that document. Compare Jessup v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., 1968, 117 Ga.App. 389, 160 S.E.2d 612; State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 1963, 107 Ga.App. 348, 130 S.E.2d 144. In the answer to an interrogatory and in an affidavit submitted by the vice-president of its underwriters, Ranger asserts that <em>it </em>did not have actual knowledge that Culberson was only a student pilot. This assertion, of course, does not answer in any way any of the factual or legal questions raised by the transaction that took place between Culber-son and Guy Hill. Under the circumstances of this case, with the exception of actual misrepresentation by Culberson, Ranger is charged with knowledge of whatever took place in Guy Hill\u2019s office, even if what took place was that, through the negligence of the agent, nothing at all was said regarding the status of Culber-son\u2019s license. Without Culberson\u2019s signature on the application to Ranger, the court below could only conclude that the information on the application came about through the negligence of the agent, the misconduct of the agent, or the misrepresentations of Culberson.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">On appeal and in its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment below, Ranger raised the inference that Culberson had misrepresented his level of flying expertise. This will not do. There is simply no scrap of direct evidence in the record that Culberson misrepresented himself <em>to Guy Hill, </em>which is the crucial question regarding insurance information. Moreover, any alleged fraud or misrepresentation between Culberson and Guy Hill must be raised in the pleadings, not by inference. If not so raised, the defense is waived. Fed.Rules Civ.Pro. 8 (c) ; Systems Inc. v. Bridge Electronics Co., 3 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 465. Ranger did not raise in the district court any question of misrepresentation by Culber-son to Guy Hill, a question clearly within Ranger\u2019s scope of information, and, therefore, the question of misrepresentation is not properly before us. In fact, we do not find in Ranger\u2019s evidence in support of its own motion for summary judgment any statement that Culberson was guilty of misrepresentation or fraud. In this case, Ranger, upon entering the arena erected for deciding cases on summary judgment, must abide its Marquis of Queenberry Rule which requires that a party submit facts, not hypotheses, of fraud or misrepresentation before it is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"adc-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Ranger\u2019s defense in the court below, as demonstrated by its pleadings, its affidavit in support of its own motion for summary judgment, Culberson\u2019s application for insurance, and its entire argument on appeal is addressed to policy construction; Ranger does not seek a remand for a trial. Without the misrepresentation issue Ranger must rely only on the written insurance policy to claim lack of coverage, construed under the presumption that Ranger, through its agent, fully intended that the policy read precisely as it was made out to Cul-berson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. \u201cA violation of this limitation <em>may </em>result in the REVOCATION FOR ONE YEAR of this certificate or any pilot certificate subsequently issued.\u201d [Emphasis added]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. Ranger\u2019s asserted construction might also be contrary to Georgia policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">\u201cNo policy of insurance issued or delivered in this State covering any loss, expense or liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an aircraft shall exclude or deny coverage because the aircraft is operated in violation of civil air regulations pursu-hnt to Federal, State or local laws or ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4f\">\u201cThis section does not prohibit the use of <em>specific </em>exclusions or conditions in any such policy which relates to any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-18\">(a) Certification of an aircraft in a stated category by the Federal Aviation Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-19\">(b) Certification of a pilot in a stated category by the Federal Aviation Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-20\">(c) Establishing requirements for pilot experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-21\">(d) Establishing limitations on the use of the aircraft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-22\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-2439.

The policy in <em>Lineas </em>did have a provision that excluded coverage in the event that the flight\u2019s purpose were one that required a special FAA permit (unless that purpose were endorsed by the company on the policy), or in the event that the flight were for an \u201cunlawful\u201d purpose. The former proviso is similar to Ranger\u2019s Exclusion Three, but the <em>Lineas </em>court did not construe that proviso. It rested its decision on the pilot clause and on the overall intent of the parties. See also Electron Machine v. American Mercury Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1961, 297 F.2d 212.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b930-4\">DYER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A9B\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">I respectfully dissent. The crucial issue in this appeal is whether \u201cThe Pilot Clause\u201d under the \u201cDeclarations\u201d in the policy issued by Ranger to Culberson means <em>exactly </em>what it says and says <em>exactly </em>what it means. The pilots\u2019s clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-6\">\u201cOnly the following pilot(s) will operate the aircraft while \u2018in flight\u2019 and while holding proper pilot certificate^) with appropriate ratings as required by the Federal Aviation Agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-7\">\n<em>W. A. Culberson or any other private or commercial pilot having a minimum of 200 total logged hours including at least 25 hours in retractable gear aircraft.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-8\">[The italicized portion was typewritten by Ranger; the balance was printed.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">The majority opinion introduces the unsupportable assumption \u201cthat Ranger fully intended to insure a student pilot.\u201d It then charges Ranger \u201cwith knowledge that Culberson, at his application as well as at his death, was a student pilot and no more.\u201d Finally, it flatly states that \u201cRanger insured a student pilot . . . .\u201d Upon this premise then the majority \u201cdoes not read the word \u2018proper\u2019 as requiring exact compliance with the face of the [pilot\u2019s] certificate.\u201d In fact, the majority requires <em>no </em>compliance with the pilot certificate which expressly forbade Culberson from carrying passengers. There is not one iota of evidence in the record to support the majority\u2019s assumption, charge or conclusion that Ranger knew that Culberson was a student pilot. On the contrary, the only information that Ranger had was that Culberson held a private pilot\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">The district court decided this case on cross motions for summary judgment. Before the court was the following: Ranger\u2019s answer to an interrogatory that the policy was based on an application which stated that Culberson, the named insured, was a private pilot, and the application submitted by an insurance agent which contained the name and address of Culberson and detailed information that was copied directly into the \u201cDeclarations\u201d of the policy, i. e., the policy period from August 1, 1967 to August 1, 1968, that the aircraft would be tied out at Fulton County Airport, the specific coverages and premium charges, a description of the aircraft, the purposes of use, and a loss payable clause to the mortgagee, Michigan National Bank, in the amount of $10,100. The application further contained pilot information showing that Culberson held a private pilot\u2019s certificate with a single engine rating with a total of 100 logged hours, 15 in retractable gear aircraft, and described other pilots who could operate the insured aircraft with a private license and 200 total logged hours, 25 in retractable gear. There was also the un-contradicted affidavit of Parks, Senior Vice President of the aviation managers of Ranger, in which he stated that \u201cRanger Insurance Company had no knowledge that Mr. Culberson had only a student pilot license, as it had been represented to the company that he held a private pilot license with a single engine rating.\u201d The district court also had before it the policy with the pilot clause limitations which tracked the information in the application, and a certified copy of Culberson\u2019s Student Pilot Certificate issued January 21, 1966, on which was marked in two places, \u201cPASSENGER CARRYING PROHIBITED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">I would have no hesitancy in joining with the majority had Ranger issued the policy as written with knowledge that Culberson was a student pilot. The insurer may knowingly undertake a risk although it involves pilot conduct that violates his certificate or FAA regulations. And an insurer may be bound if the typewritten portion of the pilot\u2019s clause names the insured \u201cas a person authorized to operate this aircraft in flight, without regard to his certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>tion or rating as a pilot\u201d even though the insured is a student pilot. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v. McDaniel, N.D.Miss.1960, 187 F.Supp. 614, aff\u2019d 5 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 926. But this is, of course, not this case. Furthermore, the form, omitted as inapplicable, excluding coverage when the aircraft was being operated by a student pilot not under the direct supervision of a FAA flight instructor, would, as the majority suggests, be of considerable moment to explain the intent of the parties, but only if Ranger was aware of Culberson\u2019s student pilot certificate. If Ranger knew this, then the omission of the exclusion would have been compelling evidence of Ranger\u2019s intent to insure Culberson, notwithstanding he held only a student pilot certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">It bears repeating that Ranger did not know and was not charged with any knowledge that Culberson held a student pilot\u2019s certificate. In the face of a record showing only that Ranger's information was that Culberson held a private pilot\u2019s certificate, the failure of Ranger to cheek the omitted exclusion cannot provide this court with the basis for an <em>assumption </em>\u201cthat Ranger fully intended to insure a student pilot.\u201d Quite the contrary is true, for if Culber-son had held a private pilot certificate as Ranger thought he did, the student pilot exclusion would have been inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The majority seems to take the position that the information furnished Ranger that Culberson was a private pilot cannot be considered because Ranger did not plead fraud and misrepresentation, nor was this issue considered by the court below. As we have shown, the application for insurance, the uneon-tradicted affidavit, and the answer to interrogatory were before the district court in support of Ranger\u2019s motion for summary judgment. They were not submitted for the purpose of showing fraud but for the evidentiary purpose of showing that the policy was written in conformity with the information Ranger possessed. This makes F.R.Civ.P. 8(c) inapposite. The crucial issue of whether this information was properly raised in the district court and hence properly before us cannot be glossed over in a footnote as the majority attempts to do. If Culberson had held a private pilot\u2019s certificate, as was Ranger\u2019s information, \u201cLiability Including Passengers\u201d would have been an appropriate coverage; Exclusion No. 3, covering student pilots, would have been inapplicable and the words \u201cwith appropriate ratings\u201d in the pilot clause would have had significance, in contrast to the fact that \u201cratings\u201d of any sort are not given to student pilots.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But if Culberson was going to fly in violation of his FAA certificate and thereby increase the risk for passengers covered, Ranger should have been made aware of it and given an opportunity to decline the risk. In my view, Ranger was entitled to rely on the information furnished to it and the district court should not have ignored it.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">But assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Ranger had no information concerning what type of certificate Culberson held, it was, of course, entitled to limit the coverage of the policy in any manner it desired. The limitations of coverage in the policy are perfectly clear and Culberson was bound by them. He knew that his student pilot certificate prohibited him from carrying passengers any time, any where. He knew that the \u201cIncluding Passengers\u201d provision would only be applicable when either a private or commercial pilot certificate holder, as specified in his policy, was flying the aircraft with passengers. He knew that his policy required him to have a proper pilot certificate. This could only mean that he was within the policy coverage if he flew the aircraft alone and that there would be no coverage while passengers were aboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Equating the word <em>proper, </em>as used in the insurance policy, with the word <em>effective, </em>which is not used in the policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>is, I deferentially suggest, an unwarranted exercise in semantics by the majority. We have repeatedly stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahr-dedup-0\">* * * our function is not to write insurance contracts. We are not underwriters. We must apply them as written by the parties * * * even though the result compelled by the plain words used may appear or be thought to appear to be unreasonable, unduly harsh, or stringent. We cannot ignore them. We cannot substitute others for them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Canal Insurance Company v. Dougherty, 5 Cir. 1957, 247 F.2d 508, 512. Of course, Culberson\u2019s student pilot certificate was effective until it was suspended, surrendered or revoked, but it was, nonetheless, an improper certificate when used by a student pilot to carry passengers. That the FAA did not revoke Culberson\u2019s certificate after his death seems wholly immaterial. Neither Halls\u2019 Aero Spraying, Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyds London, 5 Cir. 1960, 274 F.2d 527, nor Roach v. Churchman, 8 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 849, are to the contrary. In <em>Hall\u2019s </em>the aircraft crashed while crop dusting without a state permit. This activity was not within the exclusion prohibiting the operation of an aircraft \u201cfor any unlawful purpose.\u201d In <em>Roach </em>the court found that \u201cthe pilot\u2019s act * * * did not violate any <em>express </em>term of his pilot\u2019s certificate.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">We are not concerned, as the majority suggests, with an attempt to \u201choodwink\u201d the insurance purchaser by nullifying coverage for simple negligence, careless flying or some other violation of the regulations. The word \u201cproper\u201d refers solely to and modifies \u201cpilot certificate\u201d and clearly has nothing to do with avoiding liability for tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Whether we accept the fact that Ranger was informed that Culberson held a private pilot\u2019s certificate, or whether Ranger was without knowledge that Cul-berson held only a student\u2019s pilot certificate, the policy as written and accepted by Culberson insured him while he was flying the aircraft without passengers (even though the insurer might not have agreed to this coverage had it known that it was insuring a student pilot, <em>McDaniel, </em>supra); but coverage was suspended during the time that Cul-berson was operating the aircraft with a passenger because this was expressly prohibited by his certificate. Lineas Aereas Columbiana Expresas v. Travelers Fire Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1958, 257 F.2d 150. In <em>Lineas </em>Judge Brown made it clear that \u201cunderwriting is the business of estimating risks.\u201d In doing so may not an insurer have properly taken into account that a student pilot is less qualified than one who has obtained a private pilot\u2019s certificate; that one holding a private pilot\u2019s certificate is authorized to carry passengers while a student pilot is forbidden to do so; and finally that covering a pilot in flight while he was doing what was expressly forbidden by his certificate would expose the insurers to almost incalculable risks ?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">It is just such considerations that have led to the development of the principle * * * of suspension of coverage. It is, of course, true that development of the law along these lines has come from the desire to avoid an outright forfeiture. Consequently coverage is not permanently destroyed. It is suspended as long as, but only so long as the violations of the specified basic policy requirements continue. Equally clear, coverage is revived the moment the breaches or conditions cease. But until that time, there is no insurance for while the proscribed activity continues, the insurance is suspended as if it had never been in force. Travelers Protective Association of America v. Prinscen, 291 U.S. 576, 582, 54 S.Ct. 502, 504, 78 L.Ed. 999, 1003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-10\"><em>Lineas, supra </em>at 155. <em>See also </em>Electron Machine Corp. v. American Mercury Insurance Co., 5 Cir. 1961, 297 F.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">The factual distinction that the majority makes between <em>Lineas </em>and the case <em>sub judice, i. e., </em>that in <em>Lineas </em>the Mexican pilots were entirely outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>those specified in the pilot\u2019s clause, while here Culberson was authorized to fly the aircraft, continues to disregard the fact that from the time a passenger came aboard Culberson was also entirely outside the specie of pilot specified in the pilot\u2019s clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In this diversity case, as the majority points out, Georgia law is controlling. In Grigsby v. Houston Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., 1966, 113 Ga.App. 572, 148 S.E. 2d 925, the Georgia Court of Appeals cited <em>Lineas </em>with approval and held that a pilot clause almost identical to the one in issue here was \u201ca valid and binding one.\u201d Although there was no coverage due to a violation of a regulation pertaining to pilot certificates under an exclusionary clause in <em>Grigsby, </em>the court also relied upon the conditions of the pilot clause. Obviously, the court would not have discussed the pilot clause except for the fact that its violation also suspended coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The district court and the majority seem unwilling to give effect to the sound precedent established by this court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">The hazards against which a company is to insure are usually in the category of its business and the courts will not undertake to review its judgment or to hold it to the coverage of risks which it has expressly excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"><em>Electron, supra </em>at 214 of 297 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">I would reverse the judgment of the district court with directions to enter judgment in favor of Ranger.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-10\">.
