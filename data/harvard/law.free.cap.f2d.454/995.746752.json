(Company), to dismiss a petition for enforcement filed by the National Labor Relations Board (Board).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue before us is whether this Court is the proper forum for entertainment of the Board\u2019s petition. After careful consideration, of the contentions of the Company and of the Board, we conclude that it is not and, accordingly, order the petition transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-19\">In 1965 the Textile Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO (Union), filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the Company had engaged in unfair labor practices under Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board issued a complaint through its general counsel and conducted hearings in June and July of 1966. On September 22, 1966, the trial examiner issued his decision finding that the Company had engaged in and was engaging in unfair labor practices and recommending that it cease and desist therefrom and take certain affirmative action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board then issued its decision and order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>on October 21, 1968, finding that the Company had not committed the alleged unfair labor practices and dismissing the Union\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Union timely filed a Petition For Review in this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequent to the filing of the Union\u2019s petition, the Supreme Court decided a related case, N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the parties filed supplemental briefs relating <em>Gissel </em>to the instant case. This court concluded that the Board was the appropriate forum to initially consider the effect of the opinion in <em>Gissel </em>upon its prior decision; therefore, we remanded the case to the Board stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\">We think the matter of sufficient importance to warrant further consideration by the Board in the first instance in the light of <em>Gissel, </em>but without limitation; and we remand the case for that purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">On remand the Board reversed its earlier decision and on August 27, 1970, issued a supplemental decision and order concluding that the Company had violated Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On September 21, 1970 the Board filed in this court a petition for enforcement of this order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Company then filed a motion to dismiss this petition alleging that this court lacked jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s request<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for enforcement under Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">In the National Labor Relations Act Congress provided a bifurcated scheme for judicial consideration of orders of the N.L.R.B. Section 10(f) allows any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board to seek review in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the circuit wherein the unfair labor practice allegedly occurred or the person seeking review resides or transacts business.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 10(e), in contrast provides authority for the Board to petition for enforcement only in the United States Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \u201cunfair labor practice in question occurred or wherein such person resides or transacts business.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">The alleged unfair labor practice in the instant case did not occur in the District of Columbia, and the Company does not reside or conduct any business in the District. Ordinarily, any inquiry into whether the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement was properly filed here would end at this juncture since Section 10(e) clearly states that this court is not the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\"> However, the Board contends that since its <em>Supplemental Decision and Order </em>proceeded from this court\u2019s remand order in Textile Workers Union of America v. National Labor Relations Board, <em>supra, </em>this court is the appropriate body to consider the Petition for Enforcement. Although the Board\u2019s argument may have practical force, we are limited by the prior actions of this court and by the statutory language of the National Labor Relations Act. In the decision of the panel in <em>Textile Workers, supra, </em>the court explicitly <em>remanded the case </em>to the National Labor Relations Board. This court has long used such \u201cboilerplate\u201d language to indicate its intention to relinquish jurisdiction over the particular controversy. Whenever our intention had been to remand but to retain jurisdiction, we have included an explicit statement indicating the retention of jurisdiction in this court. For example, we have specifically stated in such cases that only the record, rather than the case, is remanded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, upon remand to the N.L.R.B. in <em>Textile Workers, supra, </em>this court divested itself of jurisdiction over the instant controversy, and jurisdiction passed from this court to the N.L.R.B.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, any subsequent petition for enforcement must be considered as a new proceeding which the respondent ordinarily has the right to. require be brought in a forum designated by Section 10(e). Since it is undisputed that venue is proper in the Second Circuit, the clerk of the court shall certify the entries upon the docket with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>this application for enforcement and shall physically transmit and transfer such certificate, together with the applications filed herein, and all papers and documents now on file with the Clerk of this Court in the proceedings to the Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">.

See note 5, <em>supra, </em>for the complete text of Section 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act. Judicial decisions have made clear that all intermediate federal courts have jurisdiction to review and enforce orders of the NLRB and that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e), (f), in designating particular forums for given cases, are concerned only with venue. <em>See </em>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, 324 U.S. 635, 65 S.Ct. 821, 89 L.Ed. 1241 (1945) ; Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, 343 F.2d 905 (8th Cir. 1965); Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v.

While the instant motion was pending before this Court, the Board moved to have the case remanded to it for reconsideration in light of its decision in Linden Lumber Division, Summer &amp; Co., 190 N.L.R.B. No. 116, 77 L.R.R.M. 1305 (June 7, 1971). Whether such a motion should be granted rests in the sound discretion of the court. Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 364, 369-370, 59 S.Ct. 301, 83 L.Ed. 221 (1939). Since a long period has already elapsed since the alleged unfair labor practice occurred, since a purely legal issue separates this case from <em>Linden Lumber, supra, </em>and since this case has already been remanded to the Board once for a purpose similar to the one for which the Board now requests another remand, we have serious doubts whether the Board\u2019s request should be granted. However, since the Second Circuit will be faced with the task of reviewing this case on the merits, we conclude that its views on the propriety of a further remand should control. Accordingly, we shall transfer to that Circuit the Board\u2019s motion for a remand along with the other papers and documents in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
