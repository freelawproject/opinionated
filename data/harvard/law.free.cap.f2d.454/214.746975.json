STATE OF OREGON, H. C. Cupp, Warden, Respondent-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"ARC\">No. 71-1596.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b276-7\">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b276-8\">Dec. 22, 1971.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b276-9\">Rehearing Denied Jan. 21, 1972.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-16\">John A.

And, when they found the gun, it was not required to be ignored legally.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-23\">Roderick\u2019s lineup is challenged. Although counsel was not present, Wade v. United States, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, is not retroactive. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199. Assuming counsel had been present, it is not clear that there was anything bad about the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-24\">We find the points about unreasonable delay and cruel and unusual punishment to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
