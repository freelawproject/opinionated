On August 5, 1966, he was dismissed for insubordination to the Superintendent-Medical Director of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His dismissal was subsequently sustained by the Civil Service Commission of the State of New Jersey and the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. Petitioner then filed a complaint in the United States District Court, alleging that his dismissal violated his constitutional rights. Judge Cool-ahan of the District Court dismissed his complaint, by an order dated Setpember 28, 1970, for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Petitioner now alleges a wide variety of injustices,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the thrust of his complaint is that the discharge violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Because he is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we construe his complaint in the way most favorable to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nonetheless, after resolving all ambiguities in favor of Mr. Carr, we find that his claims lack factual support. His due process claim fails because shortcomings, if any, of his hearing before the Hospital Board were remedied by the hearing <em>de novo </em>before the New Jersey Civil Service Commission <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and review by that State\u2019s Appellate Division.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petitioner was represented by retained counsel on both occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The civil right allegations are unsupported by any substantial facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The conclusory complaint was properly dismissed by the District Court for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.

Hohn, 379 F.2d 213 (3d Cir. 1967); United States ex rel. Hoge v. Bolsinger, 311 F.2d 215 (3d Cir. 1962), F.R.Civ.P. 8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">. The dismissal followed a hearing at the Hospital, at which Mr. Carr was found to have been insubordinate to the Superintendent-Director and to have used offensive language in the presence of patients. The Civil Service Commission, upon reviewing the Hospital\u2019s decision pursuant to N.J.S.A. 11:15-4 et seq. rejected the claim that petitioner used offensive language, but upheld the remaining charge of insubordination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\">. Among these are allegations that his adversary\u2019s lawyer violated Canon 3 of the Canons of Professional Ethics by having a private conference with the Presiding Judge of the New Jersey State Appellate panel which sat in this ease. When asked to substantiate the claim at the argument before this Court, petitioner explained that he was referring to a telephone call the Judge made to Mr. Carr\u2019s attorney asking him to call his adversary\u2019s attorney to encourage him to submit his brief promptly. This phone call neither supports the initial factual allegations nor in any way constitutes a violation of the Canons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">.

Occidental Life Insurance Company of California, 387 F.2d 935 (3d Cir. 1968) cert. den. 391 U.S. 926, 88 S.Ct. 1825, 20 L.Ed.2d 665 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\">. After hearing the testimony of Mr. Carr, his three witnesses, and the four witnesses produced by the defendants, the Commission found (1) that Mr. Carr had been \u201cinsubordinate\u201d to the Superintendent-Medical Director \u201cwhen he refused to comply with clear and appropriate instructions\u201d to him and (2) that his refusal \u201cendangered the health and welfare of an acutely ill patient.\u201d From these facts, the Commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">\u201cMr. Carr\u2019s conduct amply justified his dismissal. No hospital, charged with the health and welfare of its patients, can tolerate the insubordinate acts of a technician who challenges the judgment of one of the hospital\u2019s leading physicians. The technician and nurse have a very significant role in the hospital\u2019s operation. But the expertise of the medical doctor cannot be defied without endangering the life of the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-15\">\u201cIt is the further conclusion of this Hearer from observation of Mr. Carr that he remains convinced to this date that his conduct was proper. And if given the opportunity, he would repeat his defiant conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">The Commission affirmed the Hospital\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Carr.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\">.
