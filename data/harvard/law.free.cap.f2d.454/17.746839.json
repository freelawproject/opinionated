(the Company). 170 N.L.R.B. 1234 (1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******The Board issued an order which, in part, required Local 485 to take -the grievance to arbitration, if necessary, but the Board did not seek enforcement of that order. In June 1970, the Board found that the Local had failed to comply with the original order and issued a supplemental order which, with one member dissenting, required the Local to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">Make Opreas Barclay whole for any loss of earnings he may have suffered as a result of his discharge . from the date Barclay requested the Union to challenge the propriety of that discharge . . . until such time as the Union fulfills its obligation to Barclay of fair representation, or Barclay obtains substantially equivalent employment, whichever is sooner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">183 N.L.R.B. No. 131 (1970). In a petition filed in February 1971, the Board seeks enforcement of both these orders. We enforce the original order, but decline to enforce the supplemental order for reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The parties agree on some of the facts in this bitterly contested case. On August 16, 1965, Barclay was summarily discharged from his job as a grinder and polisher in the Company. The discharge was based on Barclay\u2019s alleged insubordination when he refused a temporary transfer to another job. At that time, Barclay had been in the Company\u2019s employ for over seven years and was the most senior worker in the shop. Although a written grievance was immediately filed on Barclay\u2019s behalf by the Shop Committee, Local 485 did not take Barclay\u2019s grievance to arbitration, as it had a right to do under its collective bargaining agreement. Shortly before Barclay\u2019s discharge, there had been a volatile dispute in the plant over compulsory overtime. The Company, apparently dissatisfied with the lack of sufficient volunteers to meet its overtime needs, posted a notice purportedly requiring some employees to work a 56-hour week rather than the 40-hour week provided in the contract. That same day, the Shop Committee chairman, Rupert Campbell, called Wallace Eisenberg, the Local\u2019s business manager, to complain about the Company\u2019s action and a meeting between Eisenberg and the men was held. The meeting was, in modern jargon, an exercise in participatory democracy ; positions on both sides of the overtime issue were taken with conviction and in colorful language, to say the least. Eisenberg was criticized severely for asserting that the Company had the right to demand overtime if the voluntary arrangements were inadequate. One of his most vocal critics was Opreas Barclay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">The remaining factual issues were hotly disputed and the evidence \u2014 primarily testimonial \u2014 conflicts markedly in critical respects. The trial examiner found that Eisenberg threatened to \u201cget rid of\u201d Barclay \u201cin [my] own way\u201d following the union meeting, and that when Barclay was fired soon thereafter for the alleged insubordination, Eisenberg when so advised said \u201che\u2019s the instigator, isn\u2019t he.\u201d The examiner also found that Eisenberg failed to discuss the discharge with Company representatives, although during this period he did successfully take up another discharge ease with the Company. Generally diseredit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ing the Local\u2019s witnesses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the examiner concluded that the Local\u2019s decision not to take Barclay\u2019s grievance to arbitration, which as a practical matter was under Eisenberg\u2019s control as business manager, was motivated by Eisenberg\u2019s hostility toward Barclay.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The Board adopted the trial examiner\u2019s findings, with some modifications. The Board did not rely on one of the examiner\u2019s findings that Barclay was a pawn in a feud between Eisenberg and the Shop Committee, but rather found an adequate basis for a section 8(b) (1) (A) violation in Eisenberg\u2019s threatening response to Barclay\u2019s criticism and in Eisenberg\u2019s failure to discuss Barclay\u2019s discharge with Company representatives. The Board concluded (170 N.L.R.B. at 1234):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">Since Barclay\u2019s conduct at the union meeting constituted activity protected under Section 7 of the Act [29 U.S. C. \u00a7 157], the Union\u2019s retaliation through Eisenberg\u2019s failure to process Barclay\u2019s grievance, was violative of Section 8(b) (1) (A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Local 485 argues at length that there is no substantial evidence to support the factual determinations of the Board and its trial examiner and that the credibility findings are \u201c[e]ven more egregious.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have examined the record with care, and although we might not have reached the same conclusion as the Board did had the matter come before us <em>de novo, </em>we find the Board\u2019s \u201cchoice between two fairly conflicting views\u201d to be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). See NLRB v. Marsellus Vault &amp; Sales, Inc., 431 F.2d 933, 937 (2d Cir. 1970); Bedding, Curtain &amp; Drapery Workers Union, Local 140 v. NLRB, 390 F.2d 495, 500 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 392 U.S. 905, 88 S.Ct. 2056, 20 L.Ed.2d 1363 (1968). Because resolution of the factual issues in this case turns mainly on credibility, we have necessarily relied in great measure on the trial examiner\u2019s credibility findings, particularly on the key issues whether Eisenberg threatened Barclay with retaliation and whether the Local took the trouble even to discuss Barclay\u2019s case with management at a meeting in August. See note 3 <em>supra. </em>To the extent the credibility findings are buttressed by documentary evidence, they do not appear unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the extent demeanor was influential, the testimony ultimately credited was not \u201chopelessly incredible.\u201d NLRB v. Warrensburg Board &amp; Paper Corp., 340 F.2d 920, 922 (2d Cir. 1965), quoting NLRB v. Dinion Coil Co., 201 F.2d 484, 490 (2d Cir. 1952). This, then, is the common situation of a case that could have gone either way on the facts. Its only unusual aspect is that the full scale attack on the Board as \u201csloppy and most inept\u201d in its investigations and on the examiner as \u201cone-sided\u201d and hostile comes from a union rather than from an employer. Nonetheless, applying the normal standard of review, we conclude that we are required to affirm the Board\u2019s findings. Moreover, we do not believe that the Local was denied a fair hearing, as it claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Board found that Barclay\u2019s criticism of the Local\u2019s position on the overtime issue was protected activity under section 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, and that the Local\u2019s refusal to process his wrongful discharge grievance because of the criticism was an attempt to \u201crestrain or coerce . . . employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in section [7]. . . .\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (1) (A). We agree with the Board\u2019s conclusion that this was an unfair labor practice, see NLRB v. Teamsters Local 282, 412 F.2d 334 (2d Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 396 U.S. 1038, 90 S.Ct. 682, 24 L.Ed.2d 682 (1970).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The more difficult issues arise out of the remedy proposed by the Board \u2014 a full back pay order enforceable against the Local.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The problem of protecting an individual employee against arbitrary collective bargaining decisions of his union without destroying the union\u2019s effectiveness as a bargaining agent is not an easy one. When an employee claims, as Barclay does here, that a company violated a collective bargaining agreement and that his union thereafter failed to represent him properly in pressing his grievance, the rights of the employee, the union and the company are all intertwined. Moreover, there are three possible tribunals to resolve aspects of the dispute \u2014 a court, the Board or an arbitration panel \u2014 each having practical and legal limitations on its power. Under the developing law, Barclay had a number of choices open to him. He could have brought a lawsuit against his employer directly \u201cunder \u00a7 301 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185] for breach of a promise embedded in the collective bargaining agreement that was intended to confer a benefit upon the individual.\u201d Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Electric Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees of America v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 298-299, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 1924, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971). Or Barclay could have sued the Local alone for breach of its duty of fair representation. Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). Or he could have joined the Company and the Local in a suit against both, although the essence of the claim against each would differ. See Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed. 2d 370 (1964); Steinman v. Spector Freight System, Inc., 441 F.2d 599 (2d Cir. 1971). Such actions may be brought notwithstanding otherwise enforceable limitations on employee remedies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Vaca v. Sipes, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 185-186, 195-198, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842. See also Professor Lewis\u2019s perceptive article, Fair Representation in Grievance Administration: Vaca v. Sipes, 1967 Sup.Ct.Rev. 81, 87-88 (1967). In short, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s continuing concern over maintaining the Board\u2019s exclusive powers in this delicate area of labor relations, see <em>Lockridge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 285-291, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 29 L.Ed.2d 473, it is now firmly established that Barclay could have gone directly to court rather than to the Board in order to obtain relief. He chose, however, to seek the Board\u2019s help, and we do not mean to suggest that doing so was either impermissible or unwise. The Board had ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>risdiction over Barclay\u2019s claim that the Local\u2019s failure to represent him was an unfair labor practice, see note 6 <em>supra, </em>and a case can be made that the Board is the preferable tribunal. See H. Wellington, Labor and the Legal Process 180-84 (1968). In any event, Barclay did what he had a right to do, and the central issue before us is the permissible scope of the Board\u2019s remedial powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Board\u2019s initial order in this case required the Local to cease and desist from violating section 8(b) (1) (A), to post certain notices and to take Barclay\u2019s grievance to arbitration if necessary. This order was well within the Board\u2019s power and we will enforce it in its entirety. In doing so, we note explicitly that if a section 301 suit against the employer is required in order to obtain arbitration, as the record indicates is probable, it will be deemed necessary for the purpose of complying with the order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">There are great difficulties, however, with the supplemental order which holds the Local liable for all the back pay due Barclay. To be sure, the Board has broad discretion in fashioning back pay remedies. See NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 348, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1954); NLRB v. United Marine Div. Local 333, NMU, 417 F.2d 865, 867-868 (2d Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 1008, 90 S.Ct. 1237, 25 L.Ed.2d 421 (1970). But it appears that in the present situation the Board\u2019s discretion has been sharply limited by the explicit language of Vaca v. Sipes, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 196-198, 87 S. Ct. at 920, 17 L.Ed.2d 842:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">A more difficult question is, what portion of the employee\u2019s damages may be charged to the union: in particular, may an award against a union include, as it did here, damages attributable solely to the employer\u2019s breach of contract? We think not. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALa\">The governing principle, then, is to apportion liability between the employer and the union according to the damage caused by the fault of each. Thus, damages attributable solely to the employer\u2019s breach of contract should not be charged to the union, but increases if any in those damages caused by the union\u2019s refusal to process the grievance should not be charged to the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">See also Czosek v. O\u2019Mara, 397 U.S. 25, 29, 90 S.Ct. 770, 25 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970). Although the Court in <em>Vaca </em>focused on a union\u2019s potential liability in a section 301 suit for breach of its duty of fair representation, the Court\u2019s direction would apply with equal force in Board proceedings against a union under section 8(b) (1) (A), particularly since the Board\u2019s powers have long been characterized as remedial rather than punitive. See Carpenters Local 60 v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 651, 81 S.Ct. 875, 6 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961); Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 61 S.Ct. 77, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940); Jaffe, The Judicial Enforcement of Administrative Orders, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 865, 875 (1963). It may be said, however, that <em>Vaca </em>does not prevent a court (and therefore the Board) from apportioning liability and that back pay in this case \u2014 except for the portion accruing during the relatively short time it would have taken to hold an arbitration \u2014 would properly be considered \u201cdamage caused by the fault\u201d of the union. Although there is language in <em>Vaca </em>indicating that the bulk of the back pay should not properly be attrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>uted to the Local,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> later expression of the rule in Czosek<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> leaves us less certain.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, whatever the proper rule may be for apportionment, since the Board\u2019s order holds the Local liable for all the back pay due Barclay, it is improper under <em>Vaca, </em>and for reasons indicated below we leave any apportionment problems to another time.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Apart from the language in <em>Vaca, </em>there is another fundamental difficulty with the supplemental order. No tribunal \u2014 neither court, arbitration panel nor the Board \u2014 has decided that Barclay was discharged in violation of the collective bargaining agreement. Although the trial examiner found that Barclay was \u201cunlawfully discharged,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Board concluded only that the discharge \u201cwas open to serious, unresolved question, and . . . [that] the Employer plainly disregarded clear cut provisions of its contract. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this court, the Board argues that Barclay had a persuasive grievance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Local answers that Barclay was insubordinate in refusing to accept a transfer and did not follow \u201cthe principle of \u2018obey now, grieve later\u2019.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We express, no opinion on the issue. The point is that if Barclay\u2019s discharge was valid, neither the Local nor the Company would be liable for any back pay. Until some tribunal determines the validity of the discharge, any assessment of back pay might well be regarded as speculative and punitive. See <em>Jaffe, swpra </em>at 875. Even if the Board had ruled upon the validity of the discharge, the issue would remain whether its order is an attempt to remedy the Company\u2019s breach of contract and therefore beyond the Board\u2019s power.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There is at least a substantial question whether the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ing of NLRB v. C &amp; C Plywood, 385 U. S. 421, 87 S.Ct. 559, 17 L.Ed.2d 486 (1967), and NLRB v. Acme Industrial Co., 385 U.S. 432, 87 S.Ct. 565, 17 L.Ed. 2d 495 (1967), applies where the Board seeks to \u201cinterpret and give effect to the terms of a collective bargaining contract\u201d only for the purpose of invoking a back pay remedy. See NLRB v. Strong, 393 U.S. 357, 361, 89 S.Ct. 541, 21 L. Ed.2d 546 (1967); cf. NLRB v. Huttig Sash &amp; Door Co., 377 F.2d 964, 969-970 (8th Cir. 1967) (Blackmun, J.); NLRB v. George E. Light Boat Storage, Inc., 373 F.2d 762, 768-769 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Because the Board\u2019s supplemental order in its present form is improper and because enforcement of its first order may be sufficient to remedy the unfair labor practice, we decline to enforce the supplemental order. We realize that because of the Local\u2019s inaction, a section 301 suit to compel arbitration may be barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But we are not sure that the applicable statute has run, see Abrams v. Carrier Corp., 434 F.2d 1234, 1251-1253 n. 15 (2d Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 401 U.S. 1009, 91 S.Ct. 1253, 28 L.Ed.2d 545 (1971) or that countervailing federal interests may not have tolled it. Cf. Atkins v. Schmutz Mfg. Co., 435 F.2d 527 (4th Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 402 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 1526, 28 L.Ed.2d 867 (1971), noted in 71 Colum.L.Rev. 865, 875-880 (1971); <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 92 n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In any event, we think it premature to deal with these and other major problems discussed above, some of which have not been fully briefed or argued by the parties. Should there be an arbitration, a decision for the Company would end the matter and the policies of the National Labor Relations Act would have been carried out. The presumably disinterested tribunal selected in the union contract would have reviewed Barclay\u2019s discharge on the merits, and he is entitled to no more. On the other hand, a decision for Barclay would raise such issues for the arbitrator as whether Barclay is entitled to reinstatement with back pay, what the period for back pay should be<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and whether the Company should bear all of that liability. Should the arbitrator find the Company liable for only part of the back pay period, the Board might then wish to amend its supplemental order and seek to hold the Local liable for all or part of the rest. Although we do not hold that the Board has power to do so, its position would be stronger than it is now, since by hypothesis the arbitrator would already have found that the discharge was improper and might have clarified what a proper \u201capportionment\u201d of back pay liability would be under <em>Vaca.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The Board\u2019s original order of April 9, 1968 is enforced. Enforcement of the supplemental order of June 29, 1970 is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\">. Barclay filed the charges in December 1965. The complaint was issued in May 1966, and amended that August. The trial examiner held hearings in December 1966 and issued a report in June 1967. The complaint, as amended, did not allege an unfair labor practice against the Company, and the Company was not a party to these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-21\">.

The collective testimony of Eisenberg, Anthony Nicora, the Local\u2019s business agent, and Stuart Sobel, Company treasurer, was to the effect that no threats were made concerning Barclay, that Barclay\u2019s grievance was discussed at a meeting with the Company in August, and that the decision not to demand arbitration was based on a good faith evaluation of the chances for success and the desirability of withdrawing Barclay\u2019s griev-anee to get favorable action from the Company on another grievance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b82-12\">.

For example, in a letter to Barclay dated August 31, 1965, Eisenberg recounted the Local\u2019s efforts on Barclay\u2019s behalf but did not mention an August meeting with management.

Since the Local\u2019s action was calculated retaliation against Barclay for exercise of a right clearly protected by section 7 of the Act (the right to criticize union leadership), we are not forced to reconsider this court\u2019s controversial disposition of the Board\u2019s broader theory in Miranda Fuel Co., 140 N.L.R.B. 181 (1962), enforcement denied, 326 F.2d 172 (2d Cir. 1963), that any arbitrary or invidious action which violates a union\u2019s duty of fair representation is prohibited by section 8(b) (1) (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b83-14\">.

Spector Freight System, Ino., 441 F.2d 599, 601 (2d Cir. 1971). But the Board has not so ordered and, accordingly, we will be forced to deal with any inadequate representation claims in the context of contempt proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">In the concurring opinion of Justice Por-tas, joined in by Chief Justice Warren and Justice Harlan, 386 U.S. at 201, 87 S.Ct. at 922, 17 L.Ed.2d 842:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">The Court holds \u2014 and I think correctly if the issue is to be reached \u2014 that the union could not be required to pay damages measured by the breach of the employment contract, because it was not the union but the employer that breached the contract.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b85-13\">. 397 U.S. at 29, 90 S.Ct. at 773, 25 L.Ed.2d 21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">Assuming a wrongful discharge by the employer independent of any discriminatory conduct by the union and a subsequent discriminatory refusal by the union to process grievances based on the discharge, damages against the union for loss of employment are unrecoverable except to the extent that its refusal to handle the grievances added to the difficulty and expense of collecting from the employer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b85-19\">.
