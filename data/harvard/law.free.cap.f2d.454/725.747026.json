After a formal hearing, at which appellant\u2019s retained counsel conceded that the Court had the authority to require such samples of handwriting under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), the Trial Court entered an order requiring the appellant to give the handwriting samples. No objection was raised on the trial to the introduction of the handwriting samples in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">Appellant now claims that the requirement that he give samples of his handwriting violated his Constitutional Rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. On the record in this case the Court finds no merit in this or any other claim of error sought to be presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
