The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (a) (1); this court\u2019s jurisdiction on appeal is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-13\">In the court below the action for the recovery of gift taxes was consolidated for trial with taxpayer\u2019s related action for the recovery of income taxes paid. The district court entered judgment dismissing the taxpayer\u2019s cause of action in the income tax case and the taxpayer does not appeal from that judgment. The court also denied taxpayer's claim for refund of the gift tax assessed with the exception of the sum of $1,024.87 awarded to taxpayer by reason of the agreed devaluation of certain real estate. The court\u2019s opinion in ruling on the claim for gift tax refund is set out in Monroe v. United States, 301 F.Supp. 762 (E.D. Wash.1969). We adopt Chief Judge Charles L. Powell\u2019s opinion in that case as our own, and deny the refund except as noted by the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
