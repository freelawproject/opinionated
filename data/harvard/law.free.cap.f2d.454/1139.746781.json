Foley, Chief Judge, dismissing Williams\u2019s self-styled \u201cmotion for a writ of injunction\u201d under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In his letter-motion, or, more accurately, in his complaint, which apparently was mailed to the district court in June 1969, Williams alleged that he was \u00ablocked in his cell as punishment for possessing another .inmate\u2019s plea and sentencing minutes, and requested that the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-25\">issue an order of injunction, restraining the respondents from subjecting the petitioner to any further abuse and lockups for assisting other inmates in Auburn State Prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-26\">Treating Williams\u2019s complaint as a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>Chief Judge Foley ordered its dismissal in July 1969, for failure to exhaust state remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Putting to one side the question whether Chief Judge Foley\u2019s characterization of Williams\u2019s request for relief was not improper under the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>preme Court\u2019s decision in Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971), and this court\u2019s recent disposition of three state prisoner cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm the dismissal on the ground that the complaint does not adequately demonstrate a basis for granting the equitable relief sought. Williams seeks a broad injunction against \u201cfurther abuse and lockups\u201d but has failed to indicate that his lockup was other than \u201ca single or short-lived incident.\u201d Inmates of the Attica Correctional Facility v. Rockefeller, 453 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1971). We are told that Williams was locked up for only two days. In addition, although the complaint alludes to a statement by a deputy warden that possession of the papers was a violation of prison rules, nowhere does the complaint suggest what these rules are, whether they require that permission be obtained in order to get such legal papers, whether such permission, if necessary, was requested, or in what respects the rules are unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">To be sure, we do not mean to suggest that pro <em>se </em>plaintiffs in civil rights actions must conform their allegations to Chitty\u2019s pleading rules. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S.-, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per <em>cur-iam). </em>But particularly where a prisoner-plaintiff seeks to invoke federal equity powers to undertake a continuing supervision of the administration of disciplinary rules by state prison authorities, some measure of precision is indispensable. -It is simply not present here. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1201-18\">. The judge\u2019s Memorandum-Decision and Order is unpublished. In the district court the caption \u201cUnited States ex rel. Williams v. McMann\u201d was used, and Williams was denominated \u201cPetitioner.\u201d We have altered these terms for reasons that will be obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">.
