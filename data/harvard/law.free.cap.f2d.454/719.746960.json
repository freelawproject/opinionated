Outlaw, Jr., a prisoner in the Federal Correctional Institution in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Texarkana, Texas, filed an action essentially in the nature of mandamus<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Outlaw seeks credit for 117 days which he alleges he spent in custody as a consequence of a federal detain-er warrant prior to the time he commenced to serve his present sentence. The district court treated Outlaw\u2019s petition as an application for the writ of ha-beas corpus and denied relief for lack of jurisdiction. We find that the court properly denied relief but for the reason that the venue was improper and not for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Both Outlaw and the named respondent, L. M. Connett,. Warden of the Federal Correctional Facility in Texarkana, Texas, reside in the Eastern District of Texas. The district court has jurisdiction of Outlaw\u2019s action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. However under the provisions of the venue statute, 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1391(e)* this action can not be maintained in the Northern District of Texas where neither of the parties resides nor the cause of action arose. Outlaw sought to invoke Rule 21, F.R. Crim.P. which provides that federal criminal proceedings may be transferred to. another district in certain instances. This rule has no application to Outlaw\u2019s present suit which is a civil and not a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of relief without prejudice to Outlaw\u2019s right to seek relief in the proper venue in the Eastern District of Texas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. The petition was prepared by the prisoner and is inartfully drafted. Our characterization of it is based upon the issue which the petitioner apparently sought to raise and the contentions asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. \u201cA civil action in which each defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority, or an agency of the United States, may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any ju-dieial district in which: (1) a defendant in the action resides, or. (2) the cause of action arose, or (3) any real property involved in the action is situated, or (4) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-25\">. We do not pass upon the merits of Outlaw\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>Davis v. Attorney General, 425 F.2d 238 (5th Cir. 1970); Willis v. United States, 438 F.2d 923 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
