After hearing the District Court granted a temporary injunction pending the disposition of the principal action. On this record we cannot say that the findings of fact are clearly erroneous. Rule 52, Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. Nor can we say that the trial judge abused his discretion in enjoining the appellants from prosecuting the appellee under the statutes to which reference has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
