S.C.App., registered with the Selective Service System in November, 1964, upon attaining eighteen years of age. Until June, 1970, he was classified 2-S and enjoyed a student deferment. The middle of June, 1970, after graduating from college, he was reclassified 1-A. In July, 1970, following this reclassification, he submitted his application to his Local Board for classification as a conscientious objector. Two months later, he was personally interviewed by his draft board. The board thereafter denied the application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ordered to report in January, 1971, he refused induction, and indictment and conviction followed. From such conviction he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-23\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-24\">It is appellant\u2019s first contention that he was improperly denied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>conscientious objector classification without a statement by his Local Board of the reasons for such denial. It is settled that the burden of establishing a right to a conscientious objector classification rests on the registrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unless, by his application, along with his supporting data, the registrant establishes a <em>prima facie </em>right to such classification, the Local Board may deny the application and need not set forth any grounds or reasons for the denial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, the requirement that the Board articulate its reasons for denial is dependent upon the registrant establishing a <em>prima facie </em>claim. In this case, the appellant failed to establish, by his application and supporting material, a <em>pri-ma facie </em>right and the action of the Local Board in denying the claim to a conscientious objector classification was in order and there was no necessity under those circumstances for the Board to provide reasons for its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">The appellant is not inarticulate or uneducated. He is a college graduate. As such he was fully qualified to state his beliefs fully and clearly. Yet it is manifest that the reasons given by the registrant himself for his classification as a conscientious objector are obscure \u2014it might even be said they are studiously \u201ccryptic\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>and strikingly sparse, if not entirely devoid, of any relevant detail. In describing his belief on which he based his claim, he stated in his Form 150 application; \u201cBy the miracle of life, I have been given a liberty to pursue a state of happiness and peace.\u201d By way of explanation of the origin of this belief, as called for in another question on his Form 150, he added, \u201cIt is my belief that I have been endowed with a free will by my Creator\u201d. What really the registrant is expressing, it would seem, is a freedom of will, but not a deeply felt conviction of conscience against participation in war. He certainly is not setting forth any religious, ethical or moral belief, imposing \u201cupon him a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time\u201d and held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.\u00ae Nor does he identify any occasion or situation in which, either \u201cpublicly or privately, written or oral\u201d, he has given expression to the views on which he based his claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>He appended to his application two letters. One of these letters is from his brother. In this letter, written to provide \u201cproof of sincerity\u201d on the part of the registrant, the brother states that the registrant\u2019s beliefs are \u201cof a personal nature rather that (sic) religious\"; he then summarized those beliefs as being \u201cagainst anybody or anything that advocates war, which he believes is a crime against humanity\u201d. The source of such belief, as related by the brother, is this nation\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in its Asian conflict\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Advocacy of war is condemned generally by thoughtful persons and many of our citizens are openly critical of our \u201cinvolvement\u201d in Asia; but neither feeling is inconsistent with a willingness to fight for one\u2019s country or adds up to that sincere conviction of conscience required under <em>Welsh. </em>The other supporting letter is even less relevant. It reads like an employment recommendation. It attests merely that the registrant \u201cis a Christian boy, quiet, courteous, and works hard at whatever he is doing\u201d, and concludes with the statement, \u201cI would recommend him to do his best with anything he attempts to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Such was the extent of the registrant\u2019s showing on his request for classification as a conscientious objector. As we have already observed, such a showing was insufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>claim to the classification and required of the Board no articulation of its reasons for denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">Appellant urges that he made a <em>prima facie </em>case because the Trial Judge recognized his sincerity of belief at the trial. This recognition, however, was in the context of the Judge grappling with the problem of an appropriate sentence and can be fairly characterized as comments of a compassionate Trial Judge. In any event, it is a characterization of general impressions garnered at the trial, not a finding of fact, and, as the Judge himself found, not sufficient to overturn the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">The appellant, also, complains that, in derogation of his constitutional rights, no transcript, of the proceedings at which he appeared and his claim denied, was prepared and that he was not afforded the right of counsel before the Local Board. The complaint is without merit. The procedure in connection with classification of registrants by the Local Selective Service Board \u201cis in no way penal, nor is it a criminal trial with the right to be represented by counsel, and to call, examine and cross-examine witnesses.\u201d Merritt v. United States (5th Cir. 1968) 401 F.2d 768, 769.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>matter of fact, any contention by the appellant that he should have been provided with counsel in the proceedings before the Board is somewhat paradoxical, since, at his trial in the District Court, he refused counsel and acted as his own attorney. Moreover, being staffed by laymen, the Board is not obligated to observe the niceties of a judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, there is no requirement that an exact transcript be made of all proceedings and hearings before the Board; 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.27 only demands that the Local Board \u201ckeep minutes of each of its meetings\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-13\">. In its denial of appellant\u2019s application, the Local Board stated: \u201cThe board cannot decide that the registrant\u2019s moral, ethical, or religious belief of opposition to all wars in any form is sincerely held, but concludes that it will not grant a 1-0 classification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-5\">.
