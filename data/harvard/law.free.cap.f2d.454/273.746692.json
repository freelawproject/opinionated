We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In 1970 Mauney was convicted in the United States District Court for interstate transportation of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. He was sentenced to a three year term of imprisonment. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. (No. 20,705, 6th Cir., March 25, 1971, unpublished.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In June 1971 Mauney filed the instant action, asserting that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Mauney asserts that he should have been sentenced under 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government contends that he was indicted, tried, and convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was properly sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> The record shows that Mauney was tried and convicted for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The sentence was within the maximum provided by 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 924(a). Where two statutes proscribe identical conduct, the Government may elect to prosecute under the statute providing the more severe penalty. <em>See </em>Berra v.
