The trial court denied and overruled Brown\u2019s motion, and we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">In September of 1970, Brown was charged in nine counts with use of interstate telephone and telegraph facilities in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. Trial commenced on October 14, 1970, and evidence was introduced from one of the recipients of the telephone calls and wires. At the start of the afternoon session, Brown\u2019s court appointed attorney advised the court that Brown wished to change his plea to guilty as to Count I, and the United States Attorney indicated that when this had been accomplished, the other eight counts would be dismissed. After questioning by the court, the plea was accepted, and Brown was sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of five years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">Petitioner claims that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty because \u201cwithout knowing the true nature of his plea [petitioner] received unfulfilled promises of probation by U.S. Attorney and counsel.\u201d He also claimed he had not been fully advised of the consequences of the plea and did not know he was \u201cwaivering [sic] all jurisdictional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">On this appeal, Brown assigns five reasons that this Court should reverse the decision of the trial court as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">1. The district court erred in failing to ascertain a factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-18\">2. Promises were made to defendant by his court appointed counsel and not fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">3. Defendant\u2019s attorney was both incompetent and inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-20\">4. At time of the plea, the defendant was under the influence of stimulating drugs; that defendant\u2019s counsel knew of this and made no motion to discontinue proceedings until after defendant could and would be fully aware of his actions and statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-21\">5. There was an incomplete medical evaluation of petitioner at the Federal Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri (prior to trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-22\">This Court will not consider the fourth and fifth allegations since they were not raised in the motion filed by Brown in the trial court. The other three allegations have been considered and found to be without merit based upon a full consideration of the transcript of that portion of the original proceedings in which Brown entered his plea and was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-23\">The trial court did ascertain a factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. The court had theretofore heard testimony on that count from the intended victim of the scheme and others. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Brown decided to change his plea, the following discussion took place between the court and the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: As I understand, Mr. Brown, you have indicated to your attorneys that you wanted to change your plea with respect to Count 1 and plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">THE DEFENDANT: This is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">THE COURT: And that is the one that deals with Reverend Thomas C. Kelley, Jr., of Miami, Florida. You have heard the testimony of Reverend Kelley here, and the testimony of the officers with respect to it. Is that what occurred \u2014 in substance, I mean, with respect to the telephone conversations, the sending of the wire, and so on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, by the wire \u2014 -I sent the wire, but I didn\u2019t make the telephone calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">THE COURT: Were you in on the telephone calls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I just went down with Stovall to get the money for him, I didn\u2019t make the phone calls at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t have anything to do with it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Not the phone calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-15\">THE COURT: Did you have anything to do with \u2014 were you and these other people \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">THE DEFENDANT: I was more or less played for a sucker to go down and get the money for them. I didn\u2019t know where it was coming from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-17\">THE COURT: Did you know what was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-18\">THE DEFENDANT: Later on, I did, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-19\">THE COURT: Before you went to get the money ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-20\">THE DEFENDANT: No, but later on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-21\">THE COURT: I can\u2019t- accept your plea on that. You either knew what was going on when you went down there or you didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-23\">THE DEFENDANT: Okay, I knew what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-24\">THE COURT: You knew what was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-25\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-26\">This discussion is a satisfactory showing that the trial judge satisfied himself as to the factual basis for the plea before accepting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-27\">The assertions of promises allegedly made by Brown\u2019s attorney and the U.S. Attorney appear to be frivolous in view of the following portions of the same transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-28\">\u201cTHE COURT: Has anyone made any promise to you as to what sentence you might get if you entered this plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-29\">THE DEFENDANT: No, just my lawyers told me what you said and the prosecuting attorney said, and that was about it, no promises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-30\">THE COURT: Any threats against you in order to get it, anyone threatened you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-31\">THE DEFENDANT: No, really, I think the reason I\u2019m pleading guilty is because I want to get it over with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-32\">-X- -X- * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-33\">THE COURT: Do you have anything you want to say, Mr. Brown, at this time before the court passes sentence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-34\">THE DEFENDANT: No, sir, except I went through the Medical Training at Springfield, things like this, and they haven\u2019t found any mental. Then I went to Baltimore, Maryland, the escape was \u2014 one of the policemen came after me told me to run like hell, so I ran, because I was being extradited back to jail, because I knew something on them, but I don\u2019t think I should go to a hospital anywhere. I was talking to my attorney, you know, I have a lot of problems because I went to Fort Meyers about eighteen and my mother always thought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>doctor there \u2014 you know, released me too soon and she\u2019s been holding it over my head that I\u2019ve been a mental problem all these years, you know, so for once in my life I would rather go somewhere I could get some help, like a halfway house, more like that, where I can get my life together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">THE COURT: Of course, the halfway houses, Mr. Brown, come into effect before they turn you loose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">THE DEFENDANT: I talked to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">THE COURT: What they do at this time, now, is send most of them at least \u2014 I don\u2019t know what they will do in your instance\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">THE DEFENDANT: I talked to my attorney about this, but he told me that \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t go along with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">THE COURT: Even on a halfway house\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I asked him for something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">THE COURT: What is it you\u2019re wanting ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, I told him, you know, see I\u2019ve been going to the out-patient clinic at Malcolm Bliss Medical Center. I been talking to a doctor over there, a doctor named Garrett. He left. I asked my attorney, Mr. Johnson, if I could get a five or ten years\u2019 parole and start going to the Medical Center and keep my treatments up and he said he wouldn\u2019t go along with it, and so I told him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-12\">THE COURT: Well, of course, when he wouldn\u2019t go along with it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-14\">THE DEFENDANT: Said you wouldn\u2019t go along with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-16\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t bargain with anybody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">Our examination of the record convinces us that Brown was represented by competent counsel and that Brown\u2019s change of plea was not induced by any promise made by either Government counsel or by Brown\u2019s court appointed attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
