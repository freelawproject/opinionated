Appellant Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (the company) has brought suit against the Communications Workers of Ameri-ca and its Local 6222 (the union) under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, for breach of the collective bargaining agreement and to enjoin the union\u2019s striking of one of the company\u2019s construction sites. The dispute centers over the proposed staff structure for the strikebound Houston directory assistance center project. The company had proposed to allow two part-time employees working back to back to operate a full shift which had been work available to full-time employees based on their seniority. Moreover, the company proposed a separate seniority schedule for these part-time employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">Responding to the staff plan, the union filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, grievances under the contract grievance procedure, and additionally struck the site of the facility, halting completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">Since the time this \u2019case was submitted on appeal, the collective agreement in effect at the origin of the dispute has been superseded by a new agreement which substantially carries forward the terms of its predecessor. The union asserts that this appeal is now moot as a consequence of the new agreement and its removal of pickets at the Houston project for a brief period. We disagree. The test of mootness in a case asking for injunctive relief is whether the injury is continuing or is likely to be repeated. Douds v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, 242 F.2d 808 (2nd Cir., 1957); Green v. Bangor Building Trades Council, AFL-CIO, 165 F.Supp. 902 (D.Me., 1958). The dispute at issue in this case has not been resolved, nor have the pickets left the site. It is a live controversy and an appropriate case for our continued appellate consideration, ef. <em>Douds, swpra. </em>Whether the union has excluded this dispute from the coverage of the no-strike and arbitration clauses in the past and whether the union may subsequently exclude the dispute from the ambit of those clauses are two distinct questions. We are presented with a record- of only the first. In considering whether an issue has been removed from the coverage of such clauses, this court has previously held that exclusion from coverage must be specifically articulated. The district court concluded that the disputes here in question were not covered by the contract\u2019s arbitration and no-strike clauses. However, for reasons stated infra, we disagree with the method in which the court reached that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">Turning to the merits of the company\u2019s appeal, the district court denied its application for an injunction on the grounds that the proposed staff structure was a prospective modification or amendment to the agreement beyond the scope of the contract arbitration clause and was unwarranted on basic equitable considerations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>In Boys Market, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, 398 U.S. 237, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970), the Supreme Court held that a district court may, when equity requires, enjoin a strike to effectuate a no-strike arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>tion clause to which the parties have voluntarily agreed. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-4\">\u201cOur holding in the present case is a narrow one. We do not undermine the vitality of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. We deal only with the situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure. Nor does it follow from what we have said that injunctive relief is appropriate as a matter of course in every case of a strike over an arbitrable grievance. The dissenting opinion in <em>Sinclair </em>suggested the following principles for the guidance of the district courts in determining whether to grant injunctive relief \u2014 principles that we now adopt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-6\">\u201c \u2018A District Court entertaining an action under \u00a7 301 may not grant injunctive relief against concerted activity unless and until it decides that the case is one in which an injunction would be appropriate despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act. When a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunctive order until it first holds that the contract <em>does </em>have that effect; and the employer should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of his obtaining an injunction against the strike. Beyond this, the District Court must, of course, consider whether issuance of an injunction would be warranted under ordinary principles of equity \u2014 whether breaches are occurring and will continue, or have been threatened and will be committed; whether they have caused or will cause irreparable injury to the employer; and whether the employer will suffer more from the denial of an injunction than will the union from its issuance.\u2019 370 U.S., at 228, [82 S.Ct., at 1346.] (Emphasis in original.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\"><em>Boys Market </em>presented the Supreme Court with a case in which there was no dispute that the grievance in question was subject to arbitration under the contract. In the present case, however, there is a dispute. In such a case it is the district court\u2019s duty to first examine the collective agreement and inquire whether the parties have agreed to arbitration and whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate the specific issue. International Association of Heat &amp; Frost Insulation &amp; Asbestos Workers v. Leona Lee Corporation, 434 F.2d 192 (5th Cir., 1970). The trial judge to whom an application for injunction is made has no authority to decide the substance of the question for arbitration. Rather he must only decide whether or not the parties have bound themselves to arbitrate that subject matter. Lodge No. 12, Etc. v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 292 F.2d 112 (5th Cir., 1961); Communications Workers of America v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 415 F.2d 35, 38 (5th Cir., 1969). Since <em>Lincoln Mills</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it has become increasingly clear that arbitration is the central institution for the administration of the collective bargaining contract. In order to effectuate this policy, it is necessary that a uniform standard of arbitrability be applied, regardless of whether the suit asks for the injunction of a strike, <em>Boys Market, </em>or the specific performance of an arbitration clause. Communications Workers of America v. Southwestern Bell, <em>swpra. </em>That test is the same as was stated in Cameron, <em>supra, </em>and in Southwestern Bell, <em>supra, </em>and has been called one of \u201carguable arbitrability.\u201d Our examination is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract and which is \u201carguably arbitrable.\u201d See also Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union v. Southern Union Gas Co., 379 F.2d 774 (5th Cir., 1967); Local No. 787 v. Collins Radio Co., 317 F.2d 214 (5th Cir., 1963). Applying this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>standard of \u201carguable arbitrability\u201d to the contract at issue, it is plain that the union\u2019s position and the district court finding that the dispute was not within the scope of the contract\u2019s arbitration clause (because it .was a prospective modification of the contract) cannot stand. Whether or not the company\u2019s proposal is a prospective modification of the contract, the use of part-time employees with their own seniority schedule requires consideration of the application of the collective agreement\u2019s seniority clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As such, it is a claim which on its face is governed by the contract and is arguably arbitrable. United Steel Workers of America v. American Manufacturing Co., 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1403 (1960). As the National Labor Relations Board recognized in its recent opinion abstaining from asserting unfair labor practice jurisdiction over an arbi-trable claim: \u201cArbitration has become the central institution in the administration of collective bargaining contracts.\u201d Collyer Insulated Wire, 192 NLRB, No. 150 (1971). Where a public utility is concerned, the public policy of favoring arbitration to resolve industrial strife is even stronger. If, but only if, the other elements of <em>Boys Market </em>are met,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> these considerations require that an injunction and arbitration order be entered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Since this is an interlocutory appeal and the district court retained on its docket that portion of the company\u2019s complaint asking for monetary damages, we remand the case for further consideration in light of the concept of arbi-trability discussed. The order of the district court is vacated and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent-herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">On Petition for Rehearing and Petition for Rehearing En Banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing en Bane is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">.
