Rule 35. That rule is not applicable to his claims. However, since the sentencing court addresses itself to the merits of Sica\u2019s claim, and since both sides have fully briefed the issue, we treat this as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The order denying relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-25\">When appellant accepted his release on bail pending appeal, he in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>agreed to staying his sentence. F.R.Cr. P. Rule 38; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568. There is no reason for treating time spent on bail as jail time. See, Marchese v. McEachen, 451 F.2d 555 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The unreported decision of this court on which appellant relies is not in point. Here in Sica\u2019s case the conditions of release were imposed by the Circuit Justice, not by the marshal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
