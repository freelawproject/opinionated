For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">Appellant\u2019s conviction arose out of facts relating to a notice of reclassification from 4-F to 1-A, which Local Board No. 84 mailed to Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s address in Memphis, Tennessee, on December 12, 1967. On or about January 8, 1968, the notice was returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to the local board with the following notation appearing on the face of the unopened envelope:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">\u201cNo one here by that name. Forward to, School of Marxist Studies, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The envelope bore a Montreal postmark, revealing that delivery had been attempted at the address indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The local board thereafter mailed the notice in a new envelope to an Acklen Street address of Appellant\u2019s cousin in Nashville, Tennessee, which had been provided by the F.B.I. This envelope was returned unopened with the following notation on its face: \u201cWrong address, Karl Marxist Student, Canada.\u201d The local board then mailed the notice to a dormitory on the campus of Tennessee State A &amp; I University in Nashville, where Appellant had previously received mail when he was a student at that University. The notice was returned after two days marked \u201cunclaimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The notice was once again mailed to the Memphis address of Appellant\u2019s mother on January 19, 1968. In a subsequent telephone call by the Clerk of the local board, Appellant\u2019s mother informed the Clerk that she did not know where Appellant could be located and that she was holding his mail for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">On March 19, 1968, the F.B.I. located Appellant at a Nashville address where he was then living. In response to the F.B.I.\u2019s instructions, Appellant wrote to his local board on March 20, 1968, informing them of his current Nashville address. On May 1, 1968, the local board sent Appellant a notice to report for induction. Appellant failed to report, and he was subsequently indicted for failing to keep his local board informed of his current address on or about May 1, 1968, and for failure to report for induction. On January 5 and 6, 1970, Appellant was tried without a jury and acquitted on both of these counts before the Honorable Bailey Brown, United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Western Division. At this January 1970 trial, Appellant testified that he did not know who had written the notes referring to the School of Marxist Studies in Montreal on the envelopes containing the notice of reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">After his acquittal in the January 1970 trial, the Government submitted the envelopes which had been returned to the local board with notations thereon to a questioned documents examiner and a fingerprint expert. The documents examiner concluded that some of the writing on the envelopes was Appellant\u2019s, and the fingerprint expert identified Appellant\u2019s latent finger and palm prints on the envelopes. As a result of these findings, Appellant was indicted on the following three counts which are the basis of the present appeal: (I) perjury in his testimony at the January 1970 trial that he did not know who had written the note referring to the Marxist School on the envelope sent by the local board on December 12, 1967, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621; (II) wilfully and knowingly making a false, fictitious statement and representation to his local board on or about January 8, 1968, to the effect that he no longer resided or received mail at his mother\u2019s Memphis address, by writing the note \u201cNo one here by that name. Forward to, School of Marxist Study, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\u201d on the envelope containing the December 12, 1967, reclassification notice and sent to Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s Memphis address, in violation of 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 1001; and (III) wilfully and knowingly failing to keep his local board informed of his current address on or about January 8, 1968, in violation of 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a) and the regulations thereunder. Appellant\u2019s jury trial under this indictment commenced on December 7, 1970, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Western Division, Hon. Robert M. McRae, Jr., presiding and on December 11 and 15, 1970, the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on count I and guilty on counts II and III. Appellant\u2019s motions for arrest of judgment, new trial, and acquittal were denied, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>District Court sentenced Appellant to two years probation on each of counts II and III, the sentences to run concurrently-</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On appeal, Appellant asserts that his conviction must be reversed because (1) the jury verdicts of not guilty on count I and guilty on counts II and III are fatally inconsistent, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict of guilty under count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">With respect to the asserted conflict between the verdict of not guilty on count I and guilty on counts II and III, this Court has consistently held that an apparent inconsistency in a jury\u2019s guilty and not guilty verdicts on a multi-count or multi-party indictment does not invalidate the verdicts. United States v. Bevins, 430 F.2d 601, 602-603 (6th Cir. 1970); United States v. Shipp, 359 F.2d 185, 189 (6th Cir. 1966); United States v. McGee, 315 F.2d 479, 481 (6th Cir. 1963); Conley v. United States, 257 F.2d 141, 144 (6th Cir. 1958). <em>See also </em>Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932); Steckler v. United States, 7 F.2d 59, 60 (2d Cir. 1925). This rule is particularly applicable to the alleged inconsistency between the jury\u2019s verdict of not guilty on the perjury charge in count I and the guilty verdicts under counts II and III in the present case. There is a \u201cunique and stringent burden of proof\u201d which must be borne by the prosecution in perjury charges, United States v. Johnson, 414 F.2d 22, 25 (6th Cir. 1969), Spaeth v. United States, 232 F.2d 776, 777 (6th Cir. 1956), including the requirements that the falsity of the defendant\u2019s testimony be supported by at least two witnesses or one witness corroborated by independent circumstances, Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495 (1945), and that the defendant\u2019s intent to testify falsely be clearly proven. <em>See </em>United States v. Osborn, 415 F.2d 1021, 1026 (6th Cir. 1969); United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967). It therefore cannot be said that the jury\u2019s failure to find Appellant guilty of perjury under count I in any way affects the validity of the verdicts under counts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Appellant further argues, however, that the guilty verdicts on both counts II and III are themselves manifestly irreconcilable, relying on Thomas v. United States, 314 F.2d 936 (5th Cir. 1963). In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant was found guilty on count I, charging the smuggling of marihuana into the United States, as well as count II, charging the transportation and concealment of marihuana within the United States without having paid a transfer tax. Ruling that the conviction under count I was necessarily predicated on the conclusive evidence that the defendant had acquired the single shipment of marihuana in Mexico, whereas count II was predicated on the defendant\u2019s having obtained the marihuana within the United States, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction under count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">We find no such inherent conflict between Appellant\u2019s convictions under both count II and count III in the present case. Count II charged Appellant with having written the false statement \u201cNo one here by that name. Forward to, School of Marxist Study, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\u201d on the December 12, 1967, notice of reclassification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Count III rested on Appellant\u2019s failure to fulfill a duty under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a) and the regulations thereunder. Those regulations require the following of a selective service registrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of each registrant to keep his local board advised at all times of the address where mail will reach him.\u201d 32 CFR \u00a7 1641.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of each classified registrant to keep his local board currently informed of his home address. . . . Every classified registrant shall, within 10 days after it occurs, report every change . in home address. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvQ\">32 CFR \u00a7 1641.7(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">We find no merit in Appellant\u2019s claim that count II was predicated on Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>lant\u2019s receipt of the reclassification notice at his mother\u2019s Memphis address and that the guilty verdict under count II therefore required a finding that he had complied with the requirement that he provide the local board with an address where he could be \u201creached\u201d under 32 CFR \u00a7 1641.3. Although 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), and its predecessor provisions do not require that a registrant inform the local board of his every move or temporary address, <em>see </em>Bartchy v. United States, 319 U.S. 484, 488, 63 S. Ct. 1206, 87 L.Ed. 1534 (1943); United States v. Ebey, 424 F.2d 376, 377 (10th Cir. 1970), the statute and regulations certainly required Appellant to provide his local board with something more than an address from which the board\u2019s communications would be returned unclaimed and unopened. <em>See </em>United States v. Read, 443 F.2d 842 (5th Cir. 1971); Kokotan v. United States, 408 F.2d 1134 (10th Cir. 1969) (affirming convictions for failure to keep local board informed of current address, where board\u2019s communications sent to the address where registrant indicated that he could always be reached were returned to the board unclaimed and unopened). We thus find that the jury\u2019s determination that Appellant received the reclassification notice so as to write the statement charged in count II in no way precluded the determination under count III that Appellant had failed to provide his local board with a current address where he could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We similarly find no merit in Appellant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict under count III. In Bartchy v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the following standard for compliance with \u00a7 11 of the earlier Selective Training and Service Act and the regulations thereunder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cthe regulation, it seems to us, is satisfied when the registrant, in good faith, provides a chain of forwarding addresses by which mail, sent to the address which is furnished the board, may be by the registrant reasonably expected to come into his hands in time for compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">The District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that the petitioner had not shown diligence in keeping the board advised of his whereabouts and had affirmatively endeavored to avoid delivery of the communication. We do not think either of these inferences is justified by the record.\u201d 319 U.S. at 489, 63 S.Ct. at 1208.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\"><em>See also </em>United States v. Ebey, <em>supra, </em>424 F.2d at 377 (applying the <em>Bartchy </em>test under 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a) and similarly finding no evidence of the registrant\u2019s lack of good faith). In the present case, it is undisputed that Appellant\u2019s local board sent the December 12, 1967, reclassification notice to three different addresses where it believed Appellant might be found. From each of these addresses the notice was returned unclaimed and unopened. The notice was finally sent to Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s address a second time \u2014 the address at which Appellant had indicated he could always receive mail \u2014 and a subsequent telephone conversation with Appellant\u2019s mother disclosed that she did not know where Appellant could be located and that she was holding his mail. Moreover, evidence of bad faith and an affirmative endeavor to avoid delivery of the notice \u2014 which the Supreme Court found to be lacking in the <em>Bartchy </em>case \u2014was supplied by the testimony of the questioned documents examiner, who positively concluded that Appellant had written the note appearing on the reclassification envelope. This series of attempted communications, accompanied by the evidence that Appellant had himself written the note on the envelope which was returned to the board, afforded ample evidence upon which the jury could conclude that on or about January 8, 1968, Appellant had wilfully and knowingly failed to provide his local board with a current address where he could be reached. <em>See </em>Gretter v. United States, 422 F.2d 315, 318 (10th Cir. 1970); United States v. Read, <em>supra, </em>443 F.2d at 844. <em>Compare </em>United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>States v. Ebey, <em>supra, </em>424 F.2d at 377; Venus v. United States, 287 F.2d 304, 311 (9th Cir. 1960), rev\u2019d, 368 U.S. 345, 82 S.Ct. 384, 7 L.Ed.2d 341 (1961); Ward v. United States, 195 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1952), rev\u2019d 344 U.S. 924, 73 S.Ct. 494, 97 L.Ed. 711 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
