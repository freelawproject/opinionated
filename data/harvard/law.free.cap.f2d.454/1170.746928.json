The judgment of the district court in question is therefore vacated and the cause is remanded with direction to dismiss the proceedings as being moot. Cf. Troy State University v. Dickey, 5 Cir, 1968, 402 F.2d 515, 516-517; and Lebus for and on Behalf of N.L.R.B. v. Seafarer\u2019s Int\u2019l Union, 5 Cir, 1968, 398 F.2d 281, 283, on the procedure to be followed by the Court of Appeals in dismissing a case by reason of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-25\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
