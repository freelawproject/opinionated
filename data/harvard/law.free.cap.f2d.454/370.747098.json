We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-23\">Petitioner Harvey Robert Brough was adjudged guilty on May 22, 1968, of violating 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 462<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by failing to register for the draft as required in 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 453.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record reveals petitioner was born March 5, 1944, and failed to register within five days of his eighteenth birthday as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>quired by law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>He was indicted on August 18, 1967, approximately five years and five months after his eighteenth birthday. An appeal to this court was dismissed on petitioner\u2019s motion and final judgment was entered on July 11, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (1970), the Supreme Court held that the applicable statute of limitations contained in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prohibits the indictment of a person for failure to register for the draft unless the indictment was brought within five years and five days of that person\u2019s eighteenth birthday. The Court held that failure to comply with \u00a7 453, <em>supra </em>n. 3, is not a continuing offense and the five year statute of limitations begins to run when the offender fails to register as required by law. <em>Toussie </em>thus invalidated Selective Service Regulation 32 C.F. R. \u00a7 1611.7(c) which provided that failure to register for the draft was a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d, against which the statute of limitations did not begin to run until a person\u2019s twenty-sixth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The district court stated in its memorandum decision in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cIt is clear that if <em>Toussie </em>had been the law at the time petitioner was tried he would have had a sound statute of limitations defense. Petitioner\u2019s motion rests squarely on the premise that <em>Toussie </em>should be applied now to his case. Thus, the sole issue presented is whether this 1970 decision should be applied retroactively to upset petitioner\u2019s 1968 conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Government, relying on Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971), contends that where there is no serious question raised about the accuracy of the guilty verdict in a past trial, prospective application of a new Supreme Court rule is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Not until 1965, in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed. 2d 601 (1965), did the Supreme Court hold that one of its <em>constitutionally </em>based decisions should not be given full retroactive effect. At no time has it denied retroactive application to a <em>statutory </em>interpretation which would invalidate a prior conviction. The Government has cited no case, and we find none, where a <em>statutory </em>interpretation by the Supreme Court was denied retroactive application in a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">To apply <em>Toussie </em>prospectively only would indicate that a federal statute duly enacted by Congress could mean one thing prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation and something entirely different afterwards. Here the relationship of \u00a7 3282 to \u00a7\u00a7 462 and 453 had never been considered by the Supreme Court prior to <em>Toussie. </em>Nevertheless, a statute, under our system of separate powers of government, can have only one meaning. An interpretive rule, such as 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1611.7(c), concerning that statute is either consistent with the statute or inconsistent. If inconsistent, as the Supreme Court found in <em>Toussie, </em>then the prior interpretation is, and always was, invalid. It necessarily follows that <em>Toussie </em>should have retroactive application in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Petitioner failed to register as required between March 5 and 10, 1962, and was indicted August 18, 1967, while in <em>Toussie </em>the defendant failed to register between June 23 and 28, 1959, and was indicted May 3, 1967. In spite of the fact that the <em>Toussie </em>offense occurred three years prior to petitioner\u2019s and his indictment was three months prior thereto, the Government urges us to apply the <em>same statute </em>involved in <em>Toussie </em>and uphold petitioner\u2019s convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion. We find no authority for such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">A case completely in point with the one before us, Scudder v. United States, 6 Cir., No. 20,585 (Feb. 11, 1971), in an unreported per curiam order, the court affirmed the district court and held that <em>Toussie </em>was to be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Our decision is consistent with other cases which have applied retroactively Supreme Court decisions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> overturning or construing certain Selective Service regulations and procedures. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Jones, 7 Cir., 447 F.2d 589 (1971); Wright v. Ingold, 7 Cir., 445 F.2d 109 (1971); United States v. Stolberg, 7 Cir., 346 F.2d 363 (1965); Foster v. United States, D.Conn., 320 F. Supp. 646 (1970); United States v. Rumon, W.D. Pa., 315 F.Supp. 1126 (1970); United States v. Kelly, E.D.N. Y., 314 F.Supp. 500 (1970); and Andre v. Resor, N.D.Cal., 313 F.Supp. 957 (1970) , aff\u2019d 9 Cir., 443 F.2d 921 (1971) .</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In sum, the doctrine of retroactivity has been developed in cases dealing with criminal proceedings where new <em>constitutional </em>procedural protections had been announced. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971); Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971); Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971); Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); Arsenault v. Massachusetts, 393 U.S. 5, 89 S.Ct. 35, 21 L.Ed.2d 5 (1968); Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); and Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">We conclude that the standards thus far developed for applying new constitutional protections prospectively only have no application in the instant appeal to the <em>statutory </em>interpretation by the Supreme Court. Since we find <em>Toussie </em>applicable, the prosecution of petitioner for violation of \u00a7 462 was barred by the relevant statute of limitations, 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 3282.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">We are advised that petitioner has been released from custody following the expiration of his sentence. However, his case is not moot and he should not be required to bear the consequences of his unlawful conviction \u201csimply because the path has been so long that he has served his sentence.\u201d Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 237-240, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 1561, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">The order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate his judgment of conviction and to set aside his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 is reversed. This cause is remanded to the district court with directions to grant the relief prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">. 28 U.SvC.A. \u00a7 2255 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">\u201cA motion for such relief may be made at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">:\u00a1s <em>* </em>* * sj: * s\u00a1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">\u201cAn appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-15\">.
