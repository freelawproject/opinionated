To decide whether the district court followed a permissible procedure, we need not reach the merits of the underlying dispute. Nevertheless, an understanding of the nature of that dispute is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">The parties have bargained on a mul-ti-employer, multi-union basis for many years. Plaintiff is an association composed of numerous contractors engaged in the building and construction industry, and defendant\u2019s membership comprises various local unions. Effective as of April 1, 1970, one three-year agreement was succeeded by another. The transition gave rise to a relatively narrow dispute which mushroomed into this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-18\">The underlying dispute is over the wage scale applicable to certain work performed during the three-month period between April 1, 1970, and July 1, 1970, in connection with highway construction contracts which had been previously negotiated. Plaintiff contends that the wage rates are governed by Article XXIII, section 2, paragraph (c), of the 1967-70 agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The union contends that the elimination of that paragraph in the 1970-73 agreement was specifically intended to make all wage increases effective as of April 1, 1970. Plaintiff relies primarily on the language of the two written instruments; defendant stresses the intent of the parties as evidenced by their negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-19\">The negotiations were initiated by a union letter written in September, 1969, advising that its proposals for a new contract would be submitted shortly. <em>Among </em>the union\u2019s proposed changes was a demand that paragraph (c) of Ar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>tide XXIII be eliminated and that all negotiated wage increases should become effective on April 1,1970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">The negotiating teams agreed upon the substantial terms of the new contract on about May 7, 1970; after ratification by the union membership, the agreement was executed on May 27, 1970. Article IV described the new wage schedule effective on April 1, 1970, and paragraph (c) of Article XXIII relating to work already under contract was omitted, as the union had requested. Apparently construing the new agreement as covering work in progress on April 1, 1970, the union immediately requested that the new wage rates be paid on all such work, the employers took the position that the contract change related only to the transition that would occur three years in the future, and that the old contract still governed the work in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">When the dispute arose on May 27, 1970, it related to some work that had already been performed <em>(i. e., </em>since April 1, 1970) and to some that was not yet completed. Some contractors paid the new rates, but others did not. The union therefore initiated a number of grievances against the contractors who refused to put the new rates into effect prior to July 1 or to make any retroactive payment for work performed since April 1, 1970. On July 2, 1970, at a meeting of the joint grievance committee, a union motion to allow the claims and an association motion to submit the cases to arbitration both failed by a tie vote. The parties were deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\">The grievance procedures contained in the 1967-70 and 1970-73 contracts were identical. Neither contract provides for compulsory arbitration. The parties covered the deadlock contingency by the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-12\">\u201cDeadlocked cases shall be submitted to arbitration if a majority of the Joint Committee determine to submit such matter to an arbitrator for decision. Otherwise, either party shall be permitted all economic recourse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-13\">Following the deadlock, the union proceeded in accordance with this provision. On July 2, 1970, it either struck, or threatened to strike, the contractors who were parties to the deadlocked grievances. No strike activity was initiated before the grievance procedure had been exhausted or against any contractor not a party to a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-14\">On July 9, 1970, plaintiff invoked the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time the dispute related to a liquidated amount that either was or was not payable on account of work that had been completed. The complaint prayed for a declaratory judgment determining that the rates specified in the expired contract were applicable. It was alleged that the seasonal nature of the construction business would make it economically impossible for plaintiff\u2019s members to withstand a strike, and, therefore, unless enjoined, defendant would coerce plaintiff\u2019s members both into releasing their right to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction and into acceding to the union\u2019s improper demands. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>avoid the risk that the strike would therefore divest the court of its \u00a7 301 jurisdiction, and to protect the plaintiff\u2019s members from irreparable injury, a motion for a temporary restraining order was filed. The court granted the motion and, after an evidentiary hearing, entered a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-4\">The union appeals pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contending that the district court disregarded the plain meaning of \u00a7 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the teaching of Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, 398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199. Plaintiff responds by arguing that the controversy is not a \u201clabor dispute\u201d within the statute because it concerned completed rather than on-going work, and that <em>Boys Markets </em>authorizes courts to analyze labor controversies on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis in order to resolve disputes by means more orderly than economic warfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-15\">Unquestionably, on May 27, 1970, when the controversy arose, it was a \u201clabor dispute\u201d as defined by the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It concerned terms of employment and its subject matter was arguably encompassed by collective bargaining negotiations which had just been concluded. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the union\u2019s views of the merits, the union certainly could properly bargain for an increase in the work in progress wages payable after April 1, 1970, even if they were already covered by the old contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, at its inception the controversy was a labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>The union\u2019s resort to the grievance procedures before initiating any strike activity did not change the character of the dispute or take it outside the language of the statute. It still concerned the terms of employment even though the work had been completed before the grievance proceedings ended in a deadlock. Neither the fact that the union first sought a peaceful solution of the controversy nor the fact that the grievance machinery postponed the union\u2019s resort to self-help should cause the defendant to lose the benefit of a statutory provision that otherwise would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">Not only is the dispute within the language of Norris-LaGuardia, it is also squarely covered by the statute\u2019s purpose. That Act \u2018\u201cwas passed primarily because of widespread dissatisfaction with the tendency of judges to enjoin concerted activities in accordance with \u201cdoctrines of tort law which made the lawfulness of a strike depend upon judicial views of social and economic policy\u201d.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Federal judges were regarded as allies of management and Norris-LaGuardia was specifically intended to curtail their participation in determining the merits of issues arising between unions and employers. The injunction entered in this case for the purpose of preserving a federal judge\u2019s power to decide the merits of the underlying controversy is thus at odds with the history of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">This point is highlighted by plaintiff\u2019s factual contention that the seasonal nature of its business gave the union such a tactical advantage that the companies needed judicial protection to avoid the consequences of an uneven economic conflict. The court\u2019s power to enter an injunction should not turn on its estimate of the probable outcome of a power struggle between disputants. If the union has the right to engage in economic warfare, it must also have the right to decide when it is advantageous to declare war. We cannot lay down one jurisdictional rule for strikes that will probably succeed and another for strikes that may fail, in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-8\">Plaintiff\u2019 \u00ed suggestion that exceptions to the statutory prohibition may be developed by judges on a case by case basis is also contradicted by history as well as by the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Boys Markets. </em>The Court there noted that Norris-LaGuardia was particularly directed against decrees \u201cdrawn on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis without regard to any systematic elaboration of national labor policy.\u201d 398 U.S. at 250, 90 S.Ct. at 1592.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\"><em>Boys Markets </em>represents a principled accommodation between \u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 and the \u201ccore purpose\u201d of Norris-La-Guardia; the decision rests on a reasoned exposition of the national labor policy. It does not support plaintiff\u2019s request for a ease-by-case encroachment on the scope of Norris-LaGuardia\u2019s prohibition against labor injunctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">The <em>Boys Markets </em>holding is expressly limited to \u201cthe situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure.\u201d 398 U. S. at 253, 90 S.Ct. at 1594. A finding that the strike is \u201c \u2018over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate\u2019 \u201d is a precondition to an injunctive order. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 90 S.Ct. at 1594. The predicate for the entire opinion is the national labor policy fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>voring arbitration as \u201c \u2018the central institution in the administration of collective bargaining contracts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 90 S.Ct. at 1593.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specific enforcement of a union\u2019s voluntary agreement to submit disputes to arbitration, like the Railway Labor Act\u2019s requirement of compulsory arbitration of certain disputes,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> results in the peaceful resolution of labor controversies by an impartial tribunal without offending the core purpose of N orris-LaGuardia.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">In this case the agreement provides no support for the employers\u2019 choice of procedure. The union had not agreed to compulsory arbitration. On the contrary, it had expressly reserved the right to \u201ceconomic recourse\u201d in the event of a deadlock. It scrupulously exhausted the contract procedures before engaging in self-help. The essential ingredient of the <em>Boys Markets </em>decision \u2014a union\u2019s breach of its agreement to arbitrate as the ultimate method of resolving the grievance \u2014 is absent here. In view of the critical importance of that aspect of <em>Boys Markets,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that case affords plaintiff no support here. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d which substitutes arbitration \u2014 not litigation \u2014 for economic warfare is not a part of this contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The national labor policy, as explained in <em>Boys Markets, </em>does not justify \u2014 indeed it prohibits \u2014 the entry of the preliminary injunction to prevent the union from asserting a right to strike which it specifically reserved by contract.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">The preliminary injunction is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1387-12\">.
