Skakel, appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In accordance with the three year limitations period under General Statutes \u00a7 52-582,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in 2005, while a decision on that appeal was pending, the petitioner filed a petition for a new trial, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground of newly discovered evidence. This court thereafter affirmed the judgment of conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Karazin, J., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>subsequently denied the petitioner\u2019s revised substitute petition for a new trial (petition), and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petitioner contends that the trial court improperly concluded that his third party culpability, exculpatory and impeachment evidence was either not newly discovered, not credible or not likely to produce a different result in a new trial even if credible. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the petitioner had not satisfied the prerequisites for a new trial, and, accordingly, we affirm its judgment denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The following facts that the jury reasonably could have found on the basis of evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, as well as the theories the petitioner raised in his defense at trial, were set forth in great detail by this court in our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the judgment of conviction. The unusual circumstances of this case, its lengthy history, the number of persons involved, the nature of the claims in this appeal and the standard of review applied to claims of newly discovered evidence necessitate their repeating. \u201cSometime between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. on the evening of Thursday, October 30, 1975, the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>left her home on Walsh Lane, located in the Belle Haven section of [the town of] Greenwich, with a friend, Helen lx, to play and socialize in and around the neighborhood. It was the night before Halloween, commonly referred to as \u2018mischief night,\u2019 an evening when the neighborhood children were known to engage in playful mischief. The victim and lx soon were accompanied by other friends who lived nearby. Several times that night, the group stopped by the Skakel home, which was located on Otter Rock Drive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The first time they did so, the [petitioner] was dining at the Belle Haven Club with his siblings, Rushton Skakel, Jr., Julie Skakel, Thomas Skakel, John Skakel, David Skakel and Stephen Skakel, their cousin James Dowdle,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> their tutor Kenneth Littleton, and Julie Skakel\u2019s friend Andrea Shakespeare. The Skakel group arrived home from dinner before 9 p.m., at which time the victim and her friends again visited the [petitioner\u2019s] house.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u201cShortly thereafter, the [petitioner], joined by the victim, lx and [Geoffrey] Byrne, a friend of the victim, entered one of the Skakel family vehicles, a Lincoln Continental, which was parked on the Skakels\u2019 side driveway, to talk and listen to music. Thomas Skakel, the [petitioner\u2019s] then seventeen year old brother, soon joined the group. Sometime before 9:30 p.m., the group was interrupted by Rushton Skakel, Jr., and John Skakel, who needed to use the Lincoln Continental to drive Dowdle home, where they planned to watch a television program scheduled to air at 10 p.m. Consequently, Thomas Skakel, lx, Byrne and the victim exited the car. As lx began to leave the Skakel property with Byrne, she observed Thomas Skakel and the victim engaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>in flirtatious horseplay at the other end of the driveway. Feeling \u2018a bit embarrassed by the flirting,\u2019 lx left to go home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u201cThe victim\u2019s mother, Dorothy Moxley, expected that the victim would be home that evening by 10:30 or 11 p.m. At about 1:30 or 2 a.m., upon discovering that her daughter had not returned home, she sent the victim\u2019s brother, John Moxley, out to look for her. Dorothy Moxley thereafter telephoned anyone who she thought might know the victim\u2019s whereabouts, including the [petitioner\u2019s] family, whom Dorothy Moxley called several times. Dorothy Moxley\u2019s efforts to locate the victim were unsuccessful, and she eventually contacted the Greenwich police department, which dispatched an officer to the Moxley home. The officer made a missing persons report and briefly searched the surrounding area. The next morning, at about 8:30 a.m., Dorothy Moxley, believing that the victim may have fallen asleep in the Skakel family motor home that usually was parked in the Skakels\u2019 driveway, went to the [petitioner\u2019s] house. The [petitioner] answered the door, appearing \u2018hungover\u2019 and dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. The [petitioner] informed Dorothy Moxley that the victim was not at his home, and an inspection of the motor home by a Skakel employee confirmed that she was not there either.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u201cLater that day, at about noon, a neighborhood friend discovered the victim\u2019s dead body under a large pine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tree in a wooded area on the Moxley property. The victim was lying facedown, with her pants and panties pulled down around her ankles. Forensic tests revealed that the victim had died from multiple blunt force traumatic head injuries. A large quantity of blood was discovered in two areas in a grassy region approximately seventy feet from the victim\u2019s body, with a distinct drag path leading from the pools of blood to the location where the victim\u2019s body was found. The victim likely was assaulted at or near the farther end of her circular driveway and then dragged approximately eighty feet to the pine tree under which her body subsequently was discovered. Remnants of the murder weapon, a Toney Penna six iron golf club, also were found at the crime scene. The head of the golf club and an eight inch section of its shaft were found on the circular driveway, approximately 116 feet from the area where the large accumulation of the victim\u2019s blood was found. Another piece of the shaft was discovered on the grassy area near the two large pools of blood. The remaining part of the shaft attached to the club handle never was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201cHarold Wayne Carver II, a forensic pathologist and the state\u2019s chief medical examiner, testified regarding the findings of the original autopsy performed by then chief medical examiner Elliot M. Gross, also a forensic pathologist. Carver stated that the victim\u2019s injuries appeared consistent with having been inflicted by a golf club. In addition to the fatal head injuries, the victim had been stabbed in the neck with a piece of the golf club shaft. According to Carver, Gross had used an ultraviolet light to detect the presence of semen on the victim\u2019s pubic region and also had taken vaginal and anal swabs. No semen was found in those areas, however. Nothing in the autopsy report indicated that the ultraviolet light had been applied to the victim\u2019s buttocks or to other parts of the victim\u2019s body. With respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to the time of death, Carver testified that the victim had been dead for some time before her body was found. He further opined that the time of death more likely was closer to 9:30 p.m. on October 30,1975, when she was last seen alive, rather than noon the following day, when her body was discovered. Because the autopsy was conducted twenty-four hours after the discovery of the victim\u2019s body, a more precise time of death could not be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u201cHenry Lee, a forensic scientist and the former state chief criminalist, reviewed the documents, photographs and physical evidence compiled by the investigators and performed a partial reconstruction of the crime scene. On the basis of his investigation, Lee testified as to the likely nature and sequence of events leading up to the victim\u2019s death. In particular, he indicated that the golf club that was used to assault and kill the victim probably had broken into pieces from the force with which the victim had been struck. This force, according to Lee, likely propelled the head of the golf club, and a piece of its shaft, over seventy feet, from the location of the fatal assault to the location inside the circular driveway where those pieces subsequently were discovered. According to Lee, the remaining piece of the golf club shaft then was used as a sharp weapon to stab the victim. Lee further testified that, in light of the amount of blood found on the inside of the victim\u2019s jeans and panties, those garments likely were pulled down before the assault occurred. Lee also stated that the absence of vertical blood drippings on the victim\u2019s shoes and jeans indicated that the victim was lying on the ground when the perpetrator inflicted the injuries to her head and neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u201cJames Lunney, a detective with the Greenwich police department in 1975, testified that, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, he briefly visited the [petitioner\u2019s] home and noticed a barrel containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>several items, including golf clubs, in a hallway near the rear of the home. Lunney testified that one of the golf clubs, a Toney Penna four iron, later was seized from the property with the written consent of the [petitioner\u2019s] father. Thomas G. Keegan, a captain in the detective division of the Greenwich police department in 1975, testified that an examination of the seized golf club and the golf club parts found at the crime scene revealed that the murder weapon came from the [petitioner\u2019s] home.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u201cIn the days and months following the victim\u2019s murder, the Greenwich police conducted numerous interviews in furtherance of its criminal investigation into the victim\u2019s death. The [petitioner] and his siblings were among those interviewed in the early stages of that investigation. On November 15, 1975, the [petitioner], who was accompanied by his father, gave a tape-recorded interview to the Greenwich police at the police station. Responding to inquiries concerning his whereabouts on the night of the murder, the [petitioner] explained that he had accompanied his brothers and Dowdle to Dowdle\u2019s home, which was about twenty minutes away, and watched the television show \u2018Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.\u2019 According to the [petitioner], he returned to his home around 10:30 or 11 p.m.,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and went to bed about fifteen minutes later. When asked specifically about whether he left the house after he went to his bedroom that night, the [petitioner] responded, \u2018no.\u2019 The [petitioner] acknowledged, however, that, on other occasions, he had left his home after ostensibly retiring to his room for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u201cIn 1977, two years following the victim\u2019s murder, the [petitioner] revealed certain feelings of guilt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>remorse to Larry Zicarelli, who then was employed by the [petitioner\u2019s] family as a driver and general handyman. While being driven by Zicarelli to an appointment in New York City, the [petitioner], distraught from an earlier altercation with his father, told Zicarelli that he \u2018had done something very bad\u2019 and that he \u2018either had to kill himself or get out of the country.\u2019 On another occasion, Zicarelli and the [petitioner] were stopped in traffic on the Triborough Bridge in New York on their way home when the [petitioner] \u2018opened the [car] door, started to jump out of the car and ran to the side . . . of the bridge.\u2019 Zicarelli ran after the [petitioner] and forced him back into the car. As Zicarelli was proceeding to the driver\u2019s side door, the [petitioner] again exited the car and ran toward the other side of the bridge. Zicarelh once again hurried toward the [petitioner] and forced him back into the car. Just before Zicarelli and the [petitioner] arrived at the Skakel home, Zicarelli asked the [petitioner], \u2018[W]hy would [you] want to do what [you were] trying to do?\u2019 The [petitioner] responded that, \u2018if [you] knew what [I] had done, [you] would never talk to [me] again.\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Immediately following this incident, Zicarehi terminated his employment with the Skakels.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cFrom 1978 to 1980, the [petitioner] was a resident at the Elan School [Elan], a residential facility for troubled adolescents located in [Poland], Maine. Several former Elan residents testified about the deplorable conditions at the institution, which employed a behavioral modification approach predicated on controversial techniques of intimidation, confrontation and humiliation of its residents. As a result, Elan residents regularly endured mental and physical abuse at the hands of their peers and Elan staff members. While a resident at Elan, the [petitioner] frequently was confronted and interrogated about his involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. For example, Charles Seigen, who was enrolled at Elan with the [petitioner] from 1978 to 1979, testified that he recalled attending two or three group therapy sessions, supervised by a staff member and typically attended by eight residents, during which the [petitioner] was confronted about the victim\u2019s murder. According to Seigen, the [petitioner] sometimes responded to such probing with annoyance. On other occasions, however, the [petitioner] became very upset, cried and stated that he did not know if he had done it. The [petitioner] also stated in these group sessions that, on the night of the victim\u2019s murder, he was \u2018blind drunk\u2019 and \u2018stumbling.\u2019<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201cDorothy Rogers, another former resident of Elan, testified that, on one occasion, when she and the [petitioner] were talking at an Elan social function, the [petitioner] told her that he had been drinking on the night of the murder and that he could not recall whether he was involved in the victim\u2019s death. The [petitioner] further explained to Rogers that his family had enrolled him at Elan because they feared that he may have murdered the victim and wanted him in a location far removed from the investigating officers. Gregory Coleman, a resident at Elan from 1978 to 1980, testified about an exchange that he had had with the [petitioner] while Coleman stood \u2018guard\u2019 over the [petitioner] following the [petitioner\u2019s] failed escape attempt from Elan. During this conversation, the [petitioner] confided in Coleman about murdering a girl who had rejected his advances. According to Coleman, the [petitioner] had admitted killing the girl with a golf club in a wooded area, that the force with which he had hit her had caused the golf club to break in half, and that he had returned to the body two days later and masturbated on it. John Higgins, another former resident of Elan, recounted certain emotional admissions that the [petitioner] had made to him while the two were on guard duty one night on the porch of the men\u2019s dormitory at Elan. In particular, Higgins testified that the [petitioner] had told him that, on the night of the murder, there was a \u2018party of some kind or another\u2019 at the [petitioner\u2019s] home. The [petitioner] also told Higgins that he remembered rummaging through his garage looking for a golf club, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>running through the woods with the club and seeing pine trees. Higgins further stated that, as the conversation continued, the [petitioner\u2019s] acknowledgment of his culpability in the victim\u2019s murder progressed from \u2018he didn\u2019t know whether he did it\u2019 to \u2018he may have done it\u2019 to \u2018he must have done it,\u2019 and finally to \u2018I did it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u201cElizabeth Arnold and Alice Dunn, both of whom had attended Elan during the [petitioner\u2019s] stay at the facility, also testified about certain inculpatory statements that the [petitioner] had made to them. Both testified that the [petitioner] had expressed uncertainty as to whether he or his brother had murdered the victim. Arnold also recalled a group therapy session in which the [petitioner], upon being questioned about the victim\u2019s murder, stated that \u2018[h]e was very drunk and had some sort of a blackout\u2019 that night, that his brother had \u2018fool[ed] around\u2019 with his \u2018girlfriend,\u2019 and that his brother had stolen her from him. Dunn, who graduated from Elan in 1978 and subsequently became a staff member there, testified that while she was employed at Elan, the [petitioner] stated that he was not in \u2018his normal state\u2019 on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u201cThereafter, in the summer of 1987, the [petitioner] told Michael Meredith, a former Elan resident who was staying temporarily in the [petitioner\u2019s] home, that, on the night of the victim\u2019s murder, he had climbed a tree on the Moxley property and masturbated in the tree while watching the victim through her window. According to Meredith, he first learned of the victim\u2019s murder in this conversation. The [petitioner] also told Meredith that while he was in the tree, he saw his brother Thomas Skakel walk across the Moxley property toward the victim\u2019s home but that Thomas Skakel had not seen him in the tree. The [petitioner] related a similar story to Andrew Pugh, a close childhood friend, when the two saw one another in 1991. The [petitioner] had expressed a desire to renew their friendship, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>gradually had faded following the victim\u2019s murder. In an effort to ease Pugh\u2019s concerns about the [petitioner\u2019s] involvement in the victim\u2019s death, the [petitioner] assured Pugh that he did not kill the victim but mentioned that he had masturbated in a tree on the night that she was murdered. Pugh understood that the tree to which the [petitioner] referred was the tree under which the victim\u2019s body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u201cThe most descriptive account of the [petitioner\u2019s] activities on the night of the murder came in 1997 from [a tape-recorded] conversation between the [petitioner] and Richard Hoffman, a writer who was collaborating with the [petitioner] on a book about the [petitioner\u2019s] life. On that tape [recording], the [petitioner] explained to Hoffman that, earlier in the evening of the victim\u2019s murder, he had invited the victim, who was seated with the [petitioner] in his father\u2019s car, to accompany him to his cousin\u2019s house to watch the Monty Python Flying Circus television show. The victim declined the invitation because of her curfew, and the two instead made plans to go \u2018trick or treating\u2019 the next night. The [petitioner] thereafter left for Dowdle\u2019s home with his brothers Rushton Skakel, Jr., and John Skakel, as well as Dowdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u201cThe [petitioner] told Hoffman that, after returning to his own home from Dowdle\u2019s house, he had walked through the house in search of various people. Upon observing that the door to his sister\u2019s room was closed, he had *remember[ed] that [his sister\u2019s friend, Shakespeare] had gone home . . . .\u2019He then indicated that he had gone into \u2018the master bedroom [but] there was nobody there, the [television] was on but nobody was there.\u2019 The [petitioner] went upstairs to bed shortly thereafter, but he became \u2018homy\u2019 and decided to spy on a \u2018lady\u2019 who lived on Walsh Lane. The [petitioner] then \u2018snuck out\u2019 of his house and went to this person\u2019s home, hoping to see her through her window. Unsuc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>cessful in that endeavor, he thought, \u2018[f]uck this . . . Martha likes me, I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go get a kiss from Martha.\u2019 . . . The [petitioner] then proceeded to the victim\u2019s home, climbed a tree near the victim\u2019s front door and masturbated in the tree for about thirty seconds. Shortly thereafter, \u2018a moment of clarity came into [his] head,\u2019 and the [petitioner] climbed down from the tree and walked back home. On his way home, he threw rocks into the dark, repeatedly yelling, \u2018Who\u2019s in there?\u2019 He and his Mends previously had done this while shooting BB guns into the dark. The next morning, the [petitioner] awoke to \u2018[Dorothy] Moxley saying \u201cMichael . . . have you seen Martha?\u201d \u2019 The [petitioner] thought to himself, \u2018Oh my God, did they see me last night?\u2019 At that moment, the [petitioner] told Hoffman, he \u2018remember [ed] just having a feeling of panic.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cThe state also adduced evidence establishing that the [petitioner], who was infatuated with the victim, had grown resentful of her flirtatious friendship with his older brother, Thomas Skakel, whom he considered his nemesis. According to Pugh, who in 1975 was friendly with the victim and the [petitioner], the [petitioner] had \u2018told [Pugh] that he liked Martha quite a bit and had a crush on her.\u2019 Pugh also testified that the [petitioner] had told him that \u2018he would have liked to have a relationship with her.\u2019 Pugh testified that he had observed the [petitioner] and the victim engage in \u2018horseplay, roughhousing, fooling around . . . [and] kissing one time in the [Skakel family motor home].\u2019 With respect to Thomas Skakel\u2019s relationship with the victim, Jacqueline Wettenhall O\u2019Hara, a neighborhood friend of the victim, recounted observing flirtatious conduct between the victim and Thomas Skakel in the months leading up to the victim\u2019s death. Entries recorded in the victim\u2019s diary in the two months preceding her murder disclosed the victim\u2019s friendship with the [petitioner] and Thomas Skakel, and also revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the sometimes flirtatious nature of her relationship with Thomas Skakel. In addition, [the victim\u2019s friend] lx testified that she had observed the victim and Thomas Skakel engaging in flirtatious horseplay the last time she saw the victim alive. Moreover, one of the sneakers that the victim was wearing when her body was recovered had the name \u2018Tom\u2019 written on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u201cThe [petitioner] raised an alibi defense at trial. In particular, he claimed that the victim had been murdered at approximately 10 p.m. on October 30, 1975,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that he was at Dowdle\u2019s home, some twenty minutes away from the murder scene, at that time. The [petitioner] also raised a third party culpability defense, pointing to Littleton as a likely perpetrator of the victim\u2019s murder. In fact, Littleton, who had been hired as a part-time tutor by the Skakel family, had taken up residence at the Skakel home on October 30, 1975, the day that the victim was last seen alive, and had slept there with the Skakel children that night. Littleton testified that, after returning home from dinner at 9 p.m., he remained at the house all night, stepping outside briefly at approximately 9:30 p.m. only to investigate a disturbance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, testimony adduced by the [petitioner] revealed that Littleton, who began to manifest serious psychiatric and behavioral problems in the years following the murder, may have made a statement, several years after the killing, in which he implicated himself in the crime. Littleton emphatically denied that he had had anything to do with the victim\u2019s death, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ever.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 640-53. The jury rejected the petitioner\u2019s theories, returning a guilty verdict on the charge of murder, and the trial court, <em>Kavanewsky, J., </em>rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Following this court\u2019s decision affirming the judgment of conviction; id., 770; evidentiary hearings were held on the petitioner\u2019s petition for a new trial. Although the petition had set forth nine counts, the petitioner proceeded on only four of those counts. The trial court, <em>Karazin, J., </em>construed those counts as follows. Count one alleged newly discovered evidence of third party culpability, specifically, statements from Gitano \u201cTony\u201d Bryant implicating two of Biyant\u2019s former high school classmates, Adolph Hasbrouck and Burton Tinsley, in the victim\u2019s murder. Count two alleged newly discovered evidence of witnesses who directly contradicted Coleman\u2019s testimony that the petitioner had confessed to killing the victim. Count six alleged newly discovered exculpatory evidence that the state had failed to disclose, specifically, a composite drawing of a person seen in Belle Haven on the night of the murder whom the petitioner claims resembles Littleton,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> police suspect profile reports on Thomas Skakel and Littleton, and \u201ctime lapse data\u201d chronicling Littleton\u2019s actions, including charged and uncharged criminal conduct, before and after the victim\u2019s murder. Count nine alleged newly discovered evidence relating to a \u201csecret pact and book deal between the state\u2019s lead investigator, Frank Garr, and author Leonard Levitt.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The state filed an answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>essentially denying all of the material allegations. After a hearing and review of all of the evidence adduced in relation to the petition, the trial court denied the request for a new trial as to each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On appeal, the petitioner challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for a new trial on each of the grounds previously raised. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and, therefore, we affirm the judgment. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We begin with the general legal principles that govern our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claims. Pursuant to \u00a7 52-270, a convicted criminal defendant may petition the Superior Court for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. See Practice Book \u00a7 42-55. A trial court\u2019s decision on that ground is governed by the standard set forth in <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 434, 521 A.2d 578 (1987), and further refined in <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 811, 827-28, 792 A.2d 797 (2002). Under the <em>Asherman </em>standard, a court is justified in granting a petition for a new trial when the petitioner demonstrates that the evidence offered in support thereof: (1) is newly discovered such that it could not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>discovered previously despite the exercise of due diligence; (2) would be material to the issues on a new trial; (3) is not cumulative; and (4) is likely to produce a different result in the event of a new trial. <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 434. \u201cThis strict standard is meant to effectuate the underlying equitable principle that once a judgment is rendered it is to be considered final, and should not be disturbed by posttrial motions except for a compelling reason.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThe roots of this test can be traced back as far as 1850, when this court first stated that a petition for a new trial will not be granted if the newly discovered evidence could have been known before the trial, by great diligence or if the evidence is merely cumulative .... <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>20 Conn. 305, 310 (1850). In <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>37 Conn. 563, 564 (1871), we added the requirements that the evidence, in fact, be newly discovered; that it be material; and that, if a new trial were granted a different result would be produced. . . . Id., 565. Finally, in <em>Hamlin </em>v. <em>State, </em>48 Conn. 92, 93-94 (1880), we articulated the test in terms virtually identical to that which we later adopted in <em>Asherman. </em>See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>141 Conn. 202, 208, 104 A.2d 761 (1954); <em>Taborsky </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 619, 623, 116 A.2d 433 (1955); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 163, 148 A.2d 334 (1959); <em>Lombardo </em>v. <em>State, </em>172 Conn. 385, 391, 374 A.2d 1065 (1977); <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Lichtenheim, </em>190 Conn. 351, 355, 460 A.2d 1290 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shabazz v. State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We further explained in <em>Shabazz </em>that, in determining whether a different result would be produced in a new trial, a trial court necessarily must engage in some form of credibility analysis. Id., 827. \u201cThe trial court must always consider the newly discovered evidence in the context of the evidence presented in the original trial. . . . [Thus, if] the trial court determines that the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>dence is sufficiently credible so that, if a second jury were to consider it together with all of the original trial evidence, it probably would yield a different result or otherwise avoid an injustice,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the fourth element of the <em>Asherman </em>test would be satisfied.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 827-28. By a \u201cdifferent, result,\u201d we mean that the new evidence would be likely to result in acquittal of the petitioner, not merely that it might cause one or more jurors to have a reasonable doubt about the petitioner\u2019s guilt. Id., 823 (\u201cit must be evidence which persuades the judge that a jury would find him not guilty\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Lombardo </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 391 (same); see also <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 434, 436 (considering whether admission probably would have led to petitioner\u2019s acquittal). Finally and significantly, it is well settled that whether the evidence satisfies the aforementioned standard is within the trial court\u2019s sole discretion, and the judgment of the trial court will be set aside on appeal only if it reflects a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 434; <em>Ridolfi </em>v. <em>Ridolfi, </em>178 Conn. 377, 379, 423 A.2d 85 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We first turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that he is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of Bryant\u2019s statements inculpating two other persons in the victim\u2019s murder. The petitioner contends that Bryant\u2019s account of the events of October 30, 1975, credibly establishes the motive, opportunity and means for two of Bryant\u2019s former schoolmates, Hasbrouck and Tinsley, to have committed the murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The record discloses the following additional undisputed facts and procedural history. After the petitioner was convicted, Crawford Mills, Bryant\u2019s former Greenwich schoolmate, contacted the petitioner\u2019s cousin, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., with the following information regarding the victim\u2019s homicide. According to Mills, Bryant had said that he knew who had killed the victim, and that it was not the petitioner, but, rather, it was Hasbrouck and Tinsley. Bryant reluctantly had agreed to allow Mills to relay his account to others but told Mills that he did not want his name disclosed and would not come forward with the information himself. Mills initially did not disclose Bryant\u2019s identity, but ultimately decided to do so when no one would credit the information without knowing the source. Kennedy then contacted Bryant and, following several telephone conversations, Bryant agreed to submit to a videotaped interview. On August 24, 2003, Vito Colucci, a private investigator the petitioner had hired, conducted the interview. When Bryant was deposed pursuant to a subpoena on August 25, 2006, however, he invoked his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself in response to every question relating even tangentially to the events of October 30, 1975. Although Hasbrouck and Tinsley initially had spoken willingly with Kennedy and Colucci on several occasions, after they became aware that Bryant had implicated them in the murder, they too invoked their fifth amendment right not to testify at their depositions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Prior to the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the state filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude admission of Bryant\u2019s videotaped statements on the ground that they were hearsay and did not qualify for admission under any exception to the hearsay rule. The parties agreed that the issue of the admissibility of the statements would be reserved until after the court\u2019s review of the videotape at the hearing on the petition. Thereafter, the trial court reviewed the August 24, 2003 videotaped interview of Bryant, heard testimony from various witnesses and reviewed documentary evidence relating to Bryant\u2019s account before issuing any rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In the videotaped interview, Bryant offered the following account of the events leading up to and following the evening of October 30, 1975. At the time of the murder, Bryant was fourteen years old and living in New York City, where he attended Hughes High School. For the previous three school years, however, he had attended Brunswick School (Brunswick), a private school in Greenwich, and lived with a family friend in Greenwich. The petitioner and Bryant had been classmates at Brunswick, but the two were not friends. After Bryant moved to New York, he continued to socialize with many of the young people around Belle Haven and other Greenwich enclaves, in particular, Neal Walker and Byrne.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Hasbrouck and Tinsley were friends of Bryant\u2019s who also attended Hughes High School, although they were about a year older than Bryant. The two accompanied Bryant to Belle Haven four or five times between mid-September and October 30,1975. Bryant was acquainted with the victim from his time living in Greenwich, but Hasbrouck and Tinsley first met her in mid-September at a street fair in Greenwich. Although Hasbrouck never made any direct overtures to the victim, he became \u201cobsessed\u201d with her. He would make comments to Bryant and others that \u201c[s]omeday [he was] going to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>her,\u201d as well as more vulgar variations of that comment, and, on several occasions, stated that he wanted \u201cto go caveman on her,\u201d which meant to Bryant that Hasbrouck would drag her away by the hair and sexually assault her.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">On October 30,1975, the night of the victim\u2019s murder, Bryant took the train to Greenwich with Hasbrouck and Tinsley, heading into Belle Haven somewhere between 6 and 6:20 p.m. They stopped by Walker\u2019s house at approximately 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., but Walker was not able to leave at that time and he told them to come back later. Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley then walked to the house next door, went inside, helped themselves to several six packs of beer in the refrigerator and proceeded to Byrne\u2019s house. Byrne then accompanied the three others as they walked about the neighborhood engaging in various acts of mischief, such as smashing pumpkins. As they walked, they saw other teenagers out in the neighborhood, including lx and Lisa Rader Edwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Bryant and the rest of the group walked behind the Skakel residence, where they found some golf clubs strewn about that each of them handled. Thereafter, Hasbrouck and Tinsley walked around Belle Haven carrying the golf clubs as walking sticks. Bryant and the others proceeded to a large meadow, located behind the Skakel property, where young people in the neighborhood commonly congregated to smoke and drink without being seen by the Belle Haven security guard. Bryant and the others drank several six packs of beer and smoked marijuana. At approximately 8:30 to 8:45 p.m., Bryant saw the victim, as well as the petitioner, at the meadow. Thomas Skakel also came and went, and Bryant waved to Julie Skakel, who, per her usual practice, did not stay at the meadow to socialize. By about 9 p.m., a group of ten to fifteen teenagers, including Bryant, Tinsley and Hasbrouck, had congregated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>together in a circle at the meadow. Tinsley and Hasbrouck made comments and sexual overtures to some of the girls there, which made things uncomfortable. The victim was there around that time, but became \u201cfed up\u201d with what was going on, left the meadow and went over to a group that was standing by the Skakel residence and included at various points the petitioner and Thomas Skakel.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Bryant decided to leave for two reasons. First, he had told his mother that he would catch the last train home, which left at 9:35 or 9:40 p.m. Second, Tinsley and Hasbrouck had gotten \u201cout of control,\u201d making comments that made Bryant uncomfortable, such as: \u201cWhere are the bitches?\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to get into something . . . I\u2019m not going out of here unsatisfied\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m going to get me a girl\u201d; and \u201cI\u2019ve got my caveman club . . . and I\u2019m going to grab somebody and pull them by the hair and do what cavemen do.\u201d While making these comments, Tinsley and Hasbrouck had the golf clubs in hand that they had taken from the Skakel property. Bryant feared that, with the combination of the alcohol, drugs and the personality types of his two friends, anything was possible. Bryant left the group, hitchhiked and caught a ride to the train station from a person whom he knew to be from Belle Haven, but could not identify, and went home. Tinsley and Hasbrouck stayed the night at Byrne\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">When Bryant saw Hasbrouck and Tinsley the Monday following the murder, they told him, \u201cWe did it. We achieved the caveman.\u201d Although neither mentioned the victim by name, Bryant knew that they were talking about her, given both Hasbrouck\u2019s infatuation with her, as well as the New York Times article Bryant\u2019s mother had shown him about the murder. In the days that followed, Hasbrouck and Tinsley continued to brag about having achieved their fantasy of taking a girl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201ccaveman style,\u201d meaning with a club, without expressly mentioning the victim\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In its memorandum of decision denying the petition for a new trial, the trial court first addressed the issue of whether Bryant\u2019s statements were admissible. The trial court determined, in accordance with the factors set forth under the rules of evidence, that \u201c[a] complete analysis of both the time that the statements were made and the people to whom they were made, considered in the context of the unique circumstances of the present case, meets the <em>minimum </em>threshold of trustworthiness to warrant the admission of Bryant\u2019s statements as a statement against penal interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">With respect to the timing of the statements, the trial court noted that Tinsley and Hasbrouck had made their alleged statements to Bryant immediately after the crime, which supported the trustworthiness of those statements. Although Bryant\u2019s recounting of those statements to Mills had been more than twenty-five years later, the court determined that, \u201c[bjecause of the length of the state\u2019s investigation . . . Bryant had an incentive to keep himself out of a case that he reasonably thought would never be solved. . . . [E]ven after the petitioner was arrested and brought to trial, [Bryant] still refused to come forward because he thought there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was no way that [the petitioner] would be convicted. . . . Biyant was a fourteen year old black male who was suddenly faced with information that, by his own admission, was clearly against his penal interest . . . .\u201d For all of these reasons, combined with Bryant\u2019s knowledge that there is no statute of limitations on murder,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the corut concluded that his reluctance to tell his story was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The court then focused on the person to whom Bryant initially had related his story. The court concluded that, because Bryant had made his first disclosure regarding the details of his whereabouts on October 30, 1975, to Mills, with whom he \u201cshared a connection to the facts of this case, dating back to their shared experiences at Belle Haven during the time leading up to the murder,\u201d and then to Kennedy and Colucci, the statements were trustworthy. As further support for the minimum threshold of trustworthiness to warrant admission of Bryant\u2019s statement, the court also noted that Colucci had informed Bryant that he was being sought in connection with a court proceeding, that Bryant was aware that his statements were being videotaped and that it was clear that the recording was being made in anticipation of having it presented in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Next, the court examined the extent to which Bryant\u2019s statements were corroborated by other evidence. The court highlighted the following facts: \u201cBryant went to the Brunswick School, and was classmates with the children in the Belle Haven neighborhood. Several witnesses, including [Mills] and [Walker], confirm[ed] that Bryant socialized at Belle Haven. At the hearing, witnesses confirmed] that <em>Bryant </em>indicated that he was present in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>witness recail[ed] seeing [Hasbrouck] and [Tinsley] in Belle Haven with Bryant during the fall of 1975. Both Hasbrouck and Tinsley admitted to [Kennedy] that they had been in Belle Haven with Bryant on several occasions. Bryant also provide [d] detailed descriptions of the layout of Belle Haven, including accurate recitations of where people in the neighborhood lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cAccording to Bryant, Hasbrouck was [six feet, two inches tall], at least 200 pounds on the date of the homicide, and \u2018veiy strong.\u2019 Bryant stated that [Hasbrouck] was obsessed with [the victim], and \u2018wanted to go caveman on her,\u2019 meaning that he would club her, drag her away by the hair and sexually assault her. On the night of the murder, Bryant stated that he, Hasbrouck and Tinsley walked around Belle Haven with golf clubs from the Skakel residence, with Hasbrouck stating that he had his \u2018caveman club\u2019 and that he would not leave Belle Haven unsatisfied. The victim had suffered multiple and severe injuries to her head and stab wounds to her neck which were consistent with being caused by a piece of golf club shaft. Pieces of the golf club found near the victim\u2019s body were the same brand of golf club found at the Skakel residence. Evidence presented at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial shows that these clubs were commonly left about the Skakel property.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u201cCorroboration of Bryant\u2019s statements can be found in the very reason that he is unavailable to testify. In the present case, Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley have all invoked their fifth amendment right not to incriminate themselves after being served with subpoenas to testify at a deposition.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Finally, the trial court turned to whether Bryant\u2019s statements were against his penal interest. Because Bryant had placed himself in Belle Haven on the night of the murder, in the company of the victim, discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>assaulting the victim with Hasbrouck and Tinsley, and had been in possession of golf clubs belonging to the Skakel family, the trial court concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were against his penal interest. In light of these conclusions, the court ruled that the statements \u201care admitted into evidence, and his self-serving statements go to their weight,\u201d not their admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The trial court then turned to the issue of whether the petitioner was entitled to a new trial on the basis of this evidence. Specifically, the court focused on whether the statements were evidence that, under the fourth prong of <em>Asherman, </em>probably would produce a different result upon retrial. The court noted that there was a \u201csubstantial difference\u201d between the standard it had applied to the admissibility question, which it viewed as a \u201cclose call,\u201d and the standard to be applied under <em>Asherman. </em>The court further noted that, in accordance with <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 825-28, the latter standard required the court to engage in a threshold credibility determination. Ultimately, the court concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements, although admissible, were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The court explained its conclusion as follows: \u201cOn analysis, [Bryant\u2019s statements] are merely claims of information of a crime accompanied by [Bryant\u2019s] alibi. The statements appear to be minimally against his interest. Under the <em>Shabazz </em>review, the statements were made to two former junior high school classmates with whom Bryant maintained only casual contact over the years. Although Bryant acquired his information within days of the offense, he, as a trained lawyer, kept it to himself for over one quarter of a century. On finally disclosing, he insisted upon anonymity. He did not come forward voluntarily, rather, it only happened when [Mills] informed [Kennedy] of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>\u201cThe corroboration for Bryant\u2019s claim is minimal. </em>There was some indication of the knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>geography of Belle Haven, but it is clear that he was there before. Of all the persons in Bryant\u2019s circle of Greenwich acquaintances at the time, none of them other than Walker and Mills recalled his two companions. Not even [the victim\u2019s] closest friends have any recollection of any association between [the victim] and Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley. <em>No one puts [the </em>victim] <em>in the company of Bryant and his companions on the night of October 30,1975. </em>There is no testimony that the three were in her company on any other occasion. <em>Importantly, witnesses testify as to [the victim\u2019s] activities until 9:30 p.m. No one has any recall of ever seeing Bryant and his companions in Belle Haven on the night of the murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u201cThe claim that Hasbrouck and Tinsley went \u2018caveman style\u2019 is not supported by the evidence. There was no evidence of the victim being dragged by the hair. Missing from Bryant\u2019s statement is anything concerning the breaking of the [golf] club or the stabbing of the victim. The testimony of Bryant is absent any <em>genuine </em>corroboration. <em>It lacks credibility, and therefore, would not produce a different result in a new trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">With these facts in mind, we now turn to the specific contentions made by the petitioner in support of his claim that the trial court improperly denied his petition for a new trial on the basis of Bryant\u2019s statements of third party culpability. The petitioner contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted under the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest is inconsistent with its conclusion that the statements were not credible. Although he acknowledges that the trial court may make a minimum credibility determination under <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 827-28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the petitioner contends that, when the court concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were admissible under this hearsay exception, it necessarily determined that his statements satisfied this credibility threshold. He farther contends that the trial court\u2019s favorable findings regarding the factors relevant to the question of admissibility \u2014 corroboration, and against his penal interest\u2014 improperly were contradicted by the court\u2019s unfavorable findings on those same factors when deciding whether the <em>Asherman </em>test for a new trial had been met. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We note that the parties\u2019 dispute as to this evidence focuses solely on the fourth prong of the <em>Asherman </em>test, as the state does not dispute that this evidence is newly discovered, noncumulative and would be material if credible. The standard under which we review the petitioner\u2019s claim is twofold. With respect to his claim that the trial court properly could not engage in a credibility assessment once it determined that the evidence was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, his challenge is to the legal standard applied and, therefore, our review is plenary. <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 820; <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>190 Conn. 667, 669-70, 461 A.2d 1380 (1983). With respect to his challenge to the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements were not credible, that conclusion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The question of whether, after concluding that Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted into evidence, the trial court properly could engage in a credibility analysis is resolved by examining the roles that the trial court played in making each determination. When the trial court determined that Bryant\u2019s statements were admissible, it was engaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>in a gatekeeping function. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 163 n.39, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>84 Conn. App. 519, 529-30, 854 A.2d 74, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 941, 861 A.2d 516 (2004). The trial court simply determined that the evidence met the threshold that would allow the jury to <em>consider </em>the evidence. It was not acting as the trier of fact to determine whether the jury would find the evidence credible.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 154 n.26 (\u201c[i]n determining whether the threshold level of trustworthiness [is] satisfied [for the admissibility of a statement against penal interest offered to exculpate a defendant] the trial court does not have to find it to be absolutely trustworthy because if this were so, the province of the jury as the finder of fact and weigher of credibility would be entirely invaded\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 696-97, 523 A.2d 451 (1987) (\u201cwhere the disserving parts of a statement [against penal interest] are intertwined with self-serving parts, it is more prudential to admit the entire statement and let the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>We previously have explained that, like other hearsay exceptions for unavailable witnesses, a determination that a third party declaration against penal interest is sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted simply means \u201cthat safeguards <em>reasonably equivalent to the oath and the test of cross-examination </em>exist.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Lopez, 254 Conn. 309, 316, 757 A.2d 542 (2000); accord <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Smazer, </em>151 Conn. 226, 232, 196 A.2d 432 (1963) (third party declaration against pecuniary interest). Neither this court nor any other authority of which we are aware supports the proposition that the mere fact that a witness is under oath and subject to cross-examination would require the jury to find that the witness has even a modicum of credibility. Nor does the fact that a different or more stringent test applies to declarations against penal interest than other hearsay exceptions. The more stringent test simply counterbalances the greater risk of fabrication for such statements to ensure that they have the same equivalent safeguards as other hearsay statements when admitted for the fact finder\u2019s consideration. See <em>State </em>v. Lopez, supra, 319 (\u201c[t]hird party statements that exculpate an accused are suspect because of the danger of fabrication\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>221 Conn. 58, 71, 602 A.2d 571 (1992) (requirement of corroboration is for \u201cpuipose of circumventing fabrication\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 452 n.9, 426 A.2d 799 (1980) (admissibility test for third party declarations is designed \u201c[t]o circumscribe fabrication and ensure the [statement\u2019s] reliability\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>21 Conn. App. 386, 395, 574 A.2d 230 (admissibility test for third party declarations exculpating accused is based on \u201cconcem[s] about the dangers of collusion and fabrication\u201d), cert. denied, 216 Conn. 806, 580 A.2d 63 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Thus, when determining admissibility, the trial court makes no determination as to what weight, if any, a jury might give this evidence. Indeed, to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the statements most clearly against penal interest are those that Bryant attributes to Tinsley and Hasbrouck before and after the murder, it is well settled that, when a witness testifies as to declarations against interest by a third party, \u201ca trial court may not consider the credibility of the testifying witness in determining the trustworthiness of a declaration against penal interest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>268 Conn. 351, 372, 844 A.2d 191 (2004); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 391, 528 A.2d 794 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">By contrast, the trial court\u2019s role in applying the fourth prong of the <em>Asherman </em>test is from a different vantage point. In <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 822-24, this court explained: \u201cPrior case law confirms that atrial court must engage in some form of credibility analysis in order to determine, under <em>Asherman, </em>whether the newly discovered evidence offered in support of a petition is likely to produce a different, result on retrial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201c[WJhether a new trial should be granted <em>does not turn on whether the evidence is such that the jury could extend credibility to it. .. . </em>The [petitioner] must persuade the court that the new evidence he submits will probably, not merely possibly, result in a different verdict at a new trial .... It is not sufficient for him to bring in new evidence from which a jury could find him not guilty \u2014 it <em>must be evidence which persuades the judge that a jury </em>[probably] <em>would find him not guilty. . . . </em>This articulation of the petitioner\u2019s burden of proof assigns to the trial court, in the first instance, the responsibility of evaluating the credibility of the evidence in order to decide properly whether a new trial would produce a different result. In elaborating on this point, we explicitly [have] approved of Judge Cardozo\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shilitano, </em>218 N.Y. 161, 180, 112 N.E. 733 (1916), wherein he stated that a judge, faced with conflicting stories [on a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>for a new trial], should [not] abandon the search for truth and turn it over to a jury. . . . [Rather] it [is] the duty of the trial judge to try the facts, and determine as best he [can] where the likelihood of the truth lay. ... He [is] not at liberty to shift upon the shoulders of another jury his own responsibility.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The court in <em>Shabazz </em>went on to state: \u201cAlthough . . . we previously have established that a credibility determination is a necessary part of a trial court\u2019s analysis under the fourth prong of <em>Asherman, </em>we never have defined the proper parameters of such a determination. In this regard, we note that the extent to which a trial court properly assesses the credibility of the newly discovered evidence is informed, in large part, by two well-defined and, often, competing interests. First, the state has a general interest in preserving final judgments of conviction that have been fairly obtained and in ensuring that appropriate deference is given to the original trial as the forum for deciding the question of guilt or innocence within the limits of human fallibility Second, the petitioner has an interest, shared by the state and the judiciary, in ensuring that a wrongful conviction does not stand. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u201cOur formulation of the trial judge\u2019s role in passing on the credibility of newly discovered evidence must strike the appropriate balance between these two interests. <em>If, on the one hand, we were to limit the trial court solely to a determination of whether the newly discovered evidence would be admissible in a new trial and whether it might result in a different verdict, the trial court would be stripped of its legitimate fact-finding function on the petition and [would] be relegated to the role of gatekeeper of the evidence. Such a result would render judgments of conviction unduly susceptible to collateral attacks, thereby giving insufficient weight to the state\u2019s legitimate interest in final</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>ity. </em>Alternatively, were we to hold that the trial court always acts as the final and sole arbiter of credibility in evaluating the evidence alleged to justify a new trial, we would be impeding the petitioner\u2019s legitimate interest in establishing that a wrongful conviction does not stand. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u201cWe therefore conclude that, in order to give due weight and consideration to these important interests, and in order to provide sufficient flexibility to accommodate the wide variety of types of newly discovered evidence that may be offered in support of a petition for a new trial, trial courts should utilize the following approach when applying the fourth element of the <em>Asherman </em>test. The trial court must always consider the newly discovered evidence in the context of the evidence presented in the original trial. <em>In so doing, it must determine, first, that the evidence passes a minimum credibility threshold. That is, if, in the trial court\u2019s opinion, the newly discovered evidence simply is not credible, it may legitimately determine that, even if presented to a new jury in a second trial, it probably would not yield a different result and may deny the petition on that basis. </em>... If, however, the trial court determines that the evidence is sufficiently credible so that, if a second jury were to consider it together with all of the original trial evidence, it probably would yield a different result or otherwise avoid an injustice, the fourth element of the <em>Asherman </em>test would be satisfied.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 825-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Consistent with <em>Shabazz, </em>we conclude that the trial court was not divested of its authority, and indeed responsibility, to examine the credibility of Bryant\u2019s statements following its conclusion that the statements satisfied the minimum threshold for admission as declarations against penal interest. Indeed, in <em>Shabazz, </em>this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>court stated that, \u201cbecause the interests implicated in a petition for a new trial remain the same irrespective of the nature of the newly discovered evidence at issue, we can conceive of no principled basis for maintaining two different tests [for different types of evidence].\u201d Id., 829-30. The court underscored that the failure to apply a credibility analysis in certain cases improperly would \u201crelegate the trial court to the role of evidentiary gatekeeper . . . .\u201d Id., 831 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We also reject the contention advanced by the petitioner that, when doing so, the trial court was precluded from considering any evidence regarding corroboration, or lack thereof, because the court previously had considered whether some aspects of Bryant\u2019s statements were corroborated when determining whether the threshold for admissibility had been met.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In its admissibility determination, the trial court appears to have relied on corroboration for principally peripheral facts in Bryant\u2019s account, such as his visits to Belle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Haven with or without Hasbrouck and Tinsley <em>prior </em>to the night of the murder, whereas, in its credibility determination, discussed in part I B 2 of this opinion, the court appears to have focused on the lack of corroboration for material facts relating to the night of the murder. Although the trial court <em>could </em>have considered all evidence relating to corroboration when addressing the admissibility question, its bifurcation of the corroboration evidence was not improper.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Corroboration is only one of several factors that determines the trustworthiness of third party declarations against penal interest, and we have instructed the trial courts to consider the totality of the circumstances rather than to view each factor as necessarily conclusive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 316 (\u201cWe previously have emphasized . . . that no single factor in the test we adopt for determining the trustworthiness of third party declarations against penal interest is necessarily conclusive .... Thus, it is not necessary that the trial court find that all of the factors support the trustworthiness of the statement. The trial court should consider all of the factors and determine whether the totality of the circumstances supports the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In the present case, the trial court considered some of the corroboration evidence and determined that this evidence, considered as part of the totality of circumstances, was sufficient to admit Bryant\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>as declarations against penal interest. The petitioner\u2019s approach would not only be contrary to <em>Shabazz, </em>but also would force trial courts to apply a higher threshold for admissibility so as not to abdicate their right to review all pertinent evidence when making their determination as to whether the proffered evidence probably would yield a different result on retrial. We cannot sanction such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In light of our conclusion that the trial court properly considered the credibility of Bryant\u2019s statements, we turn to the question of whether its conclusion that this evidence \u201cis absent any genuine corroboration . . . lacks credibility, and therefore, would not produce a different result in a new trial\u201d constituted an abuse of discretion. In so doing, we are mindful that evidence of third party culpability, if credible, undoubtedly would be of great significance in a retrial. We also are mindful, however, that, \u201cwhen reviewing the action of a trial court under an abuse of discretion standard, we should read the record to support, rather than contradict, [the trial court\u2019s ruling].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>266 Conn. 674, 692 n.16, 835 A.2d 451 (2003); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 667, 969 A.2d 750 (2009) (\u201c[i]n determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 724 (\u201c[i]n determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, and we will upset that ruling only for a manifest abuse of discretion\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We, therefore, have scrutinized carefully all of the evidence presented at the hearing on the petition that bears on this issue, and we conclude that the lack of corroboration, as well as the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>stances under which Bryant\u2019s allegations emerged, fully support the trial court\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The documentary and testimonial evidence presented to the trial court on the petition for a new trial reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the following evidence relating to whether Bryant\u2019s account was credible. As the trial court noted, not a <em>single </em>witness who Bryant claimed to have seen or with whom he claimed to have spoken, including his close friend Walker, or anyone who was out in the neighborhood that night recalled Bryant\u2019s presence or that of Hasbrouck and Tinsley. Perhaps most significantly, none of the girls who Bryant claims were in the meadow when Tinsley and Hasbrouck supposedly made comments and sexual overtures that created an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d situation reported their presence or this incident \u2014 an incident that would seem highly relevant following the discovery the next day of the half naked, brutalized teenage female victim who allegedly was in the meadow when these comments were made. Bryant\u2019s description of his companions also suggests that they would have been noticed had they been there. Although Tinsley and Hasbrouck had been to Belle Haven on a few occasions, Bryant described them as \u201coutsiders.\u201d He also described them both as approximately six feet, two inches tall and 200 pounds, Hasbrouck as African-American and Tinsley as mixed race. Bryant also is African-American and was six feet tall, and 160 to 170 pounds at the time of the murder. These three young men did not look like the average fourteen or fifteen year olds who would have blended into the crowd,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>particularly not in an area that was described by one witness as \u201ca fairly lily-white community.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We also note that one person who Bryant claimed to have seen walking about the neighborhood that night, Edwards, unequivocally stated that she was not even out in the neighborhood that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The evidence also contradicts Bryant\u2019s account of the location of the principal parties to the events of that evening. Bryant claimed that the victim had been with his group in the meadow in the latter part of the evening, yet other people who undeniably had been with the victim accounted for her whereabouts throughout the entire evening at other locations. Bryant also claimed that Byrne, who had died in 1980 and was only eleven or twelve years old at the time of the homicide, had been with Bryant and his two friends that evening, had been a witness to the murder and had allowed Hasbrouck and Tinsley to spend the night at Byrne\u2019s house. Several witnesses, however, placed Byrne with the victim and other friends at various times that night, and all of this testimony placed him with the victim and her friends by no later than approximately 9 p.m. In his police interviews, Byrne never stated that Bryant, Hasbrouck or Tinsley had been with him that night, but instead told the police that he had been at the Skakel house with the victim and others and had gone home after dropping lx off at her house around 9:30 p.m.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Significantly, Byrne\u2019s sister stated in a tape-recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>interview that their father had been on the porch when Byrne came home at 9:30 p.m., and that their mother had told her that she had seen Byrne <em>in his bed at 10 p.m. that night.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, at the very point in time when the petitioner claims the victim was murdered, a murder to which Bryant claims Byrne bore witness, Byrne\u2019s mother saw him in his bed. Byrne\u2019s sister further indicated that their mother was certain that Tinsley and Hasbrouck were not at the Byrnes\u2019 house that night, and Byrne\u2019s brother stated that he had arrived at the Byrne house at 8 a.m. on the morning of October 31, had seen Byrne several times around the house that morning, and did not see Tinsley or Hasbrouck.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The record also reflects no corroboration for the alleged motive for the murder, namely, Hasbrouck\u2019s supposed obsession with the victim. Bryant claimed with certainty that, prior to October 30, 1975, Walker and Mills both had heard Hasbrouck make comments about wanting to go \u201ccaveman\u201d on the victim. Neither Walker nor Mills, however, had any recollection of such comments or even that Hasbrouck had an \u201cobsession\u201d with the victim. Significantly, Walker testified that, if he ever had heard either Tinsley or Hasbrouck make the \u201ccaveman\u201d or other graphic comments about the victim that Bryant attributed to them, he would have informed the police. As there is no record of any such report, presumably no such comments were made in Walker\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Similarly, Bryant\u2019s account of when Hasbrouck and Tinsley obtained the murder weapon is not corroborated by the record. Bryant stated in his interview with Colucci: \u201cEverybody in Belle Haven touched those clubs. We used to hit balls behind the house.\u201d Bryant indicated that they would find the golf clubs on the \u201cback porch,\u201d which Bryant described as an \u201cextension of [the Skakels\u2019] yard,\u201d \u201cjust laying around.\u201d Bryant then recounted that, on the night of the murder, \u201cI picked up one. [Tinsley] picked up one. [Hasbrouck] picked up one. [Byrne] picked up one. And we were, like, goofing around. ... I had swung it and put mine down. I didn\u2019t even put it down, I swung it back to where the bag \u2014 there was like a bag that was sort of laying there and so I swung it back toward the bag. . . . [Tinsley and Hasbrouck] were using them as sort of like walking sticks.\u201d Although, as the trial court noted, there was testimony at the criminal trial that golf clubs commonly were left around the Skakel yard and thus Bryant\u2019s account of handling the clubs <em>prior to </em>the night of the murder was corroborated to some extent by that evidence, the evidence adduced at that trial did not corroborate his account with respect to the night of the murder. As we noted in <em>State v. Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 644, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, Detective James Lunney of the Greenwich police department found golf clubs <em>inside </em>the Skakel house, in a barrel in the mudroom.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Lunney made that discoveiy in the course of a neighborhood canvass for golf clubs that might be mates to the murder weapon, after he and another police officer walked from the crime scene <em>through the Skakel backyard </em>and into the back door of the Skakel house. The evidence at trial also indicated that, although numerous people had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>spent time in or walked through the Skakel backyard on the night of the murder, no one reported observing any golf clubs or a golf bag lying about the yard, despite the fact that it was well known in Belle Haven and the surrounding neighborhoods that the police were looking for golf clubs and the missing section to the murder weapon.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Indeed, the petitioner\u2019s family had every incentive to bring a witness forward who could place the golf clubs outside the house that night, but could not produce any such witness. Police records indicate that Franz Wittine, the Skakels\u2019 chauffeur and handyman, gave a statement reporting that, on the day of the murder, \u201cI was working about the Skakel property for most of the day and during this time didn\u2019t observe any golf clubs lying about the property, nor adjacent to the house, nor did I find any golf clubs lying about the property for the past couple of weeks.\u201d Thus, all of the evidence points to the conclusion that there were no golf clubs in the Skakel yard before, during, or after the time period when Bryant claims that he and his friends allegedly were there handling the clubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In sum, there is no evidence, <em>independent of Bryant, </em>to corroborate any significant aspect of his account of the events of the night of October 30, 1975, whereas there is a plethora of evidence to contradict his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>account.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Contrary to the approach advocated by the petitioner, the mere fact that one could hypothesize explanations for the lack of corroboration as to particular facts does not render improper the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements lack \u201cany genuine corroboration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The petitioner contends, however, that the trial court improperly failed to credit certain statements that he claims corroborate the fact that Bryant, Tinsley and Hasbrouck were in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. We note that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not address these statements, and, therefore, we do not know whether the trial court found the testimony not to be credible, noncorroborative or irrelevant. Even if we were to assume that the trial court found the statements credible, our review of these statements, read in the full context of the witnesses\u2019 testimony and the record, indicate that these statements were explained in a manner fully consistent with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>conclusion that they were not materially corroborative of Bryant\u2019s rendition of the facts. Under the abuse of discretion standard, we do not selectively isolate those parts of a witness\u2019 testimony that undermine the trial court\u2019s conclusion to the exclusion of other evidence that supports its conclusion. Rather, \u201cevery reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Specifically, the petitioner points to Colucci\u2019s testimony stating that Hasbrouck and Tinsley had admitted to him that they were in Belle Haven on October 30, 1975. Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the trial court credited Colucci\u2019s testimony, despite the questionable circumstances under which these alleged admissions were made, the complete record indicates that Hasbrouck and Tinsley initially recalled not being in Belle Haven that night, indicated in later conversations that they had been there, but, upon checking their calendars, subsequently confirmed that they had not been there that night.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The trial court reasonably could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>have concluded that Tinsley and Hasbrouck simply were unclear in their recollection of whether they had been in Belle Haven on that date thirty years ago, having been there on previous occasions near that time, until they checked the day of the week on which October 30,1975, fell and realized that they would not have been there that night because it was a Thursday and, hence, a school night. Indeed, the trial court reasonably could have taken into account the unlikelihood that Tinsley and Hasbrouck would have willingly and repeatedly discussed past visits to Belle Haven and their whereabouts on the night of the murder if indeed they had committed the murder.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The petitioner also relies on a statement made by Bryant\u2019s mother, Barbara Bryant, to two private investigators hired by the petitioner, that her son, Tinsley and Hasbrouck had been in Belle Haven that night, as well as her deposition testimony that he had been in Connecticut earlier that day. Barbara Bryant\u2019s full testimony reveals, however, that she repeatedly stated that her son had arrived home well before dark on October 30, 1975, that she offered evidence in support of that fact and that her statement to the contrary to the investigators was simply a repetition of what her son had told her <em>after </em>his account had become public knowledge.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Thus, accepting as trae the part of Barbara Bryant\u2019s testimony based on personal knowledge, the best that can be said is that it gives rise to the possibility of a grain of truth in her son\u2019s elaborate story, namely, that he may have been in Greenwich on the afternoon of October 30, 1975. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court not to credit the statements of Barbara Bryant upon which the petitioner relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The petitioner also points to certain physical evidence from the crime scene that he claims corroborates the involvement of Hasbrouck and Tinsley. Specifically, two human hairs were found on a sheet used to cover the victim\u2019s body, one with \u201c[njegroid\u201d characteristics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and the other \u201cpossibly\u201d having an Asian DNA profile.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Close examination of that evidence, however, reveals the de minimis nature of that supposed corroboration. Although it was undisputed that Hasbrouck is African-American,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> there is no clear evidence as to Tinsley\u2019s race. Bryant\u2019s mother recalled him as white, Mills recalled him as African-American, and only Bryant described Tinsley as being of \u201cmixed race\u201d and possibly part Asian. It is clear that the sheet was placed over the victim after the discovery of her body, but there was no evidence presented to the trial court to establish where it had come from or who had placed it there. At the criminal trial, Henry Lee, one of the state\u2019s forensic experts, had testified about the limited value of hair as an identifier. Lee also had described the concept of secondary hair transfer, explaining that the hair could have fallen on the sheet at any time. Given these factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting this evidence. Indeed, with respect to other physical evidence, contrary to Bryant\u2019s understanding of what the alleged \u201cachieved the caveman\u201d comments meant, there was no evidence that the victim had been pulled by her hair. Nor was there any evidence of semen to corroborate the allegedly completed sexual assault.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In addition to the lack of corroboration, the trial court found reason to question the credibility of Bryant\u2019s account in light of the particular circumstances under which he had disclosed this account so many years after the events in question. We agree. Specifically, Mills testified that he and Bryant had had infrequent contact with each other after Bryant left Brunswick. During a telephone conversation in late 2001, well after the petitioner\u2019s January, 2000 arrest warrant had been issued and while his criminal trial was pending, Bryant asked Mills about \u201cLittle Martha,\u201d a screenplay that Mills had been working on for many years that included a fictionalized account of the victim\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Bryant suggested that he and Mills collaborate on the screenplay. It was only after Bryant reviewed the screenplay, in which Mills had used composite characters to represent the petitioner, Thomas Skakel and Littleton as suspects, that Bryant named Hasbrouck and Tinsley as the \u201creal\u201d peipetrators of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The fact that Bryant relayed this account directly in connection with his offer to assist in the development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of a screenplay provided an additional reasonable basis for the trial court to question the veracity of the account. Indeed, at the time he relayed this account, Bryant never asked Mills to provide this information to others who could aid the petitioner or who could bring charges against the two men who Bryant claimed had committed the murder and who he claimed should be punished. Logic would dictate that, if Bryant\u2019s motivation actually had been to make this information known both to aid the petitioner but to do so <em>without disclosing his identity, </em>he would not have told a friend with whom he had had only limited contact since high school, but, rather, would have made an anonymous telephone call or sent an anonymous letter to the petitioner\u2019s attorney or to the state\u2019s attorney. Mills had no knowledge to substantiate Bryant\u2019s account. Furthermore, we note that the record indicates that Bryant\u2019s account to Mills, and later to Walker, may not have been the only time that Bryant lied to or misled these friends.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Finally, like the trial court, we decline to speculate as to why Bryant invoked his fifth amendment right not to testify. It is not surprising that counsel advised Bryant, Tinsley and Hasbrouck to remain silent when they had nothing personally to gain by coming forward and the state already had convicted someone else of the crime. The sole question we must answer is whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Bryant\u2019s account, while sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, \u201cis absent any genuine corroboration . . . lacks credibility, and therefore, would not produce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>different result in a new trial.\u201d Given the weight of evidence in the record to amply support this conclusion, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for a new trial on the basis of Bryant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The petitioner also claims that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of evidence that, prior to his criminal trial, Garr, who had worked first as a police detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>on the victim\u2019s murder case when the investigation was reopened in 1991 and later as lead investigator in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office in 1994, had engaged in a \u201csecret pact\u201d and book deal with Levitt about the petitioner\u2019s criminal case.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In the foreword to a book Levitt wrote that was published in 2004, he referred to his relationship with Garr and noted: \u201cAt our lowest ebb, we made a pact to tell our story. Here it is.\u201d L. Levitt, Conviction: Solving the Moxley Murder: A Reporter and a Detective\u2019s Twenty Year Search for Justice (Regan Books 2004), forward, p. x. According to the petitioner, Levitt and Garr had a secret arrangement to write a book about the case that caused Garr to have a \u201cparticularly unique bias\u201d against the petitioner that \u201cundermin[ed] Garr\u2019s credibility in his selection, investigation and use of . . . witnesses, and . . . dilutes the already tenuous probative value and effect of the circumstantial evidence\u201d on which the petitioner had been convicted. As evidence of the effect of this bias, the petitioner points to statements in Levitt\u2019s book indicating that Garr had \u201cthreatened witnesses leading up to and during the petitioner\u2019s trial.\u201d The petitioner contends that the trial court improperly concluded that this evidence was not newly discovered and that, had this evidence been disclosed to the jury at his criminal trial, it would not have impacted the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The state requests that we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on the alternate ground that, because the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tioner had failed to plead this claim properly and it was time barred, the trial court should not have considered it. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Should this court reach the merits, the state claims that: (1) the petitioner failed to establish that this evidence was unknown or undiscoverable through the exercise of due diligence at or prior to trial because the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had heard rumors about the book deal, could have called as witnesses the sources of these rumors and chose not to question Garr himself about the book; and (2) even had the rumors been explored or Garr been questioned in the criminal trial, such testimony would not have produced a different result. We conclude that, even if we were to assume without deciding that the petitioner properly had pleaded this claim and that this evidence was newly discovered, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the petitioner was not entitled to a new trial because of the petitioner\u2019s failure to prove that this evidence probably would result in an acquittal on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The record discloses the following additional undisputed facts. On or about May 21, 2001, the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial attorney, Michael Sherman, filed a motion for discovery and inspection, requesting, inter alia, disclosure of evidence that any agent of the state had a \u201cpecuniary or other interest in the development and/or outcome of this case, including, but not limited to, any contract, agreement, or on-going negotiations, which relate to the preparation of any book . . . .\u201d The trial court, <em>Kavanewsky, J., </em>denied the request as written, but granted it limited to the state\u2019s witnesses. The petitioner received no evidence from the state in response to this request prior to trial. During the course of the criminal trial, Garr testified outside the presence of the jury. When Garr was asked by Sherman whether he had a book deal, the state objected on relevancy grounds. Sherman did not challenge that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>At the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the petitioner presented three witnesses, Levitt, Garr and Sherman, to testify in connection with this claim. In its decision rejecting the claim, the trial court, Karazin, J., recited the following testimony. Levitt testified that he began covering the victim\u2019s murder case as a reporter in 1982. In 1995, he published an article in Newsday recounting the findings of Sutton Associates, a private investigation firm hired by the petitioner\u2019s father, Rush-ton Skakel, Sr., that disclosed that Thomas Skakel and the petitioner had given the firm different accounts of their activities on the night of the murder than they had given to the police in 1975. Shortly after the article was published, Garr contacted Levitt, expressed interest in the information that Levitt had obtained, which had not been available to Garr, and the two men became friends. Levitt had been thinking of writing a book about the homicide and had made inquiries prior to the grand jury convening in 1998. Levitt expressed his interest to Garr and even sought his help in this endeavor, but, according to Levitt, Garr consistently had refused, stating that he would not help Levitt until the case concluded. Although Levitt stated in the book that he and Garr had made a \u201cpact\u201d to tell their story, Levitt testified that there had been no conversations regarding compensation at that time. It was only after the petitioner\u2019s conviction that Levitt concluded that it seemed only fair to split the book profits with Garr, and, in February, 2003, he entered into an agreement to do so. The <em>lowest </em>ebb to which Levitt also had referred in the book\u2019s foreword was the period after the publication of Mark Fuhrman\u2019s book about the victim\u2019s murder case, in which Fuhrman, and later others, had made disparaging remarks about the Greenwich police department\u2019s investigation into the victim\u2019s homicide.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Levitt further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>testified that it was only after the case had concluded and he knew the \u201cend\u201d of the story that he began working on the book. Additionally, Levitt explained that, although he had stated in the book that reluctant witnesses had related that Garr \u201ccajoled, harassed, or threatened them,\u201d he simply meant that Garr had told witnesses that, if they did not come forward voluntarily, he would subpoena them. Garr testified that, although he had met with Levitt and reviewed drafts of the book, his role was limited to pointing out inaccuracies; he had no role in drafting and provided no access to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Sherman testified that, prior to trial, he had received \u201c \u2018pretty good information\u2019 \u201d that Garr had a book deal. Although Levitt never had made such an assertion, Sherman identified three persons as his sources regarding the alleged deal \u2014 Fuhrman, Tim Dumas and Dominick Dunne \u2014 all of whom had written about the victim\u2019s murder case. Sherman testified that it was because of these rumors about Garr having a \u201cbook deal\u201d that he had filed the aforementioned motion for discovery. Sherman claimed that, if he had known about the alleged pact Levitt mentioned in <em>his </em>book, he would have made Garr\u2019s financial motive a central theme of the petitioner\u2019s defense. Finally, Sherman testified that he had spoken to the state\u2019s witnesses prior to trial and concluded that Garr had been \u201cheavy-handed\u201d in his treatment of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">On the basis of this testimony, the trial court then essentially made two determinations before denying the petitioner\u2019s claim in connection with this evidence. First, the trial court turned to the issue of whether the evidence offered in support of the petitioner\u2019s claim for a new trial was newly discovered, meaning that it could not have been discovered previously despite the exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>cise of due diligence. The court determined that the petitioner had not established that \u201cany evidence regarding Garr and Levitt was unknown or undiscoverable through the exercise of due diligence at or prior to trial.\u201d It reasoned that Sherman had heard rumors of a book deal involving Garr and should have pursued them. Specifically, all three of the sources of these rumors \u2014 Fuhrman, Dumas and Dunne \u2014 had attended the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial in 2002, and \u201c[n]othing prevented Sherman from inquiring further to see if any of those persons had information regarding an alleged book deal.\u201d Additionally, in light of Judge Kavanewsky\u2019s ruling granting the petitioner\u2019s discovery request for information of potential pecuniary gain by the state\u2019s witnesses, the trial court concluded that it was apparent that, had Sherman \u201crequested a ruling from the court when he asked Garr about a book deal, the court would have overruled the state\u2019s objection.\u201d Next, the trial court examined whether the evidence, even if newly discovered, was likely to produce a different result in the event of a new trial. Second, the court concluded that, even \u201c[i]f [the] petitioner had presented this evidence . . . that [Garr] told his friend [that] if he wrote a book he would try to help him, but he could not do anything until the case was over, [it] is not evidence that would have swayed the jury as to lead it to acquit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Whether trial counsel has fulfilled his or her duty to conduct a reasonable investigation forms the linchpin issue in a petition for a new trial made on the basis of newly discovered evidence. \u201c[T]o entitle a party to a new trial for newly-discovered evidence, it is indispensable that he should have been diligent in his efforts fully to prepare his cause for trial; and if the new evidence relied upon could have been known with reasonable diligence, a new trial will not be granted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Terracino </em>v. <em>Fairway Asset </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Management, Inc., </em>75 Conn. App. 63, 77, 815 A.2d 157, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 920, 822 A.2d 245 (2003). Therefore, \u201c[t]he [petitioner] has the burden of proving that the evidence . . . could not have been discovered and produced [in] the former trial by the exercise of due diligence . . . .\u201d <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>supra, 190 Conn. 670; accord <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 434. \u201cDue diligence does not require omniscience. Due diligence means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible. . . . The question which must be answered is not what evidence might have been discovered, but rather what evidence would have been discovered by a reasonable plaintiff by persevering application, [and] untiring efforts in good earnest.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>supra, 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We recognize that, with due diligence and reasonable effort at or prior to the criminal trial, the petitioner <em>might </em>have been able to pursue further the \u201crumors\u201d of a book deal because Dumas, Dunne and Fuhrman had attended the criminal trial in 2002 and clearly were available to be called as witnesses at that time. Additionally, in light of Judge Kavanewsky\u2019s ruling on the petitioner\u2019s discovery request, the petitioner <em>might </em>have been given permission to question Garr about the book, any expectation of financial gain or his meetings or sharing of information with Levitt, despite the \u201clook\u201d the trial court gave to Sherman after he had asked a question about the book deal. Therefore, we are hesitant to conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the evidence was not newly discovered. On the other hand, we are hesitant to suggest that the state can avoid the deleterious impact of any failure to comply fully with its obligations under <em>Brady </em>v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), simply because one of its investigators has not been forthcoming about information relevant to a discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>request filed with the specific purpose of obtaining that particular information. See <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>229 Conn. 125, 135, 640 A.2d 572 (1994) (\u201cnondisclosure of the reports and statements constitutes suppression by the prosecution even if, at the time of the hearing on probable cause, the reports and statements were in the police files rather than the prosecutor\u2019s files\u201d); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 91, 621 A.2d 728 (1993) (\u201c[e]vidence known to the defendant or his counsel, or that is disclosed, even if during trial, is not considered suppressed as that term is used in Brady\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that, even if we were to determine that the evidence was newly discovered, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that this evidence likely would not result in an acquittal upon retrial. The petitioner has made vague claims of witness intimidation, but has pointed to no witness whose testimony was affected by Garr\u2019s conduct, and the petitioner has pointed to no evidence that was suppressed by Garr such that the petitioner was prevented from preparing his defense. Although the petitioner argues in his brief that Garr failed to investigate Coleman\u2019s testimony, as we explain in greater detail in part III of this opinion, the petitioner had equal access to evidence that could corroborate or discredit Coleman\u2019s testimony. Thus, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the petitioner was not entitled to a new trial on the basis of the evidence regarding Garr\u2019s agreement to assist Levitt with the writing of Levitt\u2019s book.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We next turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his petition for a new trial on the basis of testimony from former Elan residents that would contradict the testimony of Coleman, the state\u2019s only witness to attest unequivocally that the petitioner had confessed to killing the victim. The petitioner contends that, despite reasonable efforts, these witnesses whom Coleman had named as possibly having overheard the confession could not be located prior to trial. He further contends that, only after trial and exerting <em>extraordinary </em>efforts was he able locate these witnesses, who would testify that they never had heard the petitioner make such a confession and would cast doubt on Coleman\u2019s credibility generally. The petitioner, therefore, claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) these witnesses could have been discovered prior to trial with due diligence; and (2) their testimony was largely cumulative of other former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Elan residents who never had heard the petitioner confess, was not material and was unlikely to result in an acquittal upon retrial. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proving that this evidence was newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts and procedural history. Coleman testified before the grand jury in 1999, and at the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing, but, because he died in 2001, his probable cause testimony was read into the record at trial. As we previously have noted in our discussion of the evidence at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Coleman testified that, one night, while he was guarding the petitioner in the Elan dining hall after the petitioner\u2019s unsuccessful escape from the facility, the petitioner had said \u201cI am going to get away with murder because I am a Kennedy.\u201d According to Coleman, the petitioner then stated \u201chow he had made advances to this girl where he lives and that she spumed his advances and that he drove her skull in with a golf club.\u201d The petitioner told Coleman that this had happened in \u201ca wooded area\u201d and that \u201che had hit her so hard that the golf club had broken in half.\u201d Coleman acknowledged that, in his grand jury testimony, he had testified that another Elan resident \u2014 either John Simpson, Cliff \u201cReubin\u201d or Everette James \u2014 was working with him in the dining hall that night and could have overheard the petitioner make this confession. None of these witnesses testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">At the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the petitioner offered testimony from Cliff <em>Grubin </em>\u2014 not Reubin, as misstated by Coleman, James, whose full name is Alton Everette James III, and Simpson. Grubin, whom the petitioner had located in Ibiza, Spain, testified that he never had guarded the petitioner at Elan and never had heard him confess to killing the victim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Grubin further testified that Coleman once had stated that he \u201cwas a very good liar.\u201d James, whom the petitioner had located in Virginia, recalled guarding the petitioner on more than one occasion, but stated that he never had heard the petitioner confess to killing the victim on those or any other occasions. Simpson, whom the petitioner located in Florida, recalled guarding the petitioner on one occasion in which Coleman suddenly had stated that the petitioner \u201cjust admitted that he killed this girl,\u201d but Simpson explained that it had become evident upon his questioning of the petitioner that he had made no such admission, and Simpson never heard such an admission at any other time.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The petitioner also presented testimony from Sherman, Colucci and Keith Weeks, a private investigator, regarding the steps they had taken to procure the testimony of these three witnesses. Sherman testified that, prior to trial, he had told Colucci to do what he could to locate these witnesses and \u201csee if we can get them on the phone.\u201d Colucci testified, however, that the young attorney at Sherman\u2019s office to whom Colucci actually reported only had directed him to look for James and that no one in Sherman\u2019s office ever had told him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>look for Simpson or Grubin. Although testimony and documentary evidence established that Colucci had found an address for James in April, 2002, and subsequently a telephone number, Sherman stated, \u201cwe just . . . couldn\u2019t connect on the phone with him.\u201d Sherman acknowledged that he never directed Colucci to see whether any of the Elan residents whose contact information they did have knew the whereabouts of any of the three witnesses. Colucci eventually spoke to James in 2004, after he had been hired by the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Weeks testified that he had been hired by the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel in May, 2005, to locate Simpson and Cliff \u201cReubin.\u201d Weeks only knew their names and the time frame during which they had resided at Elan. Weeks ran several unsuccessful computer searches, but then found a posting on an Internet message board set up by former Elan students from a Cliff \u201cGrubin,\u201d who listed his attendance at Elan from 1978 to 1980. The posting listed a city and state of residence and an e-mail address. Weeks unsuccessfully attempted to track Grubin down through his place of residence, but eventually sent Grubin an e-mail at the address provided on the message board. Grubin responded seven days later, and Weeks interviewed him shortly thereafter. Weeks found Simpson through information that Weeks had acquired from various former Elan residents and eventually pieced together to obtain contact information. Weeks stated that it took him approximately one month to locate Simpson, whom Weeks referred to as \u201cthe most difficult person I have ever had to locate.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The trial court concluded that efforts to locate the three witnesses prior to and during trial did not satisfy due diligence. The court further concluded that these witnesses could have been located using the same methods that ultimately were used after trial to locate them. Therefore, the court concluded that the evidence was not newly discovered within the meaning of \u00a7 52-270. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">It is highly significant that this evidence is not newly discovered in the sense that the petitioner did not know of the existence of these witnesses prior to trial. Coleman had identified these witnesses <em>years </em>before trial. Moreover, the petitioner should have known that Coleman\u2019s testimony, if credited, could be a key piece of evidence in the state\u2019s case. Sherman apparently concluded, however, that cross-examination of Coleman at trial would be sufficient to discredit him, as he justified his lack of direction to Colucci about locating these witnesses by the fact that he \u201cdidn\u2019t anticipate that . . . Coleman would be dead at the [time of] trial . . . [and] believed that the jury would see [him].\u201d Sherman had James\u2019 contact information in the spring of 2002, but could not \u201cconnect\u201d with him. <em>No </em>effort was made to locate Simpson or Grubin prior to or during the trial. Therefore, we fully agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Sherman had failed to exercise due diligence to locate the three witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The petitioner contends that these witnesses could not have been located prior to trial because the state was unable to locate them, despite reasonable efforts to do so. Although that fact <em>might </em>demonstrate that these witnesses similarly could not have been discovered by the petitioner before trial with the exercise of due diligence, the testimony to which the petitioner draws our attention does not establish such efforts by the state. Garr indicated that he had a vague recollection of \u201cpossibly\u201d attempting to contact Simpson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>thought that the state had made \u201csome attempts\u201d to find another witness who possibly lived abroad, to no avail. He never stated what efforts had been made to locate these witnesses, and, therefore, the state\u2019s efforts in this regard cannot demonstrate that the witnesses could not have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence. Garr also testified that he believed that he had spoken with James, but that James was uncomfortable talking about his experiences at Elan and had no information. We disagree with the petitioner that this testimony establishes that the petitioner\u2019s efforts would have been thwarted had he approached James during the same time period. James willingly submitted to a deposition when he ultimately was approached on behalf of the petitioner, and there is no indication in the record that James would not have cooperated had he been approached by the petitioner prior to or during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The petitioner also contends that it was improper for the trial court to presume that the methods that ultimately were successful in locating Simpson and Grubin in 2005 similarly would have been successful had they been applied in 2002 or earlier. He further contends that, even if we were to assume that the methods used to find Grubin and Simpson <em>after </em>trial would have enabled the petitioner to contact them <em>prior </em>to or <em>during </em>the trial, his posttrial efforts were so extraordinary that they exceeded what is required to meet the due diligence standard. In essence, the petitioner\u2019s claim is that due diligence prior to or during the trial would not have yielded the location of these witnesses so he should not be penalized for failing to exercise such diligence. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">It is the <em>petitioner\u2019s </em>burden to prove that the efforts used to find these witnesses would not have yielded the same result had they been applied earlier. <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 434 (\u201c[t]he petitioner must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that . . . the proffered evidence is newly discovered, such that it could not have been discovered earlier by the exercise of due diligence\u201d); <em>Terracino </em>v. <em>Fairway Asset Management, Inc., </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 75 (\u201c[t]he burden of showing due diligence [rests] solely and throughout on the [petitioner]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 514, 545, 717 A.2d 1161 (1998) (\u201c[A] petition for a new trial is a civil action .... In this civil action, the petitioner is just that, a petitioner, and, therefore, in the trial court he bore the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that newly discovered evidence warranted the granting of a new trial.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). The trial court was not required to infer that the petitioner had met his burden of proof from the evidence demonstrating no actual effort to locate these witnesses prior to trial and from the <em>absence </em>of evidence as to whether pretrial efforts would have been successful. The petitioner has not drawn our attention to any testimony adduced from these witnesses as to their accessibility during the pretrial period in relation to the methods used to locate them after the trial. For example, Grubin was not asked whether his 2005 posting to the Elan message board was his first to that site or any other comparable site. We note, however, that the record does reflect that Grubin was living in the United States prior to and during the trial, from 2000 to 2003, a fact that may have made him easier to locate at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We also are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to find that the petitioner\u2019s post-trial efforts were so extraordinary so as to exceed the bounds of due diligence. Although we are mindful that Coleman misstated Grubin\u2019s last name, Weeks adduced without undue difficulty based on the years of attendance listed on the posting on the Elan message board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>from Cliff Grubin that he was the person Weeks had been seeking. Moreover, Weeks readily could have pursued Grubin via the e-mail address provided on the Elan message board while simultaneously pursuing his location by way of the place of residence listed. With respect to Simpson, although it did take Weeks almost one month to piece together all of the information from Elan alumni that led to Simpson\u2019s contact information, the alumni, and in turn the information they provided, were accessible without undue effort. In sum, in light of the fact that several years had lapsed between Coleman\u2019s identification of these witnesses and the time of the trial and the potential significance of Coleman\u2019s testimony, the petitioner\u2019s efforts to locate these witnesses does not go beyond the bounds of \u201cpersevering application, [and] untiring efforts in good earnest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>supra, 190 Conn. 672; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>107 Conn. App. 85, 90-91, 943 A.2d 1159 (rejecting claim that due diligence standard was not met to establish unavailability of witness to testily <em>at trial </em>when state spent nine days trying to locate witness, searched numerous databases, made numerous calls, visited various locations and attempted to locate witness\u2019 family members), cert. denied, 287 Conn. 914, 950 A.2d 1291 (2008). Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for a new trial on the ground that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proving that the evidence provided by these witnesses was newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Finally, we turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he should have been granted a new trial because of the state\u2019s pattern of failing to disclose exculpatory evidence. The petitioner points to the following pieces of evidence: a composite drawing of a person seen by Charles Morganti, a Belle Haven security guard on Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ber 30, 1975, at approximately 10 p.m., whom the petitioner claims resembles Littleton but clearly does not resemble the petitioner; reports prepared by a state investigator that profile Littleton and Thomas Skakel as potential suspects and that state as an established fact that the petitioner had left his home at around 9:30 p.m. to go to his cousin\u2019s house (profile reports); and \u201ctime lapse data\u201d that sets forth a chronological account of Littleton\u2019s actions prior to, during and after the murder that included charged and uncharged misconduct, as well as listings of crimes against female victims in areas Littleton had frequented. The petitioner claims that the trial court improperly failed to grant the petition for a new trial on the ground of reasonable cause due to the state\u2019s pattern of suppression and nondisclosure of this evidence in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83. He also claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the petition on the ground of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The state contends that we should not consider the petitioner\u2019s reasonable cause argument because he declined to pursue it as an independent basis for a new trial, asserting only the ground of newly discovered evidence. The state also contends that the trial court properly relied on this court\u2019s decision in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal from his judgment of conviction to conclude that this evidence was not newly discovered. It further contends there was no <em>Brady </em>violation with regard to the profile reports and time lapse data because the state had given the petitioner the raw data. The state simply did not produce the <em>conclusion </em>of the investigator who had prepared the profile reports, which it claims would have been inadmissible and of little value, or the state\u2019s <em>compilation </em>of the raw data. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We note that, although, at the outset of its decision, the trial court referenced the time lapse data as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>of the petitioner\u2019s claim of a pattern of nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence, the court did not specifically address that evidence in its analysis or make any findings in relation thereto. In his brief to this court, the petitioner asserts that John P. Solomon prepared the time lapse data concurrently with the profile reports and that \u201cmuch of its data is incorporated by reference into the Littleton profile report\u201d or that the profile reports \u201cinclude\u201d the time lapse data. Therefore, for purposes of our analysis, we consider the time lapse data as part of the Littleton profile report and do not address it separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The petitioner\u2019s claims are to a large degree resolved by our decision in his prior appeal from the judgment of conviction. In <em>State </em>v. Skakel, supra, 276 Conn. 693-94, the petitioner claimed that he was entitled to a new trial because the state improperly had withheld certain exculpatory evidence, specifically, the composite drawing and the two suspect profile reports. The petitioner further claimed that the state\u2019s failure to disclose that evidence had deprived him of his right to a fair trial in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83. <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 694. We rejected his claims as to both the drawing and the profile reports. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">With respect to the composite drawing, we concluded that, although the state improperly had failed to produce the drawing in response to the petitioner\u2019s pretrial general discovery request,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> there was no <em>Brady </em>violation because the petitioner had had actual notice of the existence of the drawing. Id., 703. Specifically, the state had mentioned the preparation of this drawing in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>investigative reports, those reports were turned over to the petitioner, and the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had acknowledged that he was aware of these reports. Id. We further noted that the petitioner had known of Morganti\u2019s potential significance as a witness and had the ability to explore this issue directly with him. Id. Finally, we rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that he had not had actual notice because he did not know the exculpatory nature of the drawing until he actually had seen it. Id., 704-705. We concluded that it was sufficient for the petitioner to have known that the drawing potentially could be exculpatory. Id., 705. Because the petitioner had actual notice of this evidence, we concluded that, in the absence of a specific request for the drawing to supplement the general discovery request, there was no <em>Brady </em>violation. Id., 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">With respect to the suspect profile reports, we noted the following facts. \u201cSolomon, a former supervisory inspector with the office of the state\u2019s attorney in the judicial district of Fairfield, testified outside the presence of the jury concerning issues that were raised in a motion then pending before the court. During his testimony, Solomon referred to a copy of a report that he had prepared in connection with the investigation of the victim\u2019s murder. Solomon characterized that report, which he wrote in 1992, as a profile of Littleton summarizing why, at the time the report was written, Littleton was considered a suspect. Immediately after Solomon referred to the report, the [petitioner\u2019s] trial counsel requested a copy, to which the court responded: \u2018Not right now. You are talking about examining the witness.\u2019 At that same proceeding, the state elicited testimony from Solomon indicating that he had prepared a similar profile of Thomas Skakel, who, at one time, also was a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder. The [petitioner] failed to renew his request for those reports before the conclusion of the trial, and his original motion for a new trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>which was timely filed on June 12, 2002, did not refer to the two reports.\u201d Id., 707-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We concluded that \u201cthe trial court acted within its discretion in rejecting the [petitioner\u2019s] claim on the ground that the [petitioner] had failed to raise it in a timely manner under Practice Book \u00a7 42-54. <em>Even though the [petitioner] became aware of the two reports during trial, </em>he did not raise a <em>Brady </em>challenge to the state\u2019s failure to provide him with the reports until two and one-half months after the five day limitation period [for filing a motion for a new trial under] ... \u00a7 42-54 had expired.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In addition to the aforementioned facts and conclusions set forth in <em>Skakel, </em>the trial court in the present case pointed to the following testimony. Garr had offered testimony to establish that the composite drawing had been in the state\u2019s files, which always were accessible to the petitioner. Sherman admitted that, shortly before trial, Solomon had told him about the profile reports.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Although Sherman had filed a discovery request almost one year before trial, he acknowledged that he had not renewed this discovery request specifically to request the profile reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In light of this testimony and this court\u2019s conclusions in the petitioner\u2019s previous appeal, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this evidence was not newly discovered. Although the petitioner contends that this court\u2019s statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 710, that \u201cthe [petitioner] became aware of the two reports during trial\u201d was dicta because the court\u2019s holding was directed at the timeliness of the <em>Brady </em>challenge, it is clear that this statement was predicated on facts established by the evidence. The petitioner also contends that his May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>2001 discovery motion sought documents that would have included these reports, which were prepared in 1991 or 1992. Although we would agree that the reports would have fallen within the scope of this request,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> this fact would not negate the knowledge that the petitioner subsequently obtained prior to and during trial that the profile reports existed. The petitioner did not exercise due diligence to obtain these reports once he knew of their specific existence. Indeed, neither the <em>Brady </em>doctrine nor our rules of discovery are intended either to relieve the defense of its obligation diligently to seek evidence favorable to it or to permit the defense to close its eyes to information likely to lead to the discovery of such evidence. In light of these facts, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence was not newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">With respect to the petitioner\u2019s reasonable cause and <em>Brady </em>claims, we decline to address them for several reasons. First, the trial court did not address these arguments. The petitioner does not claim that he sought an articulation to obtain a ruling on these claims; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>289 Conn. 598, 613, 960 A.2d 993 (2008); nor has he sought <em>Golding </em>review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Moreover, the petitioner extends the bounds of reasonable cause beyond its limits. \u201cAlthough [\u00a7] 52-270 permits the court to grant a new trial upon proof of reasonable cause, the circumstances in which reasonable cause may be found are limited.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Bleidner </em>v. <em>Searles, </em>19 Conn. App. 76, 78, 561 A.2d 954 (1989). \u201c[T]he basic test of \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 is whether a litigant, <em>despite the exercise of due diligence, </em>has been deprived of a fair opportunity to have a case heard on appeal. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Universal C. I. T. Credit Corporation, </em>150 Conn. 188, 194, 187 A.2d 243 (1962); <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 676, 678, 117 A.2d 439 (1955); <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>105 Conn. 710, 719, 136 A. 575 (1927).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Thorne, 202 </em>Conn. 561, 565, 522 A.2d 288 (1987). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for a new trial on the basis of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We are mindful that we have disposed of two of the petitioner\u2019s claims solely on the ground that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence was not newly discovered because the petitioner did not meet his burden of proving that this evidence would not have been available for use at trial if due diligence had been exercised. Because this conclusion is dispositive of those claims; <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>139 Conn. 690, 695, 96 A.2d 755 (1953); <em>Terracino </em>v. <em>Fairway Asset Management, Inc., </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 80; we express no opinion on the possible effect that this evidence could have in a new trial. Undoubtedly, the prerequisites for obtaining a new trial at this stage are stringent. \u201cThis strict standard is meant to effectuate the underlying \u2018equitable principle that once a judgment is rendered it is to be considered final,\u2019 and should not be disturbed by posttrial motions except for a compelling reason.\u201d <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 434.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319 (\u201cWe previously have emphasized that [t]he corroboration requirement for the admission of a third party statement against penal interest is significant and <em>goes beyond minimal corroboration. . . . </em>Third party statements that exculpate an accused are suspect because of the danger of fabrication. . . . Therefore, the statement must be accompanied by corroborating circumstances that <em>clearly indicate </em>the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. \u201d [Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Because we reject the petitioner\u2019s claim, however, that the trial court improperly determined that the petitioner had failed to persuade it that Bryant\u2019s statement probably would result in a different verdict at a new trial, we need not examine the state\u2019s alternative ground for affirmance regarding the court\u2019s admissibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> We note, moreover, that a contrary conclusion, namely, that the trial court was required to consider all evidence relating to corroboration when making its admissibility determination, would not advance the petitioner\u2019s cause. We then would have to look to the only express statements wherein the trial court quantified the extent to which Bryant\u2019s account was corroborated, in which the court found the corroboration \u201cminimal\u201d and \u201cabsent any genuine corroboration.\u201d That assessment would compel the result that the petitioner did not meet the corroboration factor for declarations against penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> The dissent acknowledges in footnote 9 of its opinion that, as a general matter, \u201ca trial court reasonably could find that, although a newly discovered third party statement against penal interest is sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible at a second trial, the statement nevertheless is otherwise so unworthy of belief that it fails to meet the minimum credibility threshold [under] . . . <em>Shabazz, </em>thereby obviating any need for the court to consider the statement in the context of the original trial evidence.\u201d The dissent further acknowledges that the abuse of discretion standard applies to our review of a trial court\u2019s decision whether to grant a petition for a new trial. As to those statements, we are in agreement. The dissent, however, fails to apply this standard of review. Specifically, the dissent reads the evidence in the light least favorable to supporting the trial court\u2019s conclusion, ignores evidence that supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion, and hypothesizes theories never advanced and founded on the slimmest of evidentiary reeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The dissent\u2019s approach is unprecedented in our case law. For more than one century, it has been settled law that an abuse of discretion standard applies not only to the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision whether to grant the petition for a new trial, but also to its subsidiary determinations in support of that decision. See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 831, 837, 792 A.2d 809 (2002); <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 820; <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 514, 536, 717 A.2d 1161 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 139, 622 A.2d 519 (1993); <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 434; <em>Lombardo </em>v. <em>State, </em>172 Conn. 385, 389-93, 374 A.2d 1065 (1977); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>141 Conn. 202, 207, 104 A.2d 761 (1954); <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Conn. 576, 578, 54 A. 199 (1903). As we previously have noted, under the abuse of discretion standard, \u201cevery reasonable presumption should be made <em>in favor of the correctness </em>of the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 724. This court also squarely has rejected the proposition that a less deferential standard than abuse of discretion should apply to review of decisions pertaining to evidence that is not predicated on an assessment of the witness\u2019 demeanor. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>282 Conn. 141, 156-57, 920 A.2d 236 (2007) (\u201c[T]he defendant misapprehends the fundamental distinction between the function of the fact finder, which is to make credibility determinations and to find facts, and the function of the appellate tribunal, which is to review, and not to retry, the proceedings of the trial court. ... In light of our limited function, it would be improper for this court to supplant its credibility determinations for those of the fact finder, regardless of whether the fact finder relied on the cold printed record to make those determinations.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 448-49, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989) (\u201cTo the extent that the [workers\u2019 compensation] commissioner\u2019s assessment of the evidence before him did not rest on a personal appraisal of the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses before him, [the defendants] urge us to hold that such deference is inappropriate and to engage in a broader appellate scrutiny. . . . We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>have not heretofore distinguished between documentary and testimonial evidence in defining the role of appellate tribunals in reviewing findings of fact . . . and we are not prepared to introduce such a distinction into administrative proceedings.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). Moreover, if the trial corut improperly had failed to weigh Bryant\u2019s statement against the evidence at the criminal trial, the proper remedy would be to remand the case to the trial court, not for this court to engage in that weighing process, as the dissent does.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> The petitioner attempts to explain the fact that no one mentioned seeing Bryant or his friends following the murder by positing that the police investigation was limited to an inquiry as to whether anyone had seen any \u201cstrangers\u201d in Belle Haven, which, in the petitioner\u2019s view, would not have yielded an identification of Bryant, who was known to people there, or his friends, who had been there previously. Testimony and police records, <em>as </em>well <em>as </em>common sense, however, indicate otherwise. Ix, Edwards and O\u2019Hara all testified that they did not know Tinsley or Hasbrouck. Thus, these young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>men would have been strangers to them. Indeed, Bryant himself characterized Tinsley and Hasbrouck as \u201coutsiders.\u201d The evidence also indicates that the police questioning was not limited simply to the question of whether people had seen strangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The dissent\u2019s rationalization that no one saw Bryant and his two friends because of the darkness and the cold also reasonably would have been rejected by the trial court. Bryant did not claim that his group was lurking in the bushes throughout the evening. Rather, he claimed to have spoken with friends like Walker face-to-face and to have congregated with a group of neighborhood teenagers for some period of time. Unless Bryant and his friends wore face masks to ward off the cold, the teenagers would have been able to identify features of persons they encountered face-to-face.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The petitioner also attempts to explain the current inability of witnesses to recall Bryant\u2019s presence that night partly by the fact that this incident occurred approximately thirty years ago. For the reasons stated in this opinion, however, the facts suggest that someone would have recalled Bryant\u2019s presence. To the petitioner\u2019s point, however, it is striking that, while other witnesses had difficulty piecing together a comprehensive and coherent account of the events of October 30, 1975, Bryant was able to provide an incredibly detailed timeline of the events of that evening, recalling times, places, people seen and exact comments made, not to mention such innocuous details as having waved to Julie Skakel. His ability to recount with such clarity the events of almost thirty years past is all the more remarkable given that, by his own admission, he had smoked marijuana and drank a sufficient amount of beer that he described his condition as \u201ca good buzz. Not slightly buzzed, I would say lightly drunk. \u201d Indeed, unlike other witnesses who had memorialized accounts of their actions in numerous police interviews, grand jury testimony and trial testimony that would have aided their recall, Bryant had no such occasion to commit these events to memory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> It appears that there was only one African-American family living in Belle Haven, the Jones family. Ethel Jones worked as a cook for the Skakels and resided with her husband and son in a house at the foot of the Skakel property. Bryant told Kennedy that he was \u201cthe only black kid living in Greenwich for a couple of years.\u201d Mills testified that there were only two African-American students at Brunswick in 1975. At his deposition, Charles Morganti, the Belle Haven security guard who was on duty the night of the murder and stated that he had observed a group of five to six youngsters around the Skakel yard, provided the following testimony in response to questions posed by the state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u201cQ.

There was none there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> The police interview report dated November 1, 1975, contained the following account of Byrne\u2019s initial statement to police: \u201c[Byrne] stated that he was with [lx, the victim and O\u2019Hara] and stated the same as [lx], that they went to the [neighboring] Mouakad residence and stayed until about 9:10 p.m. . . . They then left the Mouakad house and were enroute to the Skakel home. After remaining at the [Skakels\u2019] until about 9:20 p.m., he and [lx] left to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u201cAfter he left [lx], and was walking home by himself, he heard footsteps following him. When he stopped to listen the footsteps kept coming. He then started to run and ran all the way to his house. [Byrne] further stated that the footsteps ran after him all the way home and that he did not look back to see who was following him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The dissent offers the novel proposition that \u201cthe fact that [Byrne\u2019s] whereabouts for most of the evening remain unaccounted for <em>supports </em>Bryant\u2019s version of the facts [placing Byrne with Bryant\u2019s group].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the inability to account for Byrne\u2019s whereabouts may not be <em>inconsistent </em>with Bryant\u2019s account, that is hardly the same as <em>corroborating </em>that account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> Bryant claimed to know \u201cfor a fact\u201d that Tinsley and Hasbrouck had spent the night at Byrne\u2019s house. He immediately followed that assertion, however, with statements that, \u201cYou could stay at their house and they would never know, though. . . . The Byrnes would never know. It was a huge house.\u201d Bryant stated that both Tinsley and Hasbrouck, as well as Byrne, had told Bryant that they spent the night at Byrne\u2019s house. In conversations with Kennedy, both Tinsley and Hasbrouck acknowledged that they had been to Byrne\u2019s house on several occasions, but denied ever having spent the night in Belle Haven.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 644, we described the room as a back \u201challway\u201d because police described it as such based on its long narrow shape, but the Skakel family and others familiar with the house referred to it, in accordance with its use, as a mudroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> Andrew Pugh, the petitioner\u2019s close childhood friend, testified at the criminal trial that he was with a group of ten to twelve neighborhood teenagers playing in the Skakel backyard from approximately 6 to 7:30 p.m., which is at or near the time that Bryant claims to have been in the yard. Ix gave a statement to the police indicating that she and Byrne had left the Skakel residence through the backyard around 9:30 p.m. Keegan, a captain in the detective division of the Greenwich police department in 1975, testified that the police had considered and pursued, to no avail, the possibility that someone had picked up a golf club on the Skakel property. The search for other golf clubs included a November 2, 1975 check of many of the neighborhood properties, including the Skakels\u2019, with a metal detector. Residents of Belle Haven and nearby areas assisted the police in this search, and the police received numerous telephone calls in the days after the murder about missing or found golf clubs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> The petitioner points to testimony by Esme Dick, with whose family Bryant had lived while attending Brunswick, as corroborative. Dick testified that, during a dinner conversation in 1976 at which Bryant had joined her family, the group was speculating as to who could have committed the victim\u2019s murder. According to Dick, Bryant stated that \u201che did not think [the petitioner] could have done it.\u201d This statement reflects an opinion, not a fact based on personal knowledge, and indeed was an opinion likely shared by other people who lived in Greenwich in 1976. Dick also testified that Bryant had stated that he was in Belle Haven on the night of the murder, but she could not recall whether Bryant had made that statement during the same dinner conversation or in the course of another conversation near that time period. Notably, Bryant did not indicate in his statement that Hasbrouck or Tinsley were with him, nor did he provide any information to Dick to indicate that he had any personal knowledge about the crime. Therefore, in light of these significant omissions and the fact that Bryant was the source of this information, the trial court was well within its discretion to discount his statement to Dick. Cf. <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 818-20 (concluding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding statement of newly discovered eyewitness lacking in credibility despite fact that witness\u2019 substance abuse counselor testified at hearing on petition for new trial that, after petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, witness had confided in counselor that he had witnessed encounter between petitioner and victim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> In their initial discussions with Kennedy, which were tape-recorded without their knowledge, Hasbrouck and Tinsley had indicated that they were not in Belle Haven on the night the victim was killed, although Tinsley\u2019s recollection was somewhat more equivocal because the question related to events that occurred thirty years previous. Colucci testified, however, that, in subsequent conversations with him, which were not recorded, both men had admitted to being in Belle Haven on October 30, 1975. According to Colucci, Hasbrouck admitted to being in Belle Haven that day and had given three different times for his departure (noon, 6 to 6:30 p.m., and 9 to 9:30 p.m.), none of which, coincidentally, match Bryant\u2019s account. Colucci testified that Tinsley had told him that he had been in Belle Haven that day, but was shaky on the details and could provide no time for his departure. On cross-examination, Colucci acknowledged that these admissions were not reflected in notes taken of those conversations by the investigator who had accompanied Colucci and only later were added, upon Colucci\u2019s instruction, to a second set of notes, a curious omission given the significance of the alleged admissions. Colucci further admitted on cross-examination that, in a follow-up call that the investigators made, the two men had confirmed that, after checking their calendars, they were certain that they had not been in Belle Haven on the night of October 30, 1975. In fact, Colucci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>acknowledged that the investigators\u2019 notes reflect that Hasbrouck said he never had spent the night in Belle Haven, that his mother would have \u201ctanned his hide\u201d if he had done so and that she never would have let him stay out on a school night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> Until they were made aware that Bryant had implicated them in the crime, Tinsley and Hasbrouck voluntarily engaged in numerous and lengthy conversations with Kennedy initially, and Colucci later, recounting details of several visits to Belle Haven prior to the murder. In fact, it was Hasbrouck who provided Kennedy with a telephone number for Tinsley, whom Hasbrouck described as having \u201ca far better memory of events around that time period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\"> In her deposition, taken pursuant to a subpoena, Barbara Bryant recalled her son being in Connecticut during the <em>day </em>of October 30,1975, but repeatedly stated that he had returned home by \u201cearly in the afternoon,\u201d or at least while it was still light out. She further recalled that, because he was under a curfew at the time, he would not have been allowed to go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Connecticut on a school night without her permission. Barbara Bryant recounted an incident in which a group of women were gathered at her home shortly after the murder and, upon seeing the newspaper account of the victim\u2019s murder, made a statement to her son to the effect that \u201caren\u2019t you glad you had your black butt home because you certainly would have been accused of this.\u201d Barbara Bryant did not have a conversation with her son at that time regarding his whereabouts on the night of the murder, because she knew where he was, namely, at home. She had no personal knowledge of her son going to Greenwich accompanied by Hasbrouck, whom she described as shy, friendly and respectful, and Tinsley, whom she described as attractive and friendly. Notably, Barbara Bryant admitted the possibility that she had discussed the victim\u2019s murder with her son <em>after </em>she saw an article reporting that he had implicated other persons in the murder. She recalled being approached on the street by two private investigators whom the petitioner had hired and acknowledged the possibility that she may have told them that <em>her son had told her </em>that Tinsley and Hasbrouck had spent the night in Belle Haven on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Thus, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that Barbara Bryant\u2019s statements that were consistent with her son\u2019s account were noncorroborative because he was the source of that information and he had given her that information many years after the murder, only after his account became public knowledge. The trial court also may have taken into account the fact that medications appeared to impair Barbara Bryant\u2019s memory. Barbara Bryant testified while on several medications.that she described as making her \u201cfoggy\u201d and \u201cnot always clear,\u201d and expressed confusion about the time frame of events. She also stated that, at the time the petitioner\u2019s investigators approached her on the street, she had been on another medication that made her feel \u201csick and confused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> The dissent also has hypothesized a two <em>perpetrator, </em>two golf club theory as corroboration for Bryant\u2019s account. In support of this theory, the dissent points to statements in a letter by Keegan, then a Greenwich police captain, to a forensic expert in which Keegan discussed the conclusions that the police investigators had drawn as to the likely sequence of events in the attack of the victim. In our view, the dissent\u2019s theory is too speculative to corroborate Bryant\u2019s account in light of the facts that the expert forensic testimony on which both parties relied at the criminal trial to establish the likely sequence of events reached a different conclusion, neither party offered Keegan or any other Greenwich police officer as an expert on this matter, there is nothing to indicate that Keegan was qualified as an expert in such matters, and the letter does not state who made the determinations referred to and on what basis. Therefore, in the absence of any indication that a competent expert would offer an opinion that the evidence indicated that there were two perpetrators, such speculation cannot corroborate Bryant\u2019s account. We further note that, even if such evidence did exist, the other evidence overwhelmingly contradicting Bryant\u2019s account would inexorably lead to the conclusion that Hasbrouck and Tinsley were not the perpetrators.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> The hair with negroid characteristics was tested against, but found dissimilar to, samples taken from Thomas Skakel, Larry Jones, the teenage son of the Skakels\u2019 cook, Ethel Jones; see footnote 27 of this opinion; and Daniel Hickman, a police officer who was at the crime scene. Larry Jones and Hickman are both African-American. There is no indication that hair samples from Ethel Jones or her husband were tested to rule them out as possible sources of the hair found on the sheet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\"> Although nothing in the victim\u2019s autopsy report indicated whether any attempt had been made to determine whether semen was present on external areas of the victim\u2019s body other than her pubic region, the tests performed on that region, as well as vaginal and anal swabs, revealed no traces of semen. <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 643.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> We note that the testimony from Bryant and Mills indicates that Bryant initiated the conversation to check on Mills\u2019 well-being after the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, where Mills lived. The trial court neither credited nor discredited this reason as the actual or exclusive motive for Bryant having initiated the conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> According <em>to </em>Mills, when <em>Bryant ottered </em>his help on the screenplay, he had stated that \u201che either was an entertainment lawyer or had experience as an entertainment lawyer, and had worked in Hollywood, and also had done some writing for television.\u201d Bryant had given Walker a similar impression, namely, that he was either an entertainment attorney or a sports and entertainment attorney. Bryant admitted to Kennedy, however, that, although he had graduated from law school, he never has been licensed to practice law, let alone taken the bar examination. See footnote 21 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> We note that the petitioner also has claimed that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider his separate claim that it would cause an injustice not to submit this evidence to a jury. To the extent that the petitioner believes that this court\u2019s isolated references to \u201cavoid an injustice\u201d means that injustice is an independent basis on which to grant a new trial, he is mistaken. To order a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that <em>fails </em>to meet the <em>Asherman </em>factors but meets an amorphous and less stringent injustice standard is contrary to our case law and common sense. Review of the cases from which this ipjustice language originates indicates that the factors that ultimately became the <em>Asherman </em>test were the means by which the court determined whether an injustice has occurred. See <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Conn. 576, 578, 54 A. 199 (1903); <em>Salinardi </em>v. <em>State, </em>124 Conn. 670, 672, 2 A.2d 212 (1938); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>139 Conn. 249, 253, 93 A.2d 296 (1952). There is not a single instance in the case law dating back more than one century in which this court, has granted a new trial on the ground that such a result is necessary \u201cto avoid an injustice,\u201d without application of the <em>Asherman </em>factors. Indeed, to read our isolated use of the phrase \u201cavoid an injustice\u201d as an independent ground for granting a new trial would allow a petitioner to avoid satisfying factors other than the credibility element of the <em>Asherman </em>test. Thus, a petitioner could circumvent the habeas process for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel despite the fact that the evidence is not newly discovered by asserting that the evidence is so material that a new trial must be ordered to avoid an injustice. For all of the foregoing reasons, therefore, we decline to adopt the approach suggested by the petitioner to his claim under a broad injustice standard untethered to the <em>Asherman </em>factors. We are mindful, however, that we left open the possibility in <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 827, that \u201cthere may be cases in which the trial court is justified in determining that the newly discovered evidence is sufficiently credible and of such a nature that, in order to avoid an injustice, a second jury, rather than the trial court itself, should malte the ultimate assessment of its credibility.\u201d For the reasons we previously have set forth, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this is not such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> Although the petitioner also contends in his brief to this court that Garr \u201cthreatened witnesses in the time leading up to and during the petitioner\u2019s trial,\u201d his brief focuses on Garr\u2019s secret pact and book deal with Levitt. The only further discussion of these alleged threats is the following quote from Levitt\u2019s book, as emphasized by the petitioner in his brief: \u201c[T]he case was all [Garr\u2019s]. He had found all the witnesses. Many hadn\u2019t wanted to testify. <em>[Garr], they related, had pursued, cajoled, harassed, or threatened them.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) We, therefore, construe the petitioner\u2019s claim to be that these alleged threats were evidence of Garr\u2019s bias because of his pact to write a book and his book deal and do not address these alleged threats independently from our discussion of that deal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> Fuhrman\u2019s book, entitled \u201cMurder in Greenwich: Who Killed Martha Moxley?,\u201d was published in 1998.

Sherman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>conceded that the publication of Fuhrman\u2019s book preceded or coincided with the grand jury proceedings in the petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\"> We note, however, that, although we see no direct evidence in the record that Garr engaged in improper conduct during the course of the investigation to advance his interest in the publication of Levitt\u2019s book and indeed Garr\u2019s singular focus on the petitioner may well have been predicated on the fact that the evidence kept pointing in that direction, Garr\u2019s acceptance of a share in the book\u2019s profits creates, at the very least, an appearance of a conflict of interest. We further note that the evidence in the record indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that the state\u2019s attorney had no knowledge of Gaxr\u2019s agreement to assist Levitt prior to receiving a letter from the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel raising that issue, and in fact that Garr never informed the state\u2019s attorney that he was receiving a share of the profits from the book even after the state\u2019s attorney inquired about the book deal upon receiving that letter. Nonetheless, Garr\u2019s conduct undermines the public\u2019s confidence in the office of the state\u2019s attorney and we, therefore, express our strong disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Despite our criticism, we decline the petitioner\u2019s invitation, raised for the first time at oral argument, to order a new trial under our supervisory authority over the administration of justice because of what he characterizes as Garr\u2019s unprecedented breach of the code of ethics. Specifically, the petitioner contends that Garr violated General Statutes \u00a7 1-84 by disclosing to Levitt confidential information that Garr had obtained through his employment with the state. In addition to the fact that the testimony credited by the trial court does not support the factual predicate for the petitioner\u2019s claim, there is no persuasive justification for using the court\u2019s inherent authority to order a new trial. The code of ethics sets forth its own remedial measures, which are directed at the violator personally. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-88 (a). The alleged situation in the present case is not akin to circumstances in which the courts have deemed it necessary to craft their own remedial measure to act as a prophylactic measure against future abuses, such as the exclusionary rule to address fourth amendment violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> The following exchange took place between Simpson and the petitioner\u2019s counsel after Simpson was asked whether he recalled a particular incident at Elan:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\u201cA.

I agree with and join parts II, III and IV of the majority opinion. I also agree with the result that the majority reaches in part I of its opinion, in which it upholds the trial court\u2019s denial of the petition for a new trial filed by the petitioner, Michael C. Skakel, on the basis of newly discovered hearsay statements made by Gitano \u201cTony\u201d Bryant. I write separately, however, because the majority has failed to address the threshold issue in the present case \u2014 the admissibility of the Bryant evidence at a new trial \u2014 which, in my view, is dis-positive of the petitioner\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Bryant evidence constitutes inadmissible hearsay that does not satisfy the definition of a statement against penal interest within the meaning of \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. In addition, the Bryant evidence fails to satisfy any of the trustworthiness factors set forth in Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Finally, even if I were to assume, arguendo, that portions of the Bryant evidence are against Biyant\u2019s penal interest and satisfy the trustworthiness factors, <em>only those portions </em>would be admissible because (1) in the present case, Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements are severable from his self-serving statements, and (2) the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 114 S. Ct. 2431, 129 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1994), held that the federal hearsay exception for statements against penal interest; see Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (3); on which Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is patterned, permits only the admission of self-inculpatory statements and not collateral statements, \u201ceven if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory.\u201d <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 600-601. The statements that Bryant made that are most relevant to the issue of whether the petitioner is entitled to a new trial are those that exculpate Bryant and the petitioner and inculpate two of Bryant\u2019s former classmates, Adolph Hasbrouck and Burton Tinsley. These statements are not admissible, either under our current jurisprudence or the rule set forth in <em>Williamson. </em>Accordingly, I conclude that the petitioner is not entitled to a new trial because none of Bryant\u2019s statements that exculpate the petitioner would be admissible, and, therefore, the Bryant evidence could not produce a different result at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Under Connecticut law, the statement against penal interest hearsay exception has its roots in our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 449-52, 426 A.2d 799 (1980). <em>In DeFreitas, </em>\u201cwe adopted a rule, consistent with <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>[410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973)], and in accord with rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>provides that trustworthy third party statements against penal interest [that] are exculpatory to the defendant, are admissible if the declarant is unavailable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 114, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991). Section 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence embodies the hearsay exception recognized in <em>DeFreitas </em>and affirmed in its progeny. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>239 Conn. 56, 70-71, 681 A.2d 950 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>204 Conn. 571, 576-77, 529 A.2d 673 (1987). Section 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that \u201c[a] trustworthy statement against penal interest that, at the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true\u201d is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule when the declarant is unavailable as a witness. Section 8-6 (4) further provides that, \u201c [i]n determining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the court shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In determining whether a statement is admissible under the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest, the trial court must engage in a two step analysis. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>34 Conn. App. 166, 172, 640 A.2d 637, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 922, 642 A.2d 1216 (1994); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>539 F.2d 244, 251 (1st Cir. 1976) (applying two step analysis under Fed. R. Evid. 804 [b] [3]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>537 F.2d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 1976) (same), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1075, 97 S. Ct. 816, 50 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1977). First, the court must determine whether the statement at issue is actually against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>690 F.2d 1117, 1124 (4th Cir. 1982) (whether statement is against penal interest is threshold inquiry). If the court concludes that it is, then the court proceeds to the second step under which it must determine the trustworthiness of the statement by \u201cconsidering] all of the relevant factors and determinfing] whether the statement presents sufficient indicia of reliability to justify its admission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Smith, 289 Conn. 598, 631, 960 A.2d 993 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980), we formally adopted the definition of statement against penal interest contained in rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, stating: \u201cWe are persuaded of the logic and soundness of [rule 804 (b) (3)] and the trend to reject a narrow and inflexible definition of a statement against penal interest in favor of a definition which includes not only confessions, but other remarks which would tend to incriminate the declarant were he or she the individual charged with the crime.\u201d Id., 642. Under this definition, statements that are <em>\u201cexceedingly inculpatory, </em>but [fall] short of being a confession,\u201d may qualify for admission. (Emphasis added.) Id., 642-43. In addition, statements that strengthen the impression that the declarant has an \u201cinsider\u2019s knowledge of the crime\u201d may be admissible, as are other statements that strongly imply the declarant\u2019s personal participation in a crime. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 539 F.2d 249 (declarant\u2019s statement that he was \u201cgoing to have some trouble from the people from California\u201d with respect to alleged stamp theft and that \u201c[the defendant] wasn\u2019t involved,\u201d but that \u201cit was [another party],\u201d evidenced insider\u2019s knowledge of crime and was therefore admissible [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>584 F.2d 694, 699-700 (5th Cir. 1978) (declarant\u2019s statement that he was calling defendant to set up drug trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>action constituted statement against penal interest). Although our definition of \u201cagainst penal interest\u201d encompasses more than confessions to crimes, it is not without limits and \u201cdoes not provide that any statement which \u2018possibly could\u2019 or \u2018maybe might\u2019 lead to criminal liability is admissible; on the contrary, only those statements that \u2018so far tend to subject\u2019 the declarant to criminal liability, such that \u2018a reasonable person would not have made it unless it were true\u2019 are admissible.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>71 F.3d 243, 253 (7th Cir. 1995); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). In determining whether this standard is met, the statement must be examined \u201cin light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 604; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>254 Conn. 309, 316, 757 A.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In the present case, the trial court concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were \u201cclearly against his penal interest.\u201d Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cBryant places himself in Belle Haven, on the night of the murder, in the company of [the victim], discussing assaulting [the victim] with Hasbrouck and Tinsley and in possession of golf clubs belonging to the Skakel family. Efforts to explain away possible physical evidence indicate a consciousness of guilt. . . . Bryant attempts to explain away the possibility that his fingerprints might be found on the murder weapon or another golf club nearby. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u201cConsidered with the fact that Bryant has asserted his [privilege against self-incrimination] after being served with a subpoena to testify at a deposition, the totality of circumstances indicates that . . . Bryant\u2019s story is against his penal interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The first issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in cohcluding that Bryant\u2019s statements were \u201cagainst [his] penal interest\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). As a preliminary matter, I note that it is undisputed that Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s alleged statements to Bryant are against their penal interests. Because Hasbrouck and Tinsley have invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and, thus, are unavailable as witnesses, those statements would be admissible if Bryant were to testify to them, as long as the statements satisfied the requirement of trustworthiness set forth in Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Bryant, however, also has asserted his privilege against self-incrimination and refuses to testify in the present case. Thus, all we have before us is Bryant\u2019s unsworn statements made to various individuals and those contained in video recordings, all of which constitute hearsay. Therefore, Bryant\u2019s statements regarding Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s alleged statements to him constitute hearsay within hearsay, or double hearsay. \u201cHearsay within hearsay is admissible only if each part of the combined statements is independently admissible under a hearsay exception.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-7; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 802, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998) (\u201c[w]hen a statement is offered that contains hearsay within hearsay, each level of hearsay must itself be supported by an exception to the hearsay rule in order for that level of hearsay to be admissible\u201d). Accordingly, the admissibility of any of Bryant\u2019s statements turns on whether they are against Bryant\u2019s penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Our standard of review is well settled. On appeal, \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law . . . for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy [and admissibility] of evidence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecil J., </em>291 Conn. 813, 818, 970 A.2d 710 (2009). As such, \u201c[w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 667, 969 A.2d 750 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In my view, the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Bryant\u2019s statements were against his penal interest within the meaning of Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). A review of the Bryant evidence reveals that <em>none </em>of his statements \u201cso far tend[ed] to subject\u201d him to criminal liability. (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 71 F.3d 253. Indeed, it is doubtful that Bryant\u2019s statements even \u201cpossibly could\u201d or \u201cmight maybe\u201d lead to criminal liability. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. As the trial court aptly stated, Bryant\u2019s statements \u201care merely claims of information [about] a crime accompanied by his alibi.\u201d Moreover, the trial court explicitly found that Bryant\u2019s statements were only <em>\u201cminimally </em>against his interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Neither this court nor the Appellate Court ever has held such innocuous statements to be admissible under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. In fact, the only Connecticut appellate decisions in which statements were held to qualify for admission under this hearsay exception are those in which the statements at issue somehow <em>directly </em>implicated the declarant in a crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 289 Conn. 632 (declarant\u2019s statements were against his penal interest because they directly implicated him in unsolved murder and included chilling detail); <em>State </em>v. <em>Camacho, </em>282 Conn. 328, 358-60, 924 A.2d 99 (declarant\u2019s dual inculpatory statement admitting that he had instructed defendant to kill two people and helped defendant flee after murders was admissible under Conn.

Therefore, there is no legal precedent for their admission. In addition, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s specu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>lation as to Bryant\u2019s alleged consciousness of guilt regarding \u201cthe possibility that his fingerprints might be found on the murder weapon\u201d is not supported by the record. I further conclude that the trial court\u2019s characterization of Bryant\u2019s statements as \u201cdiscussing assaulting [the victim] with Hasbrouck and Tinsley\u201d inaccurately and unfairly suggests that Bryant made self-inculpatory statements during those discussions, when, in fact, the record reveals the opposite. Accordingly, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Bryant evidence would have been admissible was not reasonable in view of the legal landscape and factual circumstances of the present case. I therefore conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">First, Bryant\u2019s statement that he was in Belle Haven on the night of the murder is not against his penal interest within the meaning of Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4) because (1) his presence, alone, does not so far tend to subject him to criminal liability for the victim\u2019s murder, especially in light of the fact that Bryant states, and the record reflects, that <em>many </em>people were in Belle Haven that night,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) Bryant specifically states that he took a train back to Manhattan, New York, from the town of Greenwich, which departed around 9:35 p.m., before the victim was murdered. Thus, when viewed in context, the totality of circumstances indicates that, although Bryant may have been in Belle Haven on the evening of the murder, Bryant places himself either on a train or in Manhattan at the <em>time </em>of the murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>thereby completely ruling out the possibility of his participation in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In my view, it was illogical for the trial court to conclude that Bryant\u2019s statement that he was in Belle Haven on the night of the murder was against his penal interest. Taken to the extreme, the trial court\u2019s logic would dictate that every out-of-court statement made by an eyewitness to a crime would constitute a statement against penal interest simply because the eyewitness was present at the scene of the crime, without regard to any temporal considerations. Further, under this scheme, all such statements would be admissible under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest if the witness is unavailable to testify. This, of course, is illogical and not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Second, I conclude that Bryant\u2019s statement that he picked up one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, \u201cswung it,\u201d and \u201c[slung] it back to where the bag . . . was\u201d also does not constitute a statement against his penal interest. Notably, Bryant does not state that he touched <em>the </em>golf club used in the murder. Indeed, if Bryant\u2019s statements are to be believed, it would not have been possible for him to have made such a statement because he claimed not even to know how the victim was murdered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, at the time of his statement, Bryant would not have known that handling one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs could be against his penal interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>alone undercuts the trial court\u2019s speculation concerning Bryant\u2019s alleged consciousness of guilt regarding \u201cthe possibility that his fingerprints might be found on the murder weapon,\u201d and the rationale on which Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4) is founded. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 696 (\u201cit is not the fact that the declaration is against interest but the awareness of that fact by the declarant [that] gives the statement significance\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 368-69 (fact that declarant drove witness to remote location before making statement, told witness that he and defendant had done something wrong and admonished witness not to repeat statement clearly established that declarant \u201creasonably could have foreseen\u201d that statement was against his penal interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In addition, even if Bryant knew how the victim was murdered, his statements regarding the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, when viewed in context, demonstrate that those statements are insufficiently against his penal interest to be admitted pursuant to Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Specifically, Bryant stated that <em>\u201c[everybody </em>in Belle Haven touched those clubs,\u201d and that \u201cthose clubs went through <em>tons of people\u2019s hands.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, Bryant\u2019s statements no more implicate Bryant in the victim\u2019s murder than \u201c [e] verybody in Belle Haven . . . .\u201d This is insufficient to qualify as a statement against penal interest, especially in light of the fact that Bryant states that he was not in Belle Haven at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Finally, I disagree with the trial court\u2019s characterization of Bryant\u2019s statements as an admission that Bryant \u201cdiscuss [ed] assaulting [the victim] with Hasbrouck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Tinsley\u201d because it inaccurately and unfairly implies that Bryant made seif-inculpatory statements during those discussions, when, in fact, he did not. Quite the opposite, Biyant makes it clear that it was Hasbrouck who was \u201cobsessed\u201d with the victim and who \u201ctalked about her, and that was [Hasbrouck\u2019s] main focus.\u201d Moreover, Bryant stated that Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s alleged comments on the night of the murder made him \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d made his decision to go home \u201ca lot easier\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want any part of it.\u201d Bryant further distances himself from Hasbrouck and Tinsley by stating that he \u201cdidn\u2019t goad anybody into doing anything,\u201d and, in contrast, often discouraged Hasbrouck by telling him \u201c[y]ou need to think about something else. You need to think about somebody else that is more obtainable, because it is not going to happen [with her]. She\u2019s not even interested in you.\u201d In sum, the totality of Bryant\u2019s statements reveals that, although Hasbrouck and Tinsley allegedly talked about going \u201ccaveman style,\u201d Bryant never had any interest in or participated in Hasbrouck\u2019s or Tinsley\u2019s fantasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The problem with the trial court\u2019s characterization of Bryant\u2019s statements is that the court failed to consider Bryant\u2019s <em>role </em>in the discussions and what Bryant <em>actually said. </em>It is evident that the determination of whether a statement is against a declarant\u2019s penal interest requires an examination of the declarant\u2019s <em>actual statement, </em>and not just its context. In the present case, however, the trial court apparently leaped to the conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements regarding the discussions were against <em>his </em>penal interest simply because he was present while Hasbrouck and Tinsley were making statements against <em>their </em>penal interests. This was unreasonable and improper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>In concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the Bryant evidence, I also note that cases in this jurisdiction and various federal jurisdictions have held that statements that were far more inculpatory than Bryant\u2019s statements were not sufficiently against the declarant\u2019s penal interest to be admissible. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonty, </em>383 F.3d 575, 579-80 (7th Cir. 2004) (declarant\u2019s statement that codefendant \u201chad nothing to do with the [sexual assault]\u201d was not against declarant\u2019s penal interest because declarant denied sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ually assaulting victim, even though he admitted to picking up victim at shopping mall and taking her to his home, where assault occurred); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 71 F.3d 243, 252-53 (declarant\u2019s statement that he was in room when police arrived and found guns was not against declarant\u2019s penal interest because declarant \u201cdid not admit to anything remotely criminal\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Snelgrove, </em>288 Conn. 742, 769, 954 A.2d 165 (2008) (declarant\u2019s statement that victim \u201cgot what she deserved\u201d was not against penal interest because it did not imply that declarant was responsible for victim\u2019s death, even though declarant subsequently confessed to murder [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>61 Conn. App. 565, 574, 767 A.2d 166 (2001) (declarant\u2019s admission that he shot victim was not against his penal interest because he claimed that it was in self-defense and declarant \u201cmust have known that people at the scene had seen him fire a gun at [the victim]\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>46 Conn. App. 640, 648, 700 A.2d 710 (declarant\u2019s statement that friend told declarant \u201c[a third party] had shot [the victim] last night\u201d was not against declarant\u2019s penal interest, even though declarant admitted involvement in murder [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 941, 704 A.2d 797 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>14 Conn. App. 67, 74, 540 A.2d 76 (declarant\u2019s written statement that he owned car in which shotgun was found but did not know shotgun was there could not be considered against his penal interest), cert. denied, 208 Conn. 804, 545 A.2d 1102 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In the present case, Bryant does not admit to or intimate any involvement with any crime. Instead, Bryant merely points the finger at Hasbrouck and Tinsley while claiming that he, himself, is totally innocent. In addition, Bryant\u2019s statements do not strengthen the impression that he has an \u201cinsider\u2019s knowledge of the [crime].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 695. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>contrary, Bryant specifically states that he was not present when the murder occurred and \u201cnever wanted to know\u201d how the victim was murdered and \u201c[t]o this day . . . [has] never looked at any autopsy reports . . . read any books . . . [or] magazine articles\u201d that described the murder. Furthermore, Bryant states that Hasbrouck and Tinsley never confessed to murdering the victim and never disclosed any details about their alleged involvement in her murder. Indeed, Hasbrouck and Tinsley never mentioned the victim by name in their alleged comments to Bryant, and their comments always were couched in vague terms, such as, \u201c[w]e did it,\u201d \u201c[w]e achieved our fantasy,\u201d \u201c[w]e achieved the caveman,\u201d and \u201c[w]e got the girl caveman style.\u201d Thus, Bryant\u2019s statements reveal that he lacked not only an insider\u2019s knowledge of the crime but also knowledge of details of the crime that were publicly available. Under these circumstances, it was unreasonable for the trial court to conclude that the Bryant evidence would be admissible as statements against penal interest under Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Accordingly, I conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Bryant\u2019s statements would be admissible. Consequently, I also conclude that the petitioner is not entitled to a new trial because the Bryant evidence would not be admissible and, therefore, could not produce a different result at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In light of the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the Bryant evidence satisfies the definition of a statement against penal interest within the meaning of Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4), I next address the trustworthiness factors enumerated in Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4), which comprise step two of the two part test for determining the admissibility of declarations against penal interest. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 171-72. A review of Bryant\u2019s statements reveals that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>abused its discretion in concluding that they were sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted under Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The first trustworthiness factor requires the court to consider \u201cthe time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made . . . .\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). With regard to the timeliness prong, in general, a prompt declaration is considered to be indicative of trustworthiness, whereas delayed statements typically are deemed to be untrustworthy. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 317. In the present case, the trial court found that, \u201c[a]lthough Bryant acquired his information within days of the offense, he . . . kept it to himself for [more than one] quarter of a centuiy . . . [and] [o]n finally disclosing [it], he insisted [on] anonymity [and] . . . did not come forward voluntarily . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Neither the trial court, the petitioner nor the dissent has identified any legal authority, from this jurisdiction or any other, that supports a finding of trustworthiness with respect to a statement that was made more than two years following the crime that is the subject of the statement, let alone one that was made more than <em>twenty-five years </em>later, such as the statements in the present case. Although the trial court identified various reasons for the delay, those reasons do not make Bryant\u2019s statements any more timely or trustworthy. Moreover, several of the reasons that the trial court and the dissent cite are speculative and presume facts not in evidence, or otherwise lack support. Specifically, both the trial court and the dissent refer to the fact that Bryant has a law degree and, therefore, <em>somehow </em>had knowledge that there was no statute of limitations for murder in Connecticut in 1975. In addition, both the trial court and the dissent rely on Bryant\u2019s conclusory statement to Vito Colucci, the petitioner\u2019s private investigator, that it would have been \u201ceasier\u201d for the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>to have convicted Bryant than the petitioner. Neither of these reasons has merit; nor do they support a finding of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">First, just because Bryant obtained a law degree from the University of Tennessee Law School does not necessarily mean that he had any knowledge of whether Connecticut had a statute of limitations for murder in 1975. Indeed, Bryant never passed <em>any </em>state\u2019s bar examination, let alone Connecticut\u2019s. The trial court\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s conclusion is further flawed because, even if Bryant was well versed in Connecticut law when he made his statements in the early 2000s, he would have known that, in 1975, <em>Connecticut had a five year statute of limitations for murder. </em>See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-193. Moreover, in making his statements, Bryant would have been further comforted by the fact that this court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 350, 456 A.2d 305 (1983), held that the 1976 amendment to General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-193; Public Acts 1976, No. 76-35, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 76-35); \u201cwhich excepted all class A felonies, including murder, from the purview of \u00a7 54-193, did not apply retroactively to offenses committed prior to April 6, 1976, the effective date of P.A. 76-35.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 664, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006). Our decision in <em>Paradise </em>remained the law in this state for twenty-three years, including during the time frame in which Bryant made his statements, and was not overruled until 2006 with respect to offenses for which the preamendment limitation period had not yet expired when P.A. 76-35 became effective. <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 666, 693. Thus, unless Bryant was clairvoyant and foresaw our 2006 decision in <em>Skakel </em>when he made his statements, we must presume that Bryant believed that there was a five year statute of limitations that had long since expired with respect to the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The second prong of the first trustworthiness factor \u201crequire [s] that the witness testifying [about] the [declarant\u2019s] statement ... be one in whom the declarant would naturally confide.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 317-18. The rationale is that \u201c[acknowledgment of criminal activity is generally made only to confidants or to persons in whom the declarant imposes trust.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goins, </em>593 F.2d 88, 91 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 827, 100 S. Ct. 52, 62 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]here must be a relationship in which the two parties to the conversation had a close and confidential relationship.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>221 Conn. 58, 70, 602 A.2d 571 (1992). \u201c[T]he burden of establishing the requisite relationship rests on the proponent of the statement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In the present case, Bryant initially disclosed his stoiy to Crawford Mills, Biyant\u2019s former classmate. Although the trial court initially described Mills as \u201ca friend that [Bryant] trusted,\u201d the trial court later clarified that their relationship was one of mere \u201cformer junior high school classmates [who] . . . maintained only <em>casual </em>contact over the years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, Bryant had absolutely no relationship with the petitioner\u2019s cousin, Robert Kennedy, Jr., or Colucci, prior to making his subsequent revelations to them. Accordingly, because Bryant did not have a close and confidential relationship with the persons to whom he made his statements, it is unlikely that Bryant actually believed those statements were against his penal interest, and the evidence in the record does not support a finding that this factor weighs in favor of admissibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 318-19 (nine year rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>tionship insufficient to satisfy trastworthiness factor because relationship was not close and confidential); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 393, 528 A.2d 794 (1987) (trustworthiness factor not satisfied when declarant\u2019s statement was made to stranger).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The second trustworthiness factor requires the court to examine \u201cthe existence of corroborating evidence in the case . . . .\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). We repeatedly have emphasized that \u201c[t]he corroboration requirement for the admission of a third party statement against penal interest is significant and <em>goes beyond minimal </em>corroboration.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 71; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 249; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 700. Accordingly, \u201cthe statement must be accompanied by corroborating circumstances that <em>clearly indicate </em>the statement\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">It is clear from the trial court\u2019s treatment of this factor, and its failure to reference the foregoing legal standard, that this standard was neither applied nor satisfied. Rather than examining whether Bryant\u2019s accusations implicating Hasbrouck and Tinsley were corroborated, the trial court based its finding of corroboration on a host of peripheral findings that have no bearing on whether Hasbrouck and Tinsley committed the murder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court explicitly found that \u201c[t]he corroboration for Bryant\u2019s claim is minimal\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201c[t]he . . . Bryant [evidence] is <em>absent any genuine </em>corroboration,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) These explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>findings are wholly inconsistent with our legal standard that requires a level of corroboration that <em>\u201cgoes beyond minimal corroboration.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that this requirement was satisfied was erroneous as a matter of law. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 218 (plenary review applies to trial court\u2019s admission of evidence based on its interpretation of Code of Evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The third and final trustworthiness factor requires the court to examine \u201cthe extent to which the statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Although the trial court, prior to analyzing this factor, conclusorily stated that Bryant\u2019s statements were \u201cclearly against his penal interest,\u201d the trial court later contradicted itself and concluded that, \u201c[o]n <em>analysis, </em>[Bryant\u2019s statements] are merely claims of information of a crime accompanied by his alibi. The statements appear to be <em>minimally </em>against his interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As I discussed in part I of this opinion, for a statement to qualify as a declaration against penal interest within the meaning of Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4), it must be <em>\u201cexceedingly inculpatory\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 644; such that it \u201cso <em>far tended </em>to subject the declarant to criminal liability . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Thus, on the basis of the trial court\u2019s own conclusion, and for the reasons set forth in part I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>of this opinion, I conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently against his penal interest to be admissible under Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Even if I were to assume, arguendo, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that portions of the Bryant evidence were against Bryant\u2019s penal interest and satisfied the trustworthiness factors, I nonetheless would conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that <em>all </em>of the Bryant evidence, rather than only those portions that were against Bryant\u2019s penal interest, would have been admissible at a new trial. In concluding that the Bryant evidence would be admissible in its entirety, the trial court stated: \u201cBryant\u2019s statements against penal interest are [admissible], and his self-serving statements go to their weight and will not preclude their admissibility under [the hearsay] exception [for declarations against penal interest].\u201d This ruling was premised on an erroneous interpretation of Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4) and contravenes our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 676, and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 594. \u201cTo the extent a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our . . . review is plenary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 696-97, we addressed the issue of whether the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest permitted the admission of narratives that contain both self-inculpatory and self-serving statements. In <em>Bryant, </em>the defendant was convicted of burglarizing an apartment, sexually assaulting a woman therein and stealing her pocketbook. Id., 677-78. At trial, the defendant prof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>fered, under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest, various statements that his brother had made for the puipose of showing that his brother was the actual peipetrator. Id., 689. Specifically, the defendant introduced evidence that his brother had confessed to several witnesses that he had burglarized the apartment and stole the victim\u2019s pocketbook. Id., 690. The defendant\u2019s brother did not, however, admit to sexually assaulting the victim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The trial court held that the statements of the defendant\u2019s brother were inadmissible because his admission regarding the burglary alone was a \u201cselective declaration against penal interest . . .

On appeal, we held that the trial court improperly precluded the defendant from offering the statements, stating: \u201cIn vacuo, one might contend that [the brother\u2019s] silence as to the latter charge after direct admissions to the former has self-interest connotations and thus any statement short of a complete confession to both crimes should not be admitted into evidence. Any such claim, however, lacks merit <em>in this case. . . . </em>Our view is that [when] the disserving parts of a statement are <em>intertwined </em>with self-serving parts, it is more prudential to admit the entire statement and let the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 696-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In the present case, the trial court concluded that the Bryant evidence was admissible in its entirety without discerning whether Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements were intertwined with his self-serving statements. The trial court\u2019s mistake of law is understandable in light of the fact that, over the years, commentators have incorrectly omitted this requirement from their commentary. See C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.43.2; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4), commentary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it remains part of the rule in <em>Bryant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Unlike the statements at issue in <em>Bryant, </em>in which it was not possible for the court to sever the brother\u2019s <em>silence </em>as to the sexual assault charge from his confession to the burglary, Bryant\u2019s purportedly self-inculpatory statements in the present case are severable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>his self-serving statements. Therefore, only the former are admissible. According to the trial court, Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements include the following: On the night of the murder, (1) Bryant was in Belle Haven, (2) Bryant picked up one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, \u201cswung it,\u201d and \u201c[slung] it back to where the bag . . . was,\u201d and (3) at one point, Biyant and the victim were among ten to fifteen teenagers socializing in the meadow.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Notably, under the rule in <em>Bryant, </em>none of Bryant\u2019s statements concerning Hasbrouck and Tinsley<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> would be admissible because they are self-serving, have no bearing on Bryant\u2019s penal interest and, most importantly, are not \u201cintertwined\u201d with Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 697. Because these statements are the only statements that purportedly serve to exculpate the petitioner, their inadmissibility precludes the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Bryant evidence is admissible in its entirety also is in contravention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 594. In <em>Williamson, </em>the issue was whether the federal hearsay exception for statements against penal interest; Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (3); permits the admission of statements that are not self-inculpatory when they are made in the course of a narrative that also contains self-inculpatory statements. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 599. Resolution of this issue required the court to determine the meaning of the word \u201cstatement\u201d as used in the rule. Id. The court noted that the word \u201cstatement\u201d could be defined either as \u201ca report or narrative,\u201d which connotes an extended declaration, or as \u201ca single declaration or remark.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Under the first definition, a declarant\u2019s entire narrative would be admissible, even if it contains parts that are self-inculpatory and parts that are not self-inculpatory, as \u201clong as in the aggregate the confession sufficiently inculpates [the declarant].\u201d Id. Under the second definition, however, the rule \u201cwould . . . cover only those declarations or remarks within [a larger narrative] that are individually self-inculpatory.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The court held that \u201cthe principle behind the [r]ule . . . points clearly to the narrower reading. Rule 804 (b) (3) is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true. This notion simply does not extend to the broader definition of \u2018statement. \u2019 The fact that a person is making a broadly self-inculpatory confession does not make more credible the [parts of the confession that are not self-inculpatory]. One of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cAnd when part of [a] confession is actually self-exculpatory, the generalization on which [r]ule 804 (b) (3) is founded becomes even less applicable. Self-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones [that] people are most likely to make even when they are false; and mere proximity to other, self-inculpatory, statements does not increase the plausibility of the self-exculpatory statements. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cNothing in the text of [r]ule 804 (b) (3) or the general theory of the hearsay [r]ules suggests that admissibility should turn on whether a statement is collateral to a self-inculpatory statement. The fact that a statement is self-inculpatory does make it more reliable; but the fact that a statement is collateral to a self-inculpatory statement says nothing at all about the collateral statement\u2019s reliability. We see no reason why collateral statements, even ones that are neutral as to interest . . . should be treated any differently from other hearsay statements that are generally excluded. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cIn [the court\u2019s] view, the most faithful reading of [r]ule 804 (b) (3) is that it does not allow admission of [statements that are not self-inculpatory], even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory. The [trial] court may not just assume for purposes of [r]ule 804 (b) (3) that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is part of a fuller confession, and <em>this is especially true when the statement implicates someone else.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 599-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Although rule 804 (b) (3) applies only to self-inculpatory statements, \u201cwhether a statement is self-inculpatory or not can ... be determined [only] by viewing it in context. Even statements that are on their face neutral may actually be against the declarant\u2019s interest . . . in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 603-604. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>in determining whether a particular statement is admissible under rule 804 (b) (3), a judge must consider the <em>entire </em>narrative and other surrounding circumstances rather than analyze each statement in a vacuum.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Although this court has not yet had occasion to formally give its imprimatur to the rule announced in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 600-601, our previous opinions indicate that the rule should be followed in Connecticut. Specifically, in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 451-52, we explicitly stated that \u201cthe rule we adopt [with respect to third party statements against penal interest] is in accord with the Federal Rules of Evidence,\u201d and, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 643, \u201cwe [took] a step further and adopt[ed] the definition of statement against penal interest contained in the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d It follows, therefore, that our rule should be interpreted in the same manner as the federal rule, especially when the United States Supreme Court in <em>Williamson </em>has interpreted the very definition that we formally adopted in <em>Gold.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In the present case, the bulk of Bryant\u2019s statements are not self-inculpatory and, thus, are inadmissible under the rule in <em>Williamson. </em>Of Bryant\u2019s many statements, including those contained in an hour long video recording, only three, when viewed in context, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>arguably qualify as statements against Bryant\u2019s penal interest: (1) Bryant was in Belle Haven on the night of the murder; (2) Bryant picked up one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, \u201cswung it,\u201d and \u201c[slung] it back to where the bag . . . was\u201d; and (3) at one point, Bryant and the victim were among the ten to fifteen teenagers socializing in the meadow. The remainder of Bryant\u2019s statements are neutral or contextual \u2014 e.g., Bryant attended Brunswick School in Greenwich \u2014 or are blatantly self-serving \u2014 e.g., Bryant\u2019s statements inculpating Hasbrouck and Tinsley. Under the rule of <em>Williamson, none </em>of these statements is admissible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because Bryant\u2019s self-serving statements are the only statements that exculpate the petitioner, their inadmissibility precludes the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> The majority acknowledges that the state raised the issue of admissibility of the Bryant evidence before the trial court and in this appeal, yet the majority concludes that it \u201cneed not examine\u201d that issue in light of its resolution of the secondary issue concerning the trial court\u2019s application of the test set forth in <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 811, 820-21, 792 A.2d 797 (2002), for granting new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence.

Indeed, no such case exists in Connecticut. Rather, the dissent relies heavily on certain broad statements contained in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 676, while completely ignoring the facts in <em>Bryant </em>that gave rise to those statements. Specifically, in <em>Bryant, </em>the declarant\u2019s statements were held to be against his penal interest <em>because he admitted to committing felony burglary. </em>See id., 696. Similarly, the dissent relies on the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredes, </em>775 N.W.2d 554 (Iowa 2009), for the proposition that a statement may be admissible under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest even though the declarant explicitly denies responsibility for the crime. Again, however, the dissent has failed to disclose the factual basis for the court\u2019s ruling. In <em>Paredes, </em>the defendant was convicted of child endangerment after his infant child was diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome. Id., 557. On appeal, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to admit various statements that were made by the infant\u2019s mother as statements against penal interest. Id., 570. In particular, the court held that, although the mother denied hurting the infant, she previously had admitted that she and the defendant were the infant\u2019s only caregivers; id., 568-69; and stated that the defendant \u201cdid not do it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 568. Accordingly, the court concluded that, \u201cby making statements tending to exculpate [the defendant], [the mother] was indirectly implicating herself as the person who caused the injuries.\u201d Id., 569. In the present case, there are no comparable admissions to anything remotely criminal. It is undisputed that the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest includes \u201cnot only confessions\u201d but also statements that are <em>\u201cexceedingly inculpatory, </em>but [fall] short of being a confession . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 642-43. It is disputed, however, whether the statements at issue in the present case are sufficiently inculpatory to qualify for admission under that standard. The dissent fails to cite to any legal authority supporting the admission of statements, like Bryant\u2019s, that are, as the trial court accurately described, <em>\u201cminimally </em>against his interest.\u201d(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> Bryant stated that there could have been ten to fifteen teenagers socializing in the meadow around 9 p.m. on the night of the murder. In addition, Andrew Pugh, a witness that the state called at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, testified that, between approximately 6 and 7:30 p.m., he was behind the Skakels\u2019 house with \u201cten or twelve\u201d neighborhood children. Maria Coomaraswamy-Palkenstein, another witness, also testified at the hearing on the petition for a new trial that she had observed \u201ca large group\u201d of people near the Skakels\u2019 house, and that the group split up and reassembled within the neighborhood throughout the night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> Specifically, Bryant stated: \u201cI never wanted to know. ...

Even if Bryant was so aware, it does not change the fact that he claimed to be unaware of the <em>instrumentality </em>used to commit the murder. Many objects can be used to bludgeon, such as a baseball bat or a hammer. If Bryant is to be believed, he could not have known that handling one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs could be any more against his penal interest than handling one of the Skakels\u2019 tools or other household items. Thus, the rationale for admitting the statement as a statement against penal interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>does not apply. If, however, the dissent is suggesting that Bryant knew that one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs was, in fact, the murder weapon, then Bryant\u2019s conflicting statements reveal that he is untruthful and, as such, his statements are not trustworthy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> The dissent mischaracterizes my analysis of Bryant\u2019s statements by incorrectly stating that I examine each of Bryant\u2019s disserving statements \u201cin isolation\u201d and \u201cout of the context in which they actually were spoken . . . If I had analyzed Bryant\u2019s statements in this simplistic manner, then my analysis may have proceeded in the following manner: Bryant states he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. Simply being present in Belle Haven is not a crime. Thus, the statement was not against Bryant\u2019s penal interest. Clearly, my analysis does not proceed in the crude fashion that the dissent suggests. Rather, as the foregoing analysis reveals, I have given due deference to the context of Bryant\u2019s statements, and that context renders the statements insufficiently against Bryant\u2019s penal interest to be admissible under Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Specifically, Bryant qualified his statements with assertions that he was not in Belle Haven at the time of the murder, that many people were in Belle Haven on the night of the murder, that <em>everybody </em>in Belle Haven touched the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, that he did not know how the victim was murdered, and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want any part of\u2019 Hasbrouck and Tinsley\u2019s alleged plan. All of these assertions provide context for Bryant\u2019s statements and expose them for what the trial court recognized as being \u201c[mere] claims of information [about] a crime accompanied by [Bryant\u2019s] alibi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The dissent ignores this <em>actual </em>context and, instead, relies on an inaccurate and hyperbolic summary of the \u201ccontext\u201d of Bryant\u2019s statements. Specifically, the dissent describes the context as follows: \u201cBryant places himself at the scene of the crime, in the company of the victim, shortly before the murder, holding the possible murder weapon, and discussing an attack on the victim with the two persons \u2014 both of whom Bryant had introduced and brought to Belle Haven \u2014 who, shortly after the victim\u2019s murder, boasted about having committed the crime.\u201d What is most disturbing about this characterization is that the dissent, in its zeal to find the Bryant evidence admissible, has stretched the \u201cfacts\u201d to the point where they are no longer supported by the evidence. The <em>actual </em>facts contained in the record reveal that Hasbrouck and Tinsley <em>never </em>\u201cboasted about having committed <em>the crime,\u201d </em>that is, the victim\u2019s murder. (Emphasis added.) To the contrary, Bryant explicitly stated that Hasbrouck and Tinsley <em>never </em>confessed to murdering the victim and <em>never </em>disclosed any details about their alleged involvement in her murder. Indeed, Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s alleged comments <em>never </em>contained any mention of the victim by name and were always couched in vague terms, such as, \u201cI got mine,\u201d \u201c[w]e did it,\u201d and \u201c[w]e achieved our fantasy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\"> The converse of this rationale also is generally true, that is, if a declarant makes a statement to a person with whom he does not share a close and confidential relationship, then it is unlikely that the declarant\u2019s statement was against his penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> Specifically, the trial court relied on the following \u201ccorroborating evidence,\u201d much of which was not <em>independently </em>corroborated but, rather, corroborated by Bryant\u2019s own prior statements: \u201cBryant went to . . .

Pieces of the golf club found near the victim\u2019s body were the same brand of golf club found at the [Skakels\u2019] residence. Evidence presented at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial shows that these clubs were commonly left about the [Skakels\u2019] property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b561-13\"> The trial court based these conclusions on the following findings of fact: \u201cOf all the persons in Bryant\u2019s circle of Greenwich acquaintances at the time, none of them, other than [Neal] Walker and Mills, recalled [Hasbrouck and Tinsley]. Not even [the victim\u2019s] closest friends have any recollection of any association between [the victim] and Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley. No one puts [the victim] in the company of Bryant and his companions on the night of [the murder]. There is no testimony that [Bryant, Hasbrouck or Tinsley] were in [the] company [of the victim] on any other occasion. Importantly, witnesses testify as to [the victim\u2019s] activities until 9:30 p.m. No one has any recall of ever seeing Bryant and [Hasbrouck and Tinsley] in Belle Haven on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">\u201cThe claim that Hasbrouck and Tinsley went \u2018caveman style\u2019 is not supported by the evidence. There was no evidence of the victim being dragged by [her] hair. Missing from Bryant\u2019s statement is anything concerning the breaking of the [golf] club or the stabbing of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">The dissent, in contravention of this court\u2019s role as an appellate tribunal; see, e.g., <em>Saunders v. Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 535, 978 A.2d 487 (2009) (\u201c[A]ppellate courts do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a different conclusion. Instead, [they] examine the trial court\u2019s conclusion in order to determine whether it was legally correct and factually supported. . . . This distinction accords with [an appellate tribunal\u2019s] duty ... to review, and not to retry, the proceedings of the trial court.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); ignores these findings of fact that support the trial court\u2019s explicit conclusion that \u201c[t]he . . . Bryant [evidence] is <em>absent any genuine corroboration.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) These findings, of course, are dispositive of the admissibility of the Bryant evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Rather than conceding this point and accepting these findings of fact, the dissent relies on its own selection of facts that it has culled from the case file and exhibits. In this regard, the dissent, as it aptly states, \u201cviolates the bedrock principle of appellate jurisprudence that the trial court, not this court, is the finder of fact, and, consequently, we are bound by those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d Footnote 52 of the dissenting opinion, citing <em>Key Air, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>294 Conn. 225, 231, 983 A.2d 1 (2009) (\u201c[t]o the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> The dissent incorrectly advocates that we should give greater weight to the dictum in <em>Bryant </em>than to its unambiguous holding. In <em>Bryant, </em>we commented on the divide among commentators and some courts concerning the problem with statements that are both disserving and self-serving. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 696-97 n.18. We stated, as a matter of dictum, that we were <em>\u201cinclined\u201d </em>to agree \u2014 not that we actually agreed\u2014 with those commentators that \u201cwould admit the entire statement,\u201d rather than those who suggested \u201cadmitting only the disserving portion of the declaration and excluding the self-serving part where the two parts can be severed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Nevertheless, in the <em>text </em>of our opinion, we clearly <em>held </em>that it was \u201c[o]ur view . . . that [when] the disserving parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>of a statement are <em>intertwined </em>with self-serving parts, it is more prudential to admit the entire statement and let the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 696-97. Thus, in <em>Bryant, </em>although we mused about certain <em>inclinations </em>that we <em>possibly </em>could apply in a future case, our holding in that case was limited to a narrative in which the disserving and self-serving statements were intertwined, and it is that holding that is the law that must be applied. My conclusion in this case faithfully applies the holding in <em>Bryant.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\"> The commentary to \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen a narrative contains both disserving statements and collateral, self serving or neutral statements, the Connecticut rule admits the entire narrative, letting the \u2018trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 697; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 173-74.\u201d The dissent argues that this commentary is dispositive with respect to how Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4) is to be interpreted. This view, however, is incorrect because the stated purpose of the Code of Evidence was \u201cto maintain <em>the status quo, </em>i.e., preserve the common-law rules of evidence <em>as they existed prior to the adoption of the [c]ode, </em>[and] its adoption [was] <em>\u2018not intended to modify any prior common-law interpretation of those rules.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-2 (a), commentary. Thus, even though the commentary to Conn.

Finally, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 351, we implicitly called into question the continued viability of the rule in <em>Bryant, post-Williamson, </em>but determined that the declarant\u2019s entire statement therein was admissible under either rule because the \u201centire statement was self-inculpatory . . . .\u201d Id., 371 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">I note that the dissent has identified four sister state courts that have considered and declined to follow the rule in <em>Williamson </em>for purposes of their respective state\u2019s hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>966 P.2d 563, 578-79 (Colo. 1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>264 Kan. 437, 447, 957 P.2d 496 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sonthikoummane, </em>145 N.H. 316, 320-21, 769 A.2d 330 (2000); <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 279, 455 S.E.2d 219, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 889, 116 S.

See, e.g., <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 600 (\u201c[s]elf-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones [that] people are most likely to make even when they are false\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b571-6\">PALMER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArX\">dissenting. Contrary to the determination of the trial court, I believe that the petitioner, Michael C. Skakel, is entitled to a new trial for the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley (victim) in the Belle Haven section of the town of Greenwich due to the discovery of significant new evidence that was not available at the time of his original trial. In particular, I am convinced that the trial court improperly denied the petitioner a new trial on the basis of information brought forward by Gitano \u201cTony\u201d Bryant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1 \u2014 information that directly implicates two other suspects, Adolph Hasbrouck and Burton Tinsley, in the victim\u2019s murder\u2014 after failing to evaluate the significance of that newly discovered evidence in light of the nature and strength of the original trial evidence. I reach this conclusion because the evidence that Bryant provided during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>course of his lengthy and detailed video-recorded interview satisfies all of the requirements necessary for a new trial. First, the Bryant evidence is highly relevant because it identifies Hasbrouck and Tinsley as the persons actually responsible for the victim\u2019s murder. Second, as the trial court expressly found, the Bryant evidence, although hearsay, would be admissible at a new trial under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule because, inter alia, corroborating circumstances clearly indicate its trustworthiness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I also conclude that the Bryant evidence is admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Third, because the evidence is marked by substantial indicia of reliability, and because the record reveals nothing about Bryant or his background to suggest either that he is the kind of person who would provide testimony falsely implicating two innocent people in a brutal murder or that he had any reason or motive to do so, the trial court improperly failed to consider that evidence in the overall context of the original trial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, at the very least, it is likely that this new evidence, when considered in light of the state\u2019s thin case against the petitioner, would give rise to a reasonable doubt about whether the petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>involved in the victim\u2019s murder. The likelihood of an acquittal upon retrial is enhanced by other newly discovered evidence, namely, the relationship between the lead investigator in the case, Frank Garr, and Leonard Levitt, the author of a book about the victim\u2019s murder on which Garr collaborated, and the views expressed by Garr in that book reflecting, inter alia, his strong and long-standing feelings of antipathy toward the petitioner and the petitioner\u2019s family. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">LEGAL STANDARD GOVERNING NEW TRIAL PETITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">I begin my review of the petitioner\u2019s claim with a brief summary of the legal standard governing the petitioner\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. As this court stated in <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 521 A.2d 578 (1987), to prevail on a petition for anew trial, \u201c[t]he petitioner must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the proffered evidence is newly discovered, such that it could not have been discovered earlier by the exercise of due diligence; (2) it would be material on a new trial; (3) it is not merely cumulative; and (4) it is likely to produce a different result in a new trial.\u201d Id., 434. Because it is undisputed that the Bryant evidence satisfies the first three <em>Asherman </em>requirements, the primary issue raised by the petitioner\u2019s appeal implicates only the fourth and final requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">In <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 811, 792 A.2d 797 (2002), we elaborated on the fourth prong of the <em>Asherman </em>test, stating: \u201cThe trial court must always consider the newly discovered evidence in the context of the evidence presented in the original trial. In so doing, it must determine, first, that the evidence passes a minimum credibility threshold. That is, if, in the trial court\u2019s opinion, the newly discovered evidence simply is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>credible, it may legitimately determine that, even if presented to a new jury in a second trial, it probably would not yield a different result and may deny the petition on that basis. ... If, however, the trial court determines that the evidence is sufficiently credible so that, if a second jury were to consider it together with all of the original trial evidence, it probably would yield a different result or otherwise avoid an injustice, the fourth element of the <em>Asherman </em>test would be satisfied.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 827-28; accord <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 831, 838, 792 A.2d 809 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Thus, we apply a two part test for the purpose of determining whether the newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial under the final <em>Asherman </em>factor. First, the petitioner must demonstrate that the evidence is \u201cnot incredible\u201d; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 844; because, if the evidence truly is incredible, the second jury would not credit it. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>141 Conn. 202, 208, 104 A.2d 761 (1954) (no injustice done in denying petition for new trial when newly discovered evidence reasonably is found to be \u201cutterly unworthy of credence . . . since it should be presumed that no jury will believe an incredible story\u201d). Because a new trial is required if the newly discovered evidence, when considered in the context of the original trial evidence, gives rise to a reasonable doubt concerning the petitioner\u2019s guilt, that evidence need not be so convincing or persuasive as to be compelling. Rather, the evidence must only meet a \u201cminimum credibility threshold\u201d; <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 827; accord <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 838; a standard that requires the petitioner merely to establish that the evidence is not so lacking in credibility as to be wholly unworthy of belief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 844. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Upon satisfaction of that minimum requirement, the court then must proceed to the second step of the analytical process, which \u201crequirejs] [the court] to determine whether the newly discovered evidence is <em>sufficiently </em>credible [and of such a nature] that, if admitted in a new trial and reviewed by a second jury together with all of the evidence presented at the original trial, it is likely to produce a different result\u201d; (emphasis added) id.; see also <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 827; that is, it is likely to give rise to a reasonable doubt about the petitioner\u2019s guilt, \u201cor otherwise [to] avoid an injustice . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 838; accord <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision with respect to a petition for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 820. When considering the newly discovered evidence in light of the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s original trial, however, this court is no less capable than the trial court of assessing the strength of the original trial evidence if; as in the present case, the trial court did not preside over the petitioner\u2019s original trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>451 Mass. 310, 325, 885 N.E.2d 769 (2008) (\u201cWe defer to a judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses at a hearing on the motion for a new trial. However, we regard ourselves in as good a position as a motion judge who was not the trial judge to assess the trial record.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307, 491 N.E.2d 246 (1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The petitioner first contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the newly discovered Bryant evidence was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible as a declaration against penal interest but nevertheless so lacking in credibility as to justify the trial court\u2019s failure to consider that evidence in the light of the original trial evidence. Second, the petitioner claims that this court should reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of his new trial petition because the trial court improperly failed to consider his separate claim that a new trial is required to \u201cavoid an injustice . . . .\u201d With respect to the petitioner\u2019s first contention, the majority concludes that the evidence adduced at the hearing on the petition for a new trial supports the trial court\u2019s rejection of the petitioner\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a new trial, even though the trial court never considered the Bryant evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>dence in the context of the original trial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to the petitioner\u2019s second claim, the majority concludes that the petitioner is incorrect in asserting that, under <em>Shabazz, </em>newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial, irrespective of whether the trial court finds that such evidence <em>likely </em>will produce a different result, if a second trial is necessary to avoid an injustice. In rejecting this contention, the majority interprets <em>Shabazz </em>as creating a unitary standard for purposes of the fourth prong of the <em>Asherman </em>test despite our express statement in <em>Shabazz </em>that a new trial is necessary when the newly discovered evidence \u201cprobably would yield a different result <em>or otherwise avoid an </em>injustice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">With respect to the petitioner\u2019s first claim, I conclude that the newly discovered Bryant evidence meets the minimum credibility threshold as a matter of law and, therefore, that the trial court improperly failed to consider that evidence in light of the original trial evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I reach that conclusion because, under the particular circumstances of this case, the very same factors that led the trial court properly to conclude that Bryant\u2019s statements are admissible as trustworthy declarations against penal interest necessarily sufficed to satisfy the minimum credibility requirement contemplated under the first prong of the <em>Shabazz </em>formulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>conclude that, on the basis of the undisputed facts, the newly discovered Bryant evidence requires a new trial because that evidence, when viewed in the light of the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s original trial, is likely to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether the petitioner murdered the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Although my determination in this regard makes it unnecessary for me to address the petitioner\u2019s second claim, namely, that a new trial is required to avoid an injustice, I do so because I disagree with the majority that avoiding an injustice constitutes an insufficient ground for granting a petition for a new trial in the present case or in any other case. In particular, I am unwilling to presume that our use of the disjunctive, both in <em>Shabazz </em>and Adams, when articulating the applicable test, coupled with the use of the word \u201cotherwise\u201d to underscore that the second prong of the test is different from the first prong, constituted merely loose language or surplusage. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 838 (new trial required \u201c[i]f . . . the trial court determines that the evidence is sufficiently credible so that, if a second jury were to consider it together with all of the original trial evidence, it probably would yield a different result <em>or otherwise avoid an </em>injustice\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 827 (\u201cthere may be cases in which the trial court is justified in determining that the newly discovered evidence is sufficiently credible and of such a nature that, <em>in order </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>to avoid an injustice, </em>a second jury, rather than the trial court itself, should make the ultimate assessment of its credibility\u201d [emphasis added]). Indeed, this is precisely the position taken by our Appellate Court, which recently explained that, in <em>Shabazz, </em>this court \u201clooked <em>beyond the traditional four-pronged test </em>for newly discovered evidence and [was] <em>guided by the general principle of whether an injustice was done.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>State\u2019s Attorney, </em>84 Conn. App. 195, 203, 852 A.2d 841, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 923, 859 A.2d 578 (2004).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Furthermore, such a test makes eminent good sense. I can think of no legitimate reason why a court should not grant a petitioner a new trial when the discovery of new evidence places the validity of the original conviction in such doubt, or so seriously undermines our confidence in the accuracy of the verdict, that it would be unjust to deny the petitioner a new trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>supra, 451 Mass. 326 (\u201cA defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must show that the evidence is newly discovered, that it is material and credible, and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction. Newly discovered evidence that is merely cumulative of evidence admitted at the trial will carry little weight. The task of the [trial court] is to decide whether the new evidence probably would have been a real factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>in the jury\u2019s deliberations, and in that regard the [court] must consider the strength of the case against the defendant.\u201d). The state\u2019s interest in the finality of judgments cannot be so great as to deny a petitioner a new trial when the petitioner has satisfied such a standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Gannon </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Conn. 576, 577, 54 A. 199 (1903) (\u201c[t]he finality of a judgment does not preclude the court that rendered it from entertaining further proceedings in the same action, <em>when it is made apparent that injustice has been </em>done\u201d [emphasis added]). In the present case, because the petitioner satisfies the first <em>Shabazz </em>criterion, he necessarily has met this alternative standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">With these principles in mind, I now briefly summarize the trial court\u2019s decision and the majority opinion, both of which reject the petitioner\u2019s claims. I then turn to a more lengthy discussion of why I believe that the trial court and the majority are wrong in denying the petitioner a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">SUMMARY OF THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DECISION AND THE MAJORITY OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The petitioner raised several claims in his petition for a new trial, including the claim that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of the newly discovered Bryant evidence and certain revelations about Garr, including Garr\u2019s apparent hostility toward the petitioner and the petitioner\u2019s family.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>1 first summarize the trial court\u2019s and the majority\u2019s treatment of the Bryant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">At the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the trial court was informed that Bryant had invoked his privilege against self-incrimination at a deposition that had been noticed by the petitioner for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>exploring Bryant\u2019s knowledge of certain information that he previously had provided, during a video-recorded interview, directly implicating Hasbrouck and Tinsley in the victim\u2019s murder. The petitioner also presented the court with that video-recorded interview, claiming that, because Bryant was unavailable as a witness, the statements contained therein, although hearsay, would be admissible at a new trial because they were against Bryant\u2019s penal interest and bore sufficient indicia of reliability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The petitioner also claimed that Bryant\u2019s statements were admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. The trial court agreed with the petitioner\u2019s first claim that the statements were admissible under the hearsay exception for trustworthy declarations against penal interest, and, therefore, the court did not address the petitioner\u2019s alternative ground of admissibility. The trial court also concluded, however, that Bryant\u2019s statements were not credible. That conclusion was based primarily on the court\u2019s predicate finding that Bryant\u2019s statements were supported by no more than minimal corroboration, and on certain evidence adduced at the hearing, including testimony establishing that Bryant did not come forward with the information for more than twenty-five years and that \u201c[n]o one ha[d] any recall of ever seeing Bryant and his companions in Belle Haven on the night of the murder.\u201d Having concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were not credible, the trial court did not consider those statements in the context of the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s original trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In its review of the trial court\u2019s decision, the majority declines to decide whether the trial court properly determined that the Bryant evidence would be admissible at a new trial as trustworthy third party statements against penal interest. The majority explains that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>is no need to do so because, in its view, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Bryant\u2019s account of the relevant events, although sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, is not credible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of its determination that the trial court reasonably concluded that the Bryant evidence simply is not sufficiently believable to have a bearing on the jury\u2019s assessment of the state\u2019s case, the majority also does not engage in an evaluation of the strength of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The petitioner also claimed that Garr\u2019s relationship with Levitt, the author of a book about the case that was published after the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, and certain revelations about the publication and content of that book, constitute newly discovered evidence that warrants a new trial. In support of his claim, the petitioner relied in part on the fact that, at the discovery stage of his criminal case, he had sought the disclosure of evidence that any agent of the state had a \u201cpecuniary or other interest in the development and/or outcome of [the] case, including, but not limited to, any contract, agreement, or ongoing negotiations, which relate to the preparation of any book . . . .\u201d Although it is undisputed that the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the petitioner\u2019s discovery request in his criminal case applied to Garr, the state never provided the petitioner with any information in response to that request. Despite undisputed evidence of a previously undisclosed private pact between Garr and Levitt that the two would \u201ctell [their] story\u201d when the case was over \u2014 a story that, when ultimately told, reveals how passionately they believed that the petitioner, aided in a cover-up by other members of his family, was responsible for the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>death, how aggressively they pursued the case against the petitioner, and how intensely Garr disliked him and his family \u2014 the trial court in the present case concluded that the agreement was neither newly discovered nor \u201cevidence that would have swayed the jury as to lead it to acquit.\u201d Finally, the trial court also rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that a new trial was required because of the state\u2019s failure to disclose Garr\u2019s one-half financial interest in the net revenues from Levitt\u2019s book. The majority assumes without deciding that the evidence of Garr and Levitt\u2019s relationship was newly discovered but concludes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the petitioner was not entitled to a new trial because the petitioner failed to prove that the evidence probably would result in an acquittal upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">THE NEWLY DISCOVERED BRYANT EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The following facts, all of which were adduced at the hearing on the petition for a new trial, are relevant to my conclusion that the newly discovered Bryant evidence<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was sufficiently credible such that, under <em>Shabazz, </em>the trial court was required to consider it in light of the original trial evidence. Shortly after the petitioner was convicted, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the petitioner\u2019s first cousin, published an article, entitled \u201cA Miscarriage of Justice,\u201d in the January-February, 2003 edition of The Atlantic magazine, in which he maintained that the petitioner had been wrongly convicted. After the article appeared, Kennedy was contacted by Crawford Mills, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>a former resident of Greenwich and a classmate of Bryant\u2019s at Brunswick School, a private preparatory school for boys located in the town of Greenwich that Bryant had attended from 1972 until 1975.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Mills, a trusted friend of Bryant\u2019s, informed Kennedy that, two years earlier, Bryant, who then was a businessman in Florida, had confided in him that he had been in Belle Haven on the night of the victim\u2019s murder and that two of Bryant\u2019s high school classmates from Manhattan, New York, namely, Hasbrouck and Tinsley, were responsible for the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Mills told Kennedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that, for a number of reasons, Bryant was extremely reluctant to come forward but that, after the petitioner\u2019s arrest, he had consented to allow Mills to communicate the information about Hasbrouck and Tinsley to the authorities on the condition that Mills not disclose Bryant\u2019s name. Mills did contact the authorities, including the prosecutor in the case, but Mills was told that, unless the person providing the information was willing to come forward, the authorities could not act on the allegations. After the petitioner was convicted and Bryant still refused to come forward, Mills decided that he no longer would protect Bryant\u2019s identity and gave Bryant\u2019s name to Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Shortly after his conversation with Mills, Kennedy contacted Bryant by telephone. Kennedy recorded the telephone call and all subsequent calls that he made to Bryant and to other potential witnesses in the case. The recordings of the telephone calls were entered into evidence at the hearing on the petition for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and played for the court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In his first telephone call to Bryant, which was brief, Bryant told Kennedy only that he had known the petitioner when the two of them were students at Brunswick School but that he and the petitioner never had been friends. Bryant agreed to speak with Kennedy again the next day, when Bryant had more time. In his next conversation with Kennedy, Bryant explained that one of the reasons that he had been so reluctant to come forward was that he was worried about the repercussions for his family. According to Bryant, a few members of his family were quite prominent in the community and would not appreciate any publicity linking Bryant to a murder case. In particular, Bryant\u2019s mother, Barbara Bryant, is an Academy Award winning producer of educational films and a cofounder and executive vice president of the Phoenix Learning Group, Inc., and one of his cousins is the professional basketball player Kobe Bryant. Bryant also expressed concern that he could be accused of having been involved in the murder and that his business might be adversely affected if he were to become embroiled in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Bryant then related to Kennedy that, after he left Brunswick School prior to the ninth grade,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> he briefly attended Charles Evans Hughes High School (Hughes High School),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a public high school in Manhattan, before transferring to a private preparatory school in Texas. Bryant met Hasbrouck and Tinsley while attending Hughes High School. According to Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley were \u201cwild\u201d and \u201c[t]hey spurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>each other on. They fed off each other big time.\u201d Bryant explained that, although he then resided with his mother in Manhattan, all of his friends were still in Greenwich, and he often took a train there to visit them. Bryant also explained that, on several occasions, Hasbrouck and Tinsley went with him. According to Bryant, Greenwich was a different world from New York City, and, for Hasbrouck and Tinsley, it was \u201cforbidden fruit . . . .\u201d Bryant stated: \u201c[I]magine coming from the inner city into Greenwich in the . . . mid [1970s]; [it was] the difference between Beirut [Lebanon] and Cape Cod [Massachusetts], . . . It\u2019s the difference between [the] have and have-nots . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On the evening of the murder, Bryant, Tinsley and Hasbrouck went to Belle Haven to participate in \u201chell night,\u201d also known as \u201cmischief night,\u201d the night before Halloween when neighborhood children traditionally would engage in pranks and other mischief. According to Bryant, Hasbrouck had met the victim on a previous visit to Greenwich and he \u201chad this thing for her\u201d and \u201cwould just say things that were just really, looking back, you would just be, oh my God, why didn\u2019t I say something, and it just, it bothers me.\u201d Bryant told Kennedy that, after they arrived in Belle Haven from the train station, he, Hasbrouck and Tinsley spent the evening pulling pranks, drinking, and smoking cigarettes and marijuana with another boy from the neighborhood, Geoffrey Byrne.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According to Bryant, he left Belle Haven at around 9:15 p.m. to catch a train back to Manhattan, while Hasbrouck and Tinsley decided to stay the night with Byrne. Before Bryant left, Hasbrouck told him that he was going to \u201c[g]et caveman tonight\u201d on a girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>When Bryant next saw Hasbrouck and Tinsley at school the following Monday, Hasbrouck \u201csaid some very . . . damaging\u201d things that left no doubt in Bryant\u2019s mind that Hasbrouck and Tinsley had killed the victim. According to Bryant, over the next several months, Hasbrouck and Tinsley showed no remorse for what they had done and, in fact, joked and bragged about it. Bryant also told Kennedy that he immediately told his mother about what had happened, and she told him that he must distance himself from Hasbrouck and Tinsley, explaining that they could be dangerous not only to him but to Bryant\u2019s entire family. Bryant further stated that, on the basis of what Byrne had said to him after the murder, he was reasonably certain that Byrne was present when the murder occurred. In a subsequent conversation, Kennedy asked Bryant why, if Hasbrouck was so dangerous, he had associated with him. Bryant responded that, at that point in his life \u2014 he was only fourteen \u2014 it was precisely that aspect of Hasbrouck\u2019s persona that had attracted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Bryant subsequently agreed to an interview with Vito Colucci, a private investigator that the petitioner had retained. In that interview, which was video recorded at a hotel near Bryant\u2019s home in Miami, Florida, Bryant repeated much of what he had told Kennedy on the telephone but in considerably more detail. A copy of the video recording was admitted into evidence and played at the hearing on the petition for a new trial. In the interview, Bryant stated that, \u201c[ajnything you dared [Hasbrouck] to do, he would do.\u201d Bryant further stated that it was easy to tell that \u201c[tjhere was something wrong with him. All you had to do was look at him to know it. . . . [A] lot of kids were afraid of him because he was big and . . . explosive.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> According to Bryant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Tinsley was the \u201cgasoline\u201d and Hasbrouck was the \u201cengine . . . .\u201d Tinsley would incite Hasbrouck to do things, like throw bricks at passing cars, burglarize, anything Tinsley \u201cput him up to.\u201d \u201cIt was always the dare between [them]. . . . [T]hey were always trying to outdo each other. And they would just push each other . . . .\u201d According to Bryant, both Hasbrouck and Tinsley were both about six feet, two inches tall and \u201ceasfily]\u201d weighed 200 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Bryant told Colucci that Hasbrouck first met the victim at a Greenwich street festival in September, 1975, and became infatuated with her. He also saw her at a couple of dances, one or both of which were hosted by a local church or parochial school. Bryant explained that Hasbrouck was \u201cvery immature\u201d and lacked the confidence to approach the victim but that he would talk about her constantly in a very sexually explicit manner. \u201c[F]rom the time he met her . . . until the murder, that\u2019s what he would talk about.\u201d Bryant claims that he told Hasbrouck, \u201c[y]ou need to think about something else. You need to think about somebody else that is more obtainable, because it is not going to happen [with her].\u201d According to Bryant, Hasbrouck\u2019s obsession with the victim \u201cbuilt up with[in] him, [i]t built up tremendous[ly].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On Thursday, October 30, 1975, the night of the murder, Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley traveled from Manhattan to Greenwich to participate in hell night. As Bryant explained, on hell night, older children in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>neighborhood would vandalize property, spray shaving cream and smash pumpkins, among other things. Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley arrived by train at around 5:30 p.m. and went to Neal Walker\u2019s house, but Walker, a former schoolmate of Bryant\u2019s, could not come out with them. They then went across the street to see Byrne, with whom Hasbrouck and Tinsley previously had become acquainted. According to Bryant, he, Tinsley and Hasbrouck stole beer from a neighbor\u2019s refrigerator and walked around the neighborhood with Byrne \u201cplaying pranks\u201d with shaving cream and toilet paper. At approximately 8:30 p.m., they met up with a group of kids in the meadow behind the house of the petitioner\u2019s family,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Skakels, where the group smoked marijuana and cigarettes and drank some more beer. Bryant recalled that the victim was part of the group for a short period of time. Around this time, Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley picked up golf clubs that were lying around the Skakels\u2019 property and started fooling around with them.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Hasbrouck and Tinsley stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>me a girl.\u201d Hasbrouck had indicated throughout the night that he wanted to \u201cgo caveman\u201d on a girl and joked, \u201cI\u2019ve got my caveman club . . . .\u201d According to Bryant, the concept of going caveman derived from a cartoon, and signified grabbing a woman by the hair, dragging her off and presumably sexually assaulting her. Bryant claims that, at approximately 9:15 p.m., he told Hasbrouck and Tinsley that he needed to go home. Biyant stated that he left because he sensed that things were getting out of control but that he also had to go home because of his curfew. Hasbrouck said something to the effect that, \u201cI\u2019m not going out of here unsatisfied.\u201d Bryant stated that, by the time he departed, he, Hasbrouck and Tinsley had consumed a significant amount of alcohol and that things were \u201cat a fever pitch. . . . [T]hey were sort of ready to blow up.\u201d According to Bryant, the next time that he saw Hasbrouck and Tinsley at school, the following Monday, they told him, \u201c[w]e did it. We achieved the caveman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Colucci asked Biyant how he knew that Hasbrouck and Tinsley had stayed the night with Byrne. Bryant responded that they had told him that they stayed there and that Byrne had told him the same thing. In his telephone conversation with Kennedy, Bryant had explained that Byrne\u2019s house offered \u201cthe perfect place\u201d for Hasbrouck and Tinsley to clean up after the murder because \u201c[t]here was hardly anybody home. There [were] a billion rooms in that house and, at most, there were three people there at any given time, [Byrne], his brother and [the] housekeeper. [His] parents were never there.\u201d Bryant also told Colucci that he first found out about the murder from his mother, who showed him an article in the New York Times about it one or two days after the murder, and asked him whether he knew the victim. Bryant told Colucci that he did not come forward sooner because he was afraid that he would be \u201cpinned ... as a suspect\u201d and because he never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>imagined that the petitioner would be convicted. Bryant observed, \u201c[i]f they [could] convict [the petitioner] on circumstantial evidence, I think I would [have been] an easier conviction . . . .\u201d Bryant explained that, in contrast to the petitioner, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the resources to defend [Mm]self.\u201d Bryant also stated that \u201c[o]ne of the parties . . . has passed away. ... So that made [him] . . . run to the hills even worse, because [he] knew [Byrne] knew as much if not more than [he did].\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When asked, Bryant consistently provided the same explanation as to why he did not come forward sooner. For example, Walker, Bryant\u2019s childhood friend from Brunswick School, testified at the hearing on the new trial petition that he learned about Bryant\u2019s allegations against Hasbrouck and Tinsley from Mills sometime in 2002. Mills had asked Walker to call Biyant to try to convince Mm to come forward. At that time, Walker did contact Bryant and asked him why he never had said anything about Hasbrouck and Tinsley. According to Walker, Bryant responded that \u201cMs mother had told him not to because he would be implicated [by] putting himself at the scene of the crime.\u201d Walker asked him why, if that was a concern, he was bringing it up now. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>According to Walker, Bryant answered that he had never been friends with the petitioner but that he felt that it \u201cwas an injustice seeing [the petitioner] being tried for [a] murder that [Bryant] knew [the petitioner] didn\u2019t commit.\u201d Walker further testified that Bryant asked him to give the information to investigators but to try \u201cnot to reveal his name . . . .\u201d Like Mills, Walker contacted the authorities during the trial but was told that, unless Bryant himself was willing to come forward, the information was useless. Mills similarly testified that, when he asked Bryant why he had not come forward sooner, Bryant replied that he had told his mother at the time what had happened and that she had told him to \u201ckeep his mouth shut.\u201d Bryant subsequently invoked his privilege against self-incrimination when subpoenaed to testify at a deposition noticed by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Finally, when first contacted and interviewed by Colucci, both Hasbrouck and Tinsley told Colucci and his associate, Kris Steele, that they had been in Belle Haven on the date of the victim\u2019s murder. Although both men subsequently retracted that representation in follow-up conversations with Colucci, they each invoked their privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer any questions posed by the petitioner at depositions conducted in connection with the petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Hearsay Exception for Statements Against Penal Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\u201cThe hearsay rule ... is premised on the theory that out-of-court statements are subject to particular hazards. The declarant might be lying; he might have misperceived the events [that] he relates; he might have faulty memory; his words might be misunderstood or taken out of context by the listener. And the ways in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>which these dangers are minimized for in-court statements \u2014 the oath, the witness\u2019 awareness of the gravity of the proceedings, the jury\u2019s ability to observe the witness\u2019 demeanor, and, most importantly, the right of the opponent to cross-examine \u2014 are generally absent for things said out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">\u201cNonetheless, the . . . [r]ules of [e]vidence also recognize that some kinds of out-of-court statements are less subject to these hearsay dangers, and therefore except them from the general rule that hearsay is inadmissible. One such category covers statements that are against the declarant\u2019s [penal] interest .... <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 598-99, 114 S. Ct. 2431, 129 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 146, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201cOur present rule allowing the admission of trustworthy third party statements against penal interest has its genesis in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973)\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>239 Conn. 56, 71, 681 A.2d 950 (1996); which held that an accused\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial prevented the exclusion of such statements. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 302-303. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Chambers, </em>\u201c[f]ew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense. ... In the exercise of this right, the accused, as is required of the [s]tate, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to [en]sure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. Although perhaps no rule of evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied in jury trials than that applicable to the exclusion of hearsay, exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>302. Thus, when a statement against penal interest bears significant assurances of trustworthiness and is crucial to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, the due process clause bars exclusion of the statement. See id., 285, 302-303. In other words, as the court in <em>Chambers </em>explained, \u201c[i]n [such] circumstances, [in which] constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.\u201d Id., 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Before <em>Chambers, </em>however, in this state, \u201csuch third party statements were per se inadmissible as hearsay. ... In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>[179 Conn. 431, 449, 426 A.2d 799 (1980)], we interpreted <em>Chambers </em>as forbidding . . . application of the hearsay rule to exclude all third party statements against penal interest exculpatory of an accused. We [nevertheless] concluded . . . that <em>Chambers </em>did not mandate the admission of every such statement but required the admission only of those statements that, <em>after a careful examination, </em>were determined in the sound discretion of the trial court to be <em>trustworthy. State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451-52.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 71. As we explained in <em>DeFreitas, </em>\u201ccourts have recognized that the unrestricted admission of declarations against penal interest would be to invite perjury of a kind that is most difficult to ascertain. To circumscribe fabrication and [to] ensure the reliability of declarations against penal interest, there must exist circumstances . . . [that] clearly tend to support the facts asserted in the declarations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 452 n.9. Thus, under our case law and \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which represents a codification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that case law, a statement against penal interest by an unavailable declarant is admissible only if the statement is trustworthy and, \u201cat the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4); see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Lopez, 254 Conn. 309, 315, 757 A.2d 542 (2000). \u201cIn allowing this exception to the hearsay rule, <em>we are primarily concerned that under the particular circumstances, the statement is trustworthy, </em>that is, that safeguards reasonably equivalent to the oath and the test of cross-examination exist.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 316. The court must consider three primary factors in determining whether the statement is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ciently trustworthy to render it admissible: (1) the time the statement was made and the person or persons to whom the statement was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; and (3) the extent to which the statement was against the penal interest of the declarant. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4); see also <em>State </em>v. Lopez, supra, 254 Conn. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cWe previously have emphasized, however, that no single factor in the test . . . for determining the trustworthiness of third party declarations against penal interest is necessarily conclusive .... Thus, it is not necessary that the trial court find that all of the factors support the trustworthiness of the statement. The trial court should consider all of the factors and determine whether the totality of the circumstances supports the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">With respect to the timeliness element of the first prong of the trustworthiness test, \u201c[w]e afford the trial court broad discretion in deciding whether the timeliness of a statement indicates that it is trustworthy. In general, declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time [during which] a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance. ... A statement\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>timeliness, however, is not necessarily dispositive of the trustworthiness determination.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 317. Thus, this court has upheld the admission of third party statements against penal interest even though the timing of those statements afforded the declarant abundant opportunity for contrivance. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, 268 </em>Conn. 351, 370-71, 844 A.2d 191 (2004) (statement against penal interest made \u201cwithin five months\u201d of commission of crime deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible); <em>State v. Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 634, 431 A.2d 501 (statement made within three months of crime deemed sufficiently trustworthy), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). We also have upheld the exclusion of a statement against penal interest as untrustworthy when the statement was made so soon after the crime that the declarant had little or no time for reflection or fabrication. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 317-21 (statement made one and one-half days after crime was nevertheless untrustworthy because it was not sufficiently corroborated); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 392-93, 528 A.2d 794 (1987) (statement made one day after crime was nevertheless untrustworthy because, inter alia, it was not sufficiently corroborated). Indeed, in certain circumstances, statements against penal interest have been deemed to be particularly reliable because a significant amount of time had elapsed from the date of the crime to the date of the declaration. See, e.g., <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>People, </em>29 P.3d 305, 316 (Colo. 2001) (statement against penal interest more reliable when two years had passed since events at issue and investigation of declarant appeared to be inactive), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 975, 122 S. Ct. 1448, 152 L. Ed. 2d 390 (2002). It therefore may be said that \u201cthe passage of time makes a statement more reliable in one case and less reliable in another.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mizenko, </em>330 Mont. 299, 375, 127 P.3d 458 (War<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ner, J., concurring), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 810, 127 S. Ct. 43, 166 L. Ed. 2d 19 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As for the second part of the first prong of the trustworthiness test, \u201cwe require that the witness testifying [about] the statement must be one in whom the declarant would naturally confide.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 317-18. Thus, the relationship between the declarant and the person in whom the declarant confided must be close and confidential. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>221 Conn. 58, 70, 602 A.2d 571 (1992). \u201c[T]he focus on the party to whom the statement was made is consistent with the requirement that the declarant be aware of the disserving quality of the statement.\u201d <em>Laumer v. United States, </em>409 A.2d 190, 201 n.15 (D.C. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">With respect to the second trustworthiness factor, namely, the existence of corroborating circumstances, this court repeatedly has emphasized that \u201c[t]he corroboration requirement for the admission of a third party statement against penal interest is significant and <em>goes beyond minimal </em>corroboration.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 71. \u201cTherefore, the statement must be accompanied by corroborating circumstances that <em>clearly indicate </em>the statement\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319. In determining whether a statement is corroborated, \u201call evidence bearing on the trustworthiness of the underlying statement may be considered. ... No one criterion [is] determinative, but the [trial] court [should] consider a wide variety of facts and circumstances in making the ultimate determination of admissibility.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Paredes, </em>775 N.W.2d 554, 567 (Iowa 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Finally, the statement also must be against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. In determining whether a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>satisfies this requirement, this court has rejected a \u201cnarrow and inflexible definition of a statement against penal interest in favor of a definition [that] includes not only confessions . . . but other remarks [that] would tend to incriminate the declarant were he or she the individual charged with the crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 695, 523 A.2d 451 (1987). Thus, \u201c[t]he against interest exception is not limited to a defendant\u2019s direct confession of guilt. ... It applies as well to statements that tend to subject the speaker to criminal liability. . . . [Consequently, the] rule encompasses disserving statements [made] by a declarant that would have probative value in a trial against the declarant. . . . [Our rule therefore] reaches . . . remarks that strengthen the impression that the declarant had an insider\u2019s knowledge of the crimes. ... As to what is against penal interest, quite obviously the essential characteristic is exposure to risk of punishment for a crime. . . . Moreover, it is not the fact that the declaration is against interest but the awareness of that fact by the declarant [that] gives the statement significance.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 695-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Admissibility of the Bryant Evidence as Statements Against Penal Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">After carefully reviewing the Bryant evidence, the trial court concluded that the evidence was admissible as trustworthy declarations against penal interest. Although a statement against penal interest may be admissible even when not all of the trustworthiness factors have been satisfied, in the present case, the trial court expressly found that <em>each and every one of </em>those considerations had been satisfied. Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cIn the present case, full consideration of the totality of the circumstances supports the admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>bility of . . . Bryant\u2019s statements. . . . Bryant\u2019s statements were made under circumstances [that] support admission, are corroborated by sufficient evidence, and are clearly against his penal interest.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Before reviewing the analytical underpinnings of the trial court\u2019s ruling, it first must be noted that the newly discovered Bryant evidence is highly relevant, and, therefore, the evidence would be admissible at a second trial if the petitioner is able to establish that Bryant\u2019s statements fall within an exception to the rule against hearsay. The standards governing the admissibility of third party culpability evidence are well established. \u201c[A] defendant has a right to introduce evidence that indicates that someone other than the defendant committed the crime with which [he] has been charged. . . . The defendant must, however, present evidence that directly connects a third party to the crime. . . . It is not enough to show that another [person] had the motive to commit the crime . . . nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence of third party culpability is governed by the rules relating to relevancy. . . . Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. . . . Accordingly, in explaining the requirement that the proffered evidence establish a direct connection to a third party, rather than raise merely a bare suspicion regarding a third party, we have stated . . . [that] [s]uch evidence is relevant, exculpatory evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>rather than merely tenuous evidence of third party culpability [introduced by a defendant] in an attempt to divert from himself the evidence of guilt. ... In other words, evidence that establishes a direct connection between a third party and the charged offense is relevant to the central question before the jury, namely, <em>whether a reasonable doubt exists as to whether the defendant committed the offense. </em>Evidence that would raise only a bare suspicion that a third party, rather than the defendant, committed the charged offense would not be relevant to the jury\u2019s determination. A trial court\u2019s decision, therefore, that third party culpability evidence proffered by the defendant is admissible . . . necessarily entails a determination that the proffered evidence is relevant to the jury\u2019s determination <em>of whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>284 Conn. 597, 609-10, 935 A.2d 975 (2007). Because the Bryant evidence implicates Hasbrouck and Tinsley as the parties responsible for the victim\u2019s murder, thereby exonerating the petitioner, it is inarguable that the Bryant evidence would be highly relevant at a second trial. Indeed, the evidence bears directly on the central issue of whether the state has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner, and not some other person or persons, murdered the victim. Consequently, the admissibility of the evidence depends solely on whether it consists of trustworthy statements against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">I also note, as a prehminary matter, the standard of review that governs this court\u2019s consideration of the trial court\u2019s determination that the Bryant evidence does satisfy the requirements of the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. \u201cTo the extent [that the] trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. They require determinations about which reasonable minds may not differ; there is no \u2018judgment call\u2019 by the trial court, and the trial court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). When the trial court\u2019s ruling, however, is premised on a correct view of the law, that is, when, as in the present case, the trial court properly has determined \u201cthat a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception\u201d; id., 219; this court affords \u201cthe utmost deference to the trial court\u2019s determination [of admissibility].\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Id. In the present case, therefore, we must \u201cmake every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . and . . . upset it [only] for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>290 Conn. 468, 496, 964 A.2d 73 (2009). Accordingly, \u201cthe question is not whether [the reviewing court], had [it] been sitting as the trial judge, would have exercised [its] discretion differently. Our role as an appellate court is not to substitute our judgment for that of a trial court that has chosen one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>many reasonable alternatives.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 842, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). Thus, the party seeking to overturn a discretionary evidentiary ruling has the \u201cheavy burden\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 226, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); of establishing that the trial court rationally could not have decided as it did. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 667, 969 A.2d 750 (2009) (\u201c[i]n determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 224-25 n.192, 836 A.2d 224 (reviewing court will not find abuse of discretion if trial court \u201crationally could have decided as it did\u201d), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">I now turn to the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to the three part test for evaluating the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest. As for the timing of Bryant\u2019s statements, the court recognized that \u201cthere [were] actually two sets of disclosures relevant to this factor; first, the disclosure from Hasbrouck and Tinsley to Bryant and, second, from Bryant to [Mills, Kennedy and Colucci]. . . . [T]he statements by Hasbrouck and Tinsley were made immediately following the commission of the crime, which fits well within the traditional view of a time frame indicative of trustworthiness.\u201d The trial court also observed, however, that, \u201c[b]eyond the initial disclosure of Hasbrouck and Tinsley to Bryant . . . the timeline of the present case is far from typical.\u201d That is, Bryant\u2019s failure to disclose the information known to him about Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s murder for more than twenty-five years is unusual and, ordinarily, would render his infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>mation highly suspect.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The trial court explained, however, why that delay was understandable in the wholly atypical circumstances of the present case. The court stated: \u201cThe context of the longer time span in the present case is tied into the twenty-five year delay in reopening the investigation of [the victim\u2019s] murder. This unique circumstance, rather then a twenty-five year opportunity for reflection and contrivance, is the central factor that distinguishes it from typical cases [in which] investigation and prosecution of the defendant [do] not even approach the length of time present here. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cBecause of the length of the state\u2019s investigation, [Bryant] had an incentive to keep himself out of a case that he reasonably thought would never be solved. . . . Bryant indicates that even after the petitioner was arrested and brought to trial, he still refused to come forward because he thought there was no way that [the petitioner] would be convicted. . . . [Moreover] [a]t the time of the murder in 1975, [Bryant] was a fourteen year old black male who was suddenly faced with information that, by his own admission, was clearly against his penal interest . . . .\u201d The court further observed that Bryant had not come forward immediately after the murder because, as he had told Colucci, he \u201cwas afraid of being automatically pinned . . . as a suspect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court also underscored the fact that Bryant had told Colucci that it would have been \u201ceasier\u201d for the state to have convicted Bryant than the petitioner and, further, that Bryant\u2019s family had far fewer resources than the petitioner\u2019s family to provide for Bryant\u2019s defense if Bryant had become a suspect. The trial court concluded, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>basis of the foregoing considerations, and in light of the fact that Bryant, who has a law degree, had knowledge that there is no statute of limitations on prosecuting the crime of murder in Connecticut, that \u201chis reluctance to tell his story [was] reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">With respect to the second part of the first prong of the test, that is, the person or persons to whom the declarant made the inculpatory statement and the nature of the declarant\u2019s relationship with that person or persons, the trial court concluded that \u201c[consideration of the individuals to whom . . . Bryant made his statements supports their trustworthiness.\u201d The court found: \u201c[T]he fact that . . . Bryant\u2019s first disclosure regarding the details of his whereabouts on October 30, 1975, was to . . . Mills [a friend whom he trusted] supports the trustworthiness of his statement. Bryant and Mills shared a connection to the facts of this case, dating back to their shared experiences [in] Belle Haven during the time leading up to the murder. Following this disclosure to [Mills], Bryant repeated the events of October 30, 1975, to [Kennedy] and [the petitioner\u2019s] investigator, which further confirmfs] its trustworthiness.\u201d With respect to the petitioner\u2019s investigator, namely, Colucci, the trial court underscored that Colucci \u201cexplicitly informed Bryant that [Bryant] was being sought out in connection with a court proceeding. Bryant was further aware that his statements were being [video-recorded] and that the recording was clearly being made in anticipation of being presented in court. Bryant graduated from the University of Tennessee Law School. Bryant\u2019s knowledge of [Colucci\u2019s] official role provides a greater indication of trustworthiness than the normal individual with whom the declarant does not have a close relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The trial court then considered the second factor, namely, the extent to which Bryant\u2019s statements were corroborated, and found that the existence of corrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>rating circumstances supported the conclusion that those statements were trustworthy. The court identified the following corroborating circumstances in its memorandum of decision: (1) \u201cBryant went to . . . Brunswick School and was classmates with the children in the Belle Haven neighborhood\u201d; (2) \u201c[s]everal witnesses, including . . . Mills and . . . Walker, confirm[ed] that Bryant socialized [in] Belle Haven\u201d; (3) \u201cwitnesses confirmed] that Bryant [previously had] indicated that he [had been] present in Belle Haven on the night of the murder\u201d;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (4) \u201c[o]ne witness recail[ed] seeing . . . Hasbrouck and . . . Tinsley in Belle Haven with Bryant during the fall of 1975\u201d; (5) \u201c[b]oth Hasbrouck and Tinsley admitted to [Kennedy] that they had been in Belle Haven with Bryant on several occasions\u201d; (6) \u201cBryant also provide [d] detailed descriptions of the layout of Belle Haven, including accurate recitations of where people in the neighborhood lived\u201d; (7) \u201c [according to Bryant, Hasbrouck was [six feet, two inches tall], at least 200 pounds on the date of the [murder], and \u2018very strong\u2019 \u201d; (8) \u201cBryant stated that . . . Hasbrouck was obsessed with [the victim], and \u2018wanted to go caveman on her,\u2019 meaning that he would club her, drag her away by the hair and sexually assault her\u201d; (9) \u201c[o]n the night of the murder, Bryant stated that he, Hasbrouck and Tinsley walked around Belle Haven with golf clubs from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the [Skakels\u2019] residence, with Hasbrouck stating that he had his \u2018caveman club\u2019 and that he would not leave Belle Haven unsatisfied\u201d; (10) \u201c[t]he victim had suffered multiple and severe injuries to her head and stab wounds to her neck, which were consistent with being caused by a piece of golf club shaft\u201d; (11) \u201c[p]ieces of the golf club found near the victim\u2019s body were the same brand of golf club found at the [Skakels\u2019] residence\u201d; and (12) \u201c[e]vidence presented at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial show[ed] that these clubs were commonly left about the [Skakels\u2019] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The trial court further stated: \u201cCorroboration of Bryant\u2019s statements [also] can be found in the very reason that he is unavailable to testify. In the present case, Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley have all invoked their [privilege against self-incrimination] after being served with subpoenas to testify at a deposition.\u201d In concluding that Bryant\u2019s, Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s invocation of their privilege against self-incrimination supports the reliability of Bryant\u2019s incriminating statements, the trial court necessarily also concluded that the three men had asserted their privilege because to do otherwise would expose them to possible criminal prosecution on the basis of the truth of Bryant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>With respect to the third and final factor, the trial court found that Bryant\u2019s statements were <em>\u201cclearly </em>against his penal interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although not a confession to the victim\u2019s murder, Bryant\u2019s statements place him at or near the scene of the murder, with Hasbrouck and Tinsley, immediately before the victim was murdered. Bryant also acknowledged possessing a golf club, the instrumentality used to kill the victim, that he had obtained from the Skakels\u2019 property. The information that Bryant provided demonstrates an insider\u2019s knowledge of the crime and would constitute highly incriminating evidence of guilt if Bryant were to be the target of a prosecution for an offense or offenses relating to the death of the victim. Indeed, Bryant\u2019s mother had urged him not to come forward \u201cbecause he would be implicated [in the murder by] putting himself at the scene of the crime.\u201d Furthermore, when he finally did come forward, Bryant, a law school graduate, was acutely aware of the incriminating nature of his information. The trial court also observed that Bryant\u2019s \u201c[e]fforts to explain away possible physical evidence indicate a consciousness of guilt. [Bryant\u2019s statements concerning his presence in Belle Haven on the day of the murder and his possession of a golf club at that time represent an attempt] to explain away the possibility that his fingerprints might be found on the murder weapon or another golf club nearby.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Finally, although Bryant eventually disclosed the information that he had been so wary of revealing, he subsequently invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, further demonstrating his understanding of the incriminating nature of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">I fully agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Bryant evidence, although hearsay, would be admissible at a second trial under the exception to the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>rule for trustworthy declarations against penal interest. Indeed, because, as the trial court found, the Bryant evidence satisfies each of the three factors to be considered in determining the admissibility of such declarations, including the requirement that the reliability of the statements must be clearly demonstrated by corroborating circumstances, a contrary conclusion would deny the petitioner \u201ca trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 410 U.S. 302. For the reasons set forth in part III G of this opinion, the trial court, having properly recognized the trustworthiness of Bryant\u2019s statements, improperly failed to consider that evidence in the context of the original trial evidence. Before turning to that issue, however, it is necessary, first, to identify certain additional facts in the record that support the trial court\u2019s trustworthiness determination; see part III D of this opinion; second, to address the view expressed by the concurrence that the trial court improperly concluded that the Bryant evidence would be admissible at a new trial as trustworthy statements against penal interest; see part III E of this opinion; and, third, to explain why the Bryant evidence would be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule <em>even </em>if that evidence did not satisfy the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. See part III F of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Additional Facts and Circumstances That Render the Bryant Evidence Trustworthy</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The trial court reasonably could have relied on certain other evidence adduced at the hearing on the petition for a new trial because that evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that Bryant\u2019s statements are admissible as trustworthy third party declarations against penal interest. This same evidence, moreover, also supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the conclusion that those statements meet the <em>Shabazz </em>credibility threshold as a matter of law. In particular, the Bryant evidence is corroborated to varying degrees by the statements and testimony of numerous witnesses, the state has proffered no plausible explanation why Bryant, about whom there is nothing adverse in the record, would falsely implicate two innocent people in a high profile murder and, at the same time, place himself, his reputation and his family\u2019s reputation at severe risk, and there is physical evidence that corroborates Bryant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Perhaps the most significant additional corroboration comes from Hasbrouck and Tinsley themselves, both of whom, before invoking their privilege against self-incrimination, spoke on several occasions to Kennedy and others and acknowledged that they were in Belle Haven on the day of the murder and that they previously had visited Byrne\u2019s house on a number of occasions. That corroborative evidence came to light in the following manner. After his initial conversations with Bryant, Kennedy attempted to verily some of the information that Bryant had provided to him. He first located and called Hasbrouck at his residence in Bridgeport. When Hasbrouck answered, Kennedy identified himself and his relationship to the petitioner. Kennedy asked Hasbrouck whether he knew \u201cTony Bryant.\u201d Hasbrouck confirmed that he did and volunteered that he and Bryant used to \u201crun around\u201d with Byrne and Walker in Greenwich. Kennedy then asked Hasbrouck whether he was in Greenwich on the night of the murder. Hasbrouck responded that, \u201cunfortunately,\u201d he was not there. He also claimed that he only recently had learned about the murder. Hasbrouck told Kennedy that Tinsley was living in Oregon and that, although he spoke with Tinsley occasionally, he had not been in touch with Byrne, Walker or Bryant since the 1970s. Before hanging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>up, Hasbrouck asked Kennedy for Bryant\u2019s telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Kennedy was able to locate Tinsley in Oregon, and, a few days after speaking to Hasbrouck, Kennedy telephoned Tinsley. Tinsley told Kennedy that Hasbrouck had mentioned that Kennedy might call him. In response to the same general questions that Kennedy asked Hasbrouck, Tinsley explained that he had met Bryant at Hughes High School and that he and Hasbrouck had gone with Bryant to Greenwich on several occasions. According to Tinsley, going to Greenwich \u201cwas sort of fun . . . new people to meet . . . rich community.\u201d Tinsley went to Greenwich about \u201ca half dozen times\u201d and remembered the Walker family \u201creal well.\u201d When asked whether he knew Byrne, Tinsley responded that he had gone to his house \u201cprobably . . . three times.\u201d Kennedy asked him whether he had gone to Greenwich on the night before Halloween. Tinsley responded, \u201cHalloween, it seems to me we were going up there. I have a hard time remembering . . . .\u201d Kennedy then asked him whether he knew that Byrne had committed suicide a few years after the murder. Tinsley responded that he was not aware of that fact and that, \u201cafter the murder ... we never went up there . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Unlike Hasbrouck, however, who initially claimed not to have learned about the minder until around the time of the petitioner\u2019s arrest, Tinsley told Kennedy that he had read about the murder in the New York Times after it happened and that he had discussed it with his brother. Tinsley further stated that he thought that they had gone to a party in Greenwich sometime during the week leading up to Halloween. He then recalled, without prompting, that Byrne\u2019s \u201chouse was really huge. They had two different kitchens, and it was an old, historical house. There was a servant\u2019s kitchen, if I\u2019m not mistaken .... It was just huge .... [The] refrigerator had no handle .... [Y]ou push[ed] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>button and electronically the door popped open . . . .\u201d According to Tinsley, Byrne had made fun of him because he did not know how to open it at first. He also recalled that Byrne had lots of \u201ctoys and stuff . . . to mess around with\u201d and that they once sprayed so much shaving cream inside the house that it \u201clooked like hell . . . .\u201d Tinsley told Kennedy that he, Hasbrouck and Bryant had attended a dance in Greenwich during that period. As I previously indicated, in his interview with Colucci, Bryant also recalled attending a dance in Greenwich with Hasbrouck and Tinsley, noting that Hasbrouck had been fixated on the victim for the entire evening. The victim herself wrote about a dance in her diary, stating that two strangers had approached her as soon as she walked in. She also recalled seeing Walker, Bryant\u2019s good friend, and many other people from the neighborhood that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Finally, Tinsley volunteered to Kennedy that, sometime around the time of the murder, Bryant\u2019s girlfriend, who lived in Greenwich, ran away with another friend to Philadelphia, and that he, Hasbrouck and Bryant met up with them while they were in New York and tried to convince them to go home. According to Tinsley, someone had called him on the telephone at his apartment looking for the girls. Tinsley claimed that, after Bryant spoke to the caller on the telephone, the girls went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Kennedy asked Tinsley whether he ever had seen the Skakels\u2019 house or eaten there. Tinsley responded: \u201c[T]he only time that I ever heard or thought of [the petitioner], and I never met any of them, [was when] [Bryant] pointed these guys out [and] [Byrne] . . . said that . . . one of them was nuts, and I said, what do you mean nuts? He said, you know, it was [the petitioner], and he said [he was in a] pretty serious fight at . . . Brunswick School [and was expelled].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Kennedy turned over all of the information that he had gathered to Colucci. On September 2, 2003, Colucci and his associate, Steele, made an unannounced visit to Hasbrouck at his home in Bridgeport. Colucci testified that the purpose of the visit was to get a sense of Hasbrouck as a person, to see how he reacted to Bryant\u2019s accusations and to inquire whether he would agree to a video-recorded interview as Bryant had. According to Colucci, Hasbrouck started talking immediately and, over the course of approximately seventy minutes, changed his story three times with respect to his whereabouts on the day of the murder. First, he told Colucci and Steele that he was in Belle Haven on the morning of the murder but left around noontime because \u201cnothing much was going on . . . .\u201d Next, he stated that he, Tinsley and Bryant arrived in the morning but went home between 6 and 6:30 p.m., \u201cbefore it got dark.\u201d Finally, at the conclusion of the interview, he stated that the group got there in the morning and left around 9 or 9:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">After speaking to Hasbrouck, Colucci contacted Tinsley by telephone in Oregon. During the conversation, Tinsley stated that he was in Belle Haven on the day of the murder but did not remember anything more than that. Not long thereafter, however, both Hasbrouck and Tinsley notified Colucci that, after consulting their calendars, they had realized that they were not in Belle Haven that day. Colucci testified that Hasbrouck admitted that he had spoken to Tinsley and that they had consulted each other for the purpose of reconciling their stories. Both Hasbrouck and Tinsley, like Bryant, subsequently invoked their privilege against self-incrimination when subpoenaed to testify at a deposition noticed by the petitioner.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Other witnesses also corroborated various aspects of Bryant\u2019s statements, including Bryant\u2019s close ties to Belle Haven and Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s presence in Belle Haven at or around the time of the murder. For example, Walker, who lived across the street from Byrne and attended Brunswick School with Bryant, testified that Bryant visited his home \u201con many occasions\u201d and that, after Bryant had moved to Manhattan, he had brought Hasbrouck and Tinsley with him to Greenwich \u201ca few times . . . .\u201d Walker also recalled that, on one occasion, Byrne\u2019s mother called his house to complain that either Hasbrouck or Tinsley, he could not remember which one, was sitting on the wall outside her house, \u201cpurportedly waiting for [Byrne] to come home .... And she was uncomfortable with him being there, and asked [Walker] if [he] could find a way to tell him to stop doing that.\u201d Walker stated that, by the time he got outside, whoever it was had left, \u201cso [he] called [Bryant] and asked him if he could tell [Hasbrouck] or [Tinsley] to stop hanging around at [Byrne\u2019s] house.\u201d He did not recall, however, whether Hasbrouck, Tinsley or Bryant had come by his house on the night of the murder, which was a school night for him, and he did not remember Hasbrouck ever saying anything about the victim in his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Marjorie Walker Hauer, Neal Walker\u2019s sister and the victim\u2019s best friend, testified, that although she remembered Bryant well, she did not recall whether she ever had met Tinsley or Hasbrouck. She did recall, however, the same incident that Tinsley had related to Kennedy involving the Greenwich girls who ran away and ended up in New York City. Hauer wrote about the incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>in her diary on October 26, 1975, four days before the murder, and the diary entry was read into the record at the hearing on the petition for a new trial. Hauer wrote: \u201cI called . . . Bryant, my brother\u2019s friend, and [the] boyfriend [of one of the girls] and he said he saw them, and that they were [in New York City]. ... I told him to try to convince the . . . other three to come home. Two of them are ninth graders, and one [is] in eighth grade . . . .\u201d Although Hauer\u2019s diary entry bears no direct relation to Bryant\u2019s assertions that Hasbrouck and Tinsley, and not the petitioner, were responsible for the victim\u2019s murder, it nevertheless confirms Tinsley\u2019s ties to people in Belle Haven just days before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">There also is considerable corroboration of Bryant\u2019s statements regarding Byrne\u2019s house and how, because of its size, Hasbrouck and Tinsley easily could have been there and not been seen by any adults.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Hauer, who grew up across the street, described the house as a \u201chuge Tudor style stone\u201d mansion with \u201clot[s] of rooms.\u201d Hauer testified that her brother, Walker, spent a lot of time at Byrne\u2019s house because it was \u201ca little freer there,\u201d \u201c[t]here wasn\u2019t as much supervision\u201d and \u201c[Byrne] had a lot of fun toys to play with, like go carts and things like that.\u201d She also recalled a secret tunnel that ran beneath the house that was accessible through an outside door. Garr, one of the state\u2019s investigators, testified that the house was \u201cenormous\u201d and that if you were in one area of the house, it would be possible to be unaware that another person was in a different area. According to Byrne\u2019s older brother, the house had twenty-eight rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Wholly apart from the foregoing corroborating evidence, however, Bryant\u2019s testimony is credible because of the complete absence of <em>any </em>apparent motive for him to lie. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 634-35 (declarant\u2019s lack of motive to he is corroborating circumstance that indicates reliability of third party statement against penal interest). Indeed, the state has adduced no evidence suggesting that Bryant had anything to gain by coming forward with false information exonerating the petitioner and implicating Hasbrouck and Tinsley in the victim\u2019s murder. Moreover, every single witness who knew about Bryant\u2019s allegations before Bryant agreed to his video-recorded interview with Colucci testified that Biyant was extremely reluctant to come forward and did so only after the petitioner had been convicted \u2014 wrongly, on the basis of the evidence known to Bryant \u2014 and only after Bryant\u2019s identity already had been disclosed publicly. The undisputed evidence clearly demonstrates, therefore, that Bryant never sought any publicity or recognition on account of what he knew about Hasbrouck and Tinsley; rather, he repeatedly failed or refused to return telephone calls or otherwise cooperate with those who, on behalf of the petitioner, sought to interview him about his information.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Furthermore, and significantly, there is nothing in the record concerning Bryant\u2019s background or character that would cast genuine doubt on his credibility or trustworthiness as a witness. In particular, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>is devoid of evidence establishing that Bryant has a reputation for untruthfulness<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> or that he otherwise has demonstrated that he has a tendency to be dishonest. It therefore is especially hard to believe that he would concoct a story falsely accusing two former classmates of a murder with which they had nothing to do. In fact, Mills, who has known Bryant since they attended the sixth grade together, testified that Bryant is \u201ca very friendly, easy going, kind person,\u201d and that he could not recall a single instance of Bryant \u201cever saying a mean word about anybody.\u201d Moreover, there is no indication that Bryant suffers from any mental illness or instability that might call into question his judgment or ability to appreciate fully the significance of the information that he has provided. Simply put, there is no reason to think that Bryant is the kind of person who would do what the trial court necessarily believes that he has done \u2014 that is, falsely implicate two people in a murder \u2014 in rejecting his statements as incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On the contrary, the state has failed to adduce any probative evidence demonstrating that Bryant is any more likely to provide false testimony than any other citizen with knowledge about a crime. Bryant comes from a prominent family, graduated from a private preparatory school in Texas, obtained his college degree from the University of Houston,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and attained his law degree from the University of Tennessee. He is married with four children and apparently owned his own business at the time of his video-recorded interview with Colucci. In that interview, Bryant is highly articulate and appears extremely rational, thoughtful and forth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>coming. I can think of no plausible explanation \u2014 and neither the state nor the majority has proffered one\u2014 why someone in Bryant\u2019s position would accuse two childhood friends of a heinous crime if he knew that they did not commit it.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Nevertheless, there are several powerful reasons why someone in Bryant\u2019s shoes might elect to keep his information to himself. First and foremost is the potential criminal exposure that he might face by coming forward; as the trial court expressly found, \u201cone of the reasons [that] Bryant\u2019s testimony is trustworthy is because Bryant places himself in Belle Haven, on the night of the murder, in the company of [the victim], discussing assaulting [her] with Hasbrouck and Tinsley and in possession of golf clubs belonging to the Skakel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>family.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Second, few people would wish to become embroiled in so public a controversy, especially when the alleged peipetrator already has been convicted. Third, because Bryant refused for more than twenty-five years after the murder to come forward with his incriminating information about Hasbrouck and Tinsley, which, if credited, would result in the petitioner\u2019s exoneration, he risked both the scorn of his family and friends, and the disapprobation of the investigating and prosecuting authorities as well as the general public. Finally, it is highly doubtful that Bryant would falsely implicate two boyhood friends in a crime that occurred nearly thiriy-five years ago by providing information that many, including the state, would seek to discredit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In my view, only a sociopath, an inveterate liar or a calculating perjurer with something significant to gain would provide information, like the information at issue in the present case, exonerating the guilty and incriminating the innocent.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> There is absolutely no indication that Bryant is such a person. Although it is true, of course, that the state was unable to cross-examine Bryant because he invoked his privilege against self-incrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ination at his deposition, the state was free to provide the trial court with information or evidence demonstrating that Bryant is not a person who can be trusted to tell the truth. Because the state did not do so, one cannot attribute a motive or reason for Bryant to lie without engaging in the rankest kind of speculation and guesswork. Indeed, the majority itself purports to \u201cdecline to speculate as to why Bryant invoked his . . . right not to testify,\u201d presumably because the evidence provides nary a hint of any such reason other than the self-incriminatory nature of his statements.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In the absence of even the slightest suggestion of a motivation for Bryant to he, the trial court and the majority reject the only plausible reason for Bryant to come forward, a reason that <em>is </em>supported by the evidence, namely, a desire to convey the truth, albeit belatedly, to avoid further injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Thus, even though what we know about Bryant and his background indicates that he is <em>not </em>a person who would provide knowingly false testimony, and despite the fact that the record is completely devoid of any evidence of a motive to do so, the trial court and the majority have determined that Bryant is so lacking in credibility that there is no reason to consider his video-recorded interview, together with the other corroborative evidence, in relation to the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. This determination, which is based almost exclusively on the fact that no witness recalls seeing Bryant, Hasbrouck or Tinsley on the evening of the murder \u2014 a fact that, as I explain more fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>in part III G of this opinion, may be explained by a variety of considerations \u2014 is simply untenable in view of the various factors that militate strongly in favor of a contrary conclusion. Indeed, as this court recently has stated, \u201cin circumstances that largely involve a credibility contest, [as the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial did], the testimony of neutral, disinterested witnesses is exceedingly important.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>290 Conn. 502, 518, 964 A.2d 1186, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bryant, 558 </em>U.S. 938, 130 S. Ct. 259, 175 L. Ed. 2d 242 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Furthermore, although there was no physical evidence of any kind connecting the petitioner to the murder, there is physical evidence corroborating Bryant\u2019s version of the facts. As I explain in greater detail in part IV B of this opinion, the victim was ambushed on her way home from the Skakels\u2019 house, clubbed over the head with at least one golf club and dragged or carried approximately 100 feet, where she was discovered partially naked under a tree. The likely sexual nature of the crime is reflected in the fact that the victim\u2019s pants and underwear were pulled down below her knees. Moreover, evidence also led investigators to believe that the perpetrator was disoriented or unfamiliar with the area. The number and direction of the victim\u2019s injuries appear to be fully consistent with having been inflicted by more than one golf club, and the fact that the victim was dragged or carried approximately 100 feet also suggests that the attack may have been carried out by more than one assailant.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tion, because the petitioner\u2019s trial strategy was predicated almost exclusively on his alibi, the defense did not challenge any part of the state\u2019s theory as to how the crime was committed or whether someone of the petitioner\u2019s size would have been capable of committing such a brutal crime without the assistance of an accomplice.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In any event, for the reasons set forth more fully in part IV B of this opinion, I believe that the crime scene lends support to the credibility of Bryant\u2019s statements about the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Finally, the trial court reasonably could have relied on other important physical evidence that corroborates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the information that Bryant had supplied. That evidence consists of two human hairs recovered from the sheets that were used to wrap the victim\u2019s body, one of which was identified by the forensic crime laboratory (lab) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as \u201cpossessing Negroid characteristics . . . .\u201d Technicians conducting microscopic analysis of certain hair samples concluded that the hair was dissimilar to the only two African-American males known to be in the area at the time, a Greenwich police officer and the son of the Skakel family\u2019s cook. Subsequent testing on the second hair revealed that it possessed Asian characteristics. Significantly, Hasbrouck and Bryant are of African-American descent, and Tinsley, according to Bryant, is of mixed race origin, possibly of Asian descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The Concurrence</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The concurrence contends that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the Bryant evidence would be admissible at a second trial under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest because, according to the concurrence, the trial court reasonably could not have concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements are, in fact, against his penal interest. For the reasons that follow, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The conclusion of the concurrence that Bryant\u2019s statements are not against his penal interest is predicated on three separate but related claims. First, the concurrence breaks down the Bryant evidence into discrete statements, analyzes each such statement separately, and then concludes that, when so viewed, none of the various statements is sufficiently disserving so as to expose Bryant to criminal liability. The concurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>next suggests that, in this state, the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest applies only to those statements that directly implicate the declarant in a crime, and, because, in the view of the concurrence, Bryant\u2019s statements do not satisfy that requirement, they do not fall within that hearsay exception. Finally, the concurrence maintains that, even if the trial court reasonably concluded that some of Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently against his penal interest, those particular statements do not implicate Hasbrouck and Tinsley and, therefore, do not advance the petitioner\u2019s third party culpability defense. The concurrence further contends, along these same lines, that, because the statements that Bryant attributes to Hasbrouck and Tinsley are self-serving, that is, they tend to exonerate Bryant, those statements are not admissible at all. Although the concurrence concedes that a declarant\u2019s self-serving statements may be admitted when those statements are inextricably linked with the declarant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements, it asserts that that is not the case here. None of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The concurrence\u2019s analysis of the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the admissibility of the Bryant evidence begins with an examination of each disserving statement in isolation, divorced from the rest of Bryant\u2019s narrative. Upon viewing Bryant\u2019s remarks in this manner, the concurrence asserts, first, that \u201cBryant\u2019s statement that he was in Belle Haven on the night of the murder is not against his penal interest . . . because (1) his presence, alone, does not so far tend to subject him to criminal liability for the victim\u2019s murder, especially in light of the fact that Bryant states, and the record reflects, that <em>many </em>people were in Belle Haven that night, and (2) Bryant specifically states that he took a train back to Manhattan . . . from . . . Greenwich . . . before the victim was murdered.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The concurrence also contends that Bry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ant\u2019s acknowledgment that he possessed one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs on the night of the murder is not incriminating because Bryant never stated that he held the <em>specific </em>club that was used in the murder, and because he later claimed, in the same interview, \u201cnot even to know how the victim was murdered.\u201d The concurrence reasons, therefore, that, \u201cat the time of his statement [to Colucci], Bryant would not have known that handling one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs could be against his penal interest.\u201d The concurrence further contends that, even if Bryant knew how the victim had been killed, his statements concerning the golf clubs are not against his penal interest because he also stated that \u201c[everybody in Belle Haven touched those clubs,\u201d thus implicating himself in the murder to no greater degree than anyone else in Belle Haven. Lastly, the concurrence asserts that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s determination that Bryant discussed assaulting the victim with Hasbrouck and Tinsley because that determination suggests that Bryant made disserving statements during those discussions when, in fact, only Hasbrouck and Tinsley expressed an intent to abduct and to assault the victim sexually.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In isolating each of Bryant\u2019s statements in this manner and considering them out of the context in which they actually were spoken, the concurrence employs an analytical model that is incompatible with this court\u2019s mandate that the determination of whether a statement is sufficiently disserving to be considered against penal interest shall be made by examining the entire statement in context. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 696-97. In contrast to the trial court\u2019s analysis, the approach that the concurrence uses represents precisely the kind of narrow and inflexible approach that this court expressly has rejected for purposes of determining whether a statement is against penal interest. See id., 695. In fact, because all language is contex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tual, it is impossible to discern the fundamental import of virtually <em>any </em>statement by viewing it in a linguistic or factual vacuum. This is what the concurrence has done, however, in parsing Bryant\u2019s remarks and reviewing them separately from one another and from the totality of the surrounding circumstances. This approach leads the concurrence to the wrong result, for as the United States Supreme Court has explained in construing rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>\u201cwhether a statement is self-inculpatory or not can ... be determined [only] by viewing it in context. </em>Even statements that are on their face neutral may actually be against the declarant\u2019s interest. \u2018I hid the gun in Joe\u2019s apartment\u2019 may not be a confession of a crime; but if it is likely to help the police find the murder weapon, then it is certainly self-inculpatory. \u2018Sam and I went to Joe\u2019s house\u2019 might be against the declarant\u2019s interest if a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s shoes would realize that being linked to Joe and Sam would implicate the declarant in Joe and Sam\u2019s conspiracy. And other statements that give the police significant details about the crime may also, depending on the situation, be against the declarant\u2019s interest. The question ... is always whether the statement was sufficiently against the declarant\u2019s penal interest \u2018that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true,\u2019 and <em>this question can ... be answered [only] in light of all the surrounding circumstances. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 603-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">An examination of the entirety of Bryant\u2019s statements reveals that Bryant places himself at the scene of the crime, in the company of the victim, shortly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the murder, holding the possible murder weapon,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>discussing an attack on the victim with the two persons \u2014 both of whom Bryant had introduced and brought to Belle Haven \u2014 who, shortly after the victim\u2019s murder, boasted about having committed the crime.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> As this court previously has stated, the exception for declarations against penal interest \u201cencompasses dis-serving statements [made] by a declarant that would have probative value in a trial against the declarant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 695. Thus, contrary to the assertion of the concurrence, in this state, the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest includes \u201cnot only confessions\u201d or direct admissions of guilt, \u201cbut [also] other remarks [that] would tend to incriminate the declarant [if] he or she [was] the individual charged with the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Id. Bryant\u2019s statements most certainly meet that standard, for if he were being tried for the victim\u2019s murder, the statements would be highly relevant and, indeed, highly prejudicial to his case. Far from representing an irrational or arbitrary exercise of discretion, as the concurrence claims, the trial court\u2019s determination that the Bryant evidence consisted of trustworthy declarations against penal interest represents a perfectly reasonable application of that hearsay exception to the factual scenario presented by this case.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Certainly, a reasonable person in Bryant\u2019s position would not have made the statements that he did without believing them to be true. Indeed, by acknowledging his close involvement with Hasbrouck and Tinsley on the day and evening of the murder and for some time thereafter, Bryant knew that he was likely to become a suspect in that murder, the prosecution of which, as Bryant also knew, was not subject to any limitation period. As this court has observed, a statement has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>significance as one against penal interest only to the extent that the declarant is aware that the statement is self-inculpatory. Id., 696 (\u201cit is not the fact that the declaration is against penal interest but the awareness of that fact by the declarant which gives the statement significance\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Applying that principle to the present case, I conclude that both Bryant and his mother made it perfectly clear that Bryant\u2019s refusal to come forward for more than two decades prior to the petitioner\u2019s arrest, and his extreme reluctance to do so even after the petitioner\u2019s arrest, stemmed from an overriding concern that to do so would result in Bryant\u2019s becoming a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Finally, the concurrence contends that, to the extent that any of Bryant\u2019s statements may be deemed to be self-inculpatory,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> only those statements, and not Bryant\u2019s entire narrative \u2014 including the portion of that narrative that inculpates Hasbrouck and Tinsley \u2014 are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>admissible under the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest. Although the concurrence concedes that Bryant\u2019s statements implicating Hasbrouck and Tinsley would be admissible if they are inextricably linked to Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements, the concurrence asserts that those two sets of statements are not so intertwined. The concurrence\u2019s contention is belied by this court\u2019s well established case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 676, this court concluded that, when \u201cthe disserving parts of a statement are intertwined with self-serving parts, it is more prudential to admit the entire statement and let the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context.\u201d Id., 696-97. We also explained, however, that \u201c[t]he problem of statements that are both disserving and self-serving to a declarant has divided commentators and some courts.\u201d Id., 696 n.18. After acknowledging that \u201c[o]ne view . . . would admit the entire statement,\u201d whereas a second, \u201csomewhat different view suggests admitting only the disserving portion of the declaration and excluding the self-serving part [when] the two parts can be severed\u201d; id., 696-97 n.18; we expressed our agreement with the first view, pursuant to which the <em>entire statement </em>is admitted. Id. The fact that this has been the law of this state at least since our decision in <em>Bryant </em>is reflected in the relevant commentary to the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides: \u201cWhen a narrative contains both dis-serving statements and collateral, self serving or neutral statements, the Connecticut rule admits the entire narrative, letting the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4), commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tary. Other courts have adopted the same approach. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>966 P.2d 563, 578-79 (Colo. 1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sonthikoummane, </em>145 N.H. 316, 321-22, 769 A.2d 330 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Notwithstanding the clarity of our law, the concurrence asserts that only Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements, and not his purportedly self-serving statements implicating Hasbrouck and Tinsley in the victim\u2019s murder, are admissible. As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, this assertion fails in light of <em>Bryant </em>and the commentary to the Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>concurrence were correct, however, that the portions of Bryant\u2019s narrative that inculpate Hasbrouck and Tinsley are admissible only to the extent that they cannot be severed from Bryant\u2019s disserving statements, Bryant\u2019s narrative satisfies that standard. The concurrence contends that, if any of Bryant\u2019s statements may be viewed as inculpatory, it is only those statements indicating that, on the night of the murder, (1) Bryant was in Belle Haven, (2) Bryant \u201cpicked up one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, \u2018swung it,\u2019 and \u2018[slung] it back to where the bag . . . was,\u2019 \u201d and (3) that, \u201cat one point, Bryant and the victim were among the ten to fifteen teenagers socializing in the meadow [behind the Skakels\u2019 residence].\u201d The concurrence further maintains that only these statements properly could have been deemed to be admissible by the trial court, and not Bryant\u2019s self-serving statements implicating Hasbrouck and Tinsley in the victim\u2019s murder. Bryant\u2019s disserving statements, though severable from a linguistic standpoint, are so intertwined with Bryant\u2019s statements about Hasbrouck and Tinsley that the self-inculpatory nature of the former cannot be appreciated unless those statements are considered in the context of the latter. In other words, severing the two sets of statements would make it impossible for a fact finder to understand why Bryant\u2019s self-inculpatory statements are, in fact, self-inculpatory. Thus, as we expressly observed in <em>Bryant, </em>\u201c[t]here are cases ... [in which] allowing such latitude to contextual statements may give real meaning to the declaration that is disserving.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 697. The present case is clearly one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>For all the foregoing reasons, neither the state nor the concurrence can demonstrate that the trial court abused its broad discretion in concluding that the Bryant evidence would be admissible at a new trial under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. Indeed, far from representing an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s determination was the product of a reasoned analysis predicated on a perfectly proper application of settled principles to the facts presented. Indeed, because the Bryant evidence bears persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and is critical to the petitioner\u2019s defense, excluding the evidence would implicate the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. See, e.g., <em>Chambers </em>v. Mississippi, supra, 410 U.S. 302; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>64 App. Div. 3d 1078, 1084, 883 N.Y.S.2d 385 (2009) (\u201c[Supported by the relevant [nonhearsay] evidence, the hearsay testimony proffered by [the] defendant bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and was critical to his defense .... In these circumstances, [in which] constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice .... Indeed . . . [when] a statement is exculpatory as to [a] defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>dant, a less exacting standard [than that applicable to an inculpatory statement proffered by the government] applies in determining whether statements against penal interest are admissible, and [when] the statement forms a critical part of the defense, due process concerns may tip the scales in favor of admission . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). As I previously noted, however, even if it could be established that the trial court had abused its discretion in concluding that the Bryant statements would be admissible as trustworthy declarations against penal interest, for the reasons that follow, the court reasonably could have concluded that those statements would be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. I therefore turn to that hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Admissibility of Bryant\u2019s Statements Under the Residual Hearsay Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">At trial, the petitioner also claimed that the Bryant evidence would be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. In light of its conclusion that the evidence would have been admissible as trustworthy declarations against penal interest, however, the trial court not did reach the petitioner\u2019s alternative claim of admissibility. The trial court, however, would have been well within its discretion to conclude that the Bryant evidence would be admissible under the residual exception.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The following principles guide my analysis. \u201cA statement that is not admissible under any of the [hearsay] exceptions [enumerated in the Connecticut Code of Evidence] is admissible if the court determines that (1) there is a reasonable necessity for the admission of the statement, and (2) the statement is supported by equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness and reliability that are essential to other evidence admitted under traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 633 n.22, 835 A.2d 895 (2003), quoting Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9. \u201cReasonable necessity may be established by showing that unless the hearsay statement is admitted, the facts it contains may be lost, either because the declarant is dead or otherwise unavailable, or because the assertion is of such a nature that evidence of the same value cannot be obtained from the same or other sources.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>supra, 633 n.21. \u201c[T]he second prong, reliability, is met in a variety of situations .... At minimum, the statement must independently bear adequate indicia of reliability to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating [its] truth . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 810, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). \u201cWe previously have identified several factors that bear [on] the trustworthiness and reliability of an out-of-court statement, including: (1) whether the circumstances are such that a sincere and accurate statement would naturally be uttered, and no plan of falsification [could] be formed ... (2) the closeness of the relationship between the declarant and recipient ... (3) whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the statement was made spontaneously and in confidence or obtained in response to government questioning conducted in anticipation of litigation ... (4) the temporal proximity between the alleged statement and the events to which the statement refers . . . and (5) whether the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 728-29, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006). In addition, a review of cases from this court and the Appellate Court reveals other factors that have been deemed relevant to this analysis. These include whether the declarant had a reason to lie; see id., 729; whether the statement is corroborated or contradicted by other evidence; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>248 Conn. 572, 584, 730 A.2d 1107 (1999); whether the statement was made under oath; <em>State </em>v. <em>Faison, </em>112 Conn. App. 373, 384, 962 A.2d 860, cert. denied, 291 Conn. 903, 967 A.2d 507 (2009); whether the declarant\u2019s perception was impaired at the time he made the statement; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>39 Conn. App. 579, 604-605, 665 A.2d 1357 (1995), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 239 Conn. 235, 684 A.2d 1165 (1996); and whether the declarant has recanted or consistently reaffirmed the statement. See <em>Morant </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Conn. App. 137, 171, 173, 802 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 914, 796 A.2d 558 (2002). In addition, other courts have concluded that the fact that an unavailable declarant\u2019s statement was video recorded militates in favor of admissibility because the jury can assess the declarant\u2019s demeanor at the time the declarant made the statement. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez-Lima, </em>161 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir. 1998). Finally, the trial court\u2019s fact-finding and analysis for purposes of determining the trustworthiness of a statement under the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest is equally applicable to the same determination under the residual hearsay exception. See <em>Morant </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 172-73 (relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>on same trustworthiness factors in reviewing trial court\u2019s rulings under hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest and residual hearsay exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The first prong of the analysis, necessity, is readily satisfied in the present case. Because Bryant has invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, he is not available to testify for the petitioner. Furthermore, the information that Bryant provided is not available from any other source. Finally, Bryant\u2019s statements, if believed, exonerate the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, has demonstrated the necessity of admitting Bryant\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The Bryant evidence also satisfies the second requirement for admissibility under the residual hearsay exception, namely, that it is supported by indicia of trustworthiness and reliability that are equivalent to those required for admissibility under other hearsay exceptions. Because those circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that substantiate the truthfulness of Bryant\u2019s statements are set forth in detail in part III C and D of this opinion, I need not repeat them here. It bears emphasis, however, that, in addition to the fact that Bryant\u2019s statements are strongly corroborated, no plausible explanation ever has been advanced as to why Bryant would falsely implicate Hasbrouck and Tinsley in the victim\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>observes that Bryant \u201chad nothing personally to gain by coming forward,\u201d and the record indicates that, although Bryant was reluctant to come forward, he did so solely because he was convinced, on the basis of what he knew, that the petitioner\u2019s conviction constituted a grave injustice. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record that casts doubt on Bryant\u2019s credibility. The record does reflect, however, that Bryant is a law school graduate from a prominent family who, at the time of his interview with Colucci, owned his own business and was married with four children.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In addition, because Bryant\u2019s lengthy statement to Colucci was video recorded, the fact finder at a new trial will be able to evaluate Bryant\u2019s demeanor, temperament and affect as he gave the statement. It also is highly significant that physical evidence found at the scene of the crime, in particular, the two hairs found on the victim\u2019s body, support Bryant\u2019s version of the events. Finally, Biyant first confided in Mills, an old and trusted friend, and, as the trial court found, Bryant\u2019s failure to come forward sooner is readily explainable by his reasonable fear that doing so would have resulted in his being a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder. For all the foregoing reasons, the trial court properly could have found that the Bryant evidence would be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule because in no event would such a ruling have constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>It is apparent, therefore, that the trial court properly concluded that the Bryant evidence would be admissible at a new trial. For the reasons that follow, the trial court was required to consider that evidence in the context of the original trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Biyant Evidence and the <em>Shabazz </em>Minimum Credibility Threshold</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Notwithstanding its finding that the Bryant evidence was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible at a new trial, the trial court further concluded that the evidence was not sufficiently believable for purposes of the test adopted by this court in <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 811, to warrant a second trial. Although purporting to apply the test mandated under <em>Shabazz </em>for analyzing a petition for a new trial, the trial court never considered the newly discovered Biyant evidence in light of the original trial evidence, presumably because, in the court\u2019s view, Bryant\u2019s statements were not credible enough to require that second level of review.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>disagree with the trial court that Bryant\u2019s statements were not sufficiently credible to require a review of that evidence in the context of the original trial evidence. In particular, I believe that, because the Bryant evidence was admissible as trustworthy declarations against penal interest, that evidence, under the specific circumstances of this case, necessarily satisfied the minimum credibility threshold that comprises the first prong of the two part <em>Shabazz </em>test.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court\u2019s failure to view the newly discovered evidence in the context of the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial was improper. Moreover, as I explain more fully hereinafter, the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to the admissibility of the Bryant evidence and its findings with respect to the credibility of that evidence are irreconcilably in conflict, a problem that irretrievably taints both the court\u2019s analysis under <em>Shabazz </em>and its ultimate determination that a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">I begin my discussion of these issues by noting, preliminarily, that, in many cases involving new trial petitions based on newly discovered evidence, that ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>dence will prove to be so inherently incredible or unworthy of belief that it will be unnecessary for the court to consider it in light of the evidence presented at the original trial. In most such cases, the trial judge, who generally will have had the opportunity to observe the in-court testimony of the witness proffering the newly discovered evidence, will be able to assess that witness\u2019 veracity on the basis of the witness\u2019 conduct, demeanor and attitude on the stand. Indeed, \u201c[t]he trial court ... is obliged to make such a credibility determination ... on the basis of [any such] live testimony.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 842. If, on the basis of that assessment, the court reasonably concludes that the witness is so lacking in credibility that he or she simply would not be believed by a second jury, there is no reason for the court to consider the witness\u2019 testimony in the context of the original trial evidence. In cases involving newly discovered evidence that is <em>not </em>proffered through live testimony \u2014 in such circumstances, the court is unable to assess the witness\u2019 credibility on the basis of his or her demeanor and conduct at the hearing \u2014 the court nevertheless reasonably may conclude that the new evidence is unworthy of belief and, consequently, that a second juiy would not credit it, either because the evidence bears insufficient indicia of reliability, because it is clearly refuted by other undisputed or highly credible evidence, or because it derives from a source that itself is inherently unreliable or untrustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The newly discovered evidence at issue in the present case does not fall into any of these general categories. It is true that, although the trial court could not evaluate Bryant\u2019s credibility firsthand, the court was able to view his video-recorded interview with Colucci. Thus, unlike documentary or other unrecorded hearsay testimony, the video recording afforded the court the opportunity, albeit somewhat limited by the witness\u2019 absence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the courtroom, to assess Bryant\u2019s conduct, demeanor and attitude as he responded to Colucci\u2019s questions during the interview. There is nothing in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision or anywhere else in the record, however, to suggest that the court relied on any aspect of Bryant\u2019s demeanor in that video recording in concluding that a jury would not credit his version of the facts. In fact, the court expressly states that, because Bryant did not testify at the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the court was <em>unable </em>to evaluate his \u201cdemeanor and manner . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Instead, the court relied solely on certain objective, undisputed facts in reaching its conclusion that Bryant was so lacking in credibility that evaluating his testimony in the context of the original trial evidence was unnecessary. In the absence of any indication that the court\u2019s credibility determination was predicated on Bryant\u2019s conduct in the video recording, as opposed to the substance of his statements, it is apparent that Bryant\u2019s demeanor, mannerisms or appearance had no bearing on the court\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent that the trial court\u2019s assessment of Bryant\u2019s credibility would have been entitled to deference if that assessment had been based, in whole or in part, on the court\u2019s evaluation of Bryant\u2019s conduct during his video-recorded interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>with Colucci, there is no occasion for such deference because the record is devoid of any indication that the court\u2019s credibility determination was predicated, to any degree, on Bryant\u2019s demeanor during that interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Furthermore, the court\u2019s conclusion that a second jury would discredit Bryant was not founded on any evidence that Bryant, because of his character or background, is a person unworthy of belief. Indeed, there is nothing in the record to suggest that he is the kind of person who would falsely implicate two former classmates in a gruesome and high profile murder. Finally, the court\u2019s credibility determination was based entirely on its evaluation of the substance of Bryant\u2019s statements viewed in the light of the same objective facts that led the court correctly to conclude that those statements were marked by indicia of reliability sufficient to ensure their trustworthiness for purposes of admissibility. In such circumstances, the trial court was required to consider those statements in the context of the original trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">This is so because of the requirement in this state that only <em>trustworthy </em>declarations against penal interest may be admitted into evidence. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). As this court repeatedly has emphasized, and as I previously explained; see part III B of this opinion; this prerequisite to admissibility is essential and requires the court to engage in a \u201ccareful examination\u201d of the statement to ensure its trustworthiness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>218 Conn. 239, 244, 588 A.2d 1066 (1991), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 451-52. Consequently, a statement against penal interest will be excluded from evidence \u2014 notwithstanding that it would fully exonerate a defendant if believed \u2014 unless \u201ccircumstances [exist that] . . . <em>clearly tend to support the facts </em>asserted in the [declaration].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 452 n.9. Thus, there must exist facts that strongly corroborate the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ment. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319 (explaining that corroboration requirement for hearsay exception for statements against penal interest is \u201csignificant\u201d and <em>\u201cgoes beyond minimal </em>corroboration\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]). In other words, the statement must be supported by corroborating facts that <em>\u201cclearly indicate </em>the statement\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Only a statement against penal interest that meets these stringent requirements will be deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible under that exception to the hearsay rule. Because a statement cannot be characterized as trustworthy unless it is, in fact, reliable or worthy of confidence,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> it stands to reason that when, as in the present case, the trial court properly has found that the newly discovered evidence would be admissible at a new trial as trustworthy statements against penal interest, the court must have a sufficiently compelling justification to reject that evidence as so <em>unreliable </em>or <em>unworthy </em>of confidence that it need not be considered in the context of the original trial evidence. In other words, once the court has determined that a statement against penal interest bears substantial indicia of reliability, such that, at a minimum, a jury reasonably could credit it,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> the court would need strong reason also to conclude that that <em>same </em>evidence is so devoid of credibility that a jury simply would not believe it. Without such a reason, the court is obligated to view the statement in the context of the original trial evidence. To conclude otherwise would unduly diminish the significance of the newly discovered evidence and its potential effect on the jury in light of the relative strength or weakness of the state\u2019s original case. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>it would be manifestly unfair for a court to forgo considering a <em>trustworthy </em>statement against penal interest in the context of the original trial evidence without a truly sound basis for concluding that the statement, despite its reliability, is entirely lacking in credibility. As I explain hereinafter, the trial court in the present case was not justified in rejecting as wholly incredible Bryant\u2019s trustworthy statements against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Before providing that explanation, however, it is important to identify a second critical, albeit related, reason why it was improper for the trial court not to consider the Bryant evidence in the context of the original trial evidence. This reason stems from the fact that a new trial is required upon the discovery of evidence following the petitioner\u2019s original trial if that evidence is sufficiently credible and of such a nature to raise a <em>reasonable doubt </em>at a second trial. In the present case, that newly discovered evidence is third party culpability evidence, which, by its very nature, is always \u201crelevant to the jury\u2019s determination of whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 610; as long as that evidence \u201cestablishes a direct connection between a third party and the charged offense . . . .\u201d Id., 609-10. It is undisputed, of course, that the Bryant evidence satisfies this relevancy requirement because Bryant\u2019s statements directly implicate Hasbrouck and Tinsley in the victim\u2019s murder and exonerate the petitioner. Consequently, for a second jury to find the petitioner not guilty of the victim\u2019s murder, that jury need not be firmly convinced that Bryant is telling the truth about Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s involvement in the murder; indeed, the jury need not even find that it is more likely than not that Bryant\u2019s story is truthful. Rather, the jury must find only that the newly discovered evidence, along with the other evidence tending to undermine the state\u2019s case,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>rise to a reasonable doubt that the petitioner committed the offense. Because juries are instructed that \u201c[p]roof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except guilt and <em>is inconsistent with any other rational </em>conclusion(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>288 Conn. 236, 289 n.49, 951 A.2d 1257 (2008); a second jury would find the petitioner not guilty upon determining that it is reasonably possible that Bryant is telling the truth. Thus, only if the trial court reasonably were to determine that the jury would find the Bryant evidence \u201cutterly unworthy of credence\u201d; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 141 Conn. 208;<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> that is, so lacking in credibility that a jury rationally would not find it credible enough even to raise a reasonable doubt about the petitioner\u2019s guilt, <em>no matter how weak the state\u2019s case against the petitioner, </em>would it be proper for the court to reject the petitioner\u2019s claim without reviewing the newly discovered Bryant evidence in the broader context of the original trial evidence. Indeed, it is in recognition of this relationship between the state\u2019s demanding burden of proof in criminal cases and the petitioner\u2019s burden of establishing a right to a new trial that this court has explained that, in considering the newly discovered evidence in light of the original trial evidence, the court must determine not whether that new evidence is absolutely credible but, rather, whether it is <em>\u201csufficiently\u201d </em>credible to warrant a new trial. (Emphasis added.) <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 844; accord <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 827. Because Bryant\u2019s statements against penal interest bore significant indicia of trustworthiness, and because, as I explain hereinafter, there is nothing in the record to justify a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the Bryant evidence, despite its trustworthiness, is nevertheless wholly lacking in credibility, the trial court\u2019s failure to proceed to the next step of the analysis, that is, consideration of that evidence in the context of the original trial evidence, was contrary to the procedure that this court established in <em>Shabazz </em>for evaluating new trial petitions.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The trial court based its determination that Bryant\u2019s statements were not credible, first, on its finding that the statements were only minimally corroborated and, second, on four undisputed facts. I turn first to the court\u2019s first reason for finding Bryant\u2019s statements lacking in credibility, namely, that they were only minimally corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">As I explained in part III B of this opinion, a third party statement against penal interest is inadmissible unless supported by significant corroborating evidence that clearly establishes the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319. Consequently, a trial court may not admit such a statement unless it determines, after carefully examining the statement and the surrounding circumstances; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 451-52; that the statement is supported by \u201ca significant level of corroboration\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 321; a threshold that the trial court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the present case necessarily found had been met by the petitioner. Indeed, the court expressly identified various facts and circumstances that it determined were sufficient to satisfy that requirement. Notwithstanding this finding, the trial court thereafter concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were \u201cnot credible\u201d and, therefore, would not be believed by a jury, because \u201c[t]he corroboration for Bryant\u2019s claim is minimal\u201d and \u201c[t]he testimony of Bryant is absent any genuine corroboration.\u201d There simply is no way that the trial court\u2019s first finding, that is, that Bryant\u2019s statements are trustworthy because they are supported by significant, rather than minimal, corroborating facts, can be reconciled with its second finding, that is, that those same statements are not credible because the facts supporting them are minimal and not genuinely corroborative.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">This flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis is critical. Unless the trial court correctly concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible\u2014 a determination that the trial court was entitled to make only if its predicate finding of significant corroboration also was correct \u2014 Bryant\u2019s statements would be inadmissible, and, consequently, there would be no reason for the court even to analyze the petitioner\u2019s claim under <em>Shabazz. </em>Because, however, the trial court <em>correctly </em>concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently corroborated to be admissible under the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest, the court was required to proceed to the <em>Shabazz </em>test, the first prong of which mandates that the court decide whether the statements satisfy a minimum credibility threshold. A crucial component of that determination was an evaluation of the extent to which Bryant\u2019s statements were corroborated; common sense dictates that a hearsay statement \u2014 indeed, any statement \u2014 that is supported by significant corroborating evidence necessarily will be far more credible than a statement that lacks any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>real corroboration. Because the trial court improperly relied on its finding that Bryant\u2019s statements were <em>not </em>corroborated \u2014 a finding that flatly contradicted its earlier determination with respect to the <em>very same </em>statements and the <em>very same </em>corroborative evidence \u2014 its analysis was fundamentally flawed, and, therefore, its conclusion is clearly incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The trial court\u2019s analytical error is compounded by the fact that, as I have explained, a third party statement against penal interest that is found to be admissible\u2014 in other words, one that is sufficiently corroborated to be deemed trustworthy \u2014 also will be credible enough to surmount the <em>Shabazz </em>minimum credibility threshold in the absence of sufficiently strong countervailing evidence to justify a contrary conclusion. This is so because, as I also have explained, under <em>Shabazz, </em>the newly discovered evidence need not be fully credible or believable; rather, it need be only <em>sufficiently </em>credible to give rise to a reasonable doubt that otherwise did not exist. In rejecting the evidence supporting Bryant\u2019s statements \u2014 evidence that the trial court already had found, quite properly, to be strongly corroborative of those statements \u2014 the trial court improperly failed to give due weight to that evidence for the purpose of determining whether the petitioner had satisfied the minimum credibility threshold under <em>Shabazz. </em>Moreover, although the court identified certain other evidence that, in its view, supported the conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements were so lacking in credibility that they failed to meet even that low threshold,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> the court\u2019s express reliance on the purported lack of corroborating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>evidence<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> skewed the court\u2019s analysis, resulting in a credibility determination that is unfaithful to the principles underlying <em>Shabazz. </em>Consequently, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements, notwithstanding their trustworthiness, fail under the first prong of <em>Shabazz, </em>cannot stand.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> These flaws in the trial court\u2019s analysis are alone sufficient reason to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In dismissing the petitioner\u2019s claim without considering the nature and strength of the state\u2019s case, the trial court also relied on the facts that none of the victim\u2019s closest friends had \u201cany recollection of any association between [the victim] and Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley,\u201d that Bryant did not come forward with his version of the facts for many years, that none of the witnesses who testified at the new trial hearing had \u201cany recall of ever seeing Bryant and his companions in Belle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Haven on the night of the murder,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he claim that Hasbrouck and Tinsley went \u2018caveman style\u2019 [was] not supported by the evidence.\u201d For the reasons that follow, these facts are insufficient to justify the trial court\u2019s failure to consider Bryant\u2019s trustworthy statements against penal interest in the context of the original trial evidence as the second prong of <em>Shabazz </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">With respect to the first reason that the trial court advances, it is not at all surprising that none of the victim\u2019s closest friends had any recollection of Hasbrouck and Tinsley thirty years after the murder because Bryant never suggested the existence of any relationship between the victim, on the one hand, and him, Hasbrouck and Tinsley, on the other, such that that association likely would have made much of an impression, if any at all, on the victim. To the contrary, Bryant indicated that Hasbrouck, despite his fixation on the victim, was too insecure even to approach her. Bryant himself knew the victim only through his acquaintance with people who lived in her neighborhood, and he and the victim never attended school together. Moreover, at the time of her death, the victim had resided in Greenwich for only one year. In sum, there is nothing in the record to indicate either that Hasbrouck\u2019s interest in the victim was anything but one-sided or, more importantly, that Hasbrouck, Tinsley and Bryant ever spent any significant amount of time with the victim prior to her murder.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In fact, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>quite clear that Hasbrouck and Tinsley were generally unknown in Belle Haven except to those people with whom they actually had spent some time, namely, Byrne and Walker. Notably, Walker remembers both Hasbrouck and Tinsley well and, although Byrne is not alive to testify, Tinsley and Hasbrouck recall Byrne surprisingly well in view of the relatively limited contact that they had had with him more than thirty years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">I turn next to the trial court\u2019s finding that the Bryant evidence cannot be credited because of the considerable time that had elapsed before he came forward. The trial court stated: \u201cAlthough Bryant acquired his information within days of the offense, he, as a trained lawyer, kept it to himself for over one quarter of a century. On finally disclosing, he insisted [on] anonymity. He did not come forward voluntarily; rather, it only happened when . . . Mills informed [Kennedy] of this information.\u201d As I previously explained, Bryant has been very consistent in his reason for not coming forward, namely, that he and his mother feared that he could be subject to criminal liability for his involvement with Hasbrouck and Tinsley on the night of the murder. Indeed, in finding that Bryant\u2019s statements are sufficiently trustworthy so as to render them admissible as against his penal interest, the trial court found: \u201cAt the time of the murder in 1975 . . . Bryant was a fourteen year old black male who was suddenly faced with information that, by his own admission, was clearly against his penal interest ....</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201cCombined with . . . Bryant\u2019s knowledge that there is no statute of limitations on murder, his reluctance to tell his story is reasonable.\u201d I can discern no reason why the same rationale should not apply to a determination of Bryant\u2019s credibility for purposes of the test that this court adopted in <em>Shabazz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The majority seeks to bolster this particular aspect of the trial court\u2019s analysis by hypothesizing a reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>why Bryant did not come forward with his version of the facts until years after the victim\u2019s murder. Specifically, the majority speculates that Bryant fabricated Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s involvement in the murder simply in the hopes of being involved in the sale of a screenplay. The majority\u2019s theory is purely conjectural \u2014 indeed, the trial court itself did not attempt to ascribe this or any other motive to Bryant \u2014 and the majority is incorrect in asserting that the theory finds support in the evidence. On the contrary, the majority\u2019s postulation rests on a mischaracterization of the facts concerning that screenplay as those facts were related by Mills, the screenplay\u2019s author, whose rendition of the facts makes it perfectly clear that Bryant had nothing at all to do with the screenplay, and never sought to have anything to do with it, after he read it and informed Mills of Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s involvement in the murder. See footnote 17 of this opinion. Moreover, the record is perfectly clear that Bryant went to great lengths to <em>avoid </em>any publicity or attention with respect to his knowledge about the events on the night of the murder, and he assiduously resisted any and all efforts by Mills and Walker to persuade him to come forward and to speak to the authorities. Finally, as I previously explained, Bryant consistently expressed wholly understandable reasons for not wanting to make his story public, including the fact that, by doing so, he might have placed himself in jeopardy of becoming a subject or even a target of the police investigation into the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">It is worth noting, moreover, that, when Colucci asked Bryant whether, by coming forward, he was seeking \u201cthe limelight,\u201d Bryant reminded Colucci that he had not come forward willingly, stating: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in any publicity. I don\u2019t want to be involved in this at all. I\u2019m not interested in fifteen minutes or fifteen years of fame. I\u2019m interested in the preservation of my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>family . . . .\u201d Bryant continued, however, that he knew that \u201cthe wrong person is in jail for this\u201d and that Hasbrouck or Tinsley \u201cshould be serving time for this [murder].\u201d When Colucci asked Bryant why he should believe him, Bryant responded: \u201cThere is no reason for you to believe me. All I have is a story to tell. I was there. I knew all the parties.\u201d Bryant further stated: \u201cAnd when you have suspects that have been described by other people [as having been] in Belle Haven and police not following up and prosecutors not following up, it sort of makes you kind of [wary].<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> . . . They just beamed in on that one family [the Skakels]. And unfortunately for [the petitioner], [they] had a bull\u2019s eye on him. Based on the evidence that they had, they were able to convict [him]. But he\u2019s not guilty. He may be guilty of a lot of things, but he\u2019s not guilty of this. . . . But, you know, I\u2019m not his judge [or] his jury. So why should you believe me? I was there. I know who was there. I know what the atmosphere was. People still don\u2019t understand what was going on in Greenwich at the time. There [were] a lot of drugs, a lot of drinking by underage [d] minors. And you had outsiders coming in that were volatile. And you mix those things together, and there is no supervision . . . something\u2019s going to happen. . . . And do I feel responsible? Yes and no. I feel responsible [such] that I need to come forth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>give my statement. I didn\u2019t goad anybody into doing anything. My mistake in judgment is not \u2014 I mean, I sat on this story the whole time during the [petitioner\u2019s criminal] trial, because there was no way, there was no way [I] ever thought that [the petitioner] would get convicted. No way.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Thus, the explanation that the majority advances as to why Bryant might have been motivated to come forward with his information about the murder is completely lacking in factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In sum, I see no reason to disbelieve, or even to doubt, Bryant\u2019s explanation for refusing to come forward sooner. Although he certainly deserves no praise for failing to make himself available to the state and to the petitioner in a much more timely manner, the fact that he did not do so is insufficient reason to reject out-of-hand his version of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">With respect to the trial court\u2019s next reason for discrediting Bryant, I do agree that the court reasonably concluded that Bryant\u2019s credibility is undermined by the fact that no one recalls seeing him, or Hasbrouck or Tinsley, in Belle Haven on the night of the murder, even though Bryant recalls seeing several people there that night. I do not agree, however, that this renders his version of the facts incredible. It may be that Bryant is not telling the whole truth about the murder because of a desire to minimize his own involvement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>events leading up to it. He also may be embellishing, either intentionally or unintentionally, some of bis memories regarding whom he saw, or he may be conflating memories of that night with memories of other visits to Belle Haven. As I explain in greater detail in part IV of this opinion, Bryant would not be the first witness in this case to have a mistaken recollection, or no recollection at all, with respect to events that occurred more than three decades ago.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">We know, moreover, that many people were outside in Belle Haven on the night of the victim\u2019s murder but were never identified by the police. For example, Andrew Pugh, who the state called as a witness at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, testified that, sometime before 8 p.m., he ended up behind the Skakels\u2019 house with \u201cten or twelve of the neighborhood kids . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>causing a ruckus\u201d with \u201cshaving cream and toilet paper . . . .\u201d Pugh was not asked to identify these children, however, and there is no indication that the police ever identified them. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that groups of children congregated at various places in the neighborhood throughout the night. One of the children, Maria Coomaraswamy-Falkenstein, testified at the hearing on the petition for a new trial that she had observed \u201ca large group\u201d of people near the Skakels\u2019 residence and that the group would split up and reassemble within the neighborhood throughout the night. Charles Morganti, a special police officer who was on duty in Belle Haven on the night of the murder, saw a group comprised of at least five or six \u201cyoung teenagers\u201d in and around the Skakels\u2019 property early in the evening and then later on. Because of the darkness, however, he was not able to identify any of them. Evidence adduced at the hearing on the petition for a new trial indicated that there were no street lights in Belle Haven, thereby making it especially difficult to see and identify people at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Indeed, the fact that no one remembers seeing Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley in Belle Haven very well could be attributable both to the darkness and to the cold. According to police records, temperatures on the night of the murder were anywhere between thirty-five and forty-five degrees Fahrenheit; anyone who was out, therefore, likely was covered up. Furthermore, according to Morganti, the group of teenagers that he saw near the Skakels\u2019 property \u201cscattered\u201d when he approached them. When asked whether he was able to identify any of them, Morganti responded: \u201cThere was no light in that area. It was totally pitch black. There is no way I could have recognized anyone over there.\u201d Steven Hartig, another Belle Haven resident, saw a group of teenagers near the Skakels\u2019 property while he was out walking but claims not to have recognized any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>of them. Finally, there also was substantial evidence presented at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that some of the teenagers were consuming drugs and alcohol that night. In short, there is ample reason to believe that people were out in Belle Haven on the night of the murder who never have been identified, either because it was too dark to see them, because they did not want to be seen or for reasons of inattention due to drugs and alcohol. There is no reason necessarily to exclude Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley from that category of persons.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">I note, in addition, that Julie Skakel, the petitioner\u2019s sister, and Andrea Shakespeare, her close friend, observed the silhouette of a person run past the kitchen window of the Skakels\u2019 house at approximately the same time that the victim was sitting in a car in the Skakels\u2019 driveway with Byrne, Helen lx, Thomas Skakel and the petitioner. A short time later, as Julie Skakel was getting into her car to drive Shakespeare home, she observed another figure dart across the driveway in a crouched position and run into the woods. Shakespeare heard the footsteps of the second person but did not see him. Because of the darkness, neither Julie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Skakel nor Shakespeare was able to provide a description of the person or to determine whether it was the same person whom they had seen run past the kitchen window. In light of the newly discovered Bryant evidence, it is not implausible that the figures Julie Skakel and Shakespeare had observed prowling about the Skakels\u2019 property shortly before the victim was killed were those of Hasbrouck and Tinsley, both of whom could have stalked the victim and waited for Byrne to return. Indeed, according to Ix, Byrne appeared on the street, alone, as she and the victim were walking to the Skakels\u2019 residence around 9:10 p.m. Ix told the police that she had left the Skakels\u2019 house approximately fifteen minutes later because she had to be home for a 9:30 p.m. curfew, and that Byrne walked with her to her house and then disappeared. Ix assumed that Byrne went home after he left her but did not see which way he actually went.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The majority asserts that, \u201c[i]n his police interviews, Byrne never stated that Bryant, Hasbrouck or Tinsley had been with him\u201d on the night of the murder and that, \u201c[sjeveral witnesses . . . placed Byrne with the victim and other friends at various times that night . ...\u201d I agree with the majority that Byrne\u2019s whereabouts on the night of the murder are highly relevant to any assessment of Bryant\u2019s credibility because Bryant claims not only that Byrne was with him for much of the evening but also that Byrne was with Hasbrouck and Tinsley after Bryant left. Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, however, to the extent that there is credible evidence documenting Byrne\u2019s movements, it tends to support Bryant\u2019s claims. In Bryant\u2019s video-recorded interview with Colucci, Bryant states that, after going to the Walkers\u2019 residence at approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>6:30 or 6:40 p.m., he, Hasbrouck, and Tinsley went to the home of the Walkers\u2019 neighbor and took some beer from that neighbor\u2019s refrigerator. They then met up with Byrne, and the four of them proceeded to walk around the neighborhood playing pranks. Bryant places the group in the meadow behind the Skakels\u2019 house at between 8:30 and 8:45 p.m. Bryant never indicates that Byrne has left the group, so, presumably, he was with them until Bryant departed for the train station at approximately 9:15 p.m. According to Ix, Byrne met up with the victim and Ix right about this time, at approximately 9:10 p.m., as the victim and Ix were walking to the Skakels\u2019 house. At the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the state sought to establish that Byrne had been with Ix all night by introducing part of a statement that Ix had given to the police on the day after the murder. In that statement, Ix indicates that she met up with Byrne \u201cshortly after\u201d meeting up with the victim, sometime around 7 p.m. In the course of further examination of Ix, however, the petitioner\u2019s counsel introduced another portion of that 1975 statement indicating that Byrne did not stay with Ix and the victim but, rather, left them to go home to get eggs. Ix told police that, after Byrne left, she and the victim \u201cnever really saw [him] again\u201d until he appeared two hours later.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Coomaraswamy-Falkenstein testified at the hearing on the petition for a new trial that, between about 8 and 8:30 p.m. on the night of the murder, she was at the house of the Mouakad family, which lived down the street from the Skakels on Otter Rock Drive, with the victim and some other neighborhood children, and that she did not recall Byrne being with the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">There is, therefore, no firm accounting of Byrne\u2019s whereabouts for the two hour period corresponding to the general time frame that Bryant claims Byrne was with him, Hasbrouck and Tinsley. Indeed, Byrne\u2019s sudden appearance around the time that Bryant claims to have left for the train station offers a highly plausible explanation as to where he might have been most of the evening. If Byrne had gone to his house to get eggs, as lx told police that he had done, and bumped into Bryant along the way, as Bryant claims, that would explain why lx never saw Byrne again until much later in the evening. Indeed, given that Byrne simply showed up alone while the victim and lx were walking to the Skakels\u2019 residence, it is not farfetched to believe that Hasbrouck and Tinsley sent Byrne to try to isolate the victim or to draw her away from lx. As I explain in part IV of this opinion, much of the evidence that was used to convict the petitioner required the jury to draw precisely this manner of inference. In any event, Byrne\u2019s whereabouts are pivotal in terms of assessing Bryant\u2019s credibility, and the fact that his whereabouts for most of the evening remain unaccounted for supports Bryant\u2019s version of the facts.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the trial court expressly found, at the hearing on the petition for a new trial, that \u201cwitnesses confirm[ed] that Bryant [previously had] indicated that he [had been] present in Belle Haven on the night of the murder.\u201d Because the testimony of those witnesses, namely, Barbara Bryant and Esme Ingledew Dick, strongly corroborates Bryant\u2019s claim that he was in Belle Haven with Hasbrouck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>and Tinsley that night, that testimony necessarily minimizes the import of the fact that no witnesses recall seeing Bryant, Hasbrouck or Tinsley there at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">First, with respect to the information provided by Barbara Bryant, the petitioner retained private investigators Michael Udvardy and Catherine Harkness in September, 2006, to locate and interview her. In early November, 2006, Udvardy and Harkness set up a surveillance outside Barbara Biyant\u2019s apartment building in New York City. When Barbara Bryant exited the building in the late morning, Udvardy and Harkness introduced themselves and asked her if she would be willing to answer a few questions. She agreed to do so and spoke to the investigators for approximately fifteen minutes. According to Udvardy, Barbara Bryant \u201cexpressed frustration with [her son] for coming out with the story\u201d and indicated that \u201cshe didn\u2019t know why he was discussing it at all.\u201d When asked whether her son was in Belle Haven on the day of the murder, Barbara Bryant responded that he had gone there with Hasbrouck and Tinsley but had returned home <em>\u201cthat night.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) She also stated that, at that time, her son had told her that <em>Hasbrouck and Tinsley had spent the night in Belle Haven. </em>Barbara Bryant also spoke to Udvardy about the New York Times article of November 1, 1975, that her son had alluded to in his video-recorded interview with Colucci. Barbara Bryant specifically recalled discussing the article with her son at the time of its publication. Udvardy\u2019s testimony was confirmed in all respects by Harkness, who also was present for Barbara Bryant\u2019s interview with Udvardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">On February 21, 2007, Barbara Bryant was deposed by the petitioner. Her deposition was video recorded and later admitted into evidence at the hearing on the petition for a new trial. At her deposition, Barbara Bryant changed her story somewhat from what she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>told Udvardy and Harkness.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Barbara Bryant stated that she then recalled that her son had returned home from Belle Haven while it was still light out, not at night as she had told the investigators. Barbara Bryant also indicated that she no longer was sure if she or someone else in her apartment had brought the New York Times article to her son\u2019s attention; she simply remembered that it was discussed in the house shortly after the murder and that a girl who was visiting had said to her son, \u201caren\u2019t you glad you had your black butt home because you certainly would have been accused of this.\u201d She also did not recall telling her son that Hasbrouck and Tinsley were dangerous and that he should distance himself from them, although she conceded that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that she had had such a conversation with her son. Barbara Bryant stressed that she had no independent knowledge of whether Hasbrouck and Tinsley killed the victim, and that she remembered them as well mannered and attractive young men.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Finally, Barbara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Bryant noted that the publicity surrounding her son\u2019s disclosures had made her \u201cill\u201d and that she was taking several medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Dick, with whom Bryant lived while he was attending Brunswick School, also corroborated Bryant\u2019s claim of having been in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. Dick testified at the hearing on the new trial petition that, in the 1970s, her husband was chairman of the languages department at Brunswick School. Through her work as the executive director of the Educational Film Library Association, Dick had met Barbara Bryant, a producer of children\u2019s films; see part III A of this opinion; and the two women became good friends. In 1972, Dick and her husband invited Bryant to live with them in Greenwich so that he could attend Brunswick School. Dick testified that Bryant lived with them for three years, until the summer of 1975, at which time he left to reside with his mother in Manhattan. According to Dick, shortly after the murder, Bryant visited her home and disclosed to her that <em>he had been in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. </em>Dick also testified that Bryant was veiy upset after the petitioner\u2019s trial and told her that the petitioner had been \u201cwrongly convicted,\u201d although he did not explain why he believed that to be the case. Thus, this testimony, like the evidence that Barbara Bryant provided, seriously undermines any contention that Biyant\u2019s story is merely a recent fabrication. It also belies the majority\u2019s speculative suggestion that Bryant may have been prompted to tell his story because of a desire to collaborate with Mills on Mills\u2019 screenplay. Indeed, the testimony of Barbara Bryant and Dick \u2014 testimony that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>expressly credited \u2014 negates the possibility that Bryant had <em>any </em>reason or motive to he about his whereabouts on the night of the victim\u2019s murder because it defies credulity to think that, at age fourteen, Bryant was planting the seeds for a false story not to be revealed until more than one quarter of a century later.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Finally, the trial court also concluded that the evidence did not support Bryant\u2019s statements concerning the \u201ccaveman style\u201d of attack that Hasbrouck and Tinsley allegedly contemplated because \u201c[t]here was no evidence of the victim being dragged by the hair.\u201d The majority posits a second reason why Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s planned \u201ccaveman\u201d assault is unsupported by the evidence, namely, the alleged sexual nature of the assault was not corroborated by the existence of semen on the victim\u2019s body. Neither of these reasons provides any reasonable basis for rejecting Bryant\u2019s statements as lacking in credibility. First, the victim was dragged a considerable distance \u2014 at least seventy-eight feet\u2014 and it simply is not clear what part of her body her assailant or assailants used to move her that distance. Even if it assumed that she was not dragged by her hair, however, it is clear that Hasbrouck and Tinsley used the term \u201ccaveman style\u201d to describe generally what they intended to do, that is, to abduct, to subdue and then presumably to assault their victim sexually. Moreover, because the victim likely struggled when confronted by her assailants, it is reasonable to presume that Hasbrouck and Tinsley sought to accomplish their goal, including avoiding detection, in whatever way they thought was most likely to succeed under the circumstances, irrespective of whether that approach involved dragging the victim by her hair or by some other part of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">With respect to the majority\u2019s contention that the evidence does not support the conclusion that the victim was the subject of a sexual assault or an attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>sexual assault, the majority is simply mistaken. The victim was found with her pants and underwear pulled down below her knees. Furthermore, the state elicited testimony at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial from Lee, the former chief state criminalist, that semen could have been wiped away from the victim\u2019s body, as well as testimony from Harold Wayne Carver II, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner, that certain parts of the victim\u2019s body were not tested for the presence of semen. In light of the efforts of the victim\u2019s assailant or assailants to remove her pants and underwear, it appears highly likely that the purpose of the assault against the victim was sexual in nature; indeed, it is difficult to discern any other reason or motive for the brutal and shocking attack on the very popular fifteen year old victim.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Thus, the record of the proceedings with respect to the petition for a new trial does not support the trial court\u2019s failure to consider Bryant\u2019s statements \u2014 statements that the court properly found were admissible because they were accompanied by corroborating circumstances clearly indicating their trustworthiness \u2014 in the context of the evidence adduced and the arguments raised at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. Indeed, to the extent that the trial court rejected Bryant\u2019s statements as lacking in credibility because they were only minimally corroborated, that conclusion directly contradicts the court\u2019s threshold finding that the statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>were strongly corroborated, a finding that is fully supported by the evidence. Under the circumstances presented, therefore, the significant indicia of reliability that mark Bryant\u2019s statements are sufficient, as a matter of law, to surmount the minimum credibility threshold that, under <em>Shabazz, </em>triggers consideration of that newly discovered evidence in the context of the original trial evidence.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark>1 therefore turn to an examination of the original trial evidence.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">STATE\u2019S CASE AGAINST THE PETITIONER</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Because the petitioner did not raise a sufficiency of the evidence claim in his direct appeal to this court following his criminal conviction, this is the first time that this court has had occasion to consider the strength of the state\u2019s case.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> See generally <em>State </em>v. Skakel, supra, 276 Conn. 639-40. On the basis of my review of the state\u2019s evidence, I conclude that it was not strong and required the jury to draw every possible inference in favor of the state\u2019s theory of the case.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Although at least four witnesses placed the petitioner twenty minutes away from the scene of the murder when it occurred, the state argued that each and every one of those witnesses was lying. The evidence to support this argument, however, was weak at best, especially when viewed in light of the testimony that was used to convict the petitioner, which consisted almost entirely of equivocal admissions by the petitioner and one dubious confession that he allegedly had made while he was a student at Elan School, an alcohol and drug rehabilita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>tion facility for troubled adolescents located in Poland, Maine. Moreover, there was no physical evidence connecting the petitioner to the crime and no eyewitnesses. In light of the relatively weak evidence adduced by the state and the comparative strength of the newly discovered third party culpability evidence, I am convinced that that new evidence, at an absolute minimum, gives rise to a reasonable doubt about whether the petitioner had murdered the victim. I therefore am persuaded that, if the jury had considered the Bryant evidence together with the original trial evidence that it did consider, it is very likely that the verdict would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Events Leading Up to the Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The following facts, many of which are set forth in this court\u2019s opinion rejecting the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal; see generally id., 639-53; are relevant to the issue of whether the Bryant evidence warrants a new trial. On the evening of October 30, 1975, the victim left her home in the Belle Haven section of Greenwich sometime around 7 p.m. to \u201chack around\u201d the neighborhood with her friend, Helen lx. Shortly after 7 p.m., the victim and lx went by the Skakels\u2019 house to see if the petitioner and his brother, Thomas Skakel (Tommy Skakel), were home. All of the Skakel children, however, Rushton Skakel, Jr., age 19, Julie Skakel, age 18, Tommy Skakel, age 17, John Skakel, age 16, the petitioner, age 15, David Skakel, age 12, and Stephen Skakel, age 9, together with their tutor, Kenneth Littleton, age 23, their cousin, James Temen,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> age 17, and Julie Skakel\u2019s friend, Andrea Shakespeare, age 16, were having dinner at the nearby Belle Haven Club. Rushton Skakel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Sr., the father of the Skakel children, was away on a trip and would not return until the following evening.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> All of the teenagers were drinking that night, some quite heavily. There also was evidence indicating that some of them had been smoking marijuana. The evidence further established that there was virtually no parental supervision at the Skakel household and that Rushton Skakel, Sr., was an alcoholic. The house was managed by an assortment of personnel, including a cook, a housekeeper, a gardener and the children\u2019s tutor, Littleton.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">At approximately 9 p.m., the Skakels and their guests returned home from dinner. Shortly thereafter, at approximately 9:10 p.m., the victim, lx and Geoffrey Byrne arrived at the residence and were let inside by the petitioner. The four of them immediately went outside to listen to music in a family car that was parked in the driveway. The victim and the petitioner sat in the front seat while lx and Byrne sat in the backseat. At approximately 9:15 p.m., Tommy Skakel joined them, climbing into the front seat with the victim and the petitioner.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> After a few minutes, Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel and Temen came out and told them that they needed to use the car to take Temen back to his home, which was approximately twenty minutes away and where they all planned to watch \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d a television show, at 10 p.m. The petitioner asked the victim if she wanted to go with them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>but she said that she had to go home. According to statements that Ix gave to the police in the immediate aftermath of the murder, she, Tommy Skakel, Byrne and the victim got out of the car and Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel, and Terrien got into the car with the petitioner. Ix told the police that, when she got out of the car, she went home to meet her 9:30 p.m. curfew but also because she felt like a \u201cthird wheel\u201d to the victim and Tommy Skakel, who were behaving in a flirtatious manner. When Ix told the victim that she was leaving, the victim responded that she also was going home in a few minutes. Ix, accompanied by Byrne, left Tommy Skakel and the victim at the car and walked toward the rear of the Skakels\u2019 house in the direction of Ix\u2019 house. Ix\u2019 residence abutted the Skakels\u2019 property but faced Walsh Lane, directly across the street from the victim\u2019s house. The victim was standing in the driveway alone with Tommy Skakel the last time Ix saw her alive. Ix arrived home at approximately 9:30 p.m. in accordance with her curfew.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Two weeks after the murder, the police interviewed Ix and asked her to recall again exactly what she and the victim had done after arriving at the Skakels\u2019 residence. Ix responded that, initially, she, the victim, Byrne and the petitioner had gone outside to listen to music in a car. After a short time, they were joined by Tommy Skakel and then by John Skakel, Rushton Skakel, Jr., and Terrien. When the police asked Ix if \u201ceverybody . . . got out of the car\u201d when Rushton Skakel, Jr., said he needed it to take Terrien home, she responded, \u201c [n] ot everyone. Just Tom[my] [Skakel], and me, and [the victim].\u201d When asked if anyone else got out, Ix responded, \u201cand [Byrne].\u201d At the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Ix testified that the car carrying Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel, the petitioner and Terrien was pulling out of the driveway as she and Byrne started to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The victim\u2019s body was discovered at approximately 12:30 p.m. on October 31, 1975, under a tree on her family\u2019s property. In the hours following the discovery of the body, Greenwich police canvassed the Belle Haven neighborhood looking for anyone who might have been out the night before. At approximately 3 p.m., Detective James Lunney went to the Skakels\u2019 home and interviewed all of the Skakel children except for Rushton Skakel, Jr., regarding their activities the night before and was informed at that time that Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel and the petitioner all had gone to Terrien\u2019s home and that Tommy Skakel was the last person in the family to see the victim before she left to return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Julie Skakel was again interviewed by the police approximately two weeks after the murder. At that time, she stated that, at approximately 9:30 p.m. on the evening of the murder, after her brothers had left for Terrien\u2019s residence, she left to take Shakespeare home. Both Shakespeare and Julie Skakel testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that the car going to Terrien\u2019s home already had departed by the time that she and Shakespeare left because Julie Skakel\u2019s car was the only car in the driveway.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> When they got outside, Julie Skakel realized that she had forgotten her car keys and asked Shakespeare to run back inside to get them. The front door was locked, so Shakespeare rang the doorbell. Tommy Skakel, who had just entered the house through the side door where he had been talking to the victim, met Shakespeare at the front door and gave her the keys. Julie Skakel testified that, as she sat in the car waiting for Shakespeare, she saw the victim standing in the driveway and Tommy Skakel at the front door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>speaking to Shakespeare. Both Julie Skakel and Shakespeare reported to the police that, before leaving the Skakels\u2019 house, they had seen an unidentified person run past the kitchen window. Julie Skakel also told the police that, while waiting in the car for Shakespeare to return with the keys, she saw a silhouette of a person running in front of her house. She stated the figure ran in a crouched position across the driveway and disappeared into the woods adjacent to the driveway. Although it was too dark to see who it was, she later told police that she assumed, without any real basis for doing so, that it was one of her brothers, and proceeded to yell, \u201cMichael, come back here . . . .\u201d Although Shakespeare did not see the second person, she told the police that she had heard footsteps on the driveway as she was walking back to the house to get the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Julie Skakel returned home from dropping Shakespeare off at approximately 9:50 p.m. Upon exiting the car, another person ran past Julie Skakel carrying what appeared to be an object in his hands. She could not identify the person, however, because of the darkness.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The evidence established to a high degree of likelihood that the victim was killed between 9:35 and 10 p.m. Dorothy Moxley, the victim\u2019s mother, was painting in the master bedroom of her home when, sometime between 9:30 and 10 p.m., she heard a loud \u201ccommotion\u201d in the yard, on the side of the house, where the victim\u2019s body was later discovered. Dorothy Moxley told police that the commotion consisted of \u201cexcited voices,\u201d incessant barking and what she thought was her daughter\u2019s scream. The commotion was so strange that she stopped what she was doing and went to the window to look outside. Because it was so dark, however, she was unable to see anything and turned on an outside porch light. After a few seconds, however, she turned the light off because she was afraid that whoever was there might see the victim\u2019s bike on the porch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>and steal it. Dorothy Moxley then put away her paint, showered and went downstairs to watch television.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">John Moxley, the victim\u2019s seventeen year old brother, arrived home at approximately 11 p.m. and was informed by his mother, Dorothy Moxley, that the victim had not come home and that she was \u201ca little worried about her.\u201d John Moxley told his mother that it was mischief night, that the victim probably was out having fun and that she would be home soon. After watching the evening news, John Moxley went upstairs to bed, while Dorothy Moxley fell asleep on the sofa in front of the television. At approximately 1:30 a.m., Dorothy Moxley woke up and realized that the victim still was not home. At that point, she woke her son and asked him to go out and look for her. She also began calling the victim\u2019s friends to see if someone might know where she was. At approximately 3:45 a.m., she called the Greenwich police to report the victim missing. According to police records, Dorothy Moxley stated that her daughter had been due home \u201cat 9:30 p.m.\u201d and \u201chad never been late like this before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The strongest evidence of the time of death was offered through the victim\u2019s friend, Ix. She testified that, after arriving home at 9:30 p.m., she telephoned a couple of friends. During one of the calls, at approximately 9:45 p.m., her Australian Shepherd began to bark incessantly.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The barking became so loud and annoying that she put down the telephone receiver and went outside to bring the dog in. When she got there, she could see the dog at the end of her driveway, \u201cfrozen\u201d by the edge of the road, barking in the direction of the Moxleys\u2019 driveway. Ix testified that she never had seen her dog in such an agitated state and that he was \u201cscared\u201d and barking \u201cviolently.\u201d Ix further testified that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the dog always came to her when she called him, on this occasion, he refused. After a while, she gave up and went back inside. According to lx, the dog barked continuously for about twenty-five minutes, until the family\u2019s housekeeper went out and forced the dog to come inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Other neighbors, in addition to the victim\u2019s mother, reported hearing lx\u2019 dog at around 10 p.m. David Skakel testified that the barking was so \u201cdistressed and prolonged\u201d that he got out of bed and opened a window to see what was going on. His bedroom overlooked his family\u2019s backyard with views of both lx\u2019 property and the Moxleys\u2019 property. Because of the darkness, he could not see the dog, but he could tell from the direction of the barking that the dog was standing near the road at the end of lx\u2019 driveway. At trial, Joseph A. Jachimc2yk, the forensic pathologist who assisted the police early on in the investigation, placed the time of death at approximately 10 p.m. on the basis of the contents of the victim\u2019s stomach, the fact that rigor mortis had set in by the time her body was discovered and the frantic barking of lx\u2019 dog at the edge of the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In the days and weeks following the murder, the police interviewed the Skakel children, as well as their cousins, Terrien and Terrien\u2019s sister, Georgeann Terrien, on several occasions. Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel and James Terrien all told police that they and the petitioner had left the Skakels\u2019 house at approximately 9:30 p.m. to go to the Terrien residence to watch \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.\u201d All of them reported that, as they were leaving the house, they saw the victim standing in the driveway with Tommy Skakel. After the show ended at 10:30 p.m., Rushton Skakel, Jr., and John Skakel stayed at the Terrien residence for about twenty minutes and then returned home to Belle Haven, arriving at approximately 11:15 p.m. Georgeann Terrien told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the police that she was home when Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel, the petitioner and James Terrien arrived there to watch television. At the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel, James Terrien and Georgeann Terrien gave the same account of their activities on the night of the murder that they had given to police in 1975. Specifically, Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel and James Terrien all testified that they, along with the petitioner, had gone to the Terrien residence at around 9:30 p.m. to watch television and that Rushton Skakel, Jr., John Skakel and the petitioner had returned home at approximately 11:15 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Relationship Between the Crime Scene Evidence and the Bryant Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Photographs of the Skakels\u2019 property and the Moxleys\u2019 property reveal a densely wooded landscape, with trees, tall hedges and bushes running along the diagonal path that the victim would have taken to walk home after leaving the Skakels\u2019 residence. The physical evidence at the crime scene indicated that the victim initially was assaulted near the top of her driveway, just after she crossed Walsh Lane. The Moxleys\u2019 driveway was horseshoe shaped, with two entrances, one to the east and one to the west. The west entrance was opposite the southeast comer of the Skakels\u2019 property. Inside the horseshoe driveway was a large lawn that extended from the street toward the northwest comer of the Moxleys\u2019 house. The house was not centered on the driveway but, rather, was situated to the southeast of it, or to the left of the horseshoe driveway, if one were standing in the street facing the house.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>police reports, at the intersection of the west entrance to the driveway and Walsh Lane, \u201capproximately [four] feet south of the roadway, a compressed grass area existed, indicating the prior presence of a body.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> On the lawn in the middle of the horseshoe driveway, a bloodstained Toney Penna six iron golf club was found; the club later was determined to have belonged to the petitioner\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Three feet west of the golf club was a patch of blood that measured twelve inches in circumference. Thomas G. Keegan, the Greenwich detective originally in charge of the investigation, believed that the victim either was killed or knocked unconscious at this location. In a letter to Joseph A. Jachimczyk, a forensic pathologist who aided the police in the initial investigation, Keegan wrote: \u201cApproximately eight feet west of the point of attack an eight inch section of stainless steel tubular golf club shaft was found, and this piece of metal, as well as the broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>end of the club head, indicated that they were both intentionally broken, apparently by bending back and forth. The victim was then apparently carried or semi-dragged for a distance of fifty-eight feet to the west of the driveway.\u201d According to Keegan\u2019s crime scene notes, the path through the leaves from the lawn inside of the horseshoe driveway to the west side of the driveway \u201cwas obvious . ...\u201d A small amount of blood was found on the surface of the driveway along the path. \u201cThe victim was then apparently carried or dragged for another fifty feet\u201d to a point where \u201ctwo [more] patches of blood approximately] [eighteen] inches in circumference\u201d were found. Keegan concluded that \u201cthe victim was repeatedly assaulted at this location\u201d and sustained \u201cat least four stab wounds from the broken end of the [golf] club and multiple blows to the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cAbout eight feet from [the two patches of blood] another seven inch section of tubular stainless steel golf club shaft was found, again apparently intentionally broken. The victim was then dragged for a distance of approximately seventy-eight feet and placed under [a] pine tree . . . [leaving] a clear and visible drag-pattern measuring thirteen and five-[eighths] inches wide. The victim suffered one [nonfatal] blow where there is a clear impression of the golf club head on her left arm and shoulder. All other blows [were] fatal. ... A black abrasion on the right side of her nose indicates that her nose came into contact with the driveway.\u201d Finally, at some point during the attack, the victim\u2019s pants and underwear were pulled down below her knees. According to Lee, a forensic scientist who reconstructed the crime for the state sixteen years after the murder,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> blood splatter inside the victim\u2019s underwear and pants indicated that her pants and underwear were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>down when some or all of the blows were inflicted. In certain respects, however, Lee\u2019s reconstruction of the crime differed significantly from that of Keegan\u2019s.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Lee theorized that the assault had occurred in the area where the two larger patches of blood were found, on the west side of the driveway, and that, during the assault, the golf club broke from the force of one of the blows, sending the head and a piece of the shaft approximately 100 feet through the air to where they were discovered on the lawn in the middle of the horseshoe driveway. According to Lee, the blood that was found on the driveway and the twelve inch patch of blood on the lawn in the middle of the horseshoe driveway were deposited in those locations from the golf club head and shaft as they flew by.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Lee also theorized, and the state maintained during closing argument, that, after the initial assault, the victim ran into the wooded area west of the driveway. Specifically, the state\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that \u201c[the victim] was first assaulted somewhere by the driveway .... She wasn\u2019t knocked unconscious there because we learned that she was somehow able to travel from here to . . . the major blood scene, and there is no drag trail between those two points.\u201d As I previously mentioned, however, Keegan had observed an \u201cobvious\u201d path from the lawn inside the horseshoe driveway to the major blood area west of the driveway on the afternoon that the body was discovered. Because defense counsel did not cross-examine Lee about any of his conclusions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>he never explained how his reconstruction comported with Keegan\u2019s crime scene notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In light of Bryant\u2019s statements that two teenagers, both of whom were wielding golf clubs, are responsible for the victim\u2019s murder, Keegan\u2019s description of the crime scene and his theory on the manner in which the victim\u2019s murder occurred would merit serious consideration at a new trial.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> As I discussed previously, Keegan believed that the victim was first assaulted on the lawn in the middle of the horseshoe driveway, where a golf club broke or was intentionally broken. The victim then was carried or partially dragged to the more secluded wooded area west of the driveway, where the attack resumed. If Keegan is correct, and a golf club broke or was intentionally broken on the lawn in the middle of the horseshoe driveway, there would have to have been more than one golf club involved in the attack because, according to Lee\u2019s reconstruction and Keegan\u2019s crime scene notes, the victim sustained multiple blunt force injuries in the area west of the driveway, where the two large patches of blood were found. Furthermore, on the basis of the nature of the drag marks, John Solomon, the state\u2019s chief investigator in the 1980s and early 1990s, concluded that the perpetrator was disoriented, if not unfamiliar, with the location of the neighborhood houses in relation to each another.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The autopsy report is in no way inconsistent with a two assailant theory and, in some respects, appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>support it. Harold Wayne Carver II, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner who testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial regarding the findings of the original autopsy report, stated that the victim had sustained at least eight blunt force injuries to her head. All of those injuries were consistent with having been caused by the head of a golf club. Three such injuries were inflicted to the front of the victim\u2019s head, three were inflicted to the back of her head and two were inflicted to the left side of her head. Each of the blows, according to Carver, could have been fatal, and the victim likely would have lost consciousness relatively quickly. The victim also sustained a broken nose,<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> blunt force trauma to her left shoulder and at least four stab wounds to the neck and head, consistent with having been caused by the broken shaft of a golf club. When the state asked Carver to explain the order in which the injuries were inflicted, he emphasized that his answer was predicated on the \u201cassumption\u201d that only one golf club had been used in the murder. He explained that, \u201c[provided] only one golf club [was] involved,\u201d all of the blunt force injuries to the head would have to have been inflicted before the head broke away from the club\u2019s shaft. Just as with Lee, however, the defense did not cross-examine Carver, and, consequently, he was not queried as to whether so many potentially fatal blows to the front, side and back of the victim\u2019s head were consistent with the state\u2019s theory of a lone assailant or whether they were as or more likely to have been inflicted by two assailants, wielding golf clubs from different directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Furthermore, despite Keegan\u2019s conclusion that the attack was initiated where the club head was found, neither Lee nor Carver was asked whether the petitioner, who, by all indications was no bigger than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>victim; see footnote 45 of this opinion; would have been physically capable of carrying or dragging the victim\u2019s body from the lawn inside the horseshoe driveway to the second assault area approximately 100 feet away. Hasbrouck and Tinsley, however, each of whom Bryant described as weighing at least 200 pounds and standing approximately six feet, two inches in height, clearly would have been capable of doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Indeed, in my view, the most troubling aspect of the state\u2019s theory of the crime stems from the fact that it is predicated on the assumption that the victim fled to the more secluded area west of the driveway, where the major assault occurred. Thus, the state maintained during closing argument that, after the initial assault, the victim \u201csomehow\u201d was able to get away from her killer and run to that location. It is counterintuitive, however, that the victim, seizing on the opportunity to flee, would have opted to run in a direction that would leave her more vulnerable and isolated than she already was. As between the two possible escape routes, one being the wooded area west of the driveway and the other being the safety of her house to the southeast, common sense strongly suggests that she would have tried to run toward her house, which would have taken her across the lawn in between the horseshoe driveway, directly over the area where Keegan theorized that the assault had begun. If that were the case, and the victim had been subdued or knocked unconscious at that location, as Keegan believed that she had been, then someone would have had to have carried or dragged her body more than 100 feet to the other side of the driveway. It is hard to imagine, and the state\u2019s experts were not asked to explain, how the petitioner could have managed such a feat in the dark, carrying not only the victim but also a golf club or pieces thereof in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Finally, as I indicated previously, two hairs that were recovered from the sheet that was used to wrap the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>victim\u2019s body where it was discovered provide additional corroboration of Bryant\u2019s statements. One of the hairs was identified by the FBI forensic crime lab as \u201cpossessing Negroid characteristics,\u201d and subsequent testing on the other hair revealed that it possessed Asian characteristics. Hasbrouck and Bryant are of African-American descent and Tinsley, according to Bryant, is of mixed race origin, possibly of Asian descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">History of the Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">At this point, a short history of the investigation is necessary to a fuller understanding of the original trial evidence and to my conclusion that that evidence was neither particularly trustworthy nor particularly strong. The Greenwich police followed numerous leads in the weeks, months and years following the murder. In 1976, the police prepared an arrest warrant charging Tommy Skakel with the murder based, in part, on misleading statements that he had given to the police on the day after the murder, and because he was the last person known to have seen the victim alive. The arrest warrant, however, never was executed. The police then focused their suspicions on Littleton, the tutor whose first night in residence at the Skakels\u2019 house was the night of the murder. Littleton\u2019s bizarre and erratic behavior in the months and years following the murder, certain allegedly incriminating statements that he had made to his wife and others, and multiple run-ins with the law, convinced Solomon, the state\u2019s chief investigator through the early 1990s, that Littleton was the killer. Solomon also believed that Littleton, an alcoholic, was responsible for a series of unsolved murders involving the bludgeoning deaths of young women in and around places Littleton had lived or visited before and after the victim\u2019s murder. Like Tommy Skakel, however, Littleton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>never was charged, and the case went cold for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In the early 1990s, several events caused the revival of the investigation and eventually led to the petitioner\u2019s arrest and conviction. In 1991, a rumor circulated that William Kennedy Smith, who then was facing sexual assault charges in Florida, was in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. Like the Skakels, Smith was related to the family of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. Although there was no truth to the rumor, it renewed public interest in the case and put pressure on the police to solve it. In 1993, \u201cA Season in Purgatory,\u201d which was authored by Dominick Dunne, was published. The book was a best-selling fictionalized account of the victim\u2019s murder in which Dunne effectively accused Tommy Skakel of the murder and the entire Skakel family of conspiring to cover it up. Because of the renewed scrutiny on his family, Rushton Skakel, Sr., hired a private investigation firm, Sutton Associates (Sutton), to investigate the murder with the hope of exonerating his family. According to Leonard Levitt, another author who wrote about the victim\u2019s murder, before Sutton agreed to take the case, Rushton Skakel, Sr., assured Sutton that they could pursue the investigation wherever it led, and that, if it turned out that a member of his family had committed the crime, the family would publicly acknowledge it.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">As part of its investigation, Sutton interviewed Tommy Skakel and the petitioner. Both Tommy Skakel and the petitioner disclosed that they had not been truthful with the police in 1975. Tommy Skakel told Sutton that, after Julie Skakel had left to take Shakespeare home, he went back outside and spent another twenty minutes with the victim in his backyard, where they engaged in heavy petting and mutual masturbation. The petitioner told investigators that, after he returned home from the Terrien residence, he, too, went back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>out, at around midnight, to peep in the window of a woman who lived on Walsh Lane. On the way home, he stopped at the victim\u2019s house, climbed into a tree to look in her window and masturbated. The petitioner later told the same story to Richard Hoffman, a ghost writer with whom the petitioner briefly collaborated in 1997 on a book about the petitioner\u2019s life. Hoffman testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial regarding his conversations with the petitioner, which he had tape recorded. According to Hoffman, the petitioner told him that, \u201clike ... all the other boys in the neighborhood, he had [had] a crush on [the victim].\u201d The petitioner also disclosed that, by the age of thirteen, he had developed a serious alcohol problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In 1994, an employee of Sutton stole the firm\u2019s files on the case, including detailed suspect profiles, and gave them to Levitt and Dunne. On November 26,1995, Levitt published the first part of a four part series of newspaper articles in which he disclosed that the petitioner and Tommy Skakel had changed their stories with respect to their activities on the night of the murder. Dunne later gave the information that Sutton had obtained to Mark Fuhrman, a detective formerly employed by the Los Angeles police department who testified at the O. J. Simpson murder trial. In 1998, Fuhrman published a book in which he accused the petitioner of the victim\u2019s murder. Fuhrman\u2019s conclusion was based in part on the petitioner\u2019s statements to Sutton that he had gone back out on the night of the murder, peeped in a neighbor\u2019s window and masturbated in a tree in the Moxleys\u2019 yard.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Following publication of the Levitt article in 1995, the television show \u201cUnsolved Mysteries\u201d dedicated a segment to the victim\u2019s murder. After the program aired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>police received numerous tips from around the country. Some of them were from people who were fellow residents of the petitioner at Elan School (Elan), the alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility that the petitioner had attended as a teenager. A number of them recalled that the petitioner, who attended Elan from 1978 to 1980, appeared to have had some involvement in or knowledge of the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The Petitioner\u2019s Statements at Elan</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Most if not all of the evidence that was used to convict the petitioner consisted of statements that he allegedly had made at Elan and to Hoffman. According to the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Elan employed an extremely controversial behavior modification program that was based on confrontation, humiliation and public beatings. Of all the former Elan students who testified against the petitioner, however, only one, Gregory Coleman, claimed to have actually heard the petitioner confess to the victim\u2019s murder. Coleman contacted a television station in 1998, after watching a tabloid news show about Fuhrman\u2019s book and after a sizeable reward in the case had been advertised in People Magazine. Coleman, a twenty-five bag a day heroin addict, testified before the grand juiy that had investigated the victim\u2019s murder and at the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing that he met the petitioner for the first time when he was assigned to \u201cguard\u201d him at Elan, following the petitioner\u2019s attempt to escape from the school. According to Coleman, the first thing that the petitioner ever said to him was, \u201cI am going to get away with murder; I am a Kennedy . . . .\u201d Coleman also stated that the petitioner had told him that he had beaten a girl\u2019s head in with a golf club and, two days later, had gone back to the body and \u201cmasturbated on [it].\u201d Coleman died of a heroin overdose before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, but his probable cause hearing testimony was admitted into evidence and read to the jury at that trial.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Part of the reward money that Coleman had sought ultimately was awarded to Coleman\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Other former Elan students who testified, however, told a very different story about the petitioner, insisting that the petitioner never confessed to the victim\u2019s murder. Rather, as they recalled, Joseph Ricci, the executive director of Elan, often taunted the petitioner about the victim\u2019s murder, accusing him either of having committed the crime or of knowing who did. At one point, after the petitioner had run away from the school, a general meeting<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> was convened at which the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>was brutalized for several hours in a boxing ring in front of the entire school. All of the witnesses gave similar accounts of the incident. Alice Dunn, a former student, testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that, for three days before the general meeting, the petitioner had been forced to stand in the comer of the school dining room without any sleep. On the third day, he was placed against the wall, and at least 150 students confronted him by yelling and spitting in his face. After a while, the petitioner was placed in a boxing ring and questioned by Ricci about a variety of matters, including the victim\u2019s murder. According to Dunn, this was the first time that anyone at Elan ever had heard about the victim\u2019s minder. Ricci, who appeared to be reading from the petitioner\u2019s file, tried to get the petitioner to confess, but the petitioner insisted over and over that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do it.\u201d Each time the petitioner denied involvement in the crime, Ricci put him in the boxing ring, and students would \u201cpummel\u201d him until he was \u201cphysically . . . wiped out . . . .\u201d The objective of the general meeting was to make the petitioner feel abandoned by his family so that he would think that he had no alternative but to submit to the Elan program.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">According to Sarah Petersen, another former Elan student, the petitioner cried \u201cuncontrollably\u201d during the beatings. She said that Ricci often \u201cliked to pull [the petitioner] out [of the crowd at general meetings and] emotionally pound on him,\u201d saying things like, \u201cwe know you did this . . . .\u201d When Ricci did not get the response that he was seeking, he would put the petitioner in the boxing ring or spank him with a paddle. Petersen testified that the petitioner always denied any involvement in the murder, but, after \u201clong hours of torture,\u201d he would say that he did not remember just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to \u201cget them to lay off him for a little while.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Another former student, Michael Wiggins, remembered the general meetings as pure \u201cmayhem,\u201d with students hitting the petitioner as hard as they could while others screamed \u201chit him, hit him hard, hit him harder . . . .\u201d Wiggins recalled that the petitioner always denied any involvement in the victim\u2019s murder until he was beaten down and extremely fatigued, at which point he would say, \u201cI don\u2019t remember . . . .\u201d The beatings would stop as soon as the petitioner expressed some doubt. Wiggins himself was beaten so severely at Elan that, twenty-five years later, he still had scars on his body from those beatings. According to Wiggins, the beatings would stop for everyone as soon as they told Ricci what Ricci wanted to hear, even if it was not true. Elizabeth Arnold, another former Elan student, testified that, two days after the petitioner\u2019s first boxing ring incident, Ricci tried to reassure the petitioner at a group therapy session that Ricci did not really think that the petitioner had killed the victim, only that the petitioner knew who did and that he probably was covering up for Tommy Skakel. The petitioner responded that \u201che didn\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t remember\u201d anything about the night of the victim\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>By all accounts, the petitioner\u2019s rumored involvement in the victim\u2019s murder became his identity at Elan. For weeks on end, he was forced to wear a sign around his neck that stated, \u201cI am a spoiled brat, please confront me on the murder of my friend, Martha Moxley . . . .\u201d Dunn testified that she approached the petitioner after the first general meeting and asked him about the victim\u2019s murder. She thought that, if she talked to him, it might \u201cjar\u201d his memory, and that she might be the one who would be able to get him to make \u201csome sort of confession . . . .\u2019\u2019He responded that \u201che just didn\u2019t know,\u201d that he had been \u201cdrinking\u201d that night and that he was not in his normal state of mind. Nine months later, after the petitioner had graduated from Elan and both he and Dunn became staff members there, they had dinner at a local restaurant, and she asked him again if he \u201creally ha[d] no memory of what [had] happened . . . .\u201d When the trial court presiding over the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial asked Dunn to recall exactly how she had put the question to him, she responded: \u201cTo the best of my recollection, I put it to him like, you know, you know, what about that whole thing with your family and, you know, with the murder of that girl in Greenwich and, you know, do you, you know, you know, what do you think, you know, I mean, what do you think happened, really, back there.\u201d According to Dunn, the petitioner answered in the same way that he always had answered, that is, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, you know. I don\u2019t know if it was me. I don\u2019t know if it was my brother, you know. I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t remember anything. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">John Higgins testified that, on one occasion, when he and the petitioner were on \u201cnight owl\u201d duty at Elan, which consisted of guarding the dormitory door to ensure that none of the students escaped, the petitioner talked with him for hours. According to Higgins, the petitioner told him \u201cabout a murder that he was some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>how involved in\u201d and that \u201che remembered that there was a party going on ... at his house.\u201d He also remembered \u201cgoing through some golf clubs\u201d and \u201crunning through some woods.\u201d According to Higgins, the petitioner \u201cwas sobbing and crying,\u201d just \u201creleasing emotions\u201d and \u201cbleeding out.\u201d \u201c[Tjhrough a progression of statements, he said that he didn\u2019t know whether he did it, that he may have done it, [that] he didn\u2019t know what happened, [and that] eventually, he came to the point that he [thought he] did do it, [that] he must have done it . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The import of Higgins\u2019 testimony is questionable, however, because, on cross-examination, he acknowledged that he had failed to tell the state\u2019s investigator about the petitioner\u2019s alleged admissions in the first few conversations that Higgins had had with the investigator. Higgins also claimed that approximately twenty-five to thirty people were with him and the petitioner when the petitioner made his admissions, but none of these alleged witnesses testified at trial. Higgins claimed, moreover, that his conversation with the petitioner was the first and only time that he ever had heard about the victim\u2019s murder, and that he later read about it in People Magazine in the 1990s. Every other Elan witness, however, testified that the murder was a regular topic of conversation at general meetings, which were mandatory for all the students to attend. Indeed, one witness, Petersen, testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that Higgins had been the petitioner\u2019s \u201cpersonal overseer\u201d for at least six weeks after the petitioner attempted to run away.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Finally, Higgins admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>he was aware of the reward money when he came forward and that Garr had advised Higgins that the reward had been increased to $100,000.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">These statements at Elan constitute the state\u2019s strongest evidence of the petitioner\u2019s guilt. A careful review of the statements, however, reveals that, although they may have been sufficient to sustain a conviction, they reasonably cannot be characterized as particularly powerful or convincing because the exclusive source of the single, unequivocal admission attributed to the petitioner was the probable cause hearing testimony of Coleman, who, for reasons that I previously have explained, was among the least credible of the witnesses that the state produced. Indeed, it is not unfair to say that it would be difficult to find a witness more lacking in credibility.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The other statements that the petitioner made to Elan students \u2014 none of whom came forward until many years after the alleged statements were made \u2014 all were equivocal and very well could have been the product of an emotionally troubled adolescent who had been hounded about the matter during his entire tenure at Elan.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney argued forcefully that the petitioner\u2019s statements at Elan constituted powerful evidence of consciousness of guilt. The state\u2019s attorney maintained, moreover, that the only way that Ricci would have known about the victim\u2019s murder is if the petitioner\u2019s family had told him about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>it when they enrolled him at Elan. The state\u2019s attorney also argued that the only explanation for the petitioner\u2019s presence at Elan was that his family must have sent him there because they thought that he was guilty of the victim\u2019s murder and, further, that sending the petitioner to Elan would assist in the cover-up of the petitioner\u2019s guilt. Specifically, the state\u2019s attorney asserted: \u201cOne thing every client of Elan who was there during that particular era recalls vividly is . . . Ricci referring to a file and telling the [petitioner] that he wasn\u2019t getting out of [the boxing] ring until he explained why he killed [the victim], and then being forced to wear a sign [that says]: \u2018Confront me on the murder of my neighbor.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201cWhere did Ricci get that information? Clearly, he didn\u2019t get it from the police.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Why did Ricci have that information? Why did Ricci confront the [petitioner] with that information? The answer, the only one that makes sense, lies in why the [petitioner] was there in the first place, lies in why his family felt a need to put him in that awful place. Why? Because that\u2019s what they decided that they had to do with the killer living under their roof.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> The state\u2019s attorney also maintained: \u201cOne thing that I submit helps tie all this together, particularly on the subject of Elan ... is the [petitioner\u2019s] very presence at that place. The defense scoffs at the idea despite . . . such clear evidence of a cover-up. Why was the [petitioner] at Elan? This is really not a matter of seeing the forest from the trees. It is genuinely transparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\u201cClearly, the [petitioner] had a major problem. Already he was an alcoholic, a substance abuser. Already he was beyond the control of his family. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>was becoming suicidal. I doubt his family was even aware of the sexual turmoil he was going through. Elan was a last resort but why exactly so drastic a resort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Although the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument was sufficiently rooted in the evidence to defeat a claim of prosecutorial impropriety; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 755-59; the theory \u2014 a centerpiece of the state\u2019s case against the petitioner \u2014 verged on the speculative. Because it called for an inference that was so attenuated from the facts \u2014 namely, that the petitioner\u2019s father had sent him to Elan because he thought that the petitioner had killed the victim \u2014 the theory falls well short of convincing. Indeed, in my view, the relative weakness of the state\u2019s case is reflected in this very argument by the state\u2019s attorney, which requires the fact finder to reject other equally plausible scenarios without any convincing reason to do so.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The defense, evidently unimpressed with the strength of the state\u2019s case, offered no real rebuttal to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument that only someone who had committed murder would say some of the things that the petitioner had said at Elan, or that the petitioner must have been sent to Elan because his family believed that he was responsible for the victim\u2019s murder. The defense also offered no explanation as to how an innocent person, particularly one as emotionally troubled as the petitioner, could convince himself that he may have killed someone in a drunken stupor but had no recollection of doing so. Indeed, during closing argument, defense counsel boasted to the jury that, because of the weakness of the state\u2019s case, he had not deemed it necessary to call a single expert witness to provide an alternative explanation for the petitioner\u2019s statements. \u201cThe nature of our defense \u2014 we didn\u2019t have the high tech delivery. ... You don\u2019t see the big fancy jury expert sitting at our table. It\u2019s somewhat low key. It is me and three kids, as you can see. . . . We didn\u2019t bring in one expert. There is no memory expert. There is no this expert, there is no dog expert, nothing. We didn\u2019t give you any fancy theories. We didn\u2019t give you a twinkie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>defense.\u201d Defense counsel noted, however, that the petitioner was not the only suspect in the case who had made incriminating statements over the years and that Littleton, like the petitioner, had expressed doubt on several occasions as to whether he, too, could have committed the crime. Indeed, it is remarkable that at least three people have, to varying degrees, made self-incriminatory statements with respect to the victim\u2019s murder, namely, Littleton, Bryant and the petitioner. Significantly, of the three, only Bryant has no known history of emotional disturbance, addiction or acting out. In fact, it is precisely because Bryant is so much more credible than practically every other witness in the case that I am persuaded that, if a jury were to consider his statements together with the original evidence, it likely would find the petitioner not guilty of the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The State\u2019s Theory Concerning the Petitioner\u2019s Masturbation Story</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney also argued that the reason the petitioner told people that he had gone back outside on the night of the murder and masturbated in a tree next to the victim\u2019s house was that he feared that \u201chis semen might one day be identified in a crime lab, or even that, one day, someone might surface who had actually seen him [in the victim\u2019s yard].\u201d The state\u2019s attorney further asserted that, by the early 1990s, \u201cevery criminal investigator on the planet was totally attuned to this miraculous new [DNA] technology, and, of course, that would include the [private investigators] that the Skakel family had hired to assist them in the defense, [namely] Sutton Associates.\u201d According to the state\u2019s attorney, \u201cthe word \u2018masturbation\u2019 . . . [did not] come up until 1992 or thereabouts . . . . You didn\u2019t have to be a fly on the wall when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>[Sutton] came into the picture in 1992 to understand why the defendant soon was serving up his bizarre tale of masturbation in a tree to his friend, [Andrew] Pugh, and later to . . . Hoffman.\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">As with the arguments of the state\u2019s attorney about Elan, the evidence adduced at trial was not all consistent with the arguments of the state\u2019s attorney about the masturbation story, and some of the evidence directly contradicted it. For example, Michael Meredith, another former Elan student, testified that, in the summer of 1987, he resided at the Skakels\u2019 house while working with the petitioner on a class action lawsuit against Elan. Meredith learned about the victim\u2019s murder for the first time that summer in a conversation with the petitioner. According to Meredith, the petitioner \u201cinstigated\u201d the conversation, stating that, \u201cI presume you know about [the victim] and her murder. And I want you to know, unequivocally, that I am innocent of that. If you are curious about the details, I want to tell you what happened so you know from me.\u201d In the course of the ensuing conversation, the petitioner told Meredith that, on the night of the murder, he had climbed a tree outside the victim\u2019s house and masturbated. Meredith testified that his sense was that this was not the first time that the petitioner had done such a thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>In light of Meredith\u2019s testimony, which the state never discredited, the state\u2019s theory with respect to why the petitioner claimed to have masturbated outside the victim\u2019s home on the night of the murder lacked persuasive force. Because the petitioner had recounted his story to Meredith several years before the petitioner\u2019s family hired Sutton, and many years before the advent of DNA technology in criminal investigations became popularly known, the state\u2019s claim that the petitioner had invented the story has little, if any, weight. Thus, this theory, no less than the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument that personnel at Elan had been informed by the Skakel family that the petitioner was involved in the victim\u2019s murder, reflects the relative weakness of the state\u2019s case against the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Petitioner\u2019s Alibi Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">I am persuaded that the Bryant evidence likely would result in an acquittal at a new trial not only because the evidence adduced by the state against the petitioner at his criminal trial was not strong, but also because of the strength of the petitioner\u2019s alibi. As I previously indicated, several witnesses, including the victim\u2019s close friend, lx, testified that the petitioner, along with several others, left Belle Haven in a car at around 9:30 p.m. to go to the home of the petitioner\u2019s cousin, Terrien, twenty minutes away. Because the time of death was so firmly established, the success of the state\u2019s case rested on the state\u2019s ability to convince the jury that all of the alibi witnesses were lying. To this end, the state\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that the petitioner\u2019s alibi was a construct, invented by the petitioner\u2019s father, and practiced by its main proponents on a trip that they had taken to the family vacation house in Windham, New York, shortly after the victim\u2019s murder. The state\u2019s attorney also argued that the family likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>used the trip as an opportunity to \u201cdispose of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The state\u2019s attorney argued to the jury: \u201cLet\u2019s stay with the alibi. Why is it so suspect. How was it produced. What did the Skakel family do ... to put this together. Someone seeing the police all over the place decided, had the sense to get the players out of the area. The oldest brother [Rushton Skakel, Jr.] had already gone off to [Washington] D.C., so the first thing the next morning, Littleton was ordered to take the four players, [the petitioner], John [Skakel], [Tommy Skakel] and . . . Temen, out of the way for awhile, for a short trip .... The importance of that sudden, brief, one night trip is that the alibi didn\u2019t begin to take shape until some time after the return from Windham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The state\u2019s attorney further asserted that the conspiracy was not limited to just the alibi witnesses but also included virtually the entire Skakel family. Thus, he asserted, in closing argument, for example, that \u201cJulie Skakel is the best example of a family support group continuing to this day to do whatever it takes to keep the wraps on [the petitioner].\u201d With respect to David Skakel, the state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cIn tune with the alibi witnesses was younger brother David [Skakel]. Not really any useful information came from him, but I guess he felt a need to do his bit for the family. So he testified that, from a distance of 100 to 150 yards away on a cold night . . . over a hill and beyond the trees, [he] could tell which way [lx\u2019 dog\u2019s] snout was pointing as he was barking . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Apart from the trip to Windham itself, however, and the fact that the petitioner\u2019s principal alibi witnesses were all related to him, the state presented no credible evidence to support its theory of a cover-up. As I previously indicated, evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial established that all of the Skakel children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>who went to Windham were interviewed by police <em>before </em>they had departed for Windham, and the police were told at that time that the petitioner had gone to the house of his cousin, Terrien, on the night of the murder. Indeed, Tommy Skakel was interrogated for hours at police headquarters immediately following the discovery of the victim\u2019s body, the day before he went to Windham. In the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal to this court from his criminal conviction, he claimed that the state\u2019s attorney improperly had argued that the Skakel family had gone to Windham for the purpose of manufacturing an alibi.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 752. We rejected that claim, stating that \u201cthe evidence adduced at trial indicated that, on the day that the victim\u2019s body was discovered, several unidentified persons, whom Littleton described as \u2018suits,\u2019 came to the Skakel residence to help take control of the situation. While they were there, it was decided that Littleton would take the [petitioner], his brothers [Tommy] Skakel and John Skakel [and] their cousin . . . Terrien to the family\u2019s hunting lodge in Windham. The defendant\u2019s father also testified that Littleton would not have had the authority to take his children anywhere without his permission. Accordingly, we conclude[d] that the state\u2019s [attorney\u2019s] argument that Littleton was directed to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the four boys out to Windham on the basis of\u2018[sjomeone seeing the police all over the place\u2019 was not improper because it was founded on reasonable inferences drawn from the testimony of Littleton and the [petitioner\u2019s] father. Moreover, because the only family members to go to Windham were the chief proponents of the [petitioner\u2019s] alibi \u2014 the [petitioner\u2019s] other siblings were left behind \u2014 it also was proper for the state\u2019s attorney to argue that the trip had been arranged for the purpose of placing these crucial witnesses temporarily out of reach of the authorities in order to give them time to prepare a unified account of the events that occurred on the night of the [victim\u2019s] murder.\u201d Id., 754-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Although the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument concerning the allegedly concocted alibi was not so completely lacking in evidentiary support as to be improper, it is abundantly clear that his explanation concerning the manner in which the Skakel family allegedly manufactured the petitioner\u2019s alibi was extremely weak. The following evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial demonstrates how factually attenuated the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s claim actually was. Littleton testified that, on the day the victim\u2019s body was discovered, he left the Skakels\u2019 house in the morning to go to Brunswick School, where he worked as a teacher and a coach. Upon returning to the house in the late afternoon, he encountered what he described to be a scene of \u201cmayhem.\u201d According to Littleton, police cars were all over the street, and several unidentified cars were parked in the Skakels\u2019 driveway. Littleton stated that, when he went inside the house, he was confronted by ten to fifteen men in \u201csuits\u201d in the living room, Who directed him to take the Skakel children to Windham the next morning. On cross-examination, Littleton further stated that the men in suits, whom he believed to be attorneys from Rushton Skakel, Sr.\u2019s, company, Great Lakes Carbon Coiporation, \u201cwere in a great hubbub, talking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>amongst themselves.\u201d Littleton acknowledged that, on previous occasions, he had told investigators that, when he arrived at the Skakels\u2019 house, he was \u201cswept into a vortex\u201d of twenty attorneys who were there to orchestrate a \u201ccover-up.\u201d When defense counsel asked Little-ton whose idea it was to take the Skakel children to Windham, Littleton replied: \u201cWhen I walked into the living room to the . . . twenty suits, we ended up in a discussion. And in that discussion, we discussed the best ways to handle the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The testimony of the other witnesses who were at the Skakels\u2019 house on the afternoon in question indicates that Littleton\u2019s recollection of being swept into a vortex of attorneys bordered on delusional.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Lunney, the officer who interviewed the Skakel children, testified that there were no attorneys at the Skakels\u2019 house while he was there that afternoon or the following day. Julie Skakel testified that, after the victim\u2019s body was discovered, a woman in her neighborhood, who knew that her father, Rushton Skakel, Sr., was away and observed the police going in and out of the Skakels\u2019 house, advised her to call her father\u2019s office to inform them of what was going on. James McKenzie, the president of Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that, in 1975, he was an associate attorney at the company\u2019s New York City office. On the afternoon of October 31,1975, at approximately 3 p.m., he was called into the office of the general counsel and told that \u201cthere had been a murder of a neighbor next to . . . the Skakels and that the family was basically unsupervised as the father was out of town.\u201d McKenzie was asked if \u201c[he] would go up and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>stay with the family until the father arrived.\u201d McKenzie took a train to Greenwich and arrived at the house at approximately 5 p.m. McKenzie stated that the scene he encountered when he arrived \u201cwas chaotic.\u201d According to McKenzie, there were a number of reporters, \u201csome neighbors, [children of] neighbors [and] police and kids running in and out of the house . . . .\u201d When asked what he did first, McKenzie responded: \u201cI asked the press to leave, number one, and tried to bring a little order to the family, asked the kids to be respectful of the situation, and I just tried to keep things a little more under control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In an attempt to bolster Littleton\u2019s testimony, the state\u2019s attorney asked McKenzie whether there were any \u201cmale neighbors or anything of that nature\u201d at the house when he got there. McKenzie responded that there were mostly children and one woman from the neighborhood who \u201cwas trying to maintain control of the situation as well.\u201d When asked whether any of the people were \u201cwearing suits,\u201d McKenzie responded, \u201cI guess a couple members of the press were and certainly the police, but [that was] about it.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney then asked McKenzie whether he and Littleton had \u201cdiscuss [ed] anything about [the] safety of the children, where the children should go . . . .\u201d McKenzie responded that he had no such conversation, although he did recall meeting Littleton, who told him that he was the tutor and that it was his first day on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked McKenzie whether he had been sent to the Skakels\u2019 house to give legal advice to the family. McKenzie responded that he was not a criminal attorney and that his only purpose in going to the Skakels\u2019 residence was to \u201ctry to . . . maintain a little order and wait for the father to return.\u201d McKenzie further stated that, by the time he arrived, the police already had interviewed the Skakel children. Defense counsel asked McKenzie, \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the way, you didn\u2019t take the train with nineteen other Great Lakes Carbon lawyers, did you?\u201d McKenzie responded that he had not, that he was the only attorney at the house and that he had not given any legal advice to anyone the entire time he was there. According to McKenzie, Rushton Skakel, Sr., returned at approximately 9 p.m. that evening. At that time, McKenzie explained to Rushton Skakel, Sr., what he knew about the situation and then went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">It is clear that, at some point after Rushton Skakel, Sr., returned home, he decided that the older boys in the house would go to Windham the next day, a Saturday, and that Littleton would accompany them there. Apart from Littleton\u2019s highly dubious testimony, however, there is no evidence as to how or why the decision was made. Julie Skakel testified that, during that period, her brothers went to Windham almost every weekend in the fall and winter to hunt or ski. Indeed, Littleton himself testified that he had observed nothing unusual on the trip and that he never was asked by anyone in the Skakel family to participate in a cover-up. Certain Greenwich police officers testified that they were given unfettered access to the Skakel children, as well as their home and property, in the hours following the murder, and for several months thereafter, and that the family was fully cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">It may be, as the state argued at trial, that Rushton Skakel, Sr., sent his sons to Windham to get them away from police. It may also be that he sent them there simply to get them out of the house, for, as McKenzie stated, the murder had caused quite an uproar in the neighborhood, and some of the children, including the petitioner, were extremely shaken. I am fully persuaded, however, that the evidence of a cover-up was sufficiently weak, and the strength of the petitioner\u2019s alibi sufficiently strong, that, if a jury were to reconsider the alibi evidence in the context of credible evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>that one or more other persons had the means, motive and opportunity to commit the murder, that jury likely would find the petitioner not guilty of the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Indeed, it bears emphasis that the state was required, at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, to disprove his alibi defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g, <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 631, 543 A.2d 270 (1988) (\u201c[a] defendant asserting an alibi and relying [on] it as a defense is entitled to have the jury charged that the evidence offered by him on that subject is to be considered by [the jury] in connection with all the rest of the evidence in ascertaining whether [the defendant] was present, and that if a reasonable doubt on that point exists, it is the jury\u2019s duty to acquit him\u201d). At the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, the state undertook to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his alibi was constructed on a trip to Windham and orchestrated by the petitioner\u2019s father, that the several young witnesses who gave statements in support of the alibi immediately following the discovery of the victim\u2019s body all lied to the police about the petitioner\u2019s true whereabouts on the night of the murder, that those witnesses continued to lie about that fact for many years thereafter, and that they then perjured themselves as adults when they testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. Evidence to support this scenario, however, is essentially nonexistent. Indeed, it is striking that, despite the notoriety of the case and the relative youth of the petitioner\u2019s alibi witnesses at the time of the murder, all of those witnesses have been unwavering in their testimony, and not a single person ever has come forward with information to suggest that any one of them ever has been untruthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>G</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In sum, the state\u2019s thin case against the petitioner was predicated primarily on statements that he had made while a resident at Elan. At the time these statements were made, both the petitioner and those to whom he made the statements were young, impressionable and, in most if not all cases, emotionally unstable, which may explain why they were enrolled at Elan. The petitioner presented an alibi defense, the credibility of which was challenged by the state on grounds that find only marginal support in the record. Although each of the persons who testified in connection with that alibi defense is related to the petitioner, no evidence ever has been adduced to demonstrate that any one of them was lying. Indeed, it is difficult to see how those alibi witnesses, who were quite young at the time of the victim\u2019s murder, could have concocted a false story immediately after the murder, placing the petitioner twenty minutes away from the crime scene when the victim was murdered, and have stuck to that stoiy, without deviation, for decades. Furthermore, the state acknowledged the existence of at least two other significant potential suspects, including Tommy Skakel, the last person to be seen with the victim and for whom the police had sought an arrest warrant in connection with the victim\u2019s murder, and Littleton, a violent and mentally unstable person whose first night as a resident of the Skakels\u2019 home was marked by the victim\u2019s death. In light of the relatively weak evidence implicating the petitioner in the victim\u2019s murder, as well as the longstanding existence of other suspects and the petitioner\u2019s alibi defense, it is apparent that the newly discovered Bryant evidence \u2014 evidence that the trial court itself concluded was trustworthy because it bore significant indicia of reliability \u2014 is more than \u201csufficiently credible,\u201d when viewed in the context of the state\u2019s case, to give rise to the likelihood that a second jury would find a reasonable doubt about whether the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>murdered the victim.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> In such circumstances, a new trial is required.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">THE RELATIONSHIP OF GARR AND LEVITT AND GARR\u2019S ALLEGED BIAS</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In support of his petition for a new trial, the petitioner also claims that Frank Garr, the state\u2019s lead investigator, and Leonard Levitt, an author, joined in a secret \u201cpact\u201d to write a book about the case, a pact that was motivated by their desire to prove that they were correct in identifying \u2014 and, in Garr\u2019s case, pursuing \u2014 the petitioner as the person who killed the victim. The petitioner claims that this agreement resulted in the 2004 publication of a book, entitled \u201cConviction: Solving the Moxley Murder,\u201d on which Levitt and Garr had collaborated, that reveals Garr\u2019s \u201cparticularly unique bias\u201d against the petitioner and his family. The petitioner further claims that this bias so \u201cundermine[d] Garr\u2019s credibility in his selection, investigation and use of . . . witnesses and . . . dilute [d] the already tenuous probative value ... of the circumstantial evidence\u201d on which the petitioner was convicted that a new trial is warranted. The trial court concluded that the evidence relating to the book deal between Levitt and Garr was not newly discovered and that, in any event, it would not have had a bearing on the outcome of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. I disagree with the trial court that the evidence was not newly discovered. As to whether that evidence would have affected the outcome of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, I need not resolve that issue in view of my determination that the petitioner is entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>new trial on the basis of the newly discovered Bryant evidence. At a minirnurn, however, the evidence of Garr\u2019s bias toward the petitioner and his family bolsters my conclusion that the petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">As the majority has explained, in May, 2001, the petitioner filed a motion for discovery and inspection in his criminal case seeking, inter alia, disclosure of any evidence that any agent of the state had \u201ca pecuniary or other interest in the development and/or outcome of this case, including, but not limited to, any contract, agreement, or on-going negotiations, which relate to the preparation of any book . . . .\u201d The court, <em>Kavanewsky, J., </em>granted the request limited to witnesses called by the state. During the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, defense counsel asked Garr on cross-examination whether he had a book deal. When the state objected on relevancy grounds, defense counsel did not pursue his inquiry concerning a book deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Levitt and Garr both testified at the hearing on the petition for a new trial. Their testimony revealed that they had become friendly in 1995 after Levitt published an article in New York Newsday about the victim\u2019s murder. Following the petitioner\u2019s trial and conviction, Levitt published his book about the case. According to Garr, his own contribution to the book consisted of proofreading drafts to ensure accuracy. For Garr\u2019s assistance with the book, Levitt paid Garr 50 percent of the \u201cnet revenues\u201d from the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Focusing on the petitioner\u2019s claim concerning the existence of a book deal between Levitt and Garr, the trial court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that any such deal or arrangement was newly discovered. In essence, the trial court found that the petitioner had not pursued the issue with due diligence, and, in any event, the two men had no book deal prior to the petitioner\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>trial, and Garr had no expectation of any financial interest in any book that Levitt may have planned to write about the case in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In my view, the trial court viewed the petitioner\u2019s claim too narrowly by limiting its consideration to the issue of the existence of a formal business relationship between Levitt and Garr. As the petitioner notes, the book itself refers to a \u201cpact\u201d that the men made to \u201ctell [their] story.\u201d L. Levitt, Conviction: Solving the Moxley Murder (ReganBooks 2004), p. x. As Levitt testified, he and Garr had entered into this \u201cpact\u201d shortly after the 1998 publication of a book about the victim\u2019s murder by Mark Fuhrman \u2014 a point in time that Levitt candidly described as his and Garr\u2019s \u201clowest ebb\u201d \u2014 because Fuhrman was highly critical of the investigation of the murder by the Greenwich police department. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the petitioner could have learned of the \u201cpact\u201d between Levitt and Garr anytime prior to the publication of the book, which, so far as we know, contained the first public revelation of that agreement. Furthermore, there was no way for the petitioner to have known about Garr\u2019s animosity toward him and his family prior to the publication of the book, which contains comments, directly attributable to Garr, that reflect such feelings. The record clearly establishes, therefore, that the pact between Levitt and Garr to tell their story, and Garr\u2019s alleged bias toward the petitioner as reflected in the book that resulted from that agreement, constitutes newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The petitioner farther contends that this evidence would place the state\u2019s case in a new and disturbing light, thereby warranting a new trial. In fact, the book contains potentially troubling revelations about the exceedingly close relationship between Levitt and Garr \u2014 a relationship that Levitt himself characterizes as \u201cunnatural\u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> \u2014 and about their passionate commitment to establishing that the petitioner was responsible for the victim\u2019s murder. For example, in the introduction to the book, Levitt writes: \u201cPeople say I\u2019m like a dog with my teeth in someone\u2019s ankle when I\u2019m on a story. But pursuing the [victim\u2019s] murder required more than tenacity or even courage. It required stealth, guile, and, most importantly], patience.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u201cI did not solve [the victim\u2019s] murder. What I did was prevent the Skakel family from getting away with it. I was that unexpected force that created enough of a stir to keep the case alive until someone smarter than me appeared and put it all together.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">\u201cNo, that person was not the notorious former Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman, whose claim of solving the murder was trumpeted by the national media. Nor was it the celebrity writer Dominick Dunne, whose claims the media also accepted. Rather, the person who solved the [victim\u2019s] murder was an unheralded local detective named Frank Garr, who pursued his investigation for eleven years and whose work and life became intertwined with mine. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\u201cBoth of us found ourselves underdogs and outcasts and naturally formed a bond. We were an odd couple, a detective and a newspaper reporter. It was like the lion lying down not with a lamb but with a crocodile. Except that as we grew closer, I wasn\u2019t sure which of us was which.\u201d Id., p. xiv.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The book also documents in considerable detail Garr\u2019s hostility toward the petitioner and his family. Levitt writes: \u201c[Garr] also knows the Skakel family. Despite the image of forthrightness and generosity they present to the world, [Garr] says they have no morals or conscience. He calls them habitual liars and says their loyalty is only to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u201c[Garr] has no more regard for their friends, neighbors, and attorneys \u2014 even their family priest.\u201d Id., p. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Levitt later quotes Garr as saying, \u201c T never hid the fact that these people were despicable.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\u201c \u2018Liars. Liars and drunks. They refuse to take responsibility for anything they do. They actually see themselves as victims.\u2019 \u201d Id., p. 163. The factual basis for Garr\u2019s belief that the petitioner\u2019s family members are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>all liars, however, is no more apparent in Levitt\u2019s book than it was in the evidence adduced by the state at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, during which the state argued that the Skakel family had engaged in a decades-long cover-up.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> Furthermore, with respect to the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the judgment of conviction, which was pending in this court when Levitt\u2019s book was published, Levitt writes: \u201cThe Skakels [will] . . . never let it die. They [are] like the forces of evil . . . [who] just kept coming.\u201d Id., p. 285. Levitt concludes by quoting Garr as follows: \u201cFor the Skakels, it is over. They just don\u2019t know it.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\u201cAnd remember this. If I am wrong and their appeal is somehow granted, and even if [the petitioner] gets a new trial, you and I will still be there. We\u2019ll be there to stop them. Sometimes I think that\u2019s what we are meant to do in this world.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Apparently, Garr\u2019s motivation was fueled not only by a deep antipathy toward the petitioner and his family, but also by a desire for recognition that he had been right about the petitioner all along. Thus, Levitt writes that Garr was exceedingly upset by Fuhrman\u2019s book not simply because of its criticism of Garr\u2019s handling of the investigation, but also because Fuhrman claimed to be the first person to suspect that the petitioner had committed the crime. According to Levitt\u2019s book, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Garr proofread for accuracy: \u201c[Garr] was so upset [after reading Fuhrman\u2019s book] he called me. I drove over to his house. While I sat at his kitchen table, [Garr] paced the room. \u2018[Fuhrman] is such a liar.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u201cWith that he flicked on the television. There on . . . one of the network talk shows was Fuhrman. He was crowing over how he\u2019d solved the [victim\u2019s] murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\u201c[Garr] and I turned and looked at each other. I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or scream. [Garr] opened his mouth but no words came. If ever I saw a man crushed, this was it.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201c[Garr had] fought with his superiors for nearly a decade over [his suspicions about the petitioner]. He\u2019d been ostracized by his colleagues and ridiculed by his bosses yet had virtually singled-handedly gotten a grand jury impaneled. And here was Fuhrman, with barely a connection to the case, taking the credit. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">\u201cI wanted to reach over and hug him, or at least touch his arm in commiseration. I didn\u2019t, though. Instead, all I could think to say was . . . \u2018I\u2019m so very sorry.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">\u201cBut I made a promise to myself, and to him. When the case was over, I promised that no matter which way it went, no matter how the grand jury ruled, I would tell the story, his and mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">\u201c[Garr] shook his head. T pray that you do,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I\u2019ll try to help you. But you\u2019re only jerking yourself off. Nobody will listen. Nobody will believe you.\u2019 \u201d Id., pp. 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">I agree with the petitioner that evidence contained in the book would be highly relevant to demonstrate Garr\u2019s strong feelings of antipathy toward the petitioner and his family. The petitioner maintains, and I agree, that \u201c [t]he state presented and relied heavily on a variety of questionable witnesses who offered circumstantial evidence of the petitioner\u2019s guilt,\u201d such as Coleman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the convicted felon and heroin addict.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> At a n\u00fcnimum, the contents of Levitt\u2019s book would tend to undermine Garr\u2019s credibility and judgment in his selection, investigation and use of such witnesses. This is particularly so in light of Garr\u2019s testimony at the hearing on the petition for a new trial that, even though he spoke to Crawford Mills and Neal Walker \u201cseveral times\u201d about Bryant\u2019s allegations, he never once bothered to interview Hasbrouck despite the fact that Garr worked in the same city in which Hasbrouck resided. Finally, if a jury were to be presented with information that an investigator believed that he had been put on earth to thwart any effort on the part of a criminal defendant to demonstrate his innocence, it might well be inclined to view the evidence marshaled by that investigator with a heavy dose of skepticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">As I have indicated, however, in view of my conclusion that the petitioner is entitled to a new trial on the basis of the Bryant evidence alone, I need not determine the extent to which the revelations about Garr\u2019s involvement with Levitt and his intense negative feelings about the petitioner and the petitioner\u2019s family would have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. It suffices to say that, because that evidence raises questions about the objectivity of the state\u2019s investigation of the case, such evidence would make an acquittal at a new trial even more likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">A petition for a new trial is not to be granted lightly, for the state and the public have a strong interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>finality once a criminal defendant has been convicted and that conviction has been affirmed on appeal. There are occasions, however, when the discovery of new evidence following the original trial casts such doubt on the accuracy of a conviction that justice demands a second trial. The present case is such a case. The evidence brought forward by Bryant \u2014 a witness at least as credible as the state\u2019s key witnesses, without any apparent motive to lie, and whose account of the facts has been corroborated in important respects \u2014 is sufficiently compelling to give rise to a reasonable doubt, or even a <em>serious </em>doubt, as to whether the petitioner had any involvement in the victim\u2019s murder. In such circumstances, the legitimate desire for finality cannot trump the petitioner\u2019s right to a new trial. This is especially true in light of the emerging \u201creality of wrongful convictions\u201d; <em>McKithen </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>481 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1179, 128 S. Ct. 1218, 170 L. Ed. 2d 59 (2008); see also <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>548 U.S. 163, 210, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201c[m]ost . . . wrongful convictions . . . [result] from eyewitness misidentification, false confession, and (most frequently) perjury . . . and . . . among all prosecutions homicide cases suffer an unusually high incidence of false conviction . . . probably owing to the combined difficulty of investigating without help from the victim, intense pressure to get convictions in homicide cases, and the corresponding incentive for the guilty to frame the innocent\u201d [citations omitted]); a reality from which this state\u2019s criminal justice system is not immune, as recent events have made all too clear. See, e.g., <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 745, 747-48, 806-807, 700 A.2d 1108 (1997) (habeas court properly granted habeas petition when petitioner, after serving more than ten years of thirty-two year sentence following his conviction on two counts of first degree assault, established by clear and convincing evidence, unavailable at time of trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that he was innocent of those crimes and that no reasonable fact finder would find him guilty of those offenses); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, geographical area number nineteen at Rockville, Docket No. TSR-CV05-4000409S (March 17, 2010) (granting habeas petition filed by Ronald Taylor, who, along with George M. Gould, had been incarcerated for more than sixteen years following their conviction of felony murder, among other crimes, upon finding that both men did not commit crimes of which they had been convicted); <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, geographical area number nineteen at Rockville, Docket No. TSR-CV03-0004219-S (March 17, 2010) (granting Gould\u2019s habeas petition); see also C. Nolan, \u201cFreeing Inmates, Changing Laws,\u201d Conn. L. Trib., August 17, 2009, pp. 1, 9 (more than 240 inmates across country have been exonerated due to DNA evidence, including three in this state, namely, James Tillman, released from prison after serving seventeen years for robbery and sexual assault that he did not commit, Miguel Roman, released after serving approximately nineteen years following his wrongful conviction of murder, and Kenneth Ireland, Jr., released after serving twenty-one years following his exoneration for crimes of sexual assault and murder). In the present case, the trial court misapplied the test adopted by this court in <em>Shabazz </em>for determining whether a new trial is required due to newly discovered evidence. Proper application of that test and the principles of fundamental fairness that underlie it dictate that the petitioner be awarded a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> All references in this opinion to Bryant are to Gitano \u201cTony\u201d Bryant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> Bryant asserted his privilege against self-incrimination following his video-recorded interview, and, therefore, he is not available to testify at any subsequent trial. The trial court concluded, however, that his video-recorded statements would be admissible at a new trial as trustworthy declarations against penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> The trial court did not reach the issue of whether the Bryant evidence also would be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule because of its determination that the evidence would be admissible under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> As I discuss more fully hereinafter, the trial court\u2019s credibility determination is fundamentally flawed for another, closely related, reason, namely, because it is predicated on a finding by the court that Bryant\u2019s statements lack any genuine corroboration. The trial court improperly relied on that finding because it directly contradicts the court\u2019s threshold finding that the statements are <em>significantly </em>corroborated and, therefore, admissible under the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> As I explain in greater detail in part III G 1 of this opinion, it would be improper to impose a more stringent credibility standard because any such standard would run afoul of the principle that the petitioner must demonstrate only that the newly discovered evidence is credible <em>enough </em>\u2014 that is, it is <em>sufficiently </em>worthy of belief \u2014 to give rise to a reasonable doubt concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ing the petitioner\u2019s guilt. This principle has special relevance when, as in the present case, the newly discovered evidence is completely exonerating in nature because, in such circumstances, a second jury would be required to find the petitioner not guilty on the basis of such evidence unless the state is able to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence is not credible. Thus, in the present case, if the Bryant evidence is deemed to be sufficiently credible to give rise to a <em>reasonable possibility </em>that Hasbrouck and Tinsley, rather than the petitioner, murdered the victim, then the petitioner would be entitled to a new trial on the basis of that evidence. Thus, the minimum credibility threshold that comprises the first step of the two step process mandated by <em>Shabazz </em>is satisfied if the newly discovered evidence is not completely lacking in credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b575-11\"> As this court made clear in both <em>Adams </em>and <em>Shabazz, </em>the trial court always must consider the newly discovered evidence in light of the original trial evidence. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 838; <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 827. In other words, the original trial evidence is relevant at both stages of the trial court\u2019s analysis. The evidence adduced at the original trial is relevant to the first step of the analytical process, pursuant to which the trial court must decide whether the newly discovered evidence satisfies a minimum credibility threshold, because the court cannot properly make that determination in a factual vacuum; the facts of the case necessarily will inform the court\u2019s evaluation of the newly discovered evidence. Put differently, the trial court cannot make an informed view of the credibility of newly discovered evidence without knowing at least <em>something </em>about the state\u2019s case against the petitioner as developed at the original trial. Of course, the original trial evidence is critical to the second stage of the analysis because, at that point, the issue is whether the newly discovered evidence is sufficiently credible and of such a nature that it is likely to produce a different outcome, a determination that would be impossible for the trial court to make without consideration of the nature and strength of the evidence presented at the original trial. Hereinafter, all references in this opinion to the trial court\u2019s responsibility to consider the newly discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>evidence in the context of the original trial evidence pertain to the court\u2019s role during the second stage of the analytical process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\"> Although the majority never expressly says so, its affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment necessarily reflects its conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the petitioner\u2019s claim without reaching the second step of the <em>Shabazz </em>analysis, that is, without considering the newly discovered Bryant evidence in light of the original trial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"> As I explain more fully hereinafter; see part III G1 of this opinion; the trial court\u2019s impropriety stems either from a misunderstanding of the <em>Shabazz </em>minimum credibility threshold or from an abuse of discretion in applying that standard, and from that court\u2019s inconsistent factual findings with respect to the degree to which Bryant\u2019s statements are corroborated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\"> Of course, it is possible that, in a given case, a trial court reasonably could find that, although a newly discovered third party statement against penal interest is sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible at a second trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the statement nevertheless is otherwise so unworthy of belief that it fails to meet even the minimum credibility threshold identified by this court in <em>Shabazz, </em>thereby obviating any need for the court to consider the statement in the context of the original trial evidence. For the reasons set forth in part HI G 1 of this opinion, however, this is not such a case because there is nothing in the record that so undermines the reliability or trustworthiness of the Bryant evidence as to warrant the trial court\u2019s failure to consider that evidence in the context of the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s original trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> In <em>Joyce., </em>the Appellate Court also noted that application of this somewhat less stringent standard \u2014 both by this court and other courts of this state \u2014 has been limited to cases of new trial petitions involving homicides and other similarly serious criminal offenses. <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>State\u2019s Attorney, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 203-204; see, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 832 (petition for new trial filed after petitioner\u2019s conviction for aiding and abetting first degree manslaughter); <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 812 (petition for new trial filed after petitioner\u2019s murder conviction). Although I see no persuasive reason for that limitation, the present case, which involves a murder conviction for which the petitioner received a sentence of twenty years to life imprisonment, meets any such requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\"> I recognize that, in most cases, the result of the trial court\u2019s inquiry will be the same under either of the two tests set forth in <em>Shabazz. </em>Nevertheless, in the unusual case in which the court, for whatever reason, is unable or unwilling to find that the newly discovered evidence likely would result in an acquittal but does conclude that a new trial is necessary to avoid an injustice, I see no legitimate basis for denying the petitioner a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The majority, by contrast, rejects this second prong of the <em>Shabazz </em>test, characterizing it as \u201ccontrary to our case law and common sense\u201d and \u201camorphous . . . .\u201d Footnote 42 of the majority opinion. None of these grounds for dismissing the alternative <em>Shabazz </em>standard is supportable. First, I fully agree with the Appellate Court that, far from rejecting the standard, this court expressly has adopted it. <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>State\u2019s Attorney, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 203-204. I also disagree with the majority\u2019s second assertion, namely, that common sense is offended by granting a petition for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence when that evidence so seriously undermines the trial court\u2019s confidence in the verdict that justice requires a second trial. In fact, I reach precisely the opposite conclusion, that is, that common sense <em>compels </em>the conclusion that it would be fundamentally unfair to deprive the petitioner of a new trial in such circumstances. To conclude otherwise overlooks the grave risk that the first trial has resulted in a manifest injustice, namely, a wrongful conviction. Finally, the standard is not amorphous, as the majority claims. In fact, the very same principles that underlie the test are routinely applied by the trial and appellate courts of this state in a wide variety of contexts. See, e.g., <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Showmotion, Inc., </em>292 Conn. 381, 389-90, 973 A.2d 1229 (2009) (applying legislative policy that no writ, pleading or proceeding shall be abated for circumstantial defect when to do so would work injustice); <em>State </em>v. <em>Millan, </em>290 Conn. 816, 831, 966 A.2d 699 (2009) (ruling of trial eourtpermitting introduction of uncharged misconduct evidence will not be disturbed on appeal unless court abused its discretion \u201cor an injustice has occurred\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>290 Conn. 502, 522, 964 A.2d 1186 (to prevail on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must establish that counsel\u2019s deficient performance undermined confidence in verdict), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>558 U.S. 938, 130 S. Ct. 259,175 L. Ed. 2d 242 (2009); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>289 Conn. 437, 463, 958 A.2d 713 (2008) (trial court\u2019s determination that probative value of evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect will be reversed on appeal \u201conly [when] an abuse of discretion is manifest or [when] injustice appears to have been done\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>288 Conn. 646, 657, 954 A.2d 816 (2008) (doctrine of law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>case does not bar second trial judge from overruling first trial judge\u2019s ruling if ruling is clearly erroneous and following ruling would result in manifest injustice); <em>Monti </em>v. <em>Wenkert, </em>287 Conn. 101, 118, 947 A.2d 261 (2008) (trial court may order new trial limited to certain issues if issues are separable, unless doing so would result in serious injustice); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>286 Conn. 17, 26-27 n.6, 942 A.2d 373 (2008) (denial of severance in criminal case will not warrant reversal unless defendant can establish that joinder resulted in substantial injustice); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 717, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006) (state\u2019s failure to disclose evidence favorable to defendant will not result in new trial unless, inter alia, that evidence casts case in such different light as to undermine confidence in verdict); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>278 Conn. 692, 702, 900 A.2d 498 (2006) (trial court must set aside jury verdict when injustice of verdict is manifest); see also Practice Book \u00a7 1-8 (rules of practice shall be liberally construed to avoid injustice); Practice Book \u00a7 60-1 (rules of appellate procedure shall be liberally construed to avoid injustice). I therefore disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that it is appropriate to deny a p etitioner a new trial despite the existence of newly discovered evidence when, in the trial court\u2019s view, that evidence casts such significant doubt on the legitimacy of a conviction that it would be unjust to deny the petitioner an opportunity to produce that evidence at a second trial. For obvious reasons, the unfairness engendered by the majority\u2019s decision is most acute in cases, like the present one, involving convictions for serious crimes, such as murder, that inevitably result in very lengthy prison terms. In sum, the majority\u2019s conclusion, which places finality over fairness, represents an unfortunate jurisprudential step backward, especially in light of the growing awareness of the fallibility of our criminal justice system. See part VI of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> The petitioner also claimed that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of (1) the statements of several witnesses directly contradicting the testimony of Gregory Coleman, a drug addict and key state witness who died of a drug overdose before the petitioner\u2019s trial but who asserted in his testimony at the petitioner\u2019s probable cause hearing, which was admitted at the petitioner\u2019s trial, that the petitioner had confessed to murdering the victim when he and the petitioner were residents at Elan School, a facility for troubled adolescents located in Poland, Maine, in the late 1970s, (2) a composite drawing of a person observed in BeEe Haven on the night the victim was murdered that, the petitioner contends, bears a strong resemblance to Kenneth Littleton, the petitioner\u2019s former tutor and long-time suspect in the murder, who testified for the state under a grant of immunity from prosecution, and (3) poEce suspect profile reports of Littleton and Thomas Skakel, the petitioner\u2019s brother, who previously had been the prime suspect in the case, as weE as certain information concerning Littleton\u2019s actions, including charged and uncharged criminal conduct, before, at the time of, and after the victim\u2019s murder. Although at least some of this evidence Ekely would have been extremely valuable to the petitioner \u2014 especiaEy the testimony contradicting Coleman and, at least potentiaKy, the composite drawing purportedly resembling Littleton \u2014 I generaKy agree with the majority that, for the reasons set forth in its opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding, with respect to the foregoing claims, that the petitioner had faded to satisfy one or more of the prongs of the test for determining whether a new trial is warranted due to the newly discovered evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> The Bryant evidence also includes certain statements by Bryant, some of which were tape recorded.

At the time, Mills owned a business that provided simultaneous interpreting services to various corporate clients, but business had dried up completely after September 11. Bryant asked Mills how he intended to make a living going forward and whether he still acted or wrote screenplays. According to Mills, all of his friends, including Bryant, had known \u201cfor years\u201d that, in the late 1980s, Mills had written a screenplay about Greenwich and the victim\u2019s murder, and that the screenplay was completed in the early 1990s. Bryant told Mills that he might be able to help him with the screenplay because Bryant \u201chad some experience in [the] industry\u201d and had \u201cwritten a couple of things that had made it to the air on television.\u201d Mills stated that he \u201cdusted\u201d the screenplay off and \u201csent [Bryant] a copy of [his] latest version, which was probably about the [twentieth] . . . version . . . .\u201d According to Mills, he wrote the screenplay \u201cto make a statement about the town in which [he] had grown up and used the [victim\u2019s] murder ... as sort of a vehicle to paint that picture . . . .\u201d Although Mills did not identify any of the characters by their real names, the script \u201cpointed the finger [at] a group of people\u201d through the use of \u201ccomposite characters\u201d whom everyone knew to be \u201cthe Skakel brothers, [Thomas Skakel] and [the petitioner], and [Kenneth] Littleton . . . .\u201d Mills further testified that he \u201chad sent [Bryant] the script with the hopes that he would read it and sort of edit it . . . but that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d According to Mills, although Bryant apparently read the script, he offered no assistance. When Mills and Bryant finally spoke about the screenplay a few months later, Bryant told him \u201cthat none of the Skakels could have been involved in [the victim\u2019s] killing\u201d because he had been there and knew that Hasbrouck and Tinsley killed the victim. Mills testified that, at the time of their conversation, the petitioner\u2019s arrest and pending trial had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>much media attention. Mills stated that Bryant understood that Mills would take the information about Hasbrouck and Tinsley to the authorities, but Bryant implored Mills not to identify him as the source of the information. According to Mills, the first thing he did after learning about Hasbrouck and Tinsley was to call his father for advice. After speaking to his father, Mills then \u201ccalled the cops . . . the prosecutor, and . . . the defense attorneys.\u201d Mills stated that he spoke to Bryant several times to update him on how the various authorities had reacted to the information and told him that it was quite clear that he was going to have to come forward himself. According to Mills, Bryant \u201crefused to come forward [at that time] and tried to make [him] understand how important it was to keep his name out of this story. It seemed to [Mills that Bryant] was endeavoring to do the right thing but only to the point where his name was left out of it. \u201d Mills also stated that, once Bryant told him about Hasbrouck and Tinsley, any possibility of working with Bryant on the screenplay \u201cwas over . . . .\u201d Mills further noted that he made some \u201cvery simple\u201d changes to the script to incorporate the information that Bryant had given him about the murder but that he never showed those changes to Bryant. As it turned out, Mills made no further efforts to sell the screenplay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\"> Kennedy participated in approximately ten recorded telephone conversations that were introduced into evidence at the hearing on the petition for a new trial.

Whether a statement satisfies the relevant requirements of a hearsay exception, however, is a determination that is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See id., 218-19.

In fact, Barbara Bryant recalled that, according to her son, both Hasbrouck and Tinsley also were in Belle Haven that night and, in addition, that Hasbrouck and Tinsley had spent the entire night there. The testimony of Barbara Bryant and Dick is particularly significant because it contained Bryant\u2019s contemporaneous account of his whereabouts that night, an account that, because it was given shortly after the murder when Bryant was only fourteen years old, strongly corroborates his statements, made many years later, that he, along with Hasbrouck and Tinsley, had been in Belle Haven on the night of the murder. See part III G 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> I note that the trial court found that Bryant\u2019s, Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s invocation of their privilege against self-incrimination corroborated Bryant\u2019s statements even though the court was not required to draw such an inference. Cf. <em>Rhode </em>v. <em>Milla, </em>287 Conn. 731, 738, 949 A.2d 1227 (2008) (whether nonparty witness\u2019 invocation of privilege against seh-incrimination may be considered by fact finder is determination to be made by trial court, on case-by-case basis, in exercise of court\u2019s sound discretion). Furthermore, as the majority has noted, the state explained in oral argument before this court that it did not seek to grant Bryant immunity from prosecution for the purpose of compelling his testimony because it is not the state\u2019s practice to grant immunity to persons who, in the state\u2019s view, are not telling the truth. Although Hasbrouck and Tinsley also invoked their privilege against self-incriraination, the state elected not to grant them immunity even though it credited the statements that they had made denying any involvement in the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><em> </em>In fact, Bryant had told Kennedy that he was \u201csurprised [that the authorities] didn\u2019t get [his] prints off those clubs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> The state suggests that, because Colucci\u2019s interviews with Hasbrouck and Tinsley were not recorded, and because one of the written interview reports mistakenly failed to reflect certain of Tinsley\u2019s statements, Colucci\u2019s testimony concerning Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s acknowledgment that they were in Belle Haven on October 30, 1975, is not necessarily reliable. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>does not appear to be any dispute, however, that, as Colucci testified, both men changed their story about being in Belle Haven on the day of the victim\u2019s murder after checking their calendars. Because the state does not challenge Colucci\u2019s testimony that the two men subsequently changed their stories, there also can be no dispute that they previously had indicated that they were in Belle Haven on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> Byrne\u2019s brother testified at his deposition that, although he did not live in Belle Haven at the time of the murder, he did not recall seeing Hasbrouck and Tinsley at his parents\u2019 house on the morning after the murder, when he arrived to work in a basement office that he used there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\"> The state suggests that Bryant might have made up his story merely \u201cto get into the act,\u201d perhaps to gain the attention of his former classmates. This theory, like the similar theory hypothesized by the majority; see part III G of this opinion; is highly implausible because it is absolutely clear from the record that Bryant did everything possible to <em>avoid </em>any publicity or attention on account of what he purported to know about the victim\u2019s murder. Indeed, he did not confide in Mills until more than twenty-five years after the murder, following the arrest of a person who, on the basis of Bryant\u2019s knowledge of the facts, is innocent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\"> See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-6 (a) (\u201cThe credibility of a witness may be impeached or supported by evidence of character for truthfulness or untruthfulness in the form of opinion or reputation. Evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been impeached.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> The evidence also indicates that Bryant was a standout athlete in both high school and college.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\"> Of course, I do not vouch for Bryant\u2019s credibility. The state, however, has presented no evidence to establish that Bryant is not an honest or credible person. In the absence of such evidence, and in light of what we do know about him and his background, it would be improper, and entirely unfair to the petitioner, to surmise that Bryant is not a trustworthy person. Undoubtedly for those reasons, neither the state nor the trial court has sought to discredit Bryant on the basis of any aspect of his personal, academic or professional background.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The majority, by contrast, suggests that Bryant may have \u201clied to or misled\u201d his friends, a possibility that the majority also suggests might reflect adversely on the credibility of Bryant\u2019s statements to Mills and Walker. In support of this assertion, the majority relies on the fact that Mills and Walker understood that Bryant was a sports or entertainment lawyer even though Bryant, a law school graduate, was not licensed to practice law. In fact, the evidence indicates that Bryant, who, as I previously noted, comes from a family that truly has distinguished itself in the sports and entertainment world, has written several screenplays and otherwise been involved in the law and entertainment business. Furthermore, there is nothing in Mills\u2019 or Walker\u2019s testimony to suggest that either of them believed that Bryant had misled them in any way. Indeed, the record reflects that, when asked, Bryant did not hesitate to reveal that he was not a member of the bar. In the absence of any evidence to suggest that Bryant intentionally had misled his friends \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 with respect to his professional endeavors, it is improper for the majority to speculate otherwise. This is particularly true in light of the fact that the state has failed to adduce any evidence casting doubt on the veracity of Bryant\u2019s own statements concerning the nature of his professional activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> Indeed, Bryant stated to Kennedy in their first conversation that anyone who had come forward with information in the case \u201chas either become a whacko or a suspect,\u201d and that \u201c[he did not] want to go through that.\u201d Bryant presumably was referring to Gregory Coleman and Kenneth Littleton, two of the state\u2019s key witnesses at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. As I previously noted, Coleman died of a drug overdose before the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, and his probable cause hearing testimony was read to the jury. Littleton, who, for years, was himself a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder, suffered from serious mental problems, including bizarre delusions about himself and the petitioner\u2019s extended family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> The state has not asserted, and I do not believe, that there is any reasonable possibility that Bryant simply is mistaken in his assertions with respect to the incriminatory conduct and statements of Hasbrouck and Tinsley. Although it certainly is possible that Bryant may be confused or that his recollection is faulty with respect to some of the details he recounted, the information that he has provided is not such that he could be confused or mistaken about its essential nature. It would appear, therefore, that, if Bryant is not lying, he is telling the truth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\"> This is equally trae for Hasbrouck and Tinsley. If they were <em>not even in Belle Haven </em>on the night of the murder, it is difficult to understand why they would have invoked their privilege against self-incrimination, especially in view of the fact that someone else already has been convicted of the victim\u2019s murder \u2014 the legitimacy of which remains unquestioned by the prosecuting authorities \u2014 and because of the adverse effect on one\u2019s reputation that such an invocation inevitably has, particularly in a high profile murder case such as this one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> Thomas G. Keegan, the Greenwich detective originally assigned to perform the investigation of the victim\u2019s murder, conducted a review of the crime scene that gives rise to inferences about how the murder was committed that differ in some respects from the conclusions drawn by Henry Lee, formerly the state\u2019s chief criminalist. Only Lee testified at trial as to how the crime likely unfolded. Keegan, however, took meticulous notes, documenting the location and condition of the physical evidence at the crime scene, including obvious paths through the leaves connecting blood and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>other physical evidence, and reached somewhat different conclusions regarding, among other things, where the assault began and the manner in which some of the evidence came to be located in certain areas of the crime scene. As I explain more fully in part IV of this opinion, Keegan\u2019s theory of how the murder occurred is more consistent with an assault carried out by two assailants rather than one, particularly if the lone assailant was someone the size of the petitioner; see footnote 45 of this opinion; because, in Keegan\u2019s view, the killer or killers moved the victim\u2019s body over a considerable distance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"><em> </em>Although one childhood friend described the petitioner as strong and athletic, photographs of the victim and the petitioner taken around the time of the murder reveal that the petitioner, who had just turned fifteen, was no taller than the victim and appeared to have been even smaller. In one such photograph, for example, the petitioner is standing with his freshmen soccer team and, in relation to the other boys on the team, is only of average size. Most of the boys in the photograph, including the petitioner, appear not to have experienced any significant growth spurt. Por the reasons set forth in part IV of this opinion, the petitioner\u2019s size at the time of the murder is relevant to my conclusion that the newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial. Because the defense relied so heavily on the petitioner\u2019s alibi, and because the issue of whether the crime had been committed by one assailant or two was relatively unimportant to the defense as long as the state could point to another member of the Skakel household, such as Thomas Skakel, as the possible second perpetrator, the defense apparently saw no need to challenge any aspect of the state\u2019s reconstruction of the crime. Indeed, the central thesis of the state\u2019s case was that the petitioner\u2019s family had conspired to cover up the crime. Consequently, the defense did not question, among other things, whether someone of the petitioner\u2019s size would have been physically capable of committing the crime alone. Significantly, the Greenwich police department\u2019s original crime scene investigation, the results of which were not introduced into evidence, appears to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the conclusion that the murder was committed by two assailants or, possibly, by a single assailant who was much bigger and stronger than the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\"> See footnote 27 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\"> The concurrence contends that Bryant\u2019s statement to Colucci that he \u201cpicked up one of the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, \u2018swung it,\u2019 and \u2018[slung] it back to where the bag . . . was\u2019 . . . does not constitute a statement against his penal interest\u201d because \u201cBryant does not state that he touched <em>the </em>golf club used in the murder.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The mere fact that Bryant did not know whether the golf club that he handled was, in fact, the club that was used to kill the victim does not mean that his statement was not against his penal interest. First, Bryant\u2019s acknowledgment that he was in possession of what may have been the murder weapon certainly constitutes evidence that \u201cwould tend to incriminate [him] were he . . . the individual charged with the crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 695. Second, Bryant understood that his statement was disserving, and it is that fact that gives the statement significance as a declaration against penal interest. Finally, as the trial corut expressly found, Bryant\u2019s statements concerning his possession of a golf club on the day of the murder, including his statement to Kennedy that he was \u201csurprised\u201d that the authorities \u201cdidn\u2019t get [his] prints off those [golf] clubs,\u201d demonstrate that he knew that the golf clubs would be dusted for fingerprints and reflect his attempt \u201cto explain away possible physical evidence,\u201d thereby \u201cindicat[ing] a consciousness of guilt.\u201d For all of these reasons, it is incorrect to assert that Bryant\u2019s remarks about the golf clubs were not disserving.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The concurrence further contends that Bryant\u2019s statements about handling the golf clubs on the night of the murder cannot reasonably be construed as statements against penal interest because, later in the interview, Bryant \u201cclaimed not even to know how the victim was murdered.\u201d The concurrence takes this statement out of context. Although Bryant apparently never sought to ascertain a detailed account of exactly how the murder was committed, it is perfectly clear that he, like virtually everyone else with any connection to this high profile case, generally was aware that the victim had been beaten to death. In fact, as he explained, he had understood that Hasbrouck and Tinsley intended to abduct and then to \u201cclub\u201d the victim, \u201ccaveman style</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The concurrence also states that, \u201ceven if Bryant knew how the victim was murdered, his statements regarding the Skakels\u2019 golf clubs, when viewed in context, demonstrate that they are insufficiently against his penal interest to be admitted pursuant to Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). Specifically, Bryant stated that <em>\u2018[everybody </em>in Belle Haven touched those clubs,\u2019 and that \u2018those clubs went through <em>tons of people\u2019s hands.' </em>Accordingly, Bryant\u2019s statements no more implicate Bryant in the victim\u2019s murder than \u2018everybody in Belle Haven . . . .\u2019 This is insufficient to qualify as a statement against penal interest, especially in light of the fact that Bryant states that he was not in Belle Haven at the time of the murder.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Once again, this assertion misses the point because the concurrence views Bryant\u2019s statements about the golf clubs in isolation from his other self-inculpatory remarks. Of course, not everyone in Belle Haven handled the golf clubs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the night of the murder, in the vicinity of the victim, accompanied by the two men who, according to Bryant, discussed \u201cgoing caveman\u201d and, shortly thereafter, acknowledged doing so on the victim. When these facts are considered in this context, it is clear that the trial court properly found that Bryant\u2019s comments about the golf clubs were self-inculpatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> The concurrence contends that the trial court\u2019s characterization of Bryant\u2019s statements as \u201cdiscusspng] assaulting [the victim] with Hasbrouck and Tinsley . . . inaccurately and unfairly implies that Bryant made seif-inculpatory statements during those discussions, when, in fact, he did not.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) As a result, according to the concurrence, \u201cthe trial court apparently leaped to the conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements regarding the discussions were against <em>Ms </em>penal interest simply because he was present while Hasbrouck and Tinsley were making statements against <em>their </em>penal interests.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In contrast to the trial court, the concurrence views Bryant\u2019s statements in isolation from what transpired both before and after the conversations in which Hasbrouck and Tinsley expressed their intention to \u201cgo caveman . . . .\u201d Considering Bryant\u2019s presence at those discussions in that broader context, it is evident that the trial court reasonably found that Bryant\u2019s statements concerning those conversations revealed a close and confidential association with Hasbrouck and Tinsley, and that that involvement, when viewed in light of Bryant\u2019s other statements placing him at or near the scene of the crime, in possession of a golf club and in the company of Hasbrouck and Tinsley on the evening of the murder, supported the conclusion that Bryant\u2019s narrative was sufficiently disserving to warrant its admissibility as a statement against penal interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> Indeed, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 691-92, 694-95, this court concluded that the trial court in that case had abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>prohibiting </em>the defendant from introducing into evidence, under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule, statements by the declarant in which the declarant did not acknowledge committing the most serious of the crimes with which the defendant had been charged (sexual assault) but in which the declarant nevertheless acknowledged committing one of the lesser crimes (burglary). In rejecting the state\u2019s contention that that omission rendered the statement insufficiently reliable for admissibility purposes, we explained that, when viewed in the broader context of the facts of the case and the entirety of the declarant\u2019s statements, those statements were sufficiently disserving such that the defendant was <em>entitled </em>to introduce them into evidence. Id., 696-702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> The concurrence asserts that my agreement with the trial court that Bryant\u2019s statements are against his penal interest is founded \u201con an inaccurate and hyperbolic summary of the \u2018context\u2019 of Bryant\u2019s statements.\u201d Footnote 8 of the concurring opinion. On the contrary, my analysis, in contrast to that of the concurrence, is predicated on the facts that the trial court reasonably had found. For example, the trial court expressly found that \u201cone of the reasons [that] Bryant\u2019s testimony is trustworthy is because Bryant places himself in Belle Haven, on the night of the murder, in the company of [the victim], discussing assaulting [the victim] with Hasbrouck and Tinsley and in possession of golf clubs belonging to the Skakel family.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> The concurrence claims that my analysis and the trial court\u2019s analysis are unfaithful to our case law concerning the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest because other cases of this court, including <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 676, involve statements against penal interest that are more inculpatory than Bryant\u2019s statements. The concurrence misconstrues <em>Bryant </em>and our other precedent inteipreting that hearsay exception. It is axiomatic, of course, that each case must be decided on its particular facts, and, for the reasons that I have set forth in this opinion, the trial court in the present case properly concluded that the statements at issue meet <em>all </em>of the requirements for admissibility under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. Indeed, as this court made crystal clear in <em>Bryant, </em>a statement need not constitute a confession or other direct acknowledgment of guilt to be admissible; id., 695; rather, the declarant must be aware that the statement exposes him to a risk of prosecution, such that the statement would have probative value at a trial against him. Id. In light of this standard, the fact that the declarant denies responsibility for the crime is not a bar to admissibility of a statement that otherwise is incriminating for purposes of our test. Thus, for example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredes, </em>supra, 775 N.W.2d 554, the Iowa Supreme Court recently undertook a thorough analysis of its state\u2019s hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. Under the Iowa exception, the test for admissibility is identical to our exception in all material respects. Compare Iowa R. Evid. 5.804 (b) (3) with Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). The court concluded that, although the declarant in that case expressly had denied involvement, in the offense; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredes, </em>supra, 569; the trial court nevertheless had abused its discretion in barring the defendant from introducing the statement under that hearsay exception. See id. In particular, the court determined that other statements made by the declarant were sufficiently incriminating to satisfy the \u201cthreshold adversity requirement . . . .\u201d Id., 565. Explaining that this requirement \u201cposes a question of degree\u201d; id.; the court concluded that the statement at issue was both sufficiently incriminating and sufficiently corroborated that the trial court was required to admit it as a matter of law. See id., 570. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The analysis and conclusion of the Iowa Supreme Court in <em>Paredes </em>is no less applicable to the present case. Moreover, even if it is assumed, arguendo, that the trial court in the present case was not required to reach the conclusion that it did concerning the incriminating nature of Bryant\u2019s statements, it certainly cannot be said that the court\u2019s decision constituted a manifest abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>280 Conn. 36, 50, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006) (\u201c[w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s [evidentiary] ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Finally, the incriminatoiy nature of Bryant\u2019s statements is further evidenced by the fact that Bryant has asserted his privilege against self-mcrimination, thereby opting not to repeat those statements under oath at a deposition or at a trial. Of course, if his sworn testimony regarding those statements was not likely to incriminate him, he would have had no reason for refusing to testify because his sworn testimony denying the truthfulness of his prior statements also would not expose him to any criminal liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> The concurrence also maintains that, even if Bryant\u2019s statements are against his penal interest, they nevertheless fail to satisfy the three trustworthiness factors enumerated in Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). I disagree with this contention for all of the reasons previously set forth in parts ni C and D of this opinion. I note, moreover, that, in reaching its conclusion, the concurrence rejects the reasonable inferences and findings of the trial court and improperly substitutes its different view of the facts. For example, the concurrence asserts that the record does not support the conclusion that Hasbrouck and Tinsley boasted about having committed the victim\u2019s murder. The concurrence argues, rather, that, \u201cBryant explicitly stated that Hasbrouck and Tinsley <em>never </em>confessed to murdering the victim and <em>never </em>disclosed any details about their alleged involvement in her murder. Indeed, Hasbrouck\u2019s and Tinsley\u2019s alleged comments <em>never </em>contained any mention of the victim by name and were always couched in vague terms, such as, T got mine,\u2019 \u2018[w]e did it,\u2019 and \u2018[w]e achieved our fantasy.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Footnote 8 of the concurring opinion. As the record reveals, however, although Bryant stated that Hasbrouck and Tinsley never identified the victim by name, Bryant expressly stated that, \u201cI knew who they were implying. It was so obvious because, I mean, [one or two days after the murder, the news of the victim\u2019s murder] was all over. I mean, it was everywhere.\u201d Bryant further stated, \u201cI knew exactly who they were talking about. . . . They were talking about [the victim].\u201d In view of the facts that (1) Hasbrouck and Tinsley had discussed going \u201ccaveman\u201d on a girl on the evening of the victim\u2019s murder, (2) they told Bryant shortly after the victim\u2019s murder that they had \u201cachieved the caveman,\u201d and (3) the victim was the only person who was assaulted and killed in Greenwich around the time that Hasbrouck and Tinsley had told Bryant that they intended to go \u201ccaveman, \u201d it would have been manifestly <em>unreasonable </em>for the trial court to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>that Bryant had not identified the victim as the person about whom Hasbrouck and Tinsley had been speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The concurrence also improperly second-guesses the trial court\u2019s finding that Bryant\u2019s reluctance to tell his story, and thus his twenty-six year delay in coming forward with it, was reasonable and, under the unique circumstances presented, did not detract from the trustworthiness of Bryant\u2019s statements. In particular, the concurrence attacks the trial court\u2019s finding that Bryant had knowledge that there was no statute of limitations for murder in Connecticut in 1975, asserting that this finding was not supported by the record, and, further, that, even if this finding was supported by the record, it would not make Bryant\u2019s statements any more timely or trustworthy. Bryant explicitly stated, however, that one of the reasons why he did not come forward sooner was because he was afraid that he would be identified immediately as a suspect. Indeed, the fact that the petitioner was tried more than twenty-five years after the victim\u2019s murder, suggests, at the very least, that the <em>state </em>believed that there was no applicable statute of limitations for murder. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s finding that Bryant believed that he, too, could be prosecuted for the murder is hardly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Similarly, the concurrence rejects the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Bryant\u2019s statements to Mills and Colucci are trustworthy because, among other reasons, Mills, whom Bryant has known since childhood, was someone Bryant trusted and with whom he shared a close connection to the case, and because Bryant was aware that his statements to Colucci were being recorded for later use in a court of law. Even though these findings are firmly rooted in the evidence, the concurrence simply refuses to credit them. As the foregoing examples demonstrate, the concurrence refuses to accept the inferences fairly and reasonably drawn by the trial court, relying, instead, on its own contrary conception of the facts. In doing so, the concurrence violates the bedrock principle of appellate jurisprudence that the trial court, not this court, is the finder of fact, and, consequently, we are bound by those findings unless they are clearly erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Key Air, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>294 Conn. 225, 231, 983 A.2d 1 (2009) (\u201c[t]o the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Finally, the concurrence mistakenly asserts that I have \u201cignore[d]\u201d certain facts that the trial court highlighted when it concluded, for purposes of its credibility determination rather than for its determination of admissibility, that Bryant\u2019s statements are \u201cabsent any genuine corroboration.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

In <em>Williamson, </em>the court adopted that approach for purposes of rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence; id.; which is similar but not identical to this state\u2019s hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). As I have explained, in <em>Bryant, </em>this court carefully considered the two competing modes of analysis and, in contrast to <em>Williamson, </em>elected to follow the less restrictive approach pursuant to which the fact finder is permitted to consider both the declarant\u2019s disserving <em>and </em>self-serving statements. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 696-97 and n.18. In accordance with <em>Bryant, </em>the trial court properly proceeded in that manner, and neither the state nor the petitioner has suggested that this court should overrule <em>Bryant </em>and adopt the <em>Williamson </em>methodology. Significantly, although an apparent majority of sister state courts that have considered the issue after <em>Williamson </em>have followed the rule of that case for purposes of their states\u2019 hearsay exceptions for declarations against penal interest \u2014 perhaps, because those states\u2019 exceptions contain language that is identical to the language of their federal counterpart \u2014 other states have declined to do so. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>supra, 966 P.2d 578-79 (declining to follow <em>Williamson); State </em>v. <em>Sonthikoummane, </em>supra, 145 N.H. 320-21 (same); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>264 Kan. 437, 447, 957 P.2d 496 (1998) (noting that <em>Williamson </em>is not binding on state court\u2019s interpretation of its own evidentiary rules); <em>Chandler v.

In any event, the fundamental point is that, in the absence of a request from the parties that we revisit our decision in <em>Bryant, </em>the present case does not present an appropriate opportunity to decide whether the reasoning of <em>Williamson </em>is sufficiently persuasive to warrant overruling the portion of <em>Bryant </em>that is inconsistent with <em>Williamson. </em>Indeed, to do so would violate the well established rule that an appellate court \u201cmay not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>reach out and decide a case before it on a basis that the parties never have raised or briefed. ... To do otherwise would deprive the parties of an opportunity to present arguments regarding those issues.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Sabrowski </em>v. <em>Sabrowski, </em>282 Conn. 556, 560, 923 A.2d 686 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> Despite our long-standing precedent supporting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Bryant evidence would be admissible as trustworthy declarations against penal interest, the concurrence, in defending its contrary view, asserts that \u201ccases in this jurisdiction and various federal jurisdictions have held that statements that were far more inculpatory than Bryant\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>were not sufficiently against the declarant\u2019s penal interest to be admissible.\u201d The concurrence neglects to note, however, that, in each and every one of those cases, the reviewing court concluded that the trial court <em>had not abused its discretion </em>in determining that the statement at issue was not against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Snelgrove, </em>288 Conn. 742, 769-70, 954 A.2d 165 (2008) (reviewing for abuse of discretion); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>61 Conn.

In light of the extremely wide latitude accorded trial courts with respect to the admission of evidence generally and the admission of evidence under hearsay exceptions specifically, it is hardly surprising that the concurrence has found cases in which the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility or inadmissibility of a statement against penal interest has been sustained on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\"> In applying an abuse of discretion standard to determine whether the trial court properly could have determined that Bryant\u2019s statements would be admissible under the residual hearsay exception, I am mindful of this court\u2019s statement in <em>State </em>v.

Id., 219. This admonition in <em>Saucier </em>bears no relevance to the issue in the present case, however, because, even if Bryant\u2019s statements were not admissible under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule, that exception does not expressly bar the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>admission of those statements; if that hearsay exception bars the admission of Bryant\u2019s statements at all, it is because the statements do not meet the requirements of that exception, not because of any express or categorical prohibition against the admissibility of such statements. Accordingly, the issue is whether the trial court reasonably could have concluded that Bryant\u2019s statements would be admissible under the residual hearsay exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> The majority suggests that Bryant might have fabricated a story about Hasbrouck and Tinsley as an outgrowth of his offer to assist Mills in the development of a screenplay regarding the victim\u2019s murder. In essence, the majority raises the specter that Bryant\u2019s desire to become involved in that undertaking was so strong that he lied to Mills about Hasbrouck and Tinsley, and then repeated his imaginary and detailed story, with considerable embellishment, to several others, including the petitioner\u2019s investigator, Colucci. As I discuss in part III G 3 of this opinion, there is nothing in the record to support an inference that Bryant had any particular interest in participating in the screenplay aside from assisting his good friend, Mills. Because the majority\u2019s purely speculative hypothesis has no foundation in the facts, it hardly can be deemed a plausible explanation for why Bryant would falsely and repeatedly report that his two former classmates were responsible for the victim\u2019s brutal and tragic death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b644-6\"> See part III D of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> I note that the commentary to \u00a7 8-9 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that \u201c[\u00a7] 8-9 takes no position on whether a statement that comes close but fails to satisfy a hearsay exception enumerated in the Code nevertheless can be admitted under the residual exception. Connecticut courts have not addressed definitively the \u2018near miss\u2019 problem, although some cases would seem to sanction the practice of applying the residual exception to near misses.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9, commentary. As I have explained, the Bryant evidence falls within the purview of the residual exception to the hearsay rule because it \u201cis supported by equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness and reliability that are essential to other evidence admitted under traditional exceptions <em>to the </em>hearsay rule.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 633. I see no principled reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>why a statement that satisfies that requirement should be excluded from admission under the residual exception solely because it comes close to being admissible under another hearsay exception. Indeed, a contrary conclusion, that is, one that bars admission of a statement that is equivalent in trustworthiness to that of a statement that falls within another exception, might well run afoul of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. See, e.g., <em>State v.

For the reasons set forth in part IV of this opinion, I disagree with the trial court\u2019s characterization of the strength of the state\u2019s case. To the extent that the trial court may have relied on its view that the state\u2019s case was \u201cstrong\u201d in concluding that the Bryant evidence does not warrant a new trial, albeit without expressly stating that it was doing so, any such reliance was, in my view, seriously misplaced and would provide an independent basis for reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> Because the trial court concluded that the Bryant evidence was admissible under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule, I refer to that exception in the following analysis. Because the trial court properly could have found that that evidence was admissible under the residual hearsay exception, however, and because the admissibility of the evidence under that exception requires that evidence to be no less trustworthy and reliable than it would be to be admissible under the exception for declarations against penal interest, the analysis that follows applies to the former as well as to the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> The trial court stated in its memorandum of decision: \u201cThe trier of fact may consider whether a witness is worthy of belief by considering the [witness\u2019] intelligence, motive, state of mind, demeanor and manner while on the stand.

Because the truth of that testimony is unchallenged, the court\u2019s reliance on it also is not subject to challenge. As I discuss more fully in the text of this opinion, for present purposes, the only issue is whether those undisputed facts are legally sufficient to justify the trial court\u2019s failure to consider Bryant\u2019s statements in the context of the original trial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"><em> </em>\"Trustworthy\u201d is defined as \u201cworthy of confidence: dependable . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.

As I have explained, however, in the present case, Bryant did <em>'not </em>testify in court, the trial court made no finding that Bryant\u2019s performance during the video recording rendered him incredible, and the court expressly found that Bryant\u2019s statements bore significant indicia of trustworthiness and reliability. In such circumstances, the court reasonably could not have concluded that the newly discovered evidence was wholly incredible. Consequently, the trial court was required to consider that evidence in light of the original trial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> For Hie reasons set forth hereinafter, even if the trial court properly had considered the corroborating facts and circumstances in connection with its analysis under <em>Shabazz, </em>the other evidence on which the trial court relied or reasonably could have relied in finding that Bryant\u2019s statements did not meet the minimum credibility threshold under <em>Shabazz </em>is inadequate to support that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> The importance of that reliance to the court\u2019s decision is reflected in the court\u2019s repeated reference to the absence of corroboration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> Although the majority acknowledges that the finding of the trial court that Bryant\u2019s statements lack any genuine corroboration \u201cappears to fall short of the standard for admission of a statement against penal interest\u201d; footnote 23 of the majority opinion; the majority states that it \u201cneed not examine . . . the court\u2019s admissibility determination\u201d because of the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court properly determined \u201cthat the petitioner had failed to persuade it that Bryant\u2019s statements] probably would result in a different verdict at a new trial. . . .\u201d Id. The majority\u2019s attempt to avoid the problem created by the trial court\u2019s inconsistent findings is unavailing. To the extent that the trial court\u2019s finding that Bryant\u2019s statements are <em>uncorroborated </em>is a proper one, as the majority has determined, it <em>necessarily </em>follows that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that those statements are trustworthy and, therefore, that they would be admissible, because, as I have explained, under settled law, only trustworthy third party statements against penal interest are admissible, and only those statements that are significantly corroborated may be deemed trustworthy. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 319; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 700. Thus, the majority\u2019s endorsement of the trial court\u2019s finding that the statements lack corroboration leads inexorably to the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Bryant\u2019s statements were sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible. For whatever reason, the majority elects not to acknowledge that unavoidable fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> As I previously indicated, Bryant stated in Ms video-recorded interview with Colucci that Hasbrouck first may have seen the victim at an annual street festival m Greenwich. According to Neal Walker, the festival was attended by the whole town. An article in a Greenwich newspaper that was published in September, 1975, stated that \u201cmore than 12,000 residents took part in the fourth annual Block Party.\u201d B. Young, \u201cBlock Party Proves Massive Success,\u201d Greenwich Time, September 22, 1975, p. 1. The other two events that Bryant claims Hasbrouck and Tinsley attended and that the victim also attended were two local dances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\"> Bryant is referring to the fact that, after the petitioner\u2019s arrest, he had authorized Mills and Crawford to convey to the police the information about Hasbrouck and Tinsley that Bryant himself already had provided to Mills and Crawford. Garr, the state\u2019s lead investigator, testified that, although he had, in fact, been given that information in advance of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, he never followed up on it. Indeed, although Mills honored Bryant\u2019s request not to reveal his name to the prosecuting authorities and to the defense, Mills did tell the prosecuting authorities, but apparently not the defense, that Bryant was African-American. Because only one other African-American attended Brunswick School with Bryant and because there were no more than fifty students in Bryant\u2019s class, it would have been extremely easy for the state to have ascertained Bryant\u2019s identity and then to have interviewed him prior to the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. For whatever reason, however, the state elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\"> It is also noteworthy that, in his video-recorded interview with Colucci, Bryant candidly acknowledged that he \u201c [does not] like\u201d the petitioner. Bryant explained, however, that, \u201cjust because I don\u2019t like him doesn\u2019t mean he should be incarcerated\u201d for a crime he did not commit. In a tape-recorded telephone conversation with Kennedy, Bryant alluded to one of the possible reasons why he and the petitioner did not get along, suggesting that it may have been an issue of race. Bryant states: \u201c[The petitioner] is innocent. . . . I am not a very loving or caring person, but I feel very bad for [the petitioner\u2019s] situation because I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody. . . . And he is not my enemy. I don\u2019t dislike [the petitioner], you have to understand that. It was kind of a difficult situation, being the only black kid living in Greenwich for a couple years. So I, you can imagine, it wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, but it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> Although there are many examples of witnesses with similar memory problems, one such witness is Jacqueline Wetenhall, who was one of the victim\u2019s closest friends and was with the victim for much of the evening on the night of the murder. At the hearing on the petition for a new trial, Wetenhall testified for the state that she had no recollection of seeing Bryant that night or of ever having met Hasbrouck or Tinsley. When asked whether she recalled being at the Greenwich street festival where Bryant claims Hasbrouck saw the victim for the first time, Wetenhall responded that she had no memory of having attended the event. A copy of the victim\u2019s diary, however, reveals that the victim wrote about attending the event with Wetenhall, recounting that she and Wetenhall walked home after the festival and that she then slept at Wetenhall\u2019s house. Of course, if Wetenhall cannot remember attending the event herself, she hardly can be expected to remember others who attended. Another person who suffered a lapse of memory is Dorothy Moxley, the victim\u2019s mother, who testified at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that she could not recall whether she had heard dogs barking on the night of the victim\u2019s murder even though she told police on the day following the murder that she had heard such barking, and notwithstanding that the time of the barking had played a very significant part in determining the time of the victim\u2019s death. Dorothy Moxley also could not remember what time she expected her daughter home on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">I note that the state, in closing argument during the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, focused on the inability of some members of the petitioner\u2019s family to remember similar details about the night of the murder as evidence of their deceit. Specifically, the state argued that it simply was unbelievable that they would not remember such details about the night in light of the shocking and painful nature of the crime that occurred at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"76\">\n<p id=\"b664-5\"> The majority states that Bryant, Hasbrouck and Tinsley \u201cdid not look like the average fourteen or fifteen year olds who would have blended into the crowd, particularly not in an area that was described by one witness as \u2018a fairly lily-white community.\u2019 \u201d The witness to whom the majority refers, however, namely, Morganti, was working in Belle Haven for the first time on the night of the murder, and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that he had sufficient familiarity with that community or its residents to be able to assess reliably the extent to which a person\u2019s race or nationality would make him or her more recognizable, particularly on mischief night, when those outside were dressed for the cold weather and seeking to ensure that they would not be apprehended for their pranks. More importantly, as Morganti himself repeatedly acknowledged in his testimony, <em>it simply was too dark to see anyone that night, </em>irrespective of skin color. We know, moreover, that at least one African-American family lived in Belle Haven with their teenaged child next door to the Skakels at the time of the murder and that Bryant, who also is African-American, regularly visited the neighborhood during the three years preceding the murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b665-5\"> In an interview with Ix conducted shortly after the murder, the police asked her whether she had seen which way Byrne went after he left her. Ix responded that she had not observed which way Byrne went.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\"> Several hours after the victim\u2019s body was discovered, Detective Theodore J. Brosko of the Greenwich police department interviewed Ix, who related that she and the victim \u201cleft the Mouakad residence and while in [the] process of walking on Otter Rock Drive to the [Skakels\u2019] [residence, they met [Byrne] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201c[T]he three of them then walked to the [Skakels\u2019] residence arriving at about 9:10 p.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">When Byrne was interviewed the next day by a different detective, however, he indicated that he, too, had been at the Mouakad residence with Ix and the victim until about 9:10 p.m. In another interview one day later, however, Byrne told a different story to yet a different detective, namely, that he was the person that Willie Jones, the husband of the Skakels\u2019 cook, saw \u201cdart\u201d in front of Jones\u2019 car at approximately 9:05 p.m. as Jones was pulling out of his driveway on Walsh Lane. Byrne\u2019s statements, at least as memorialized by the police, conflict insofar as he places himself at two different locations at or around the same time. Unlike Byrne, however, Ix was very clear and consistent in her statements to the police that Byrne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>had left her early in the evening and met up with her and the victim again in the street about two hours later as the victim and lx were walking to the Skakels\u2019 residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> I note that, in 2003, Kennedy telephoned Byrne\u2019s sister, Daryl Fleuren, in an attempt to verify the information that Bryant had given Kennedy concerning Byrne. Fleuren told Kennedy that she did not know much about the murder \u201cbecause [she] was married and out of the house by then and [she and her family] weren\u2019t allowed to talk about it.\u201d She remembered being told by her parents that her father was on the front porch when Byrne returned home at 9:30 p.m. on the night of the murder, and that her mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>had seen Byrne in bed at around 10 p.m. This information, however, based as it is on Fleuren\u2019s recollection of what she had been told by others about events that had occurred nearly thirty yeans earlier, is suspect because there is nothing else in the record even to indicate that Byrne\u2019s parents were home that night. Indeed, Byrne\u2019s parents were never interviewed by the police, and Byrne\u2019s older brother, rather than Byrne\u2019s parents, accompanied Byrne when he was interviewed by the police immediately after the murder. Fleuren also checked with her mother to see if she had any recollection of Bryant, Hasbrouck or Tinsley, and Fleuren reported back to Kennedy that her mother never had met or seen the three boys and, further, that \u201c[Byrne] never had any black friends.\u201d This latter observation, however, is belied by the fact that both Hasbrouck and Tinsley acknowledged that they and Bryant had socialized with Byrne when they went to Greenwich, and both Tinsley and Bryant recalled that they had been to Byrne\u2019s home on several occasions. See part III D of this opinion. Indeed, one of Bryant\u2019s best friends, namely, Walker, lived directly across the street from Byrne, and both Bryant and Walker explained that they and Byrne socialized together often.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Although there is no indication that the trial court relied on or even credited Fleuren\u2019s second-hand account of her deceased brother\u2019s activities, and notwithstanding that Fleuren\u2019s statements to Kennedy regarding her parents\u2019 alleged memories likely would be inadmissible at a new trial, the majority places great weight on those statements, asserting that they support the trial court\u2019s credibility determination because they contradict \u201cBryant\u2019s account of the location of the principal parties to the events of that evening.\u201d Specifically, the majority states: \u201cSignificantly, Byrne\u2019s sister [Fleuren] stated in a tape-recorded interview that [her] father had been on the porch when Byrne came home at 9:SO p.m., and that [her] mother had told her that she had seen Byrne <em>in his bed at 10 p.m. that night. </em>Thus, at the very point in time when the petitioner claims the victim was murdered, a murder to which Bryant claims Byrne bore witness, Byrne\u2019s mother saw him in his bed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) As I previously indicated, however, in the thousands of pages of police notes and interview transcripts entered into evidence at the hearing on the petition for a new trial, there is no indication that Byrne\u2019s parents were home on the night of the murder, and there also is no indication that they were interviewed by the police regarding Byrne\u2019s whereabouts that night. In contrast, police records indicate that virtually all of the other parents living in the vicinity of the murder were interviewed by the police, along with their children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\"> At her deposition, Barbara Bryant stated that Udvardy and Harkness initially had \u201caccosted\u201d her, \u201c[s]cared the hell out of [her]\u201d and that she was \u201cfull of [prescription] drugs\u201d when they conducted their unannounced interview. Udvardy and Harkness testified, however, that they introduced themselves to Barbara Bryant before proceeding and informed her that it was a voluntary interview and that she could walk away at any time. One of the investigators, Udvardy, testified that, in his opinion, Barbara Bryant appeared \u201cmore vague\u201d and \u201cout of it\u201d during the video-recorded deposition than when he encountered her on the street. Moreover, Barbara Bryant conceded at her deposition that, when she met with Udvardy and Harkness, she voluntarily had given them her telephone number in the event that they had any additional questions to ask her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"81\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> The majority attempts to minimize the significance of Barbara Bryant\u2019s statements to Udvardy and Harkness, emphasizing that, in her deposition, she gave an account of her son\u2019s whereabouts on the night of the murder and of other surrounding events that was different from the one that she had given to Udvardy and Harkness. See footnote 35 of the majority opinion. The majority also underscores that Barbara Bryant claimed in her deposition to have been heavily medicated when Udvardy and Harkness approached her. Id. The fact remains, however, that Barbara Bryant consistently has acknowledged, first to Udvardy and Harkness, and subsequently in her deposition testimony, that Bryant was in Belle Haven on the day of the murder; she simply changed the time that she claims that he returned home. It is noteworthy that she changed her story in this regard only after Bryant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>had asserted his privilege against self-incrimination at his own deposition. In light of all the relevant facts and circumstances, including Barbara Bryant\u2019s own statements and deposition testimony, it is clear both that she disapproved of her son\u2019s willingness to come forward with information about the victim\u2019s murder and that she wished to downplay any possible involvement that he may have had with respect to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"82\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> As further reason for discrediting Bryant, the trial court also notes that \u201c[mjissing from Bryant\u2019s statement is anything concerning the breaking of the [golf] club or the stabbing of the victim.\u201d On the contrary, it is clear from Bryant\u2019s statements that he knew that the victim had been beaten and stabbed to death by one or more golf clubs; in fact, the trial court observed that Bryant\u2019s explanation that he had been in possession of golf clubs belonging to the Skakel family on the night of the murder \u201cindicate[s] a consciousness of guilt\u201d that reflects Bryant\u2019s \u201c[e]fforts to explain away the possibility that his fingerprints might be found on the murder weapon or another golf club nearby.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"83\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> Although the trial court expressly identified the evidence that it had relied on in rejecting the petitioner\u2019s claim without considering Bryant\u2019s statements in the context of the original trial evidence, the majority identifies certain other evidence on which, the majority asserts, the trial court reasonably could have relied to support that conclusion. None of that additional evidence, however, renders Bryant\u2019s statements materially less rehable or trustworthy than the evidence on which the trial court did rely, and, moreover, some of the evidence to which the majority refers simply has no bearing on Bryant\u2019s credibility. For example, the majority makes much of Bryant\u2019s statement that, on the day of the victim\u2019s murder, he, Hasbrouck and Tinsley had \u201cpicked up\u201d golf clubs at the Skakels\u2019 residence. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The <em>majority then </em>asserts that, according to Bryant, he had obtained those golf clubs from the Skakels\u2019 yard, even though other testimony indicates that no golf clubs were seen lying around the yard that day. Although it is undisputed that golf clubs frequently were left outside the Skakels\u2019 home, a careful review of Bryant\u2019s statement indicates that he obtained the golf clubs from somewhere on the Skakels\u2019 property, perhaps from inside the back porch, where they generally were located. In any event, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, there is nothing in that portion of Bryant\u2019s statement in which he speaks about the golf clubs \u2014 a portion of Bryant\u2019s statement that the trial court expressly concluded was <em>supported </em>by corroborative evidence \u2014 that in any way contradicts the statements of others that no golf dubs were known to be lying around the Skakels\u2019 property on the day of the murder. In fact, Bryant\u2019s testimony is consistent with the findings of police investigators that the Skakel family owned numerous sets of golf clubs that were stored in different locations in their house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"84\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\"> As I previously noted, a trial court\u2019s evaluation of the strength of the evidence adduced at the petitioner\u2019s original trial is not entitled to deference when, as in the present case, the trial court did not preside over that original trial, because, in such circumstances, this court is no less able to perform that function, which entails a review of the record of the original trial. Because our review of the strength of the state\u2019s case is de novo, we are not hampered in our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claim by the fact that the trial court failed to undertake that review. Indeed, to the extent that the trial court did engage in such areview, I believe that its conclusory characterization of the state\u2019s case as \u201cstrong\u201d is not supported by the original trial record. See footnote 60 of this opinion. Furthermore, although the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>adduced certain testimony relating to the petitioner\u2019s claim concerning the newly discovered Bryant evidence, that testimony is unchallenged and, therefore, did not give rise to any credibility findings by the trial court. See footnote 63 of this opinion. Consequently, there is no impediment to resolving this second and final prong of the <em>Shabazz </em>test at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"> hi addition, in that original appeal, this court rejected all of the petitioner\u2019s claims of impropriety which, if meritorious, would have required us to engage in harmless error analysis. Of course, that analysis, if necessary, would have required us to consider the strength of the state\u2019s evidence against the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"86\">\n<p id=\"b675-10\"> The evidence also was tainted by more than twenty years of sensationalistic media coverage, which included two true crime books, a novel and a television mini-series in which the petitioner\u2019s family was vilified as utterly lacking in moral conscience. The theme of a family cover-up was pounded by the prosecution at trial but supported only by the very questionable testimony of Kenneth Littleton, whose long-standing mental illness and delusional thought patterns caused him to believe that the Skakel family had tried to kill him and that he himself was a member of the Kennedy family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"87\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> James Terrien now uses the name James Dowdle.

There also was evidence that the victim and Tommy Skakel had developed a crush on each other.

Blood and bloodstained pieces of a broken golf club were found on the lawn within the horseshoe driveway. The state maintained at trial that no aspect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>assault against the victim had occurred in this area. Thomas G. Keegan, the detective in charge of the original investigation, concluded, however, that the assault <em>began </em>in this area, and that the victim was then dragged or carried approximately 100 feet to a more secluded area west of the driveway, in the opposite direction from the house, where she was beaten to death. The victim apparently then was dragged another seventy-eight feet to a large pine tree, under which her body ultimately was found. Keegan\u2019s reconstruction of the crime is significant insofar as it posits that the victim was dragged or carried over a much larger area and, as I explain hereinafter, raises the question, which neither party posed or addressed at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, as to whether someone of the petitioner\u2019s slight stature would have been capable of dragging or carrying the victim the distance that Keegan believed that she had been moved. There can be no doubt, however, that two teenagers the size of Hasbrouck and Tinsley easily could have done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"94\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> A photograph of the rather large compression just off the road along the Moxleys\u2019 driveway was admitted into evidence at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial and at the hearing on the petition for a new trial. The grass appears to have been flattened either by a body or perhaps by two persons kneeling or standing side by side. On the basis of its appearance, it is perfectly plausible that the compression was made by a person or persons lying in wait for the victim as she made her way across the street from the Skakels\u2019 yard, or even by the victim herself if she had been forced to the ground in that location by her assailant or assailants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> The police determined that golf clubs routinely were left scattered about the Skakels\u2019 property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\"> Lee testified that his reconstruction was based on photographs of the crime scene, police reports, the autopsy report and any evidence that was collected at the crime scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"97\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> Keegan was called by the state to lay a foundation for the various crime scene photographs that were admitted into evidence, but he was not questioned by either party about the conclusions that he had drawn regarding the manner in which the murder had been committed, which had been based on his own observations and collection of evidence from the crime scene itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"98\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> Lee also posited, however, in the alternative, that the blood on the driveway could have been deposited there by the victim if the assault had been initiated at that location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"99\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> The petitioner presumably did not challenge the state\u2019s reconstruction or otherwise suggest the possibility that the murder had been committed by two people rather than by a lone assailant because his alibi defense was not dependent on either theory. Indeed, even if the petitioner had asserted that the evidence indicated that two people were involved in the murder, the state likely would have maintained that, notwithstanding any such claim, the evidence still pointed to the petitioner as one of those people. The Bryant evidence, however, places Keegan\u2019s testimony in an important new light because it supports the third party culpability defense, predicated on the newly discovered Bryant evidence, that the victim was murdered by Hasbrouck and Tinsley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"100\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> Gravel embedded in the victim\u2019s face led both Carver and Lee to conclude that, at some point, the victim\u2019s nose had come into contact with the surface of a driveway or roadway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"101\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> Several of the state\u2019s key witnesses, including Gregory Coleman, Elizabeth Arnold and Shakespeare, testified that they had read Fuhrman\u2019s book or seen television shows about the book prior to testifying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"102\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> According to Coleman, three former Elan residents likely were present when the petitioner allegedly made his incriminating statements to Coleman. Each of those former residents testified at the hearing on the petition for a new trial, however, that they never had heard the petitioner confess to the murder. In fact, one such witness, Clifford Grubin, recalled that Coleman once had bragged about being \u201ca very good liar.\u201d Another witness, John Simpson, remembered the incident in question and recalled that Coleman had turned to him while he and Coleman were guarding the petitioner and said that the petitioner \u201cjust admitted that he killed this girl.\u201d Simpson testified that he had not heard the petitioner make any such confession, and, therefore, he immediately asked the petitioner whether he had confessed to Coleman. The petitioner, according to Simpson, denied having done so. Simpson then turned to Coleman and said, \u201c[the petitioner] just said that he didn\u2019t say that he killed [the] girl,\u201d to which Coleman replied, \u201c[w]ell, he didn\u2019t answer yes or no, but he gave one of those . . . shit-eating grin[s].\u201d According to Simpson, Coleman also stated, \u201c[w]ell, it was his reaction, the fact that he didn\u2019t say no.\u201d The trial court in the present case concluded that the testimony of the three former Elan residents was not newly discovered because, in the exercise of due diligence, the defense could have located the witnesses prior to the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. I agree with the conclusion of the trial court in this regard, but I underscore that the testimony of those witnesses would be extremely important if the petitioner were to receive a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"103\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> One witness described the nature of a general meeting at Elan as follows: \u201c \u2018[A] general meeting was probably the scariest word that you would hear when you were at Elan.\u2019 A typical general meeting, which was attended by 100 or more Elan residents and staff, focused on one or two residents who were singled out for violating Elan rules. . . .

According to Seigen, the [petitioner] sometimes responded to such probing with annoyance. On other occasions, however, the [petitioner] became very upset, cried and stated that he did not know if he had done it. The [petitioner] also stated in these group sessions that, on the night of the victim\u2019s murder, he was \u2018blind drunk\u2019 and \u2018stumbling.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 647.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"106\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\"> Petersen testified that, in Higgins\u2019 capacity as the petitioner\u2019s \u201coverseer,\u201d Higgins regularly tormented the petitioner and, in Petersen\u2019s opinion, would have been the last person in the world in whom the petitioner would have confided. Petersen also explained that Elan\u2019s \u201cprotocol\u201d was predicated on a system of rewards and privileges such that students were rewarded for turning one another in for the smallest of offenses, such as not making a bed properly, as well as for more serious infractions, such as having sexual relations. According to Petersen, if Higgins actually had heard the petitioner make any sort of admission, he would have told Ricci about it because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>would have improved his status tremendously and yielded significant rewards for him, as it would have for any Elan resident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"107\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"> I note that another former Elan student, Dorothy Rogers, testified that the petitioner had told her that his family had sent him to Elan because they were afraid that he might have killed the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"108\">\n<p id=\"b699-10\"> As I have noted, Coleman\u2019s credibility would be further undermined at a new trial because of the three witnesses identified by the petitioner following his conviction whose testimony directly contradicts Coleman\u2019s assertion that the petitioner had confessed to him. See footnote 102 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"109\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> Police records indicate that Ricci did, indeed, get the information from the Greenwich police. See footnote 111 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"110\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> In fact, this was not true. The petitioner had been sent to Elan as part of a plea agreement in New York arising out of a serious drunken driving incident there. See footnote 111 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"111\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> Although, it does not factor into my conclusion that a new trial is required, I note that evidence presented at the hearing on the petition for a new trial reveals that, contrary to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial that the Greenwich police did not tell Ricci about the murder, the Greenwich police were, in fact, in contact with Elan during the petitioner\u2019s stay there. Moreover, the police were aware that the petitioner had been sent to Elan as part of a plea agreement arising out of an incident in Windham, New York, in which the petitioner had been arrested for operating his vehicle while under the influence. A suspect profile of the petitioner that Garr, the state\u2019s lead investigator, prepared in the 1990s, indicates that James Scarey, the chief of police in Windham, contacted the Greenwich police in April, 1978, and informed them that the petitioner had pleaded guilty to a number of charges stemming from his arrest in March, 1978. According to the suspect profile, the petitioner had driven at high speeds, attempted to evade police and crashed his vehicle into a telephone pole. Scarey told the Greenwich police that the petitioner had pleaded guilty to all of the charges except the charge of driving while under the influence and that, after the plea hearing, \u201can airplane arrived at the local airport, occupied by two . . . attendants . . . and a doctor, at which time [the petitioner] was handcuffed and taken to a hospital in . . . Maine. . . . Scarey reported that he was very familiar with the Skakel family and that recently [the petitioner] had been causing numerous problems for his family.\u201d In May, 1978, the Greenwich police learned that the petitioner was residing at Elan. According to the suspect profile, \u201c[djuring this phase of the investigation [the petitioner\u2019s attorney] Thomas Sheridan became aware of inquiries [that the Greenwich police had] made at Elan, and . . . subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>quently . . . contact[ed] . . . the . . . department.\u201d Sheridan informed the police at that time that the petitioner was making some progress at Elan, that he was going to be there for ten months, and that Sheridan feared that the petitioner would suffer a relapse if he was interviewed at that time. Police records further indicate that, \u201c[o]n November 15, 1978, information was received that [the petitioner] had escaped from Elan. He had left by himself, and had not been adjusting to the facility.\u201d On November 16,1978, the petitioner\u2019s father informed the police that the petitioner had been located and returned to Elan by his older brother, Rushton Skakel, Jr. In short, notwithstanding the state\u2019s argument to the contrary, it appears that the Greenwich police were given regular updates about the petitioner\u2019s placement and progress at Elan, that they were fully informed of the reason why he had been sent there and that they had attempted to arrange an interview with him while he was a resident at Elan. Thus, there was very little or no factual basis for the argument of the state\u2019s attorney that Ricci could not have learned about the murder from the Greenwich police, or that there was no other explanation for the petitioner\u2019s presence at Elan except that his family must have believed that he had killed the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"112\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> The state\u2019s attorney further articulated the state\u2019s theory to the jury as follows: \u201cLooking at the evidence, the beating started again in the driveway. [The victim\u2019s] pants certainly weren\u2019t below her knees at that point because she couldn\u2019t have gotten five feet, let alone a near fifty feet, to get over toward that bloody major assault scene. And, of course, it only took one good swing over at the bloody major assault scene to render her permanently beyond help.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">\u201cThis, as you review the evidence, is where the absolutely weird masturbation story acquires significance. It\u2019s incorrect to say this is not a forensic case. It is a forensic case, not for the forensic evidence that was produced but, rather, for the forensic evidence that wasn\u2019t produced . . . .\u201d The state\u2019s attorney also suggested that the petitioner must have pulled the victim\u2019s pants down after he killed her and masturbated and ejaculated on her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"113\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> Specifically, the petitioner maintained on direct appeal from his criminal conviction that, \u201cwithout a shred of evidence to support it, the state fabricated an elaborate story about a Skakel family \u2018conspiracy\u2019 to falsify evidence that would supply an alibi for [the petitioner]. This devastating \u2018cover-up\u2019 theme not only conveyed a familial verdict of guilt, it also gutted the credibility of all alibi witnesses in one argumentative thrust, and appealed to the jury\u2019s sense of outrage that a wealthy family thought it was able to trick the police by concocting a false alibi. The state\u2019s conduct was grossly egregious because it was deliberate and false.\u201d The petitioner further contended that \u201c[t]his story of a family \u2018alibi\u2019 conspiracy has no evidentiary support; in fact, the evidence was all to the contrary.\u201d In support of this contention, the petitioner referred to Julie Skakel\u2019s testimony that her brothers were interviewed by police before the trip to Windham, and to the testimony of the Greenwich police officers that the Skakel family was fully cooperative with the investigation from the moment the police arrived at the scene on October 31, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"114\">\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> As I noted previously, Littleton was known to have suffered from such delusional thinking. Indeed, on cross-examination, Littleton acknowledged that he once told the police, after an arrest in Florida, that he was \u201cKenny Kennedy, a black sheep of the Kennedy family,\u201d and that he previously had told a friend that the Skakel and Kennedy families were trying to \u201cblow [his] heart out with an intravenous dosage of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"115\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> The majority asserts that my analysis is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d that I advocate what the majority characterizes as essentially de novo review of the trial court\u2019s findings, and that I view the evidence \u201cin the light least favorable\u201d to sustaining the trial court\u2019s decision. Footnote 25 of the majority opinion. These contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">My analysis is not predicated on a de novo review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings. With respect to the threshold issue of the admissibility of Bryant\u2019s statements, I conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in concluding that those statements are admissible as trustworthy statements against penal interest. With respect to the trial court\u2019s failure to consider those statements in the context of the original trial evidence, the court did not elaborate on its rationale for not doing so, stating only that the statements, while admissible, are not credible. For the reasons that I previously have set forth in this opinion, I believe that the trial court was required to conduct such a review because, under the particular circumstances of the present case, <em>Shabazz, </em>if properly applied, requires that review. I cannot discern from the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, however, whether the court failed to consider Bryant\u2019s statements in light of the original trial evidence because the court did not give due consideration to the fact that the first prong of the <em>Shabazz </em>test erects a truly <em>minirrial </em>credibility hurdle or, instead, because the court\u2019s fact-based finding that the petitioner had not met that low credibility threshold was unreasonable. If the court\u2019s decision to reject the petitioner\u2019s claim without proceeding to the second prong of the <em>Shabazz </em>test was predicated on a misunderstanding of the petitioner\u2019s minimal burden under the first prong of <em>Shabazz, </em>then the court\u2019s decision is the product of an error of law. Indeed, that may well be the case in view of the fact that the majority itself does not agree with my conclusion that the first prong of <em>Shabazz </em>is satisfied unless the court reasonably finds that the newly discovered evidence lacks all credibility. If, however, the court\u2019s decision not to consider Bryant\u2019s statements in the context of the original trial evidence was based on the conclusion that, as a factual matter, those statements were so utterly lacking in credibility that it was unnecessary to engage in such a review, then, in my view, the court\u2019s finding constituted an abuse of discretion. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, I do not engage in a de novo review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Furthermore, contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, there is nothing in this opinion to support the conclusion that I view the evidence in the light least favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s decision. To the extent that the impropriety of the trial court\u2019s decision, in particular, its decision to reject the petitioner\u2019s claim under the first prong of <em>Shabazz, </em>is the product of unreasonable fact finding, rather than a misunderstanding of the minimum credibility threshold, I have explained why I reach that conclusion, that is, because the court\u2019s finding in that regard is unsupported by the facts and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. Moreover, as I also have explained, that determination cannot stand because of the court\u2019s inconsistent findings with respect to the extent to which Bryant\u2019s statements are corroborated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"116\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\"> In light of the trial court\u2019s factual findings and the undisputed nature of the evidence underlying this case, the inherent reliability of the newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>discovered evidence and the state\u2019s failure to rebut it, and the weakness of the state\u2019s original trial evidence, I see no reason to remand the case to the trial court for another hearing. In other words, under the particular facts and circumstances presented, in my view, the only proper resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claim is to direct a new trial. I therefore disagree with the majority that the appropriate remedy for the trial court\u2019s failure to weigh the newly discovered evidence against the original trial evidence is another hearing on the petitioner\u2019s claim for a new trial. See footnote 25 of the majority opinion. Although that would be the proper remedy in some cases, for the foregoing reasons, it is not the proper remedy in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"117\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"> As an alternative ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, the state contends that the court should have barred the petitioner from proceeding on his claim concerning Levitt and Garr. In light of the following procedural history, I disagree with the state\u2019s contention. In October, 2005, the state tiled a request to revise in the present case, claiming, among other things, that the petitioner should be required to delete count nine of his complaint, which alleged, inter alia, that he was \u201centitled to a new trial based [on] newly discovered evidence, including but not limited to the information previously alleged in\u201d the first eight counts of the complaint. The trial court denied the state\u2019s motion, and the state sought no further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>relief at that time. In particular, the state did not file a motion to strike that portion of count nine containing the broadly worded allegation that the petitioner was entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence \u201cincluding <em>but not limited to\u201d </em>the allegations contained in the other counts of the complaint. (Emphasis added.) During the hearing on the petition for a new trial, the state moved to bar the petitioner from proceeding on his claim concerning Levitt and Garr. In support of its motion, the state maintained that count nine did not afford it adequate notice of the claim and that it was too late for the petitioner to amend that count due to the three year limitation period applicable to petitions for a new trial under General Statutes \u00a7 52-582. The trial court rejected the state\u2019s contention that it had not been afforded adequate notice of the claim because the state was well aware of the claim on the basis of certain submissions by the petitioner during the pretrial discovery phase of the case. The trial court also explained that the state\u2019s request to revise had sought only to delete count nine, not to \u201cflush it out.\u201d Because the state never sought a more specific statement or articulation of the petitioner\u2019s claim, and because the state had actual notice of that claim, the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to preclude the petitioner from proceeding on the claim. Although the state undoubtedly would have been entitled to more specificity from the petitioner with respect to the broad allegation contained in count nine, the state did not seek it, and, as the court found, the state had ample notice of the claim. I therefore see no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the state\u2019s motion to preclude the petitioner from proceeding on his claim involving Levitt and Garr.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"118\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> Levitt writes: \u201cHere we were, two grown men with wives and children, now spending an increasing amount of time together.
