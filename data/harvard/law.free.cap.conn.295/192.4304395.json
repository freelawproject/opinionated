App. 171, 180-81, 954 A.2d 256 (2008). The Appellate Court determined that the two convictions violated the proscription against double jeopardy contained in the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and that they, therefore, must be merged, because, but for the actions of the police, the defendant, Andre D. Martin, would not have been charged with both offenses. Id., 177-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In its certified appeal to this court, the state claims that the Appellate Court applied an improper legal standard in assessing the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claims. After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-12\"> The defendant was also convicted of conspiracy to possess a kilogram or more of marijuana with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (b), 21a-278 (b) and 53a-48.
