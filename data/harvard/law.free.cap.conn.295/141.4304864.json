The plaintiffs, Monica Picco, Joseph S. Picco, Jr., and their children, Nicole Picco and Dominic Picco, appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the named defendant, the town of Voluntown (town), and the defendant town board of education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(board).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiffs claim, inter alia, that the trial court improperly determined that our decision in <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>237 Conn. 135, 166, 676 A.2d 795 (1996), in which we held that a municipality may be held liable pursuant to certain environmental protection statutes<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cfor a public nuisance that it intentionally creates through its prolonged and deliberate failure to act to abate that nuisance,\u201d does not apply to the plaintiffs\u2019 nuisance claims, which were asserted pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n. The plaintiffs claim that, if the holding of <em>Keeney </em>is applied in the present case, their revised complaint properly alleges viable nuisance claims against the defendants and, therefore, that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motions to strike those claims and rendered judgment for the defendants. The defendants respond that the plain meaning of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) requires the plaintiffs to allege that the defendants, by some \u201cpositive act,\u201d created the claimed nuisance in order for governmental immunity to be waived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and that the holding in <em>Keeney </em>does not apply to claims brought solely pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n. Accordingly, the defendants contend that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint fails to satisfy the positive act requirement of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C), the trial court properly rendered judgment for the defendants. We agree with the defendants and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The record reveals the following relevant factual allegations and procedural history.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants owned, maintained and controlled an athletic field, known as Constitution Field (field), adjacent to Voluntown Elementary School (school). A white ash tree measuring approximately fifty-one inches in diameter and sixty feet in height stood on the field, approximately forty to fifty feet away from the playing area of a soccer field.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tree allegedly had a \u201chistory of failure\u201d and contained \u201cnumerous structural defects, including bark inclusions, trunk cracks, [and] major decay . . . .\u201d On or about October 11, 2005, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Nicole Picco, a student at the school, was participating in a school sponsored soccer game on the field. At that time, Monica Picco, Joseph S. Picco, Jr., and Dominic Picco were standing near the ash tree and waiting for the game to end, when a portion of the tree separated from the main trunk and fell on top of Monica Picco, causing her to suffer serious injuries. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an action against the defendants, asserting claims sounding in negligence and nuisance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the tree had a \u201cnatural tendency\u201d to pose a danger in light of its size, defects and location on the field. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants knew or should have known of the tree\u2019s history of failure and dangerous propensities because the defendants previously had removed from the field and adjacent school grounds large branches that had fallen from the tree, had obtained an estimate for the tree\u2019s removal, and had been advised by a tree professional that the tree was dangerous and needed to be removed immediately. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants\u2019 \u201cfailure to remove the tree was unreasonable\u201d under the circumstances and that \u201c[t]he condition of the tree was the proximate cause\u201d of Monica Picco\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The defendants subsequently filed motions to strike the counts directed against them, asserting that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity. At oral argument before the trial court, the plaintiffs conceded that the defendants\u2019 motions to strike should be granted on all counts except those alleging nuisance. Thereafter, in a memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded, with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 nuisance claims, that, on the basis of our common law, \u201c[liability can be imposed on [a] municipality only in the event that, if the condition constitute [s] a nuisance, it was created by some positive act of the municipality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 164. \u201cIndeed . . . failure to remedy a condition not of the municipality\u2019s own making is not the equivalent of the required positive act in imposing liability in nuisance [on] a municipality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On the basis of these principles of law, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 nuisance claims could not withstand the defendants\u2019 motions to strike because \u201cthe plaintiffs have not alleged any facts indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>eating that the defendants, by any positive act, created the alleged nuisance.\u201d In addition, the trial court held that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Keeney </em>did not require a different conclusion because the legal principles announced in <em>Keeney </em>were limited to \u201cthe narrow environmental context of that case . . . .\u2019\u2019Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to strike and rendered judgment thereon for the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that the holding in <em>Keeney </em>was limited to the environmental law context and failed to apply that holding to their nuisance claims. The defendants respond that the plain language of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) clearly and unambiguously precludes liability in nuisance against a municipal defendant unless the alleged nuisance was created by a positive act of the defendant. The defendants further argue that <em>Keeney </em>is inapplicable because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the present case were brought solely pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C). We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u201cThis court has stated often that a plaintiff must prove four elements to succeed in a nuisance cause of action: (1) the condition complained of had a natural tendency to create danger and inflict injury [on] person or property; (2) the danger created was a continuing one; (3) the use of the land was unreasonable or unlawful; [and] (4) the existence of the nuisance was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and damages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pestey </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>259 Conn. 345, 355, 788 A.2d 496 (2002). In addition, when the alleged tortfeasor is a municipality, our common law requires that the plaintiff also prove that the defendants, by some positive act, created the condition constituting the nuisance. See, e.g., <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 464, 470, 356 A.2d 176 (1975). In the present case, the defendants have not challenged the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>allegations with respect to the four prima facie elements of nuisance. Rather, the defendants\u2019 motions to strike are premised on their claim that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C), like the common law, contains a positive act requirement that the plaintiffs have failed to allege and satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The issue of whether the defendants may be held liable pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) for damages caused by their failure to act to abate an alleged public nuisance presents a question of statutory interpretation over which we exercise plenary review. See, e.g., <em>Considine </em>v. <em>Waterbury, 279 </em>Conn. 830, 836, 905 A.2d 70 (2006). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 836-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In accordance with \u00a7 l-2z, we begin with the text of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1), which provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by . . . (C) <em>acts </em>of the political subdivision which constitute the <em>creation or participation in the creation </em>of a nuisance . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not. define the word \u201cacts\u201d or the word \u201ccreation.\u201d \u201cIn the absence of a statutory definition, words and phrases in a particular statute are to be construed according to their common usage. . . . To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chatterjee </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>277 Conn. 681, 690, 894 A.2d 919 (2006); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Common usage does not equate a failure to act with an act. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines an \u201cact\u201d as \u201ca thing done or being done\u201d or \u201can external manifestation of the will: <em>something done </em>by a person pursuant to his volition . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Notably, the definition of the word \u201cact\u201d does not denote something <em>not </em>done by a person. The latter appropriately falls within the meaning of the word \u201comission,\u201d which is defined as \u201csomething left out, <em>not done, </em>or neglected . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 1993). This distinction is particularly significant in the present case because the statutory provision at issue references only \u201cacts,\u201d whereas, in other parts of the same statute, the legislature uses the phrase \u201cacts or omissions.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (A) (stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>municipalities may be liable for \u201cnegligent acts or omissions\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (A) (shielding municipalities from liability for \u201c[a]cts or omissions of any employee . . . which constitute criminal conduct, fraud, actual malice or wilful misconduct\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B) (shielding municipalities from liability for \u201cnegligent acts or omissions which require the exercise of judgment or discretion as an official function of the authority expressly or impliedly granted by law\u201d). We conclude that the legislature\u2019s use of different phrases within the same statute evidences a deliberate decision on its part to exclude omissions, or a failure to act, from the realm of municipal liability for nuisance. See <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubinstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 46-47, 513 A.2d 98 (1986) (when legislature uses word or phrase in one part of statute, its failure to use that word or phrase in another part of statute is deliberate); see also <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 527, 978 A.2d 487 (2009) (\u201cwhen a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that the \u201cacts\u201d referred to in \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) must be ones that \u201cconstitute the <em>creation </em>or <em>participation in the creation of a nuisance </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201ccreate\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary as: \u201cto bring into existence\u201d or \u201cto cause to be . . . .\u201d Thus, at a bare minimum, \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) requires a <em>causal link </em>between the \u201cacts\u201d and the alleged nuisance. A failure to act to abate a nuisance does not fall within the meaning of the term \u201cacts,\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C), because inaction does not create or cause a nuisance; it merely fails to remediate one that had been created by some other force. Accordingly, the plain meaning of \u00a7 52-557n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>(a) (1) (C)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> leads us to conclude that that provision imposes liability in nuisance on a municipality only when the municipality positively acts <em>(does </em>something) to create ('cause) the alleged nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Notwithstanding the clear meaning of the term \u201cacts\u201d contained in \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C), the plaintiffs claim that the term \u201cact\u201d is ambiguous on the basis of the following alternative definition from the Cambridge Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary (3d Ed. 2008): \u201cTo do something for a particular purpose, or <em>to behave in the stated way.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs contend that the latter portion of their definition, which includes behavior, encompasses the defendants\u2019 \u201cconscious decision to ignore a warning to abate a dangerous condition\u201d and, therefore, that their allegations satisfy the requirements of the statute. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">We often have stated that, when \u201cthe ordinary meaning [of a word or phrase] leaves no room for ambiguity . . . the mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ahmadi </em>v. <em>Ahmadi, </em>294 Conn. 384, 391, 985 A.2d 319 (2009). In the present case, the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed definition of the word \u201cact\u201d is untenable for several reasons and, therefore, does not render the meaning of the statute at issue ambiguous or alter our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">First, the plaintiffs completely ignore the first part of the definition of the word \u201cact\u201d that they have advanced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>That definition, \u201cto do something,\u201d mirrors the definition of \u201cact\u201d set forth in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, and supports our interpretation of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) as requiring a positive act and excluding a failure to act from the ambit of municipal liability for nuisance. Second, the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed definition lacks the required causal link between the acts and the alleged nuisance. Specifically, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how the mere behavior of ignoring a warning to abate a nuisance actually <em>causes </em>the nuisance in the first place. Unlike with the proverbial chicken and egg conundrum, logic dictates that, in the context of public nuisances, the nuisance must precede the \u201cbehavior\u201d of ignoring the nuisance, because one cannot ignore something that does not exist. Thus, the nuisance necessarily must be <em>caused </em>by something other than the behavior of ignoring it. Indeed, in the present case, the plaintiffs acknowledge in their revised complaint that the tree\u2019s defects and dangerous condition were caused by <em>\u201cnatural </em>tendencies]\u201d rather than by the defendants\u2019 behavior. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Finally, in advocating for their proposed definition of the term \u201cact,\u201d the plaintiffs have failed to account for the greater context in which the word \u201cacts\u201d is used in the statute. As we previously discussed, in other parts of \u00a7 52-557n (a), the legislature uses the phrase \u201cacts or omissions,\u201d whereas, in \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C), the legislature explicitly limits a municipality\u2019s liability to acts. The plaintiffs have ignored this context in advancing their definition, yet, this context clearly evidences that the legislature did not intend for liability to be imposed under \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) for the mere behavior of ignoring something; rather, as with the common law, the legislature intended for liability to be imposed only when a municipality has engaged in some positive act that results in the creation of the nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Applying our interpretation of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C) to the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 revised complaint, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims cannot survive the defendants\u2019 motions to strike. The plaintiffs simply have not alleged any facts indicating that the defendants, by any positive act, created the alleged nuisance. Although the plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 act of ordering an evaluation of the tree constitutes a positive act within the meaning of the statute, such argument necessarily fails because the evaluation of the tree did not <em>create </em>the nuisance; it merely evaluated it. Moreover, the plaintiffs explicitly alleged that the tree\u2019s defects and dangerous condition were caused by <em>\u201cnatural </em>tendencies]\u201d; (emphasis added); and that Monica Picco\u2019s injuries were proximately caused by the condition of the tree, as opposed to any acts of the defendants. Notably missing from the allegations is any claim that the defendants <em>did something </em>to <em>cause </em>the tree to decay, to rot or a portion thereof to fall down. Instead, the plaintiffs merely have alleged that the defendants knew or should have known of the tree\u2019s dangerous propensities and that their \u201cfailure to remove the tree was unreasonable . . . .\u201d Such allegations are insufficient to state a viable cause of action in nuisance under \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motions to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and rendered judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were asserted solely pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (C), and because we conclude that that statute contains a positive act requirement, we further conclude that our decision in <em>Keeney, </em>which did not concern \u00a7 52-557n, has no applicability to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by . . .

In addition to the claims asserted against the town and the board, the plaintiffs asserted claims against the following individuals, each of whom served as either a town official or a town employee: (1) Gilbert Grimm, the town\u2019s first selectman; (2) Ronald Millovitsch, the head of the town\u2019s department of public works; (3) Paul Ricard, the head of grounds and maintenance for Voluntown Elementary School; (4) Mary T. Chinigo, the principal and or acting superintendent of Voluntown Elementary School; and (5) Diana M. Ingraham, the chairperson of the board. The trial court, with the consent of the plaintiffs, struck all of the counts directed at these individual defendants, as well as all counts sounding in negligence that were directed against the town and the board. The trial court also struck all of the counts directed against the town and the board that sounded in nuisance, albeit over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection. Thus, the counts that are the subject of this appeal are those directed against the town and the board that sounded in nuisance.
