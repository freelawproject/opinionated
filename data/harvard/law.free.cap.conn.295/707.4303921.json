The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict, and the defendant now appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion to suppress certain evidence on the ground that it was seized in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct; (3) admitted evidence that the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent in violation of his rights under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (4) failed to give a special credibility instruction on the testimony of an informing witness. We conclude that, although the defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his cell phone, the automobile exception to the constitutional requirement for a search warrant applied under New York law. We also reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the defendant\u2019s other claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 2001 and early 2002, the defendant lived in Mamaroneck, New York, with his girlfriend, Melissa Gagliardi. The defendant was a drug dealer. Carlos Barradas, the victim, spent a large amount of time at the defendant\u2019s apartment, where he helped the defendant with his drug business. In return, the defendant provided drugs to the victim. The victim also purchased drugs from the defendant on an almost daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">In early January, 2002, a gold bracelet belonging to the defendant was missing from the apartment. The defendant believed that the victim had stolen the bracelet and became upset with him. On the night of January, 16, 2002, at approximately 10 p.m., the defendant told Gagliardi that he and the victim were going to go to Mount Vernon, New York, to buy drugs. The defendant and the victim took the victim\u2019s car. Instead of driving to Mount Vernon, however, they drove to Norwalk. They arrived at an area near the intersection of Merritt Street and Chestnut Street at approximately 11:48 p.m. The defendant then shot the victim with a .45 caliber semiautomatic gun. The victim exited from the car and tried to flee, but a fence blocked his way. The defendant, who also had exited the car, shot the victim again. The victim then entered and exited the car again in an attempt to escape from the defendant. The defendant ultimately shot the victim several times in front of the car, where the victim fell. Police arrived at the scene within minutes of the shooting and found the victim still alive. They took him to Norwalk Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Later that morning, when the defendant arrived back at his apartment in Mamaroneck, he was wearing a woman\u2019s sweatshirt. Gagliardi asked him where he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>acquired it, and the defendant told her that he had needed to change his clothes in order to get rid of \u201c \u2018evidence\u2019 \u201dor\u201c \u2018gun\u2019s powder.\u2019 \u201d At some point, Gagliardi asked the defendant where the victim was and the defendant told her that he had killed him by shooting him multiple times. He also indicated that his cousin, Kevin Thomas, had been present during the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In March, 2004, the defendant was arrested and charged with murder. After a trial, the jury found him guilty of murder and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain evidence that he claims was seized without a valid search warrant in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. We conclude that the evidence was admissible under the automobile exception to the constitutional requirement for a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this claim. In January and February, 2002, the Mamaroneck police department was investigating the defendant for suspected drug sales. On February 1,2002, Joseph Comblo, a detective with the Mamaroneck police department, executed a search warrant in connection with the investigation. Both the warrant and. the affidavit attached to the warrant were captioned: \u201cFOR THE PREMISES AND PERSONS OF: SOLOMON BOYD, 627 MAMARONECK AVENUE, MAMARONECK, NEW YORK, APARTMENT # 3 . . . AND FOR THE PERSON OF SOLOMON BOYD AND ANY PERSON THEREIN.\u201d The body of the search warrant stated: \u201cYou are therefore commanded ... to make an immediate search of 627 Mamaroneck Ave. . . . Mamaroneck, New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>... for crack cocaine and cocaine, narcotics paraphernalia, including but not limited to plastic bags, records of ownership or use of this location, including trace evidence, records of narcotics transactions, any safe and its contents, computers, computer programs, computer data, and [United States] [c]urrency used to purchase crack cocaine and cocaine . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Because the Mamaroneck police were aware that the Norwalk police department was investigating the defendant in connection with the victim\u2019s murder, Robert Holland, a sergeant with the Mamaroneck police department, invited Arthur Weisgerber and Charles Chrzanowski, detectives with the Norwalk police department, to accompany the Mamaroneck police during the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment. The Mamaroneck police department executed the warrant at approximately 7:45 p.m. on February 8, 2002. Weisgerber and Chrzanowski arrived at the apartment after the search had begun. They did not participate in the search, but remained in the kitchen of the apartment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They attended the search in the hope that, while the Mamaroneck police were searching for drugs, they would find in plain view evidence related to the victim\u2019s murder, such as a gun, ammunition or bloody clothes. The Mamaroneck police found crack cocaine, drug paraphernalia, a scale, a razor blade and a computer in the apartment. Gagliardi was present during the search and the police arrested her on drug charges. The police found no evidence related to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">During the search, Holland received a radio call that other Mamaroneck police officers had stopped the defendant nearby as he was returning to the apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>in his car. Holland and Weisgerber went to the location where the defendant had been stopped. By the time they arrived, the other police officers already had arrested the defendant for drug offenses on the basis of the evidence seized at the apartment. Holland and Weisgerber noticed a cell phone on the passenger seat of the car that the defendant had been driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Later that night, Weisgerber and Chrzanowski went to the Mamaroneck police station to interview Gagliardi about the murder. While they were waiting to interview Gagliardi, Andy Genovese, a detective with the Mamaroneck police department, was at his desk nearby, scrolling through the numbers on the cell phone that had been taken from the defendant\u2019s car.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Genovese announced several telephone numbers that he had found on the cell phone, including the cell phone\u2019s subscriber number. Chrzanowski recorded the number in his notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Thereafter, Weisgerber prepared and executed a search warrant on Sprint Spectrum L.P., the wireless telecommunications company that serviced the cell phone for the telephone records related to the cell phone. The cell phone records revealed that the account for the cell phone was in the defendant\u2019s name. The records also showed that, in the hour before the victim\u2019s murder, calls from and to the cell phone had been routed through a series of telecommunications towers progressing in a northeasterly direction from Mamaroneck to Norwalk. A number of cell phone calls that had been made and received minutes before the murder had been routed through a tower located approximately five blocks north of the murder scene. The cell phone records further showed that, beginning minutes after the murder, a number of calls from and to the cell phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>had been routed through a series of towers progressing in a southwesterly direction from Norwalk to Mamaroneck.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In addition, the cell phone records revealed that, shortly after the murder, several calls originating with the cell phone had been made to the telephone of Sally Williams, who is Gagliardi\u2019s mother. Gagliardi\u2019s cousin, Joanne Gentile, who was one of the defendant\u2019s drug customers, was living with Williams at that time. Gentile testified at trial that the defendant had called her in a panicked state on the night of the murder and had asked her to go to his apartment to tell Gagliardi to call him or to answer his telephone calls. Gagliardi testified that, after Gentile came to the apartment, she answered the telephone and the defendant asked her to call his sister to ask her to provide him with an alibi. The defendant also asked Gagliardi to say that he had been at his sister\u2019s house getting his hair done or that he had been at home with Gagliardi. Gagliardi refused and hung up the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the cell phone records and any other evidence to which the police had been led as the result of seizing the cell phone. At the suppression hearing, Holland testified that, although the warrant did not specifically authorize the police to seize cell phones, the Mamaroneck police department considered cell phones to constitute drug paraphernalia and records, which were covered by the warrant. Gagliardi testified that, when the Norwalk police interviewed her on the night of the search, she knew the defendant\u2019s cell phone number and that the carrier for the cell phone was \u201cSprint.\u201d The defendant testified about the circumstances surrounding certain statements that he had made after his arrest for murder, but he did not testify regarding the cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The defendant argued at the suppression hearing that the cell phone was not covered by the search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>because the warrant authorized a search only of the defendant\u2019s apartment, not his person. He further argued that the seizure of the cell phone was not valid under any of the exceptions to the fourth amendment warrant requirement. The state argued that, because the search warrant referred to the defendant\u2019s person, it was not limited to his apartment. It further argued that, even if the search warrant did not authorize the seizure and search of the cell phone, the search was valid under the automobile exception to the constitutional requirement for a warrant, the search incident to lawful arrest exception, the doctrine of exigent circumstances and the inevitable discovery doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The trial court concluded that the search warrant had authorized the seizure and search of the cell phone because it authorized the search of the defendant for evidence of drug activity and the evidence presented at the suppression hearing showed that the Mamaroneck police had seized the cell phone on the basis of their experience that cell phones contain such information. The trial court further concluded that, even if the search warrant had not authorized the seizure and search of the cell phone, the inevitable discovery doctrine applied because Weisgerber and Chrzanowski would have learned the cell phone number from Gagliardi when they interviewed her on the night of the search if Genovese had not revealed the number to them. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence developed as the result of the seizure of the cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly determined that the search warrant authorized the seizure and search of the cell phone and that, even if the warrant did not authorize the search, the inevitable discovery doctrine applied. The state disputes these claims and claims as alternate grounds for affirmance that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>privacy in his cell phone number and that the search was valid under both the automobile exception and the search incident to arrest exception. Finally, the state claims that, even if the search was unconstitutional, the admission of the evidence related to the cell phone was harmless. We conclude that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his cell phone, but that the search of the cell phone was valid under the automobile exception. Accordingly, we need not address the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the search warrant authorized the search of the cell phone and that the inevitable discovery doctrine applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We begin with the standard of review for a motion to suppress. \u201cIt is axiomatic that [ujnder the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the fruit of prior police illegality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>267 Conn. 495, 511, 838 A.2d 981 (2004). \u201cAs a general matter, the standard of review for a motion to suppress is well settled. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]hen a question of fact is essential to the outcome of a particular legal determination that implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, [however] and the credibility of witnesses is not the primary issue, our customary deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings is tempered by a scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain that the trial court\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. . . . [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [our review is plenary, and] we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345, 362-63, 952 A.2d 784 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We first consider the state\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress may be affirmed on the alternate ground that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his cell phone under the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">\u201cThe touchstone to determining whether a person has standing to contest an allegedly illegal search is whether that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the invaded place. . . . Absent such an expectation, the subsequent police action has no constitutional ramifications. ... In order to meet this rule of standing ... a two-part subjective/objective test must be satisfied: (1) whether the [person contesting the search] manifested a subjective expectation of privacy with respect to [the invaded premises]; and (2) whether that expectation [is] one that society would consider reasonable. . . . This determination is made on a case-by-case basis. . . . Whether a defendant\u2019s actual expectation of privacy ... is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable involves a fact-specific inquiry into all the relevant circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Hill, 237 Conn. 81, 92, 675 A.2d 866 (1996). \u201cThe burden of proving the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy rests on the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>278 Conn. 341, 349, 898 A.2d 149 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">\u201cThe courts have identified a number of factors indicating that a person\u2019s expectation of privacy in a particular place is one that society is not prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>85, 96, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991). \u201c[A]n individual . . . may have a constitutionally cognizable expectation of privacy in areas where his use is exclusive, that is, where he has the legal right to control access and to exclude others.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sealy, </em>208 Conn. 689, 693, 546 A.2d 271 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\u201c[Although the inquiry in determining whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy involves an inquiry into the particular place invaded, when the search is of a [container] the principal \u2018place\u2019 for fourth amendment purposes is the interior of the [container] and its contents.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 103-104. \u201c[I]t is the contents . . . of . . . closed containers in which a reasonable expectation of privacy may inhere, not the visible exterior or location of the containers.\u201d Id., 102. Thus, in determining whether the defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his cell phone, we focus on the contents of the cell phone, not on the cell phone itself or its visible exterior.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The state argues that the defendant failed to establish that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his cell phone because he presented no evidence that he owned it. The state further argues that, even if the defendant owned the cell phone, mere ownership or possession is not sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 92, 100 S. Ct. 2547, 65 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1980) (mere possessory interest in seized item is not sufficient to establish fourth amendment interest); and he presented no evidence that he had taken steps to keep his cell phone number private. The defendant counters that he was not required to present evidence at the suppression hearing that the cell phone belonged to him because, even without such evidence, the record established that he owned the cell phone and had exhibited an expectation of privacy in its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>tents. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 133-34, 613 A.2d 211 (1992) (finding reasonable expectation of privacy on basis of information presented in search warrant affidavit and statements that defendant made to police before search warrant was issued). He further contends that his expectation of privacy was reasonable. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The evidence presented at the suppression hearing established that the police seized the cell phone from the passenger seat of the car that the defendant had been driving. Gagliardi testified that the defendant possessed a cell phone at the time of the search. In addition, the cell phone records themselves indicated that the cell phone belonged to the defendant. Finally, the defendant\u2019s exclusive possession is implicit in the state\u2019s claim that the cell phone records showed that the defendant had traveled to Norwalk on the night of the murder and that the defendant had been in possession of the cell phone that night.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant owned the cell phone and exercised exclusive control over it, and that he therefore had a reasonable expectation that others would not have access to it without his permission. We conclude, therefore, that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the cell phone. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sealy, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 693 (reasonable expectation of privacy exists when person has exclusive use of area, right to control access and right to exclude others); see <em>United States </em>v. Finley, 477 F.3d 250, 259 (5th Cir.) (defendant had reasonable expectation of privacy in cell phone because he had possessory interest in it, had right to exclude others and exhibited subjective expectation of privacy by taking normal precautions to maintain privacy, such as keeping cell phone on his person), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1353, 127 S. Ct. 2065, 167 L. Ed. 2d 790 (2007).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The state also claims, however, that even if the defendant owned and controlled the cell phone, he failed to establish that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the cell phone number because he presented no evidence that he had made any attempt to keep it private. In support of this claim, the state relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fierros-Alavarez, 547 </em>F. Sup. 2d 1206 (D. Kan. 2008). In that case, the court concluded that, because the defendant had lawful possession and control of his cell phone when it was seized and searched by the police, he had a subjective expectation of privacy in it. Id., 1210. The court also concluded, however, that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the cell phone\u2019s recent call directory showing the numbers that the defendant had called from the cell phone because he had provided that information to third parties. Id., 1210-11. In support of this conclusion, the court relied on <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 742-44, 99 S. Ct. 2577, 61 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1979) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in dialed telephone number because telephone company must receive telephone number to complete call and person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forrester, </em>512 F.3d 500, 509-10 (9th Cir. 2008) (applying <em>Smith </em>to validate police surveillance of defendant\u2019s computer to obtain e-mail addresses of outgoing e-mails and addresses of web sites visited).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We do not find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Fierros-Alavarez </em>to be persuasive. In <em>Smith </em>and <em>Forrester, </em>the government had not obtained the dialed telephone numbers and e-mail addresses from an item or area in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy, but had obtained the information from, respectively, the telephone company and the Internet provider. See <em>Smith </em>v. Maryland, supra, 442 U.S. 741 (government installed pen register to record numbers dialed from defendant\u2019s telephone on telephone company property at telephone company\u2019s central offices); <em>United States </em>v. Forrester, supra, 512 F.3d 505 (government installed \u201cpen register analogue\u201d at Internet provider\u2019s facility).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we understand the cases to stand for the proposition that the government can obtain information that the defendant has provided to a third party <em>from that third party </em>without implicating the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights. For example, in the present case, if the police had obtained the defendant\u2019s cell phone number from Gagliardi or from the cell phone carrier, there would have been no fourth amendment violation <em>under Smith </em>and <em>Forrester </em>because the defendant could have no reasonable expectation that Gagliardi and the carrier would not reveal the information. Contrary to the court\u2019s assumption in <em>Fierros-Alavarez, </em>however, nothing in either case supports a conclusion that, if a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in an area or item, the government may search that area or item for any information that the defendant had provided to third parties without triggering fourth amendment protections. We conclude, therefore, that the fact that the defendant in the present case had provided his cell phone number to third parties and had not taken steps to ensure that it was confidential does not mean that he had no reasonable expectation that the police would not search the contents of his cell phone for the number without a warrant. We conclude, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>therefore, that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in all of the contents of his cell phone, including his subscriber number.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">We next address the state\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance that the seizure of the cell phone and the search of its contents were valid under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. The state contends that, although the search would have been unconstitutional under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution if conducted in Connecticut by Connecticut police; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 386-87, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993) (\u201ca warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause, but conducted after the automobile has been impounded at the police station, violates article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution\u201d); this rule of state constitutional law does not apply to the search because the New York police officers conducted the search in accordance with New York law. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Blasich, </em>73 N.Y.2d 673, 681, 541 N.E.2d 40, 543 N.Y.S.2d 40 (1989) (automobile exception \u201cis equally applicable whether the search is conducted at the time and place where the automobile was stopped or whether, instead, the vehicle is impounded and searched after removal to the police station\u201d). We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">At the outset, we address the defendant\u2019s contention that the record is not adequate for review of the state\u2019s claimed alternate ground for affirmance because the trial court did not make factual findings regarding the applicability of the automobile exception. We disagree. The trial court found that the cell phone was on the front passenger seat of the defendant\u2019s car when he was arrested. The court also expressly found that it was not clear when the cell phone had been seized from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the car on the basis of the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, but that the cell phone was in the possession of the Mamaroneck police when they returned to the police station. Finally, the trial court found that \u201cthe Norwalk police were not implicated in the determination of the [cell phone] number; it was solely the Mamaroneck police who did so.\u201d As we discuss subsequently in this opinion, we conclude that these factual findings are sufficient for this court to determine whether the state met its burden of proving the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Accordingly, we turn to a review of the law governing the automobile exception to the constitutional requirement for a warrant. \u201cUnder both the federal and the state constitutions, the police must first obtain a warrant before conducting a search, unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>257 Conn. 216, 228, 777 A.2d 182 (2001). \u201c[T]he burden is on the state to prove the existence of an exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>229 Conn. 10, 27 n.19, 639 A.2d 1007 (1994), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1077, 118 S. Ct. 1523, 140 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\u201cIn <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 153, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925), the United States Supreme Court held that the fourth amendment is not violated by a roadside warrantless search of an automobile if the police have probable cause to search the automobile and if obtaining a warrant would be impracticable because of the possibility that the automobile will be moved out of the jurisdiction. The rule announced in <em>Carroll </em>has come to be called the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. Connecticut recognizes this exception as a matter of state constitutional law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>hi Miller, </em>this court rejected what it characterized as a request to expand the automobile exception to permit \u201ca warrantless automobile search that is conducted after the automobile has been impounded at a police station.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 383. The court reasoned that, because the exception is justified only by \u201cthe inherent mobility of automobiles and the latent exigency that that mobility creates\u201d; id., 384-85; and because those circumstances no longer exist after the automobile has been impounded, \u201ca warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause, but conducted after the automobile has been impounded at the police station, violates article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d Id., 386-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In the present case, the state does not dispute that, if Connecticut police had seized and searched the defendant\u2019s cell phone in this state, the search would have been unconstitutional under <em>Miller </em>and, therefore, the evidence would have been inadmissible. Thus, the state implicitly concedes that the evidence would not support a finding that the police seized the cell phone when they arrested the defendant, and that it must therefore be presumed that they seized the cell phone from the defendant\u2019s car after it was impounded at the police station. The state argues, however, that, because the evidence was obtained in New York by New York police officers in compliance with New York law, the exclusionary rule does not bar its admission merely because the search would have violated this state\u2019s constitutional law if it had occurred in this state. We agree with the state that: (1) the legality of the search was governed by New York law; and (2) under New York law, the search was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>We first consider whether the legality of the search should be determined under Connecticut law or New York law. The majority of courts that have considered the issue have concluded that \u201cit does not offend the constitutional principles of a forum jurisdiction to allow the transfer of criminal evidence from the officers of another jurisdiction to those of the forum when the evidence has been obtained lawfully by the former without any assistance by the latter,\u201d even when the search would have been illegal in the forum jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>v. <em>Mollica, </em>114 N.J. 329, 353, 554 A.2d 1315 (1989). A number of these courts have reasoned that, because the primary justification for the exclusionary rule is to deter illegal police conduct, no valid purpose is served by excluding evidence that has been obtained legally. See id., 353-54; <em>Echols </em>v. <em>State, </em>484 So. 2d 568, 572 (Fla. 1985) (\u201c[a]ny rule of evidence that denies the jury access to clearly probative and reliable evidence must bear a heavy burden of justification, and must be carefully limited to the circumstances in which it will pay its way by deterring official [lawlessness]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 871, 107 S. Ct. 241, 93 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>372 N.W.2d 731, 737 (Minn. 1985) (exclusion of legally obtained tapes not justified because it would not serve to deter illegal conduct by police officers in either forum state or state where search was conducted); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evers, </em>175 N.J. 355, 380, 815 A.2d 432 (2003) (exclusion of legally obtained evidence not justified because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u201cwould advance none of its purposes \u2014 deterrence, judicial integrity, and imposing a cost on illicit behavior\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cauley, </em>863 S.W.2d 411, 415-16 (Tenn. 1993) (relying on Mollica). The courts have reasoned that, under these circumstances, the sole \u201ceffect of suppression would [be] to keep highly probative and lawfully obtained evidence from the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>552 Pa. 570, 578, 716 A.2d 1221 (1998); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Evers, </em>supra, 380 (exclusion of legally obtained evidence \u201cwould disserve the process of doing justice in this state by preventing the introduction of reliable and relevant evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Like these courts, this court previously has recognized that \u201c[t]he purpose of the exclusionary rule is not to redress the injury to the privacy of the search victim .... Instead, the rule\u2019s prime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the [fjourth [a]mendment against unreasonable searches and seizures .... Application of the rule is thus appropriate in circumstances in which this purpose is likely to be furthered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 570, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988). Moreover, we agree with these courts that the application of the exclusionary rule to evidence that was obtained legally by officers of another jurisdiction will not deter unlawful police conduct either in this state or in the other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation in the present case to expand the exclusionary rule to apply to such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The defendant contends, however, that even if the exclusionary rule ordinarily does not apply to evidence that was lawfully obtained in another jurisdiction when the official conduct at issue would have been illegal in this state, the exclusionary rule does apply when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>officers from the other jurisdiction acted as agents for officers of this state. In support of this contention, the defendant relies on <em>Lustig </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 74, 78-80, 69 S. Ct. 1372, 93 L. Ed. 1819 (1949) (federal officer\u2019s participation in illegal search conducted by state officials rendered evidence inadmissible in federal criminal proceeding), <em>Gambino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U.S. 310, 316-17, 48 S. Ct. 137, 72 L. Ed. 293 (1927) (when unconstitutional search and seizure was made solely for purpose of aiding United States in enforcement of its laws, evidence was inadmissible in federal criminal proceeding even though state officers were not acting under direction of federal officials), and <em>Byars </em>v. <em>United States, </em>273 U.S. 28, 33, 47 S. Ct. 248, 71 L. Ed. 520 (1927) (when federal officer participated in illegal search conducted by state police, \u201ceffect is the same as though he had engaged in the undertaking as one exclusively his own\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant contends that these cases support the general proposition that, when evidence was obtained in a search that was legal in the search jurisdiction but that would have been illegal in the forum jurisdiction, the evidence is inadmissible in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the forum jurisdiction if officers from the forum jurisdiction participated in the search.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">We need not decide in the present case, however, whether participation by officials of this state in a search that is legal in the search jurisdiction, but which would be illegal in this state, renders the evidence inadmissible in this state and, if so, what level of participation by this state\u2019s officials is required, because, upon a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe Norwalk police were not implicated in the determination of the cell phone number; it was solely the Mamaroneck police who did so,\u201d was supported by substantial evidence. The evidence shows that Norwalk police were not present while the Mamaroneck police engaged in conduct that the defendant claims would have been unconstitutional if conducted by Connecticut officials, namely, the seizure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the defendant\u2019s cell phone after his automobile was impounded. Moreover, there was no evidence that the Norwalk police had any knowledge that the Mamaroneck police intended to engage in such conduct or that they had influenced the Mamaroneck police in any way.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, although the Norwalk police were present in the police station when Genovese searched the contents of the cell phone and announced the cell phone number, they were there to interview Gagliardi, not to obtain information about the search from the Mamaroneck police. Indeed, there was no evidence that the Norwalk police knew that the Mamaroneck police had seized the cell phone, that they would search its contents or that they would announce their findings. We conclude, therefore, that there was no evidence to support a conclusion that the Norwalk police had intended to violate the state constitution by \u201ccircuitous and indirect methods.\u201d <em>Byars </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 273 U.S. 32. Because it is clear that, under any standard, the Mamaroneck police were not acting as agents for the Norwalk police, the legality of the search must be determined under New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We turn, therefore, to that question. Under New York constitutional law, \u201cwhen the occupant of an automobile is arrested, the very circumstances that supply probable cause for the arrest may also give the police probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband, evidence of the crime, a weapon or some means of escape. If so, a warrantless search of the vehicle is authorized ... as a search falling within the automobile exception to the warrant requirement . . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Blasich, </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 678; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>55 N.Y.2d 49, 54-55, 432 N.E.2d 745, 447 N.Y.S.2d 873 (1982) (under automobile exception, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>\u201ca valid arrest for a crime authorizes a warrantless search \u2014 for a reasonable time and to a reasonable extent \u2014 of a vehicle and of a closed container visible in the passenger compartment of the vehicle which the arrested person is driving or in which he is a passenger when the circumstances give reason to believe that the vehicle or its visible contents may be related to the crime for which the arrest is being made [as possibly containing contraband or as having been used in the commission of the crime]\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When the automobile exception applies, police also may search closed containers located within the automobile that may contain evidence of the crime of arrest. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra, 54-55; <em>People </em>v. <em>Langen, </em>60 N.Y.2d 170, 172, 456 N.E.2d 1167, 469 N.Y.S.2d 44 (1983) (\u201cwhen the circumstances giving rise to probable cause to arrest a driver or passenger in the automobile also support the belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>that the automobile contains [evidence] related to the crime for which the arrest is made, police may search, within a reasonable time after the arrest, any container, locked or otherwise, located in the automobile\u201d), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1028, 104 S. Ct. 1287, 79 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1984).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The defendant in the present case does not dispute that, on the basis of the evidence that the Mamaroneck police found in his apartment, they had probable cause to arrest him for drug offenses. The trial court found that the cell phone was visible on the front seat of the defendant\u2019s car when he was arrested and that the Mamaroneck police consider cell phones to constitute drug paraphernalia and records because they are likely to contain information about drug transactions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the police had probable cause to believe that the defendant was selling drugs, because the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>dant\u2019s cell phone was visible in the defendant\u2019s car when the police arrested him and because the police had probable cause to believe that the cell phone contained evidence of drug activity, we conclude that the police had probable cause to seize and search the contents of the cell phone under the automobile exception as applied in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In addition, as we have indicated, the New York Court of Appeals has held that the automobile exception \u201cis equally applicable whether the search is conducted at the time and place where the automobile was stopped or whether, instead, the vehicle is impounded and searched after removal to the police station . . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Blasich, </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 681; see also <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51-52, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970) (fourth amendment permits warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause and conducted while automobile is impounded at police station). It is clear, therefore, that the seizure of the cell phone and search of its contents were not unconstitutional under New York law merely because the defendant\u2019s car had been impounded before the seizure and search. Accordingly, we conclude that the New York Court of Appeals would conclude that the seizure and search of the defendant\u2019s cell phone was valid under the automobile exception to the constitutional requirement for a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Before trial, the state filed amotion in limine seeking to introduce evidence that the defendant previously had engaged in misconduct that was similar to the charged conduct in this case. The defendant filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>a motion to exclude the evidence. At the suppression hearing, the state presented an offer of proof in the form of testimony by Gentile that the defendant had driven her to the same location in Norwalk where the victim had been murdered and had threatened her with harm. Specifically, Gentile testified that, in December, 2001,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> after she had stolen money and cocaine from the defendant, the defendant told her that he wanted to go with her to the Bronx to obtain more drugs for his drug business. Gentile got into a car with the defendant and the defendant\u2019s cousin, Thomas, who was driving. Instead of driving south toward the Bronx, however, Thomas drove north toward Connecticut. At some point, the defendant pointed a gun at Gentile and placed handcuffs on her. After they entered Connecticut, Thomas stopped the car in an area where there were warehouses and a gate with two bars. The defendant then questioned Gentile about the theft of his money and his drugs. When Gentile refused to admit that she had stolen them, the defendant stated that he was going to get some gas and bum Gentile. He then got out of the car, left the area and returned with a can of gas. He then left again. Some time later, he called Thomas\u2019 cell phone, and Thomas told Gentile that the defendant was at her house with Gagliardi and Williams and he wanted Gentile to tell them to give him the money. Gentile did so. The defendant returned to the car a couple of hours later and they drove to Port Chester, where Gentile was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In April, 2005, Gentile told Weisgerber about the incident. Weisgerber brought Gentile to several locations in Norwalk to see if she could identify the location where the defendant had brought her. Gentile did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>recognize the first three locations, but recognized the fourth one. Weisgerber then took Gentile around the comer from that location and told her that the police had found the victim there.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">During argument on the state\u2019s motion in limine, the state argued that Gentile\u2019s testimony was relevant to the issue of identity because the defendant\u2019s treatment of Gentile was so similar to the perpetrator\u2019s treatment of the victim. The state agreed, however, that it would not elicit testimony about the defendant\u2019s threat to use gasoline to bum Gentile. The defendant argued that the evidence was highly prejudicial to the defendant in that it tended to show that the defendant had a propensity to engage in this type of conduct and that the incident with Gentile was not sufficiently similar to the murder to come within the exception to the bar on propensity evidence for signature crimes. The trial court concluded that the conduct was sufficiently similar to be probative on the issue of identity and that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, it granted the state\u2019s motion to admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">At trial, Gentile testified substantially in accordance with her offer of proof testimony at the suppression hearing, with the exception that she did not testify about the defendant\u2019s threat to bum her with gasoline. The trial corut immediately cautioned the jury that the evidence was being introduced solely for the purpose of proving the identity of the perpetrator, not to show that the defendant was a person of bad character or had a propensity to commit crime. The court further instructed the jury that, if it determined that the uncharged misconduct was not similar to the charged conduct, it could not consider it for any purpose. The trial court repeated these instructions to the jury in its final jury charge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly admitted Gentile\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s misconduct toward her because the conduct was not sufficiently similar to establish identity. We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence. We also conclude, however, that its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Our standard of review for evidentiary claims is well settled. \u201cTo the extent [that] a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Because the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of . . . other crimes is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged against him.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> . . . The rationale [for] this rule is to guard against its use merely to show an evil disposition of an accused, and especially the predisposition to commit the crime with which he is now charged. . . . The fact that such evidence tends to prove the commission of other crimes by an accused does not render it inadmissible [however] if it is otherwise relevant and material. . . . Such evidence is admissible for other purposes, such as to show intent, an element [of] the crime, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 161-62, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\u201cThe first threshold for the use of evidence of other crimes or misconduct on the issue of identity is that the methods used be sufficiently unique to warrant a reasonable inference that the person who performed one misdeed also did the other. . . . McCormick points out that in proffering other crime evidence [t]o prove other like crimes by the accused so nearly identical in method as to earmark them as the handiwork of the accused . . . much more is demanded than the mere repeated commission of crimes of the same class, such as repeated burglaries or thefts. The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201c[T]he fact that some of the similarities between the offenses were legal or relatively common occurrences when standing alone does not . . . negate the uniqueness of the offenses when viewed as a whole. It is the distinctive combination of actions which forms the signature or modus operandi of the crime . . . and it is this criminal logo which justifies the inference that the individual who committed the first offense also committed the second. . . . The process of construing an inference of [ijdentity . . . consists usually in adding together a number of circumstances, each of which by itself might be a feature of many objects, but all of which together make it more probable that they coexist in a single object only. Each additional circumstance reduces the chances of there being more than one object so associated.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In the present case, the state argues that the misconduct evidence was sufficiently similar to the murder to establish that the defendant was the perpetrator because both Gentile and the victim were customers of the defendant\u2019s drug business; the defendant was angry at both Gentile and the victim because he believed that they had stolen from him; the defendant used the same ruse to lure Gentile and the victim to accompany him; the defendant brought both Gentile and the victim to the same place; and Thomas had accompanied the defendant during both incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">As we have indicated, however, evidence of other misconduct is admissible <em>only </em>for the purpose of raising an inference that \u201cthe person who performed one misdeed also did the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 163. Thus, misconduct evidence is admissible <em>only </em>to show that the defendant, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>another person, committed the charged crime. Regardless of how similar the uncharged misconduct is to the charged conduct, the uncharged misconduct may not be used to prove that, because the defendant committed the same type of conduct before, he committed the charged conduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vorhees, </em>248 S.W.3d 585, 591 (Mo. 2008) (\u201c[e]vidence of prior bad acts, regardless of the degree of their similarity to the acts in the charged case, may not be admitted to corroborate\u201d evidence that defendant committed charged offense [emphasis in original]); id., 590 (\u201c[signature evidence used for corroboration is, at base, propensity evidence masquerading under the well-recognized identity exception, a category of exception in which it does not belong\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In the present case, it is obvious that the jury could not have concluded that a person other than the defendant had been angry with the victim because of the theft of the defendant\u2019s bracelet and had tricked the victim into accompanying him on a drive on the night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>of the murder. Rather, if it disbelieved the evidence tending to prove those facts, it could have concluded only that the conduct did not occur. Thus, the state was not using the similarity between the defendant\u2019s prior conduct with Gentile and the defendant\u2019s conduct with the victim to show the defendant, and not another person, had engaged in that conduct toward the victim, but to corroborate the evidence that he had engaged in that conduct by showing that he previously had engaged in extremely similar misconduct. As we have indicated, the evidence was not admissible for that purpose. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We must determine, therefore, whether the improper admission of the misconduct evidence was harmful. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the [impropriety] was harmful. ... [A] nonconstitutional [impropriety] is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the [impropriety] did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 663, 969 A.2d 750 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">We conclude that the admission of the misconduct evidence was harmless. First, Gentile\u2019s misconduct testimony did not cast the defendant in a significantly worse light than the other evidence presented at trial. Both Gagliardi and Gentile testified that the defendant ran a drug selling business. Moreover, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim that the misconduct evidence was the only evidence tending to show that the defendant was a violent person, Gagliardi testified that she had discovered in December, 2001, that the defendant carried a gun. The defendant told her at that time that he needed the gun for protection. Gagliardi also testified that the defendant had told her that he had shot the victim multiple times.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Second, the jury had before it other strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Again, Gagliardi testified that the defendant had confessed to her on the morning following the murder that he had killed the victim by shooting him multiple times and that he had asked her to provide him with an alibi. Gagliardi\u2019s testimony also showed that the defendant had a motive to kill the victim. In addition, the cell phone records provided strong evidence that the defendant had been in the area of Norwalk where the murder occurred at the time of the murder and corroborated the testimony that he had spoken by telephone to Gagliardi and Gentile shortly after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Third, the trial court forcefully instructed the jury that it could not use the evidence to infer that the defendant had a bad character or that he had a propensity to commit criminal acts both immediately after Gentile\u2019s misconduct testimony and during its final instructions. Under these circumstances, we have a fan-assurance that the misconduct evidence did not substantially affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court violated his fifth amendment right to remain silent when it admitted evidence that he had invoked that right during questioning by the police. He further claims that the state violated his fifth amendment right when it commented on that evidence during closing arguments. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On March 29, 2004, Weisgerber and Andrew Gail, a lieutenant with the Nor-walk police department, interviewed the defendant regarding the victim\u2019s murder. Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the statements that the defendant made during this interview on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>that the defendant had made the statements without having been properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that he had made them involuntarily. The defendant testified concerning the interview at the February 28, 2006 suppression hearing, and the state introduced the written police report of the interview. The trial court denied the motion to suppress on March 2, 2006.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">At trial, the prosecutor started to question Weisgerber about the interview and the police report and the defendant objected. The trial court excused the jury and noted that the statements that the defendant had made during the interview had been the subject of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, which the court had denied. The trial court acknowledged, however, that the defendant had reserved his right to object to the admission of the statements on grounds that he had not raised in the motion to suppress. Accordingly, it held a conference in chambers during which it heard the parties\u2019 arguments and ruled on the portions of the written police report about which Weisgerber would be permitted to testily.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">After the conference in chambers, the parties returned to the courtroom and defense counsel placed on the record her objections to the court\u2019s rulings. With respect to the defendant\u2019s statement in the written police report that he was not ready to share his opinion about who had committed the murder, defense counsel objected to its admission on the ground that the defendant was entitled to invoke his right to remain silent. She also objected to the admission of the defendant\u2019s statement that Weisgerber had \u201casked a very good question\u201d because it was intertwined with his statement that he was not going to discuss the crime scene, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>the trial court had excluded as an invocation of the defendant\u2019s rights. Defense counsel further objected to the admission of the defendant\u2019s statements that he was not willing to divulge information because the police were not going to release him, claiming that the statements were invocations of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Thereafter, the prosecutor continued his examination of Weisgerber. Weisgerber testified that, at the beginning of the interview, he advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant waived those rights and Weisgerber asked him when he had learned about the victim\u2019s death and when he had last seen the victim. The defendant said that he could not recall. Weisgerber then asked the defendant whether he was willing to answer questions at that time or if he would prefer to answer them at another time. The defendant responded that there would be plenty of time to talk later. When Weisgerber responded that this would be his only opportunity to talk to the police, the defendant responded that there was no hurry to discuss details. After answering several more questions, the defendant stated that the police had arrested the wrong person. When Weisgerber asked why he had made that statement, the defendant responded that he did not want to answer the question at that time because he knew that the police would not release him that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Weisgerber further testified that the defendant initially had declined Weisgerber\u2019s request that he give a written statement about the night of the murder, but ultimately indicated that he would like to provide one. The defendant repeatedly denied in his written statement that he had hurt the victim. The defendant then asked Weisgerber whether he believed that the defendant had murdered the victim, and Weisgerber replied that he did. Weisgerber testified that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>demeanor did not change when Weisgerber made this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Weisgerber further testified that, after the defendant answered several more questions, Weisgerber asked him whether he had ever been to Norwalk. The defendant responded that he had family in Connecticut, but that he would not speak about his family. Weisgerber testified that he then asked the defendant if he had gone to Norwalk with the victim and the defendant answered that he had not. Weisgerber again asked the defendant if he had gone to Norwalk with the victim on the night of the murder, and the defendant stated twice that \u201cthat was a very good question.\u201d Defense counsel then interrupted Weisgerber and asked for \u201cone moment with counsel.\u201d The prosecutor then asked Weisgerber to continue his testimony and Weisgerber stated that the defendant had advised him that, \u201cat that point he was not going to speak about the crime scene.\u201d The trial court asked defense counsel whether she objected to this testimony, and she indicated that she had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Weisgerber then testified that, shortly after stating that he was not going to talk about the crime scene, the defendant asked to go to the bathroom. Upon his return, he indicated that he knew the truth about the murder. When the prosecutor asked Weisgerber whether the defendant had been willing to tell the police what he knew at that point, Weisgerber responded that he had not. The prosecutor then asked why the defendant had been unwilling to talk to the police and Weisgerber stated that the defendant had said that he wanted to speak to counsel first. Defense counsel again interrupted and stated that the trial court had granted the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude that portion of the written report of the interview. After conferring with counsel, the trial court directed the jury to \u201ccompletely disregard\u201d Weisgerber\u2019s testimony that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>was not going to tell the police what he knew about the murder without talking to an attorney first.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The next day, the defendant filed a motion for mistrial claiming that the state had violated the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding the defendant\u2019s statement that he would not tell the police what he knew about the murder until he talked to an attorney. She argued that the testimony suggested that the defendant had been \u201ctrying to hide something\u201d by invoking his constitutional rights. The prosecutor conceded that Weisgerber inadvertently had violated the court\u2019s order, but argued that the defendant had not been prejudiced. The trial court concluded that the defendant had not been prejudiced by Weisgerber\u2019s brief reference to the defendant\u2019s request for counsel and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor referred to the statements made by the defendant during the March 29,2004 interview. The prosecutor stated, \u201cisn\u2019t it interesting that [the defendant] doesn\u2019t want to talk about where he was on the night [of the] murder nor what he did?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The defendant now claims that the admission of Weisgerber\u2019s testimony about these matters violated his fifth amendment rights under <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 611, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), which proscribed the use of <em>post-Miranda </em>silence or requests for an attorney against a defendant at trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court should not have permitted Weisgerber to testify that: (1) the defendant had told him that he was not yet ready to tell the police what he knew about the murder; (2) the defendant had initially refused to provide a written statement; and (3) the defendant\u2019s demeanor did not change when Weisgerber indicated that he believed that the defendant had killed the victim. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>defendant claims that the trial court improperly ruled that Weisgerber\u2019s testimony that the defendant had stated that he wanted to talk to an attorney before he spoke about the murder was inadvertent and was not prejudicial. Finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor violated <em>Doyle </em>when he commented on the defendant\u2019s silence during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly allowed Weisgerber to testify that the defendant had stated repeatedly that he did not want to tell the police what he knew about the murder. \u201cIn <em>Doyle . </em>. . the United States Supreme Court held that the impeachment of a defendant through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process. The court based its holding [on] two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is insolubly ambiguous and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important[ly], it observed that while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>283 Conn. 748, 764-65, 931 A.2d 198 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>Doyle </em>is not applicable, however, when the defendant has waived his right to remain silent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985). \u201cOnce an arrestee has waived his right to remain silent, the <em>Doyle </em>rationale is not operative because the arrestee has not remained silent and an explanatory statement assuredly is no longer \u2018insolubly ambiguous.\u2019 By speaking, the defendant has chosen unambiguously not to assert his right to remain silent. He knows that anything he says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>can and will be used against him. and it is manifestly illogical to theorize that he might be choosing not to assert the right to remain silent as to part of his exculpatory story, while invoking that right as to other parts of his story. While a defendant may invoke his right to remain silent at any time, even after he has initially waived his right to remain silent, it does not necessarily follow that he may remain \u2018selectively\u2019 silent.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In the present case, the defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and told the police that he could not recall how he had learned of the victim\u2019s death or when he had last seen the victim. He also stated that the police had arrested the wrong person and that he knew the truth about the murder. In addition, he gave a written statement in which he repeatedly denied that he had hurt the victim. Interspersed among these exculpatory statements, the defendant also made statements that he was not yet ready to tell the police everything that he knew about the murder and that he was not willing to discuss the crime scene.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He did not ask the police to end the interrogation, however, or indicate that he was reluctant to answer any inquiries until the point that he stated that he wanted to speak to an attorney, at which point the police ended the interview. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant had not invoked his right to remain silent by stating that he was not yet ready to discuss everything that he knew about the murder and, therefore, Weisgerber\u2019s testimony about those statements did not violate <em>Doyle?</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See id., 296 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(when defendant refused to divulge certain information about crime to police, but \u201cdid not ask that the interrogation be ended or indicate reluctance to answer other inquiries\u201d defendant failed to invoke fifth amendment right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of Weisgerber\u2019s testimony that the defendant initially declined to give a written statement violated <em>Doyle. </em>This claim was not preserved at trial and the defendant therefore seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We conclude that the claim is reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding, </em>but that the defendant cannot prevail under the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. When the prosecutor asked Weisgerber whether the defendant had been willing to give a written statement, Weisgerber responded that the defendant had declined to do so. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cA written statement?\u201d, thereby suggesting that he was surprised by Weisgerber\u2019s answer. When Weisgerber repeated his response, the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid there come [any time] where [the defendant] decided he wanted to put something down in writing?\u201d and Weisgerber answered affirmatively. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>clear, therefore, that the prosecutor had elicited Weisgerber\u2019s testimony that the defendant had initially declined to give a written statement in an attempt to explain the process by which the police had obtained the defendant\u2019s written statement, not to raise an inference that the defendant had been reluctant to cooperate with the police. \u201cWe have held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence that is . . . presented to show the investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded, is not inadmissible under <em>Doyle </em>. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. Jones, 215 Conn. 173, 186, 575 A.2d 216 (1990). We conclude, therefore, that this testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights under <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that Weisgerber\u2019s testimony that the defendant\u2019s demeanor did not change when Weisgerber told him that he believed that he had murdered the victim violated <em>Doyle. </em>Because this claim was not preserved at trial, we review it under <em>Golding. </em>In support of this claim, the defendant relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989). In that case, the defendant raised two <em>Doyle </em>claims. First, he claimed that the trial court improperly had admitted evidence that he had failed to deny killing his wife. Id., 462-63. Second, he claimed that the trial court improperly had admitted evidence of his demeanor when the police confronted him with the evidence of his guilt. Id., 464-65. This court concluded that the record was inadequate for review of the first claim because it was not clear whether the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent at that point. Id., 463. We agreed with the defendant, however, that, because he clearly had invoked his right to remain silent before the police confronted him with evidence of his guilt, evidence of his demeanor at that time was inadmissible under <em>Doyle. </em>Id., 468. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>we explicitly recognized in <em>Plourde </em>that <em>Doyle </em>does not require the exclusion of testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s postarrest conduct unless the defendant has invoked his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In the present case, we have already concluded that the defendant did not invoke his constitutional right to remain silent until he asked for an attorney, at which point the interview was terminated. We conclude, therefore, that Weisgerber\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s demeanor when Weisgerber said that he believed that the defendant was guilty was not inadmissible under <em>Plourde.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">We next consider whether Weisgerber\u2019s testimony that the defendant had refused to provide any more information about the murder to the police until he spoke with an attorney violated <em>Doyle. </em>As we have indicated, although the trial court had ruled that Weisgerber would not be permitted to give this testimony, it concluded that the testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights because it was inadvertent, brief, isolated and had not prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">This court held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 491, 556 A.2d 154 (1989), that \u201cthe constitution does not permit . . . extensive commentary on the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence,\u201d including \u201cthe defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel . . . .\u201d We conclude, therefore, that in the present case, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude testimony on the portion of the police report referring to the defendant\u2019s request for an attorney. We agree with the trial court, however, that, because Weisgerber\u2019s comment was inadvertent,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> brief and isolated, and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the trial court immediately gave a curative instruction to the jury, the testimony did not prejudice the defendant. See id., 492 (testimony by three witnesses that defendant had invoked his right to counsel was harmless because testimony was not highlighted by prosecutor and evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor violated <em>Doyle </em>when he commented on the defendant\u2019s silence during closing arguments. We conclude that the prosecutor did not violate <em>Doyle </em>by stating \u201cisn\u2019t it interesting that [the defendant] doesn\u2019t want to talk about where he was on the night [of the] murder nor what he did\u201d because, as we have already concluded, the defendant had not invoked his constitutional right to remain silent before stating that he did not want to provide details about the night of the murder. Because the defendant chose to talk to the police, any statements that he made properly could be used against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Lastly, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court inadequately instructed the jury regarding the credibility of Gagliardi\u2019s testimony. Specifically, he claims that the trial court should have given the cautionary instruction for jailhouse informants, as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>276 Conn. 452, 469, 886 A.2d <em>777 </em>(2005). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>292 Conn. 558, 569, 973 A.2d 1254 (2009) (extending requirement for special credibility instruction to testimony of all jailhouse informants, regardless of whether benefit has been promised), cert. denied, U.S. , 130 S. Ct. 1296, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1086 (2010). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Gagliardi testified at trial that, after she was arrested for drug offenses as the result of the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment, the Norwalk police interviewed her at the Mamaroneck police station. She gave two statements to the police that night. In the first statement, Gagliardi told police that the defendant had been angry because he believed that the victim had stolen his bracelet, that the defendant and the victim had left the defendant\u2019s apartment together on the night of the murder, that the victim never returned to the apartment and that Gagliardi previously had found a gun in the defendant\u2019s jacket. After a break, the police informed Gagliardi that the defendant was not taking responsibility for the drugs that had been seized from his apartment. Gagliardi testified that this upset her and, because she was upset, she gave a second statement indicating that the defendant had told her that he had shot the victim and that the defendant had asked her to provide an alibi. Gagliardi testified that she had received no benefit from the state in exchange for her testimony. She also testified that the drug charges against her had been reduced to misdemeanor charges, that she had served no time in jail<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and that she was not testifying at trial because the charges had been reduced to a misdemeanor. She further testified that she was not on probation and that, if she had not testified at the defendant\u2019s trial, there would have been no danger that the New York authorities would attempt to imprison her on the drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The defendant submitted a request to charge requesting that the trial court give a special credibility instruction regarding Gagliardi\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As legal authority for the charge, the defendant stated: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>charge is a compilation of the motive and accomplice charges approvingly cited in [D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, 5 Connecticut Practice Series: Criminal Jury Instructions (4th Ed. 2007) \u00a7 3.10, pp. 192-93], and a number of Connecticut cases as follows: <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, [210-12, 438 A.2d 418 (1980)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>196 Conn. 122, [132-33, 491 A.2d 382 (1985)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The trial court specifically instructed the jury that Gagliardi was an informing witness and that the jury could consider whether she had motives for testifying other than truthfully.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It did not instruct the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Gagliardi\u2019s testimony must be viewed with \u201cparticular scrutiny and weighed . . . with greater care than the testimony of an ordinary witness,\u201d as requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant now claims that he was entitled to a special credibility instruction in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 465, 469. We conclude that this claim was not preserved for review. The defendant stated in his request to charge that a charge regarding Gagliardi\u2019s testimony was required under our cases requiring a special credibility instruction for the testimony of accomplices and complaining witnesses. He did not explain to the trial court, however, why such a charge was required for Gagliardi\u2019s testimony when there was no suggestion in the case that she was implicated in the murder.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> He also did not argue that the charge was required under <em>Patterson </em>or explain to the trial court why the holding of that case, which required a special credibility instruction only for <em>jailhouse </em>informants; see id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 569; should be expanded to apply to <em>all </em>witnesses who testify that the defendant confessed to them.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cAs we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>have observed repeatedly, [t]o review [a] claim, which has been articulated for the first time on appeal and not before the trial court, would result in a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Konigsberg </em>v. <em>Board, of Aldermen, </em>283 Conn. 553, 597 n.24, 930 A.2d 1 (2007). Moreover, the defendant is not entitled to review under <em>Golding </em>because he has made no claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to give a special credibility instruction violated his constitutional rights. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> The fourth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\"> Article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-11\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> Weisgerber testified that he and Chrzanowski were in the kitchen of the apartment while the Mamaroneck police conducted the search.

Weisgerber testified, however, that he believed that the cell phone was still on the front seat of the vehicle when it was brought to the Mamaroneck police station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> The trial court did not rule explicitly on the question of whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his cell phone or its contents, but implicitly concluded that he did when the court concluded that the cell phone was covered by the search warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> The United States Supreme Court has held that the fact that a defendant had a possessory interest in an item that was sufficient to prove a possessory offense is not necessarily sufficient to establish that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the item. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salvucci, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 90 (rejecting \u201cunexamined assumption that a defendant\u2019s possession of a seized good sufficient to establish criminal culpability was also sufficient to establish [fjourth [ajmendment \u2018standing\u2019 \u201d). Similarly, in the present case, if the state had merely alleged that the defendant was in possession of the cell phone on the night of the murder, that allegation would not necessarily be sufficient to establish that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the cell phone. The state\u2019s claim that the cell phone was in the defendant\u2019s possession that night, however, was premised on undisputed evidence that tended to show that the defendant owned the cell phone and used it exclusively. We do not think that the state should be able to claim simultaneously that: (1) the cell phone records proved that the defendant traveled to Norwalk on the night of the murder because it was undisputed that the defendant owned and exclusively used the cell phone; and (2) the defendant has not proved that he owned or exercised control over the cell phone. Cf. id.

Nevertheless, the principles underlying the doctrine continue to provide guidance on the application of the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained outside the forum court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> A number of state courts have reached this conclusion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cauley, </em>supra, 863 S.W.2d 416 (\u201c[w]hen evidence is used in a Tennessee courtroom that has been obtained at the behest of Tennessee authorities pursuant to their own investigation of a crime occurring within our borders, as in the instant case, Tennessee\u2019s constitutional search and seizure principles should apply\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>132 Wash. 2d 529, 588, 940 P.2d 546 (1997) (whether statements legally obtained in California could be admitted trader Washington law depended on whether California police had acted as agents of Washington police), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1007, 118 S.

Other authorities have concluded, however, that, when the seizure of evidence was \u201cvalid under the law of the search jurisdiction but would be regarded as unlawful had it occurred in the forum . . . the evidence should be admitted even if police agents of the forum participated in the extrajurisdictional search.\u201d R.

Presumably, the rationale for this conclusion is that it would be unrealistic and counterproductive to require government officials of the search jurisdiction to comply with the law of the forum state. See, e.g., <em>Echols </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 571-72 (\u201cwe do not believe that the interest of Florida is served by imperially attempting to require that out-of-state police officials follow Florida law, and not the law of the situs, when they are requested to cooperate with Florida officials in investigating crimes committed in Florida\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Indeed, if the Norwalk police had intended to obtain the cell phone, they could have asked the Mamaroneck police to seize it from the defendant\u2019s automobile when he was arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\"> Under federal constitutional law, when an occupant has been arrested and there is reason to believe that the automobile contains evidence related to the offense of arrest, a search of the automobile is valid under the search incident to arrest exception.

The New York Court of Appeals has held that, under that state\u2019s constitution, the search incident to arrest exception \u201cexists only to protect against the danger that an arrestee may gain access to a weapon or may be able to destroy or conceal critical evidence. Thus, we have held that the scope of such a search must be limited to the arrestee\u2019s person and the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence . . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Blasich, </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 678.

Ct. 2016, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1109 (2009), the court expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he had a heightened expectation of privacy in his cell phone because it was capable of storing a large amount of information. The court stated that the defendant had \u201cnot provided the [c]ourt with any standard by which to determine what would constitute a \u2018large\u2019 storage capacity as opposed to a \u2018small\u2019 storage capacity, as he does not quantify these terms in any meaningful way. Second, [the defendant] has introduced no evidence that his cell phone had the requisite \u2018large\u2019 storage capacity which he contends is subject to a heightened expectation of privacy. Third, even assuming that his cell phone does have a \u2018large\u2019 storage capacity, his argument still fails because it is premised on the unwarranted assumption that information stored on a cell phone with a \u2018large\u2019 storage capacity would be any less volatile than the information stored on a cell phone with a \u2018small\u2019 storage capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">\u201cFinally, [the defendant\u2019s] argument must be rejected because to require police officers to ascertain the storage capacity of a cell phone before conducting a search would simply be an unworkable and unreasonable rule. It is unlikely that police officers would have any way of knowing whether the text messages and other information stored on a cell phone will be preserved or be automatically deleted simply by looking at the cell phone. . . . Rather, it is very likely that in the time it takes for officers to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>a cell phone\u2019s particular storage capacity, the information stored therein could be permanently lost.\u201d (Citation omitted.)

See <em>People </em>v. <em>Blasich, </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 678 (\u201c[t]wo considerations have generally been cited as justifying the exemption of car searches from the warrant requirement in appropriate circumstances: the reduced expectation of privacy associated with automobiles, and their inherent mobility which often makes it impracticable to obtain a warrant,\u201d); compare id. (under New York constitution, search incident to arrest exception to warrant requirement \u201cexists <em>only </em>to protect against the danger that an arrestee may gain access to a weapon or may be able to destroy or conceal critical evidence\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> Indeed, the trial court expressly found that \u201c[t]he [cell] phone was seized base[d] upon the experience of the police that it contained evidence of drug activity.\u201d The defendant contends that this finding was clearly erroneous because the Mamaroneck \u201cpolice never obtained search warrants for cell phones but automatically seized them in narcotics cases and searched them in the hopes that it would help in their investigations.\u201d Even if we assume that the police are required to specify cell phones when requesting authority to seize records of drug activities, however, the fact that the Mamaroneck police customarily did not ask for such authority does not mean that they would not receive it if they asked for it based on their experience that cell phones are likely to contain such records. Holland testified at the suppression hearing that the police customarily seized cell phones to determine whether calls had been made to persons who were known to be drug users or drug dealers. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s finding was supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> Gentile testified at the suppression hearing that these events occurred in December, 2002.

There is no constitutional prohibition on the admission of propensity evidence in Connecticut. As we have indicated, however, the admission of misconduct evidence to establish propensity is generally prohibited under \u00a7 4-5 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Although our cases have not expressly discussed the rationale for this prohibition, the rule presumably embodies \u201ca long-standing element of American law. It is part of our jurisprudential tradition that an accused may be convicted based only upon proof that he committed the crime with which he is charged \u2014 not based upon poor character or uncharged sins of the past. The rule against use of other misconduct evidence to suggest that the defendant had a propensity to commit crimes of the type charged recognizes that such evidence may have a too-powerful influence on the jurors, and may lead them to determine guilt based upon either a surmise that if the defendant did it before, he must have done it this time, or a belief that it matters little whether the defendant committed the charged crime because he deserves to be punished in any event for other transgressions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>126 Idaho 241, 244-45, 880 P.2d 771 (App. 1994).

You may consider his/her appearance and demeanor as a witness, the reasons she gave for telling the story to the state authorities, and among these <em>tests, to </em>consider whether any motive has appeared or any reason is apparent why she should seek to fasten so grave a crime upon the accused, if her story is untrue. The presence or absence of a motive is often an important factor to consider in a determination of the truth or falsity of a story. You may consider any promises that were made by a person in authority and the circumstances under which the informer\u2019s statement was made to any person in authority. You can also consider whether [her] complaint is retaliatory in nature and a response to her position that [the defendant] refused to exonerate her for illegally possessing narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">\u201cIn other words, the testimony of an informer who provides evidence against a defendant must be reviewed with particular scrutiny and weighed by you with greater care than the testimony of an ordinary witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">\u201cWhether the informer\u2019s testimony has been affected by interest or prejudice against the defendant is exclusively for you to determine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b774-11\"> The trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[a]n informing witness is one who claims to have heard the defendant make an admission about his case.

You may consider her appearance [and] demeanor as a witness, the reasons she gave for telling what she did to the state authorities, and among these tests to consider whether any motive has appeared for her to inform the authorities other than truthfully. It is for you to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>what credibility you will give . . . Gagliardi.

It is clear, therefore, that the complaining witness charge is required only when there is evidence that the witness committed the crime for which the defendant is being tried.

Rather, he contends that we should expand <em>Patterson </em>to apply to any witness who may have received a promise from the police or the prosecutor in exchange for his or her testimony. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>supra, 292 Conn. 569, however, we recognized that the credibility of jailhouse informants is particularly suspect because they \u201cfrequently have motives to testify falsely that may have nothing to do with the expectation of receiving benefits from the government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
