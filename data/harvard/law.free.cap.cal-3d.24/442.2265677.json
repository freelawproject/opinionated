J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQR\">\u2014 This case presents the question of whether an arbitrator\u2019s order and award conflicted with the Charter and Ordinances of the City of Berkeley, and are therefore not binding on the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On the night of April 16, 1974, Charles Crane, a permanent civil service employee with the rank of police inspector, dined at a Berkeley restaurant with a friend. As they left the restaurant, Crane saw three persons who appeared to be burglarizing his friend\u2019s automobile. While pursuing the suspects on foot, Crane fired two shots from his police service revolver, wounding one of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Four days later, City Manager John Taylor discharged Crane on the grounds that he had violated a city police regulation restricting the use of firearms in the course of police duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a member of the Berkeley Police Association, Crane invoked a grievance procedure which provided for arbitration of disputes relating to the discipline of police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">After preliminaiy steps in the grievance process had failed to produce accord, the parties signed an \u201carbitration submission agreement\u201d (submission agreement), which designated the issue to be decided by the arbitrator as follows: \u201c. . . \u2018Was Inspector Crane properly discharged by City Manager John L. Taylor as provided in the Charter of the City of Berkeley, applicable Ordinances, Resolutions, Personnel Rules, Regulations, and Department Orders, Rules and Regulations?\u2019 If not, what should the remedy be?\u201d William Eaton, an attorney and arbitrator, was designated to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">On March 6, 1975, Mr. Eaton issued his final opinion and award. The arbitrator found that Crane had violated the police regulations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>question. However, Eaton concluded that in view of all the facts, Crane should be suspended, not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In reaching this conclusion, Eaton carefully reviewed the evidence and circumstances of the case, including Crane\u2019s distinguished record. Crane\u2019s superiors had testified that he was the best investigating officer the department had ever known. They also testified that Crane worked long hours without thought of reward or extra compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The arbitrator noted that at the time of the incident in dispute, Crane had been working unusually long hours and was under considerable stress. Part of this stress related to the fact that Crane had been warned by the FBI that he had been marked for assassination by a violent political group which he had been investigating in connection with a bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The arbitrator also found it significant that the Alameda County District Attorney had expressly determined that Crane\u2019s actions did not warrant criminal prosecution under state law. In addition, Eaton noted that the city had been unable to show that it had ever clearly communicated to its police officers that a violation of the regulations in. question could result in discharge. Finally, the arbitrator\u2019s opinion emphasized testimony that if Crane\u2019s discharge were sustained, it would likely end his distinguished career as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In these circumstances, Eaton found that Crane\u2019s actions constituted sufficient cause for a substantial disciplinary suspension, but not for dismissal. Crane was ordered suspended for 30 days, but otherwise reinstated at rank with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The city refused to honor the arbitrator\u2019s award. The police association filed suit seeking judicial confirmation of the award. The city in turn sought a declaratory judgment that the award was void. After consolidating the actions, the trial court found that under the Berkeley City Charter, the city manager had the exclusive power to discipline or remove city employees. The court ruled that the findings and award of the arbitrator were in conflict with this power and that the award was not binding on the city. Crane and the police association appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Article VII, section 28 of the Berkeley City Charter grants the city manager the power and duty to \u201cappoint, discipline or remove\u201d city employees \u201csubject to the civil service provisions of this Charter.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201ccivil service provisions\u201d of the charter authorize the city to establish a personnel board \u201cto administer a personnel system under rules and regulations to be made by the Council.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The city council has exercised this authority by adopting Ordinance No. 2342-N.S. (personnel ordinance) and Resolution No. 34,480-N.S. (resolution). Together, these enactments establish a merit system of civil service employment under supervision of the city\u2019s personnel board. The personnel ordinance grants tenure to permanent city employees during good behavior and proved fitness for the position. (Personnel ordinance, \u00a7 12 (a).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The resolution provides that permanent employees may be discharged only \u201cfor a cause.\u201d (Resolution, rule XV, \u00a7 l.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Disciplined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>employees have a right to appeal to the personnel board. (Personnel ordinance, \u00a7 12 (b), \u00a7 13 (a); resolution, rule XVI, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">An alternative method of reviewing the city manager\u2019s disciplinaiy decisions has been created for members of the police association. Pursuant to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3500 et seq.), the city manager and the association have negotiated and executed a supplemental \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d (memorandum agreement), which the city council has ratified.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the agreement, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>parties are unable to come to terms, the matter is submitted to a six-member \u201cadjustment board,\u201d composed of an equal number of city and association representatives. (Memorandum agreement, \u00a7 2 (d).) If a majority of the adjustment board cannot agree on a resolution of the dispute, it may be referred to an impartial arbitrator. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2 (e).) When the grievance concerns suspension or discharge, the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding \u201cto the extent permitted by the Charter of the City.\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Appellants contend that the memorandum agreement does not conflict with any provision of the city charter. Therefore, appellants assert that the agreement was binding once it was adopted by the city council. <em>(Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 334-338 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To its credit, the city does not argue otherwise. It properly concedes that its charter permits it to agree to arbitrate grievances relating to employee discipline.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the city contends that in this particular arbitration, both the memorandum agreement and the submission agreement (see p. 445, <em>ante) </em>were improperly interpreted and applied in a way which conflicted with the city charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>At the outset, it is important to set forth the arbitrator\u2019s duties in this case. Under the memorandum agreement, an arbitrator\u2019s task is to resolve \u201cgrievances,\u201d which include any dispute involving the interpretation or application of city rules or regulations governing personnel practices or working conditions. (Memorandum agreement, \u00a7 1; see fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>One rule requiring interpretation and application in this arbitration was police regulation 106, which provides that an officer\u2019s violation of departmental regulations \u201cmay be considered sufficient cause for discharge, suspension, demotion, or other penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Under the submission agreement, arbitrator Eaton was to decide whether Crane had been \u201cproperly discharged\u201d according to city rules. In view of police regulation 106, Eaton interpreted that agreement as authorizing him to determine not only whether Crane had violated departmental regulations, but also whether a finding of violation provided <em>sufficient cause </em>for his removal. Appellants assert that Eaton was authorized by the agreements to resolve both issues, while respondents contend that his authority ended with his resolution of the first issue against Crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">As a rule, courts defer to arbitrators in determining the extent and meaning of arbitration agreements. <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Zuckerman </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 686, 690 [72 Cal.Rptr. 880, 446 P.2d 1000].) Although an award may be vacated if the arbitrator has exceeded his powers (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1286.2), ambiguities in the scope of arbitration are resolved in favor of coverage. <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 690; <em>East San Bernardino County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>City of San Bernardino </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 942, 953 [109 Cal.Rptr. 510].) Since the question submitted to Eaton was not limited to whether Crane had violated police regulations, these principles justify upholding Eaton\u2019s view of what was arbitrable under the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The city points out that it agreed to arbitrate grievances only \u201cto the extent permitted by [its] Charter . . . .\u201d (Memorandum agreement, \u00a7 2 (e); see fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>The city argues that its charter does not permit arbitration of the question of the <em>proper </em>penalty for an employee who has violated city rules. That discretion is reserved by the charter to the city manager, who may not assign it to another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Settled principles of construction compel rejection of this claim. A city charter is construed to permit the exercise of all powers not expressly limited by the charter or by superior state or federal law. <em>(City of Grass </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Valley </em>v. <em>Walkinshaw </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 595, 598-599 [212 P.2d 894].) Restrictions on a charter city\u2019s powers may not be implied. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 863, 867-868 [136 Cal.Rptr. 315].) It has long been recognized that a city may agree to arbitrate any matter which could be the subject of civil suit. <em>(Cary </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 443, 448 [184 P. 857].) Discipline of a permanent city employee is such a matter. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; see, e.g., <em>Perea </em>v. <em>Pales </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 939 [114 Cal.Rptr. 808].) Thus, unless the charter expressly prohibits the city from agreeing to arbitrate whether Crane\u2019s conduct was sufficient cause for his discharge, the city retains the power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The charter contains no such prohibition. It is true that article VII, section 28 gives the city manager the power and duty to \u201cappoint, discipline or remove all . . . subordinate officers and employees of the City, subject to the civil service provisions of this Charter.\u201d It is also true that the charter\u2019s civil service provisions authorize creation of a personnel board (charter, former art. IX, \u00a7 56), to which disciplined employees may appeal. (Personnel ordinance, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13; resolution, rule XVI; see fns. 3 and 6, <em>ante.) </em>However, there is no provision in the charter barring the creation of an alternative form of appeal, such as arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Accordingly, article VII, section 28 of the charter may be harmonized with the arbitration agreements. Section 28 vests in the city manager the <em>initial </em>discretion to determine the proper sanction for violation of city rules. The agreements at issue here do not remove that initial discretion. Instead, they subject it to binding review by an impartial arbitrator. (See <em>Fugitt </em>v. <em>City of Placentia </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 868, 875 [139 Cal.Rptr. 123].) Under the principles of construction set forth above, the grant of disciplinary power in section 28 may not be construed as a limitation upon the city manager\u2019s authority to agree to such review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The same reasoning applies to article VII, section 28, subdivision (c) of the charter. That subdivision provides that the city manager shall have the power \u201c[t]o exercise control over all departments, divisions and bureaus of the City Government and over all appointive officers and employees thereof.\u201d This provision vests control over city employees in the city manager <em>as opposed to </em>the city council or other city officials. Such a grant of initial control to one officer may not be read to limit his authority to agree to subject his disciplinary decisions to review by an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Further, the city has conceded that the city manager\u2019s control over employee relations does not bar arbitration over whether cause exists for an employee\u2019s discharge. The city agrees that an arbitrator may play this central role in the disciplinary process without intruding on the city manager\u2019s control. Once an arbitrator\u2019s significant participation in the disciplinary process is accepted, nothing on the face of section 28, subdivision (c) requires that his role be limited in the manner asserted by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This conclusion is reinforced by public policy considerations.  A favored means of resolving labor disputes in this state, arbitration eases the burdens on courts while resolving disputes quickly and inexpensively. (See <em>Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 608, 622 [116 Cal.Rptr. 507, 526 P.2d 971]; <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Drexel Burnham &amp; Co. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 706, 715 [125 Cal.Rptr. 147].) For these reasons, where a city charter or ordinance may be construed to authorize grievance arbitration of broad scope, that construction is preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The city argues that allowing an arbitrator the final word on the propriety of discharge would \u201cunlawfully delegate\u201d the city manager\u2019s discretion in personnel matters. However, since the city manager retains the significant power to initially impose discipline, there has been no \u201ctotal abdication\u201d of his disciplinary authority. <em>(Kugler </em>v. <em>Yocum </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 371, 384 [71 Cal.Rptr. 687, 445 P.2d 303].) Further, even if some portion of the city manager\u2019s powers is viewed as having been delegated, the exercise of that portion of authority is subject to adequate judicial safeguards. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1286.2; <em>Kugler, supra, </em>at pp. 379-381.) Under the principles of <em>Kugler, </em>there has been no unlawful delegation of the city manager\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The city\u2019s reliance on <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>City of Manhattan Beach </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 22 [132 Cal.Rptr. 668, 553 P.2d 1140] and <em>San Francisco Fire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Fighters </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 896 [137 Cal.Rptr. 607], is misplaced. In <em>Bagley, </em>this court held that the statutory duty of a general law city to fix compensation for its employees could not be delegated to an arbitrator when impasses in salary negotiations arose. In <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters, </em>the Court of Appeal held that a city agency\u2019s charter power to make rules governing the conduct of city fire fighters could not be assigned to an arbitrator. Thus, both cases involved the submission to arbitration of a <em>generalpolicymakingpower </em>to determine the terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The power to set the terms and conditions of public employment is broader and more intrusive upon the functions of city government than the arbitrator\u2019s authority in this case to resolve an individual grievance.  Grievance arbitration does not involve the making of general public policy. Instead, the arbitrator\u2019s role is confined to interpreting and applying terms which the employer itself has created or agreed to and which it is capable of making more or less precise. (Gradin, <em>California Public Employee Bargaining: The MMB Act in Relation to Local Charters and Ordinances </em>(1978) Cal. Pub. Employee Rel. No. 36, at p. 7.) In view of the more restricted role of arbitration in this case, this court finds no unlawful delegation of municipal powers of the kind existing in <em>Bagley </em>and <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Arbitrator Eaton\u2019s decision that Inspector Crane\u2019s conduct warranted suspension but not discharge was within the scope of the question submitted to him and the terms of the city\u2019s memorandum agreement on arbitration. Further, Eaton\u2019s decision did not conflict with any express provision of the Berkeley City Charter. For these reasons, the arbitration order and award were binding on the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The judgments are reversed and the trial court is directed to enter judgments confirming the arbitrator\u2019s findings and order of suspension and denying respondents\u2019 prayer for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-11\"> Police regulation 323 provides in pertinent part: \u201cOfficers shall not discharge firearms in connection with police duty except under the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">\u201c3.

Neither case is apposite. As discussed at pages 452-453, <em>post, Bagiev </em>involved arbitration of general policy matters, not grievance arbitration. <em>California Sch. Employees </em>involved neither arbitration nor any delegation. There, a public employee\u2019s dismissal was initiated by the wrong agency. It was held that the employee should be reinstated since improper procedures had been followed. This court expressly declined to decide whether there had been any improper delegation of the authority to initiate dismissals. (3 Cal.3d at p. 145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In th\u2018e present case, had the city manager ceded his initial discretion concerning employee discipline to an arbitrator, a question of unlawful delegation would be presented. In fact, however, the city manager did not delegate that discretion but exercised it himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b481-10\">RICHARDSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW8\">Concurring and Dissenting. \u2014 I concur in the judgments, but for reasons quite different from those of the majority. Under the Berkeley City Charter, as currently worded, nonjudicial limitations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the city manager\u2019s absolute power and discretion to discharge public employees are governed exclusively by the established civil service ordinance, rules and regulations adopted by authority of the charter. Hence, that power cannot be further delegated or circumscribed in a negotiated memorandum of understanding which provides an arbitration process directly contrary to governing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Article VII, section 28, of the charter vests the city manager with the \u201cpower and duty\u201d to \u201cappoint, discipline and remove\u201d subordinate city employees, without interference by the city council or its agents, and \u201csubject to the civil service provisions of this Charter.\u201d As the majority concedes, these \u201ccivil service provisions\u201d (now art. XVI, \u00a7 119) authorize establishment of a \u201cpersonnel system\u201d to be \u201cadminister[ed]\u201d by a \u201cpersonnel board\u201d under \u201crules and regulations to be made by the council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Fairly read together, these charter provisions give the city manager <em>sole </em>authority over hiring and firing, subject <em>only </em>to action by a <em>personnel board </em>(board) which supervises the civil service system under the council\u2019s <em>rules and regulations. </em>The council\u2019s power to delegate or circumscribe the city manager\u2019s disciplinary authority is thus <em>limited </em>by the terms of the charter, the \u201csupreme\u201d law of the city. (See <em>Harman </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 150, 161 [101 Cal.Rptr. 880, 496 P.2d 1248]; <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>City of Manhattan Beach </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 22, 26 [132 Cal.Rptr. 668, 553 P.2d 1140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">From the foregoing it seems apparent that the charter may not prevent the council from establishing, through properly adopted ordinances and rules, a <em>board-supervised </em>grievance procedure utilizing arbitration. The council, however, has chosen to implement the charter in another way. The city\u2019s personnel ordinance (Ord. No. 2342-NS, hereafter ordinance) confirms the city manager\u2019s authority over \u201ctransfers, promotions, demotions, reinstatements, layoffs,\u201d suspensions and dismissals of covered employees, \u201csubject to\u201d the provisions of the ordinance and subordinate rules arid regulations (rules). (\u00a7 4.) In turn, the rules (Res. No. 34,480-NS) state that employees may be discharged \u201cat any time by the City Manager\u201d for cause. (Rule XV, \u00a7 1.) Considered together, the Ordinance and rules invest the <em>board </em>with power to investigate and hear employee disciplinary matters. (Ord., \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13(a); rules XV, \u00a7 1, XVI.) The ordinance clearly provides that the rules are to \u201cgovern\u201d dismissal of employees (\u00a7 6(h)) and \u201cshall set forth <em>the </em>procedure for the hearing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>complaints made by employees in the competitive service.\u201d (\u00a7 13(a), italics added.) Nowhere in the charter, ordinance or rules is provision made for binding arbitration of employee grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The charter, ordinance and rules thus clearly establish that the city manager\u2019s sole disciplinary authority is reviewable <em>only </em>by the board. The memorandum of understanding, on the other hand, routes grievances by members of appellant association through a separate \u201cadjustment board\u201d and ultimately to binding arbitration. The personnel board is nowhere involved. Thus, as the majority concedes, the memorandum agreement completely bypasses the disciplinary procedures provided under the civil service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Official acts which conflict with a city\u2019s charter are void. <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 898, 923-924 [120 Cal.Rptr. 707, 534 P.2d 403]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 223, 230-233 [129 Cal.Rptr. 1].) A public agency <em>or officer </em>may not delegate discretionary functions in the absence of appropriate legislative authorization. <em>(Bagley </em>v. <em>City of Manhattan Beach, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 24-25; <em>California Sch. Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Personnel Commission </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 139, 144 [89 Cal.Rptr. 620, 474 P.2d 436].) A public employer may not negotiate employee benefits which directly conflict with a statute <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 808, 814 [135 Cal.Rptr. 386, 557 P.2d 970]) or charter <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>at pp. 919-924) even where, as here, the negotiations take place under \u201cmeet and confer\u201d provisions of a state law governing public sector labor relations <em>(id., </em>at p. 922). In fact, the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, under which the instant memorandum agreement was negotiated, expressly provides that it <em>does not supersede local charters, ordinances and rules governing merit of civil service systems. </em>(Gov. Code, \u00a7 3500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The majority stresses the fact that the <em>city manager himself </em>negotiated and approved both the original memorandum of understanding and the submission agreement under which this case was subjected to arbitration. However, as the foregoing cases explain, the no-delegation doctrine applies with as much force to the improper allocation by a public <em>executive </em>of his <em>administrative </em>powers, as to the surrender by a <em>governing body </em>of its <em>legislative </em>control. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The majority insists that the charter invests only \u201cinitial\u201d discretion over discipline in the city manager, and does not expressly preclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>council or city manager from ratifying arbitration as a means of <em>reviewing </em>that discretion, which would in any event be subject to judicial scrutiny. This interpretation must be adopted, the majority declares, in deference to the policy favoring arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">I cannot agree. The charter does indeed vest initial discretion in the city manager. However, contrary to the majority\u2019s view, that document, together with its implementing ordinance and rules, <em>unambiguously limits the ways in which that discretion may be delegated or circumscribed. </em>Though a public entity may normally agree to binding arbitration in lieu of judicial review (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281; <em>Viola, Inc. </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara High Sch. Dist. </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 425, 427-428 [80 Cal.Rptr. 784]), here the exclusive procedures for nonjudicial appeal are set forth in the city\u2019s laws and arbitration is not included. <em>(Bagley, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 26.) There may be, as the majority contends, valid policy reasons for compulsory arbitration, and the people of Berkeley may be well advised to authorize it. But they have not done so yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The majority asserts that the memorandum of understanding simply creates an \u201calternate method\u201d of grievance resolution applicable only to association members. The problem presented by the argument, however, is that the city\u2019s personnel ordinance <em>expressly includes police officers </em>among the employees covered by <em>its </em>provisions. (\u00a7 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Appellants do not suggest that the ratification of the memorandum of understanding substantially conformed to the requirements for any amendment of governing law. (See <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 898, 931; <em>Walker v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 626, 639 [12 Cal.Rptr. 671, 361 P.2d 247]; <em>City and County of S.F. </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 685, 692 [140 P.2d 666].) Indeed, the ordinance, besides establishing the board\u2019s sole jurisdiction over grievances, requires the board\u2019s <em>participation </em>in any amendment of the civil service rules. (\u00a7\u00a7 5(c), 6.) The charter, of course, may only be amended by vote of the people. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 34459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The majority emphasizes the city\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d that preliminary fact-finding, constituting a ministerial task, may properly be delegated to an arbitrator. (See, e.g., <em>California Sch. Employees Assn., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 144.) However, where the charter so explicitly provides a different means of grievance resolution, the rule permitting ministerial delegation does not apply. In any event, at issue here is an agreement under which the <em>entire </em>issue of proper discipline is submitted to arbitration. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>majority\u2019s reasoning, that any concession of <em>partial </em>arbitrability validates this entire proceeding, is manifestly improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The majority describes arbitration as a promising means of resolving public sector labor disputes. However, the citizens of Berkeley have chosen another method of administering their civil service system. They have opted for a procedure in which the lines of disciplinary authority are clear and grievances are fairly and efficiently resolved by a single expert agency applying <em>uniform </em>standards. These goals may also represent desirable public policy. (See, e.g., <em>Boren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 634, 641 [234 P.2d 981].) It is not for us, as judges, but for the people themselves, to decide the contrary. I would conclude that the arbitration procedure provided in the memorandum of understanding contravenes the charter and ordinances of the City of Berkeley, and is therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">I believe, however, that, on the particular facts of this case, the city is equitably estopped to deny liability under the arbitration award. Through its council, the city purported to ratify the original memorandum of understanding. The city manager executed an agreement submitting this case to arbitration; contrary to the city\u2019s position, the agreement clearly placed the entire matter of proper discipline of appellant Crane before the arbitrator. Under these circumstances, appellants could reasonably rely on the city\u2019s apparent authority and intent to cooperate. In doing so, they forfeited other avenues of administrative and judicial review which were available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">No public policy is served by preventing confirmation of the award in this case. Accordingly, I concur in the judgments of reversal. <em>(City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Mansell </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 493-501 [91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Clark, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
