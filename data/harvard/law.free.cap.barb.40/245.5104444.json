The average depreciation being from 40 to 50 per cent, which the plaintiffs refused to receive. And this action was commenced to recover the sum so deposited, with interest from the date of demand. The case was tried before Mr. Justice Hogeboom, and a judgment for the' plaintiffs entered October 15th, 1861, from which the defendants appealed to the general term of this court. The general term reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. <em>(See </em>37 <em>Barb. </em>62.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-11\">The cause was tried a second time, at the Hew York circuit, in June, 1862, before Justice Marvin, without a jury.

The contract on which this action is brought, created an obligation on the part of the defendants to pay to the holders $1781.42, in Illinois currency, of the same kind and character as that which was deposited. In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>(23 <em>Wend. </em>71,) action on a note payable in Canada money, Mr. Justice Cowen says: \u201c On the note in question, Canada money, a specific article, would be <em>lawful tender.\u201d </em>In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Failes, </em>(4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>245,) action on a note for $680, foreign bills, Parsons, Ch. J. says : \u201c A contract to pay money and a contract to pay money\u2019s worth in bills, appear to me to be essentially different; and if we were to render judgment on this verdict, it could not be pleaded in bar to an action * * * * on it as a contract to pay money in foreign bills.\u201d In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>(12 <em>Ill. Rep. </em>184,) action on a note of the defendant for payment of $131,480.50, in \u201c <em>State of Illinois indebtedness,\u201d </em>Ch. J. Treat <em>(p. </em>190) says: <em>\u201c </em>Where the promissor agrees to pay a certain sum'in <em>bank notes </em>or <em>other evidences-of indebtedness, </em>which purport on their face to represent dollars, and be <em>counted </em>as such, the sum is expressed to indicate the number of dollars of <em>the notes or evidences to be paid, </em>and <em>not the amount of the debt or consideration. </em>The <em>obligation is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>in fact but a promise to deliver </em>so many dollars, <em>numerically, </em>of <em>the securities described.\u201d </em>In <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Trotter, </em>(10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>94,) action on a note payable in bank notes of the chartered banks in Pennsylvania, Duncan, J. <em>(p. </em>96) said: \u201c It <em>was not a promise to pay money, </em>either in legal contemplation or the contemplation of the parties when they contracted. It is an <em>unanswerable objection </em>to the action, that the defendant might, according to this contract, <em>have tendered the </em>$500 <em>in the notes of any chartered bank, however depreciated the paper might be.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">II. The contract only entitled the holders to demand payment in <em>\u201c </em>Illinois currency of the same kind and character as that which was deposited.\u201d There is no evidence of any such demand, and no such fact found by the court below. Smith swears <em>\u201c </em>that he simply demanded payment of the certificate.\u201d The defendants did not refuse payment; they offered payment in gold or in current bills. In <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Bloomer, </em>(20 <em>Wend. </em>197,) action on a due-bill, payable in ready made clothing, Cowen, J. says: <em>\u201c </em>A special demand and refusal to perform were necessary;\u201d again, <em>(p. </em>200,) <em>\u201c </em>It is no answer to say that a demand was made <em>importing </em>that the plaintiff wanted his pay upon the noteand again, <em>\u201c </em>He [the defendant] was not bound to offer, but only to comply with a <em>proper demand.\u201d (See also Buck </em>v. <em>Burk, </em>18 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>337, 340, 346; <em>Lutweller v. Linnell, 12Barb. </em>512, 515; <em>Downs </em>v. <em>The Phoenix Bank, </em>6. <em>Hill, </em>297.) The demand made by Smith was not considered a legal demand, and it was <em>tvaived </em>by Bradner, Smith <em>&amp; </em>Co. the holders of the certificate. <em>(Buck </em>v. <em>Burk, </em>18 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>341.) Bradner, Smith <em>&amp; </em>Go. then requested a notary public to make a <em>special demand. </em>He demanded payment <em>in Illinois or other currency that would pass at par at Chicago, which was refused.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">III. When the special demand was made by the notary the defendants offered to pay the holders $1781 in Illinois currency that would not pass at par at Chicago, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>refused. The defendants are not in default. <em>(Battle </em>v. <em>Rochester City Bank, </em>3 <em>Comst. </em>88. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Hudson River R. R. Co., </em>12 <em>Barb. </em>156.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">IY. The action cannot be sustained in its present form, under any aspect. The demand made was for <em>cash; </em>and such is the action. ' The contract does not entitle the plaintiffs to cash, but only to <em>hank Mils </em>of <em>Illinois </em>banks\u2014a currency unknown to the laws of the state of Hew York, and the court below so held. The certificate should not have been received as evidence of a <em>cash </em>indebtedness, and the defendants\u2019 exception was well taken. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 162. <em>Prindle </em>v. <em>Caruthers, </em>15 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>429. <em>Seacord </em>v. <em>Burling, 5 Denio, </em>444. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Failes, </em>4 <em>Mass. </em>234. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>23 <em>Wend. </em>71, 73.) And the complaint should have been dismissed, for the reasons stated upon the several motions therefor. (1.) Because the defendants did not promise to pay money. (1 <em>R. S. </em>768, <em>marg. p. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>1, </em>4. <em>Leiber </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>5 <em>Cowen, </em>186. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Satterlee, 6 id. </em>108. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>23 <em>Wend. </em>71, 73. <em>Battle </em>v. <em>Rochester City Bank, </em>3 <em>Comst. </em>91, 92.) (2.) Because the plaintiffs did not show any transfer of the certificate to them from Bradner, Smith &amp; Co. (3.) Because the certificate is embraced by the terms of the restraining act of 1830, which prohibits the giving, paying, receiving or circulating of any evidence of debt, issued by any banking company, payable otherwise than in lawful money of the U. S. <em>(See </em>1 <em>R. S. </em>711, <em>&amp;c.) </em>Certificates of deposit are evidences of debt. <em>(Banking Laws of N. Y. p. </em>26.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">Y. The 5th finding of fact by the court below is not sustained by the evidence, which is that, on the 11th June, 1861, the demand was for \u00a71781.42 in Illinois or other currency that would pass at par in Chicago, which was refused. All that part of the 6th finding after \u00a71781.42 is not sustained by the evidence, which is that the defendants were willing and offered to pay to the holders of the contract \u00a71781.42 in depreciated' Illinois currency, which would not pass at par at Chicago. All that part of the 8th finding, af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ter the words <em>\" nominal par value\u2019\u2019 </em>is not sustained by evidence of any kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">YI. The facts found by the court below do not justify the judgment, and the conclusions of law drawn from the facts are erroneous. <em>(Smith </em>v. Devlin, 28 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>365.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-6\"><em>A. B. </em>Capwell, for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aco\">I. The instrument set forth in the complaint is in fact and in law a promissory note for the payment of money only; and as such was properly received in evidence. 1. The supreme court of the state of Illinois have expressly held that certificates of deposit, similar to the one in this case in all material respects, are promissory notes. <em>(Bank of Peru </em>v. Farnsworth, 18 <em>Ill. R. </em>553. <em>Laughlin </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>19 <em>id. </em>390.) 2. Certificates of deposit, payable at a future day, have been repeatedly held to be promissory nbtes within the restraining and prohibitory acts of this state. <em>(Bank of Orleans </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>295. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 <em>Coms. </em>19. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Talmage, A Kern. </em>178.) 3. Similar instruments have been held to be promissory notes, in other states and courts. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Austen, 13 How. U. S. 218; S. C. 5 McLean, </em>153. <em>Cary </em>v. <em>McDougald, </em>7 <em>Georgia Rep. </em>84.) 4. The fact that it is payable in Illinois currency, if proved, will not change the nature of the instrument. In the cases of Bank of Peru <em>v. </em>Farnsworth, and Laughlin <em>v. </em>Marshall, the certificates were for \u201c currency\u201d received, and were made payable \u201cin like funds\u201d and \u201cin currency.\u201d Yet the court held both to be \u201c promissory notes \"for the payment of money.\u201d <em>(See also Judah </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>19 <em>John. </em>144, <em>and cases cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">II. The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of variance was properly denied. The plaintiffs\u2019 title is not specifically denied in the answer. Their possession is therefore <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership, and their production of the same on the trial entitled them to recover upon it. <em>(Farmers and Mech. Bank of Genesee </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>24 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>547.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>III. On the trial, the court admitted evidence of a custom at Chicago, as to the meaning and application of the abbreviations \u201c 1ll. cy.,\u201d and held as a conclusion therefrom that this certificate was payable in \u201c Illinois currency,\u201d or in the words of the custom proved, \u201c Illinois currency of the same kind and character as that which was deposited.\u201d 1. In the third finding of facts, the court has found specifically that the kind and character of the deposit was <em>\u201c </em>currency or bills used in commercial transactions generally in the state at their nominal or par value.\u201d 2. It is clear from the evidence, and the court so found in the 8th finding of facts, that there were two or three banks whose bills would have answered to the kind and character required for payment on the day of the demand. 3. The defendants were not ready or willing to make such payment, but offered 60 cents gold, or bills which the court has found <em>\u201c </em>were uncurrent and would not be received or passed as ordinary currency in the ordinary transactions of business.\u201d Bor could they be used at all, except at a depreciation, on the average, of about 50 per cent of their nominal value. This was properly refused by the plaintiffs. 4. The defendants having thus refused to pay in Illinois currency, there is no error in the conclusion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the amount of the certificate and interest. 5. Indeed the only error appears to be in the finding and decision, deducting five per cent from the amount of the draft, but this is in the defendants\u2019 favor. It was doubtless to reduce the plaintiffs\u2019 money to a gold basis. If the defendants could be compelled to pay in gold, instead of in <em>\u201c </em>greenbacks,\u201d worth from 60 to 70 per cent in gold, the plaintiffs would have no ground for complaint.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b252-5\"><em>By the Court, </em>Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avy\">When this case was before the general term, on a former occasion, the Justice who delivered the opinion of the court observed that \u201c it would hardly be consistent with a fair interpretation of this contract that the defendants might receive bills on banks, on deposit, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>time worth quite or nearly par, and after using the same, be allowed to repay the amount in the same kind of money, even if it had become, since the deposit, worthless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">At the trial, evidence of a custom at Chicago was received tending to show that when deposits were made in the manner specified in this contract, repayment should be made in notes of the same character ; that is, in notes of Illinois banks, but current for the ordinary transactions of business, in the state of Illinois, at their nominal or par value. It was also proved that any bills of Illinois banks not depreciated more than five per cent would, on the 11th of June, 1862, when the certificate was presented for payment, at the banking house of the defendants, have been received in payment as ordinary currency in the state, in the ordinary transactions of business, at par.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">On the first perusal of the certificate in question I was inclined to the opinion that the defendants were liable to pay in specie ; the description of the paper specified in the certificate appearing to me to relate only to the bills received, and not to the manner in which repayment should be made. Certainly it would be a hard construction of the contract to infer from it that the parties intended, although the bills were current at the time they were received, that the defendants, after using them, should be allowed to repay the amount in the same kind of money after it had become depreciated. This would be a fair construction, if the deposit was a special one merely for safe keeping, when the same identical bills should be returned ; but where, as in the usual dealings between banks and their .depositors, the former use the money of the latter, nothing would be more unjust than that the banks, after applying the money when it was current, to their own business purposes, should be allowed, after it became uncurrent and depreciated, to apply bills of the same kind which they may have on hand, or which they may pick up among the brokers, to the repayment of the amount deposited.</p>\n<court id=\"b254-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>[New York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"ATHf\">May 4, 1863.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">If the-plaintiffs are not entitled to specie, they were'at least dinary transactions of business at par. entitled to payment in Illinois currency receivable in the or-</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\"><em>Sutherland, Clerke </em>and <em>Mullin, </em>Justiees.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
