That said count is fatally defective is apparent because the accusation therein made is by the affidavit of D. S. Bedell and is not the presentment of the prosecuting attorney. The rule is well established that, if separate counts be set out in the information, such counts, to be sufficient, must show to have been the presentment of, or to have been presented by, the prosecuting attorney.
