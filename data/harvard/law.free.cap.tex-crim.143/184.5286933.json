It is essential that the recognizance contain a recital that the accused has been convicted of an offense. Art. 831, C. C. P.; Gressett v. State, 138 Tex. Cr. R. 295, 135 S. W. (2d) 990; Maultsby v.

Since then and in due time, appellant has filed in this court a certified copy of a recognizance containing the same defects, together with a prayer for the rehearing in this case. Appellant has not deemed it necessary to file a motion to reinstate the appeal, accompanied by an appeal bond or a corrected recognizance. Hence we adhere to our original opinion dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Furthermore, <em>we </em>note that there is no judgment of conviction in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The motion to reinstate the appeal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
