The question for determination here is whether the complaint was sufficient to-support the information. In this connection, it appears that appellant moved to quash the information because of a variance between , the name of the purchaser of the whiskey as stated in the complaint and that as set forth in the information. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>trial court overruled the motion to quash, and, over appellant\u2019s objection, permitted the State to amend the complaint by changing the name of the alleged purchaser as it appeared therein to the name as stated in the information. In this the trial court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In Patillo v. State, 3 Tex. App. 442, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\u201cClearly, the court had no right to amend, or permit any one else to amend, the affidavit. Affiant himself could not have done so without being sworn anew as to the amended statement. Whenever the court permitted the county attorney to amend the affidavit, it ceased to be the act of affiant; \u2014 \u2014 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ <em>99 </em>See, also, Phariss v. State, 126 S. W.
