After the repeal of the national prohibition law Dallam County held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>another election and legalized the sale of beer under the Liquor Control Act, but did not legalize the sale of whiskey. The court in his charge instructed the jury as a matter of law that Dallam County is a wet county as defined by the Liquor Control Act and an area in which the sale of alcoholic beverages containing alcohol in excess of four percent by weight could be legally carried on under a legal permit. This seems to be directly in conflict with the record of the court approving appellant\u2019s bill of exception number one embracing exceptions to the court\u2019s charge. In approving said bill of exception the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u201cExamined by the court and approved in all things as correctly reflecting the facts, the evidence as the local option elections and Status of Dallam County, Texas when the Constitutional amendment was enacted as a law repealing the prohibition law or Dean Act, and Dallam County at said time as shown by the records and evidence herein was a Dry Area and the only local option election as shown by the evidence in this case was to permit 3.2 liquor by weight to be sold under a legal permit in Dallam County, Texas, and the court being of the opinion that regardless of said evidence it must take judicial notice of whether or not Dallam County is a Wet or Dry Area, did instruct the jury that said Area is a wet area and disregarded the evidence thereon as produced by the defendant, and here and now ordered filed with the above qualification as a part of the record herein and as defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions number one, this the 22 day of October, 1941.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The definition of a \u201cdry area\u201d and of a \u201cwet area\u201d seem to be relative terms as set out in Subdivision 23 of Art. 666, Penal Code, and from the facts stated in the foregoing quotation from the court\u2019s qualification of the bill it would appear to be the correct conclusion that Dallam County is a \u201cdry area\u201d as to the sale of whiskey and other alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.2 per cent alcohol by weight. At the same time it is a \u201cwet area\u201d as to beer and those liquors which do not contain more than 3.2 percent of alcohol by weight. The appellant was charged in this case with the sale of whiskey containing alcohol in excess of four percent by weight. Consequently, as to the sale of the liquor charged, Dallam County is a dry area. This being true, the whole theory of the case was erroneously charged and the proof would not sustain a conviction for the offense alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
