Recently this matter has been considered in the cases of R. C. Davis v. State, No. 21,699, (142 Texas Crim. Reports, 602) and Pete Houston v. State, No. 21,684, (Reported in this volume) (neither of which have been reported) and decided adversely to appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">No other question is presented.
