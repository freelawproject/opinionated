Barron, Jr., </em>of Bryan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-8\"><em>Spurgeon E. Bell, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aks\">GRAVES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Appellant was convicted of unlawfully carrying a pistol, and by the jury fined the sum of $100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The State\u2019s testimony shows that during an altercation at a dine and drink establishment appellant produced a pistol and displayed the same, the State\u2019s witnesses contending that such was a blue colored bona fide pistol loaded with cartridges and ball, and appellant contending that same was a bright colored toy pistol. The jury evidently believed the State\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Bill of exceptions No. 1 complains of the argument of the State\u2019s attorney wherein he said to the jury in his final argument that \u201cI think where a man goes to a honkey-tonk at midnight he ought to have to pay a fine on general principles.\u201d This argument, while possibly appealing to many people, does not seem to us to be called for nor proper in a discussion of the facts herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Bill of exceptions No. 2 again complains relative to a statement of the State\u2019s attorney to the jury in his final argument. It appears that the complaining witness was present in the establishment above referred to as a honkey-tonk in company with a Miss Regmund. The complained of argument upon the part of the State\u2019s attorney was as follows: <em>\u201cI </em>have known the Regmund family and there is no finer family in Brazos County than the Regmund family.\u201d We think this was unsworn testimony that should not have been given in an argument before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Bill No. 3 arose in the following manner: Appellant\u2019s brother Steve Garza, according to the testimony, was engaged in some kind of a difficulty with the complaining witness Ca-hill, when appellant appeared with what the State\u2019s witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>say was a bona fide pistol and exhibited the same. While this brother, Steve Garza, was on the stand, the State, over appellant\u2019s objection, asked him if he had not been charged in the justice court with a simple assault upon Cahill and had paid a fine therefor, to which the witness answered that he had, over the objection of appellant. We do not think the same was admissible. It could only have been used to affect the witness\u2019 credibility, and a simple assault is not a crime involving moral turpitude. See Branch\u2019s Criminal Law, Sec. 868, p. 551; Hardin v. State, 57 Tex. Cr. R. 401, 123 S. W. 613; Gray v. State, 86 S. W. 764; Brittain v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep. 406, 411, 37 S. W. 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Bill of exceptions No. 4 also complains of the following argument of the State\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cAny man that rides up and down the highways of this great state of ours in the dead hour of night and visits honkey-tonks, or any other place, armed with a pistol, is a potential murderer and ought to be convicted for it. A man that would walk around the streets of this great country of ours and great state, and this great democracy of ours armed with a pistol, well, I had better not state what I want to say, counsel might object to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">It seems to us that counsel in his enthusiasm may have said things in this statement that appealed not only to him but also to many others, -and though same may not have been called for by the facts, we are not impressed with the idea that, standing alone, it evidences any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Bill No. 6 evidences the following: While the State\u2019s attorney was making his final argument to the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel arose and objected to a certain portion thereof, whereupon the State\u2019s attorney said: \u201cYour Honor, please, if counsel wants to make another speech, I would like to sit down and let him,\u201d and he did sit down, at which point the court said: \u201cHe has the right to object,\u201d whereupon the State\u2019s attorney said: \u201cI don\u2019t think a pistol toter in this country has got any right.\u201d At the request of appellant the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the conduct and statements of the State\u2019s attorney, nevertheless an exception was reserved to such, by appellant\u2019s attorney. W\u00e9 think such conduct and statement should not have been indulged in. A pistol toter or honkeytonk frequenter all have their rights in court or elsewhere, no matter how reprehensible their conduct may be, they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>a right to a fair trial before an unprejudiced jury, given to them by the same law that protects us all, and we do not think such conduct as herein complained of was conducive to such trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Taking into consideration the various matters complained of in these bills of exceptions, we think this cause should be reversed, and the judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
