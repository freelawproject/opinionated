There is no objection shown to its introduction, nor even any showing as to whether same was introduced. We are not informed nor do we see why such order, standing alone, should be found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The order thus found in the transcript is the identical order that we have recently passed upon in the recent case of Arthur Taylor v. State, from Hill County, our No. 21924, opinion delivered February 11, 1942, (Page 354 of this volume) and in which last named case such order was held to be a valid order, and that same put into effect the law prohibiting the .sale of intoxicating liquors in Hill County, Texas, in February, 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">By virtue of the authority of the above case of Taylor v. State, this judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
