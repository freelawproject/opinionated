We also find a further bill of exceptions to the complaint \u201cbecause it does not appear on the face of same that an offense against the law of this State was committed by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We have carefully examined the complaint herein, and we think same is not subject to the objections leveled thereat by appellant. The pleading is in three counts, all based on forms 502 and 503, p. 303, Willson\u2019s Texas Criminal Forms, Fifth edition, and such forms were evidently before the pleader in making such allegations. We hold the complaint to be sufficient to charge the offense of an aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
