The bill of exception presenting this question affirmatively reflects that the jurors selected to try this case stated that they had no opinion in the cause and were not in any manner biased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>in favor of or prejudiced' against the \u00e1ppell\u00e1nt.

It is only when such a\" juror has formed or expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused that he is disqualified to sit in the case. Sec. 13 of Art. 616, Vernon\u2019s Annot.
