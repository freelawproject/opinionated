The State.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b246-6\">No. 21795.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AoN\">Delivered December 10, 1941.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b246-7\">Rehearing Denied January 28, '1942.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-16\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-17\"><em>Mel Janes, </em>of Lubbock, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-18\"><em>Sam H. Dawidson, </em>County Attorney, of Levelland, and <em>Spurgeon E. Bell, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-19\">BEAUCHAMP, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">This appeal is from a fine of $100.00 for violation of the local option law and is from the county court of Hockley County.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-21\">There is only one bill of exception in the case, which complains of the testimony of an officer that he had arrested appellant on a previous occasion for violation of the liquor laws. Prior to this testimony, appellant, at the instance of his counsel, had told of having been arrested and kept in jail about twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>minutes, and said if he signed a bond he did not remember it. Neither did he know what became of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The statement of facts found in the case appears in question and answer form and we are, therefore, unable to give it any consideration. In the absence of this we cannot appraise the value of the bill of exception, but it appears to us that it is perfectly proper for the State to make a full explanation about a matter which was brought out by appellant himself and about which he did not seem to be certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We find no error, in the record and, consequently, aifirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b247-8\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The particular offense for which appellant was convicted was the sale of whiskey in a wet area, without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">In his motion for rehearing, appellant insists that there was no proof showing that Hockley County was a \u201cwet\u201d area. As pointed out in the original opinion, no statement of facts is before us for consideration; hence, we are unable to apprize appellant\u2019s contention. Moreover, under the terms of Art. 666-23, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, all area of the State is \u201cwet,\u201d except that which has been determined to be \u201cdry.\u201d Unless the proof shows that the area is \u201cdry,\u201d it is by law \u201cwet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
