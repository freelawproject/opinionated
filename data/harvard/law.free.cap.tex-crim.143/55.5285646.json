We do no think the language of the indictment is subject to such criticism. No brief has been filed in the case, and the bill of exception does not point out the object of the motion so as to convey to us just what appellant had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The procedure appears to be regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
