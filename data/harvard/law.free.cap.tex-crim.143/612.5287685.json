No brief was filed in behalf of appellant by the date of submission on February 11th and none was tendered for filing on or before February 18th. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not appear on said date to make an oral argument in his behalf. It, therefore, appears that appellant\u2019s complaint that he was defeated in his right to present the case in this court is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We have examined the evidence on the question of identification and considered the argument thereon in the motion for rehearing. We are of the opinion that a proper dispostion was made of the questions raised and that the motion for rehearing should be denied, which is, accordingly, done.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
