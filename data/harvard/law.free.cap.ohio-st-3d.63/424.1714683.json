The court of appeals found no prejudice because the trial court specifically instructed the jury \u201c * * * not to consider in any way the evidence pertaining to crimes committed by the defendant against other persons.\u201d However, Waddy argues that the instruction could not erase the evidence of the other crimes from the minds of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">Waddy assumes that the Wilson, Jackson, and Milligan crimes are irrelevant to whether he should be executed for murdering Mason. His assumption is erroneous. Waddy\u2019s record of criminal behavior is directly relevant to his \u201chistory, character and background,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B), which a sentencing jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>must consider. Accordingly, Waddy\u2019s first proposition of law must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In his second proposition of law, Waddy claims joinder denied him a fair trial. It is well settled that the law favors joinder; therefore, in order to prevail, Waddy must show that the trial court abused its discretion by joining the indictments. See <em>State v. Franklin </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The state argues that, had the offenses not been joined, evidence of each crime joined at trial would have been admissible at the trial of each of the others, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). See, <em>e.g., State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 306, 533 N.E.2d 701, 708. Here, the evidence of the Wilson, Jackson, and Milligan crimes was relevant to Mason\u2019s murder. Red fibers like those found in Mason\u2019s apartment, in her car, and on the screwdriver apparently used to open her window were also found in Wilson\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s apartments. All these fibers were consistent with the red gloves in Waddy\u2019s closet. Thus, if Waddy raped Wilson and robbed Jackson, leaving red fibers in their apartments, that evidence tends to prove that he also murdered Mason and left red fibers in her apartment and car.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Additionally, the Wilson and Jackson crimes share a similar <em>modus operandi </em>with the murder. In each case, Waddy entered a woman\u2019s apartment at night; he bound the victim\u2019s wrists behind her back and tied her ankles; he used a knife; he called each victim a \u201cbitch\u201d (cf. <em>State v. Broom </em>[1988], 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 282, 533 N.E.2d 682, 690); he took the victim\u2019s car or car keys; and he stole or demanded bank cards or credit cards. The crimes occurred within a three-month period and within walking distance of each other. Cf. <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 186, 552 N.E.2d 180, 184. Waddy points out that the crimes differ in some ways; however, such differences go to weight, not admissibility. <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 187, 552 N.E.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The Milligan crimes were admissible for a different reason. Milligan testified that Waddy, during a phone call, boasted of killing Mason. Both the call and the boast were part of Waddy\u2019s extortion plot against Milligan; without the whole story of the extortion, the jury could not have understood Milligan\u2019s highly probative testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Finding no abuse of discretion, we conclude that joinder was proper, and overrule Waddy\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Evidentiary Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">In his thirteenth proposition of law, Waddy asserts that the state failed to prove his guilt of the counts involving Mason. In his fifteenth, he makes the same assertion about the counts involving Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>When a defendant challenges the legal sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573. The weight and credibility of the evidence are left to the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We reiterate these basic principles, not just for the sake of analytic completeness, but also because litigants too frequently ignore them. In several propositions of law, including these, Waddy in effect asks us to resolve evidentiary conflicts in his favor and substitute our evaluation of witness credibility for the jury\u2019s. This is not the first case to employ this tactic. See, <em>e.g., State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 25, 544 N.E.2d 895, 905; <em>Jamison, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 191, 552 N.E.2d at 189; <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 553 N.E.2d 576, 589. We once again state that \u201c[n]ot even in a capital case may we sit as a \u2018thirteenth juror,\u2019 * * * as to a judgment of conviction.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 33, 553 N.E.2d at 589. With that in mind, we turn to Waddy\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Waddy asserts that all the evidence tying him to Mason\u2019s murder was circumstantial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and argues that the evidence is not \u201cirreconcilable with any reasonable theory of * * * innocence,\u201d citing <em>State v. Kulig </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St.2d 157, 66 O.O.2d 351, 309 N.E.2d 897, syllabus. However, our recent decision in <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph one of the syllabus, overruled <em>Kulig. </em>Circumstantial and direct evidence are now subject to the same standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The evidence of Waddy\u2019s guilt includes his boast to Milligan that he had strangled a young woman at Jefferson and Broad. This statement inculpates Waddy in two ways. First, the state introduced evidence that the manner of Mason\u2019s death had not been released to the public; thus, only the killer would have known that Mason had been strangled. (Waddy points out that one witness testified that the manner of Mason\u2019s death was common knowledge in the neighborhood. But that, as we have noted, is a jury question. <em>DeHass, supra.) </em>Second, even had the details of the killing been widely known, Waddy\u2019s statement that he killed Mason obviously has independent probative force as an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Another key element in the state\u2019s proof was trace evidence. Red fibers kept turning up where Waddy had been. Waddy had a pair of red gloves in his closet, and he left red fibers at the scenes of his other crimes. Thus, when red fibers found in Mason\u2019s apartment and car proved consistent with Waddy\u2019s gloves and with the fibers at the Jackson and Wilson crime scenes, the jury could infer that they came from Waddy. Moreover, one of the screwdrivers found near the Jeffersonian Apartments had on its handle not only a red fiber but a blue fiber that matched the material of a blue stocking hat found in Waddy\u2019s closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Other physical evidence firmly tied Waddy to the murder. His fingerprint was found on a plastic jewelry box left near Mason\u2019s residence. Mason owned an identical box, which was missing from her apartment after the murder. And the torn edge of the piece of white tape on the washcloth was \u201can exact match\u201d with the edge of a similar roll of white tape found in Waddy\u2019s house. Thus, a reasonable jury could find that the piece of tape had been torn off that roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">According to Greg Jefferson and Allen Russell, Waddy had Mason\u2019s credit card in his possession. A black male was seen shortly after Mason\u2019s death, driving Mason\u2019s car to Gay Street and Pearl Alley, near a bank that accepted Anytime Bank cards. Additionally, an Anytime Bank card was found in Mason\u2019s car. (Part of Waddy\u2019s <em>modus operandi </em>was stealing credit cards and bank cards, as shown by the Wilson, Jackson, and Milligan cases.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the defense tried to blame Jefferson for the murder, the witness who saw the car testified that Jefferson was not the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Finally, in addition to the red fibers, Mason\u2019s murder had several other features in common with the Wilson and Jackson crimes (see our discussion, <em>supra, </em>of Waddy\u2019s second proposition of law), indicating that a single individual committed all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">On this evidence, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Waddy murdered Paula Mason. Waddy\u2019s thirteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">In his fifteenth proposition of law, Waddy alleges that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him of aggravated assault, aggravated robbery, and burglary in the Jackson case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Jackson identified Waddy\u2019s voice as the burglar\u2019s. Police found red fibers in the knots of Jackson\u2019s bindings; these fibers, like those found in Mason\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s apartments, were consistent with the red gloves found in Waddy\u2019s closet. Moreover, in the same closet were Jackson\u2019s car keys with their unique keychain. Jackson positively identified the keys and keychain.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Waddy testified that his daughter found the keys outdoors. He points out that the keys, which were not rusty when stolen, had rusted by the time police found them. Waddy claims that they could have become rusty only if left outdoors, but the record contains no evidence of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Waddy also tries to discredit Jackson\u2019s identification testimony by pointing to a minor memory lapse of hers and citing testimony of other witnesses. Again, we refuse to second-guess the jury\u2019s credibility determination. Based upon the evidence a rational jury could have believed Jackson despite Waddy\u2019s possible impeachment of her testimony. Therefore, Waddy\u2019s fifteenth proposition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In his fourteenth and sixteenth propositions of law, Waddy contends that these convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Since we do not review appeals on that basis, see, <em>e.g., Cooey, supra, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 26, 544 N.E.2d at 905-906, we must overrule these propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"ATfq\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\"><em>Brady </em>Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">In his ninth proposition of law, Waddy contends that the prosecution illegally withheld evidence favorable to him and material to guilt or punishment, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, and Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Prosecution witness Karen Martin testified that, on the morning of July 18, she saw a medium- to dark-skinned black male driving Mason\u2019s car. Martin did not identify Waddy, but she specifically testified that Greg Jefferson (who she saw leaving the courtroom just before she testified) was not the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">On cross-examination, Martin testified that, when she reported the incident, detectives showed her a photographic array, but she could not pick out the driver. After Martin stepped down, the defense moved for a mistrial, arguing that her failure to pick Waddy out of the array (assuming his picture was in it) was evidence favorable to the defense which the state should have disclosed before trial. The trial court denied a mistrial and a motion to strike Martin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>testimony, but ordered the prosecution to reconstruct the array for defense counsel to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The next day, Sergeants Nash and Sears, Columbus homicide detectives, testified outside the jury\u2019s presence that they had never shown Martin a photo array. The defense renewed its motion to strike Martin\u2019s testimony, which was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Waddy argues that, if Martin did see a photo array, the defense had a right to examine it. If Waddy\u2019s photo was in the array, he argues, Martin\u2019s inability to identify him was favorable evidence, and the array should have been presented to the jury. But Sears and Nash testified that they did not show Martin an array \u2014 thus supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation. Since the record supports this finding, we cannot say it was wrong; resolving such factual disputes are within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Waddy argues that, if the trial court believed that Martin did not see an array, it should have stricken her testimony regarding the photo identification as irrelevant under Evid.R. 104(B). This argument is academic, since Martin\u2019s testimony regarding the array \u2014 that she did not see the driver of Mason\u2019s car in it \u2014 clearly could not have harmed Waddy.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Waddy also complains that the jury was not allowed to hear Nash and Sears testify that they showed no photo array to Martin. We disagree. Although the detectives testified outside the jury\u2019s presence in the motion hearing, the state later called both men to testify before the jury. Waddy asked about the photo array on cross-examination. See Staff Note to Evid.R. 611(B) (cross-examination not limited to scope of direct).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Even if Martin saw a photo array with Waddy\u2019s photo in it, we cannot conclude that the array was \u201cmaterial either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d at 218. \u201cThe evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">We think the array, if it existed at all, fails Bagley\u2019s materiality test. Martin did not eliminate Waddy as the driver of Mason\u2019s car; she merely failed to identify him. This does little to refute the inference that Waddy was the driver. Indeed, some courts hold that a witness\u2019s failure to identify the defendant is not exculpatory evidence at all. See <em>McMullin v. State </em>(Ala. Crim.App.1983), 442 So.2d 155, 158; <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(D.C.App.1988), 544 A.2d 270, 275; but, see, <em>Evans v. Janing </em>(C.A. 8, 1973), 489 F.2d 470, 476, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>quoting <em>United States v. Ash </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 300, 318-319, 93 S.Ct. 2568, 2578, 37 L.Ed.2d 619, 632; <em>State v. Reddick </em>(1985), 197 Conn. 115, 120-121, 496 A.2d 466, 470. We need not go so far; Martin\u2019s failure to pick Waddy out of an array might be \u201cfavorable\u201d evidence, but it would clearly not be so favorable that the state\u2019s failure to disclose it could undermine confidence in the result, given the evidence of Waddy\u2019s guilt. Waddy\u2019s ninth proposition is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Separation of Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In his tenth proposition of law, Waddy contends that Detective Sears spoke to Allen Russell before Russell testified, and thus violated the trial court\u2019s order for separation of witnesses. On cross-examination, Russell testified that Sears had discussed the case with him the previous day when Russell was in the prosecutor\u2019s office for fifteen to twenty minutes with Assistant Prosecutor David Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Russell quoted Sears as saying: \u201cI want the same thing said that was said in the very beginning of this case.\u201d Testifying outside the jury\u2019s presence, Sears characterized the discussion differently. Sears testified that he told Russell \u201cthat he explained some facts back in July and August of 1986, and I expected him to explain those same facts to Mr. Johnson [assistant prosecutor].\u201d Sears and Russell both testified that Sears told Russell to tell the truth. Johnson also told Russell \u201cover and over and over\u201d to tell the truth. Russell described Sears\u2019s manner as \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cassertive.\u201d Sears admitted he raised his voice during the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Apparently Sears did not technically violate the separation order: so far as the record shows, he was not in the courtroom when Russell testified. However, Waddy claims that Sears\u2019s out-of-court contact with another witness violated the purpose of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The purpose of a separation order is \u201cso that [witnesses] cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses,\u201d Evid.R. 615, and tailor their own testimony accordingly. Thus, a spectator or witness may not tell a prospective witness what has taken place in court if the judge has ordered separation of witnesses. <em>State v. Spirko </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 1, 14, 570 N.E.2d 229, 246. However, at the time of their conversation, neither Sears nor Russell had yet testified. There is no evidence that Sears disclosed any witness\u2019s testimony to Russell, nor does Waddy so claim. Thus, Sears violated neither the letter nor the spirit of the separation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Waddy also charges that Sears sought to influence Russell\u2019s testimony with \u201cintimidation\u201d and \u201cthreats.\u201d However, both Sears and Johnson repeatedly insisted that Russell tell the truth, as Russell conceded. Yet Russell did not explain how Sears wanted him to testify (except that Sears wanted him to stay consistent with earlier statements, which are not in the record). We find no merit in Waddy\u2019s tenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Testimony by Prosecutor\u2019s Staff</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">State\u2019s Exhibits PM-24 and PM-25 are Columbus Dispatch articles about Mason\u2019s murder, introduced to show that the public did not know Mason was strangled. This was relevant because Waddy told Milligan that Mason was strangled; the state claimed Waddy could not have learned that from the newspapers. Carmelina Conti of the Franklin County Prosecutor\u2019s Office identified PM-24 and PM-25 as the only articles about the murder she found in two public libraries.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Waddy\u2019s twelfth proposition of law asserts that the articles were hearsay. However, they were not introduced for the truth of any matter asserted therein. See Evid.R. 801(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Waddy further suggests the state violated the Code of Professional Responsibility by having a member of the prosecutor\u2019s staff testify. However, he cites no Disciplinary Rule forbidding an attorney to call an employee to testify. None exists. Under DR 5-101(B) and 5-102, a lawyer generally may not represent a client if \u201che or a <em>lawyer </em>in his firm ought to be called as a witness * * (Emphasis added.) But the record does not show Conti was a lawyer. Moreover, cross-examination could expose any bias on Conti\u2019s part. This proposition therefore lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">In his seventeenth proposition of law, Waddy complains of eight alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct in the guilt phase of the trial. Waddy objected to four, preserving them for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">When Waddy\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that Greg Jefferson or Allen Russell might be the killer, the prosecutor rebutted by arguing that this was \u201ca standard defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">Waddy\u2019s contention that this statement was improper has some merit. The prosecutor suggested that such defenses are common and implied that they are usually bogus. His argument invited the jury to substitute the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tor\u2019s experience for its own evaluation. Cf. <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 252, 530 N.E.2d 382, 401. However, a prosecutor\u2019s conduct is generally not reversible error unless it robs the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 OBR 379, 402, 473 N.E.2d 768, 793. We do not think the prosecutor\u2019s comment did so here. It was not repeated, and the prosecution\u2019s argument concentrated on the evidence. \u201cIsolated passages of a prosecutor\u2019s argument, billed in advance to the jury as a matter of opinion[,] not of evidence, do not reach\u201d the level of a due process violation. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 646, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 40 L.Ed.2d 431, 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The prosecutor also described some testimony inaccurately. He said: \u201cAllen Russell testified that Warren Waddy tried to get him to use the Bank One [Visa] card with Paula Mason\u2019s name on it.\u201d The trial court overruled an objection, but instructed: \u201cThe jury can draw upon their own memories as to what the testimony was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement, while an inaccurate summary of Russell\u2019s testimony, was a reasonable inference from that testimony. Russell testified that Waddy offered him a chance to \u201cmake some money on a particular card.\u201d Although Russell never specifically said this was Mason\u2019s card, he did indicate that it was the same card Waddy later gave to Greg Jefferson, which the state proved was indeed Mason\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The prosecutor also said that Jefferson had no access to Waddy\u2019s home at the time of the murder, and thus could not have worn the red gloves found in Waddy\u2019s closet. According to the prosecutor, Jefferson did not visit 801 Oak Street until after Russell moved there, five days after the murder. Again, the defense objected and the court instructed the jurors to \u201cdraw upon your own memories.\u201d The state concedes this statement was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Of course, a prosecutor may not deliberately misstate evidence or argue facts not in the record. But reversal is not the remedy for every trivial factual error in a prosecutor\u2019s argument. <em>Dunlop v. United States </em>(1897), 165 U.S. 486, 498, 17 S.Ct. 375, 379, 41 L.Ed. 799, 803. The errors were corrected by the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jurors to rely on their own memories. The prosecutor\u2019s mistakes did not render the trial fundamentally unfair, and thus \u201ccannot be made a ground of error * * <em>Maurer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Waddy also complains that the prosecutor argued that \u201call of these crimes\u201d were not \u201cseparate and distinct,\u201d and that the evidence \u201creveal[ed] a pattern.\u201d The prosecutor also said that he \u201cdid not spend the last two weeks trying four separate cases,\u201d but \u201ctrying one man who committed four separate cases.\u201d This was not misconduct. The prosecution was entitled to use \u201cother acts\u201d to show the accused\u2019s identity. Evid.R. 404(B). Considered in that light, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cases were not \u201cseparate and distinct.\u201d As the prosecutor himself said, he was not asking the jury \u201cto take all of the counts collectively and decide whether or not the defendant is guilty of all collectively. That can\u2019t be so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Other alleged errors were not objected to. They are reversible only if they amounted to plain error \u2014 that is, if Waddy would clearly have been acquitted but for the alleged error. See, <em>e.g., State v. Williford </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 252, 551 N.E.2d 1279, 1284. We find no plain error, and therefore hold that Waddy\u2019s claims are waived. We overrule his seventeenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Jury Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In his nineteenth proposition of law, Waddy argues that the trial court should have granted his new trial motion. Waddy\u2019s motion was based on two alleged incidents involving the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">At the motion hearing, an employee of Waddy\u2019s attorney testified that Mason\u2019s mother had cried in front of five or six jurors while waiting for an elevator after penalty-phase closing argument. But Mason\u2019s mother and another witness contradicted this testimony. The trial judge specifically found that, although Mason\u2019s mother boarded an elevator at the same time as a juror, she did not cry at any time in the juror\u2019s presence. The testimony supports these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Waddy further accuses the jury of misconduct because four jurors allegedly played cards during deliberations. In the mitigation phase, the trial court delivered instructions orally. The jury was apparently told that typed copies of the instructions would be supplied as well. The jury retired to deliberate. It took a long time to type and copy the instructions; the jury twice signaled the court to ask when the instructions would be ready. The bailiff responded both times. The second time, the bailiff saw four jurors playing cards. Once the written instructions were delivered, the jury was out two or three hours before reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">These facts do not amount to juror misconduct. There is no evidence that any jurors played cards during deliberations. Rather, the testimony and findings support an inference that the card game took place while the jurors had suspended deliberations to wait for written instructions. Waiting for the written instructions indicates conscientiousness, not carelessness. Because the record does not support Waddy\u2019s misconduct assertions, his nineteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Y</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Suppression Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cSuggestive\u201d Voice Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">On August 5, 1986, police had Wilson listen to a taped conversation between Waddy and Milligan. She identified Waddy\u2019s voice as that of \u201cD.C.,\u201d who had raped her. On August 19, police played the same conversation for Jackson. She identified Waddy\u2019s voice as that of the man who burglarized her home and robbed her. The prosecution also played the conversation to both women in court during trial; again they identified Waddy\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In his third proposition of law, Waddy claims that police used unduly suggestive procedures to get Wilson and Jackson to identify Waddy\u2019s voice. Accordingly, he claims, the identifications were unreliable and should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">When a witness has been confronted with a suspect before trial, due process requires a court to suppress her identification of the suspect if the confrontation was unnecessarily suggestive of the suspect\u2019s guilt and the identification was unreliable under all the circumstances. <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>(1972), 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401; <em>Manson v. Brathwaite </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Under Neil's two-pronged test, the first question is whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. Wilson and Jackson, both of whom were attacked by a black male, heard only two voices, one recognizably that of a black male (Waddy), the other that of a white male (Milligan). That is certainly a suggestive procedure. Moreover, in Jackson\u2019s case \u201cthere was no emergency or exigent circumstance,\u201d <em>Manson, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 109, 97 S.Ct. at 2250, 53 L.Ed.2d at 151, requiring use of the tape. Waddy had been arrested nearly two weeks before. He plausibly argues that police could have asked Jackson to pick her assailant from a \u201cvoice lineup\u201d of exemplars by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>similar-sounding speakers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the procedure used was unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Wilson\u2019s case is different, however, because Waddy was not in custody on August 5. Had police asked him for an exemplar, they would have tipped him off to the rape investigation, allowing him to destroy evidence (police did not search Waddy\u2019s house until August 6) or intimidate Wilson (the rapist knew where she lived). Thus, police had to use the Waddy-Milligan tapes with Wilson. Cf. <em>Chambers v. State </em>(Ind.1981), 422 N.E.2d 1198, 1201-1202. Theoretically, perhaps, at great cost in time and effort, police might have created several exemplars identical to the Waddy-Milligan conversation for a lineup. But the Constitution does not require police to jump through such hoops. Thus, we do not find the procedure used with Wilson <em>unnecessarily </em>suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Since the identification procedure used with Jackson was unnecessarily suggestive, we must apply the second part of the <em>Neil </em>test. The question is whether, under all the circumstances, the identification was reliable, <em>i.e., </em>whether suggestive procedures created \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1253, quoted in <em>Neil, </em>409 U.S. at 198, 93 S.Ct. at 381, 34 L.Ed.2d at 410. Key factors are the witness\u2019s opportunity to view (in the case of a voice identification, to hear) the defendant during the crime, the witness\u2019s degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description of the suspect, the witness\u2019s certainty, and the time elapsed between the crime and the identification. <em>Neil, </em>409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. at 382, 34 L.Ed.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Jackson had an excellent opportunity to hear the burglar\u2019s voice. He was in her home for half an hour and spoke several times. She thoroughly described the burglar\u2019s manner of speaking and remembered what he said, indicating a high attention level. After Jackson identified the voice, a detective told her to \u201cmake sure that was the same voice that I heard the night that I was attacked\u201d; she did not waver in her identification. Like the victim in <em>Neil, </em>409 U.S. at 200, 93 S.Ct. at 382, 34 L.Ed.2d at 412, Jackson \u201cwas no casual observer,\u201d but the victim of a protracted invasion of her home coupled with a physical assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Two negative factors exist. Jackson\u2019s fear could have distorted her auditory perception. See <em>Thigpen v. Cory </em>(C.A. 6, 1986), 804 F.2d 893, 897; 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) 551, Section 7.1(b). Also, nearly two months elapsed between crime and identification; however, in <em>Neil </em>factors favoring reliability outweighed a seven-month gap. On balance, we find no \u201cvery substantial\u201d likelihood of misidentification. <em>Neil, </em>409 U.S. at 198, 93 S.Ct. at 381, 34 L.Ed.2d at 410. Jackson\u2019s identification of the burglar\u2019s voice on the tapes was therefore admissible. (Wilson\u2019s identification is even more reliable, since she knew Waddy. See <em>State v. Parker </em>[1990], 53 Ohio St.3d 82, 87, 558 N.E.2d 1164, 1169.) Waddy\u2019s third proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Fifth Amendment Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In his fourth proposition of law, Waddy claims that his statements to police should have been suppressed because the state failed to show that he voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment rights. Finding Waddy\u2019s claim utterly unsupported by the record, we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The sole witness at the suppression hearing was Officer Neal Mason, who kept an eye on Waddy while police searched Waddy\u2019s house. Officer Mason testified that a detective read Waddy his rights and Waddy refused to make a statement. Despite this, Waddy spontaneously made several statements to Mason over the next ninety minutes to two hours. Additional statements were made by Waddy on the trip to the police station in the presence of Officer Mason. No officer asked Waddy questions, nor did anyone comment about the evidence in Waddy\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The Fifth Amendment does not bar volunteered statements. <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 726. Officer Mason\u2019s uncontroverted testimony shows that Waddy\u2019s statements were volunteered, not elicited. Waddy does not deny this; he simply argues that we should not believe Officer Mason. This proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Validity of Search</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">In his twenty-eighth proposition of law, Waddy asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence found at 801 Oak Street during execution of a search warrant. According to Waddy, the warrant was invalid and police seized more than it authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"AJF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Validity of Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Waddy challenges the warrant\u2019s validity by alleging that one misrepresentation and several omissions tainted the affidavit. To successfully attack the veracity of a facially sufficient search warrant affidavit, a defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either \u201cintentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2676, 57 L.Ed.2d 667, 672. \u201cReckless disregard\u201d means that the affiant had serious doubts of an allegation\u2019s truth. <em>United States v. Williams </em>(C.A. 7, 1984), 737 F.2d 594, 602. Omissions count as false statements if \u201cdesigned to mislead, or * * * made in reckless disregard of whether they would mislead, the magistrate.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>United States v. Colkley </em>(C.A. 4, 1990), 899 F.2d 297, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Even if the affidavit contains false statements made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, \u201cwith the affidavit\u2019s false material set to one side, the affidavit\u2019s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause * * *.\u201d <em>Franks, supra, </em>438 U.S. at 156, 98 S.Ct. at 2676, 57 L.Ed.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The affidavit, signed by Detectives Sears and Martin, stated that Waddy had been convicted of various crimes including burglary. Waddy points out that he was never convicted of burglary; however, he introduced no evidence that the affiants knew this or seriously doubted the allegation\u2019s truth. Rather, Detective Sears testified that he mistook a burglary arrest noted on Waddy\u2019s rap sheet for a conviction. This was negligent, but negligence is insufficient to traverse the affidavit. <em>Franks, supra, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. at 2684, 57 L.Ed.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The affidavit stated, based on the affiant\u2019s \u201cyears of experience as a criminal investigator,\u201d that burglars conceal stolen property at their homes.. Waddy attacks this statement as misleading. The Milligan burglary was twelve days old when the affidavit was sworn; Waddy claims burglars generally do not keep stolen goods in their homes that long. However, the affidavit gave the date of the Milligan burglary; the judge could therefore evaluate for himself the likelihood that the goods were still at Waddy\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Waddy also argues that the affidavit was signed by both Sears and Martin, and it is unclear which one knew that burglars generally keep stolen goods at home. But probable cause may be based on the knowledge of more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>officer. <em>Benner, supra, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 308, 533 N.E.2d at 710. Thus, it is irrelevant which officer had a particular bit of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The affidavit said Waddy, a felon, listed Kay Drake as his sponsor and 801 Oak as his address on his registration. Waddy argues that the affidavit should have mentioned other facts tending to show that Waddy no longer lived there. This reasoning is flawed. The record shows that Waddy did in fact live at 801 Oak at the time the affidavit was sworn; therefore, the alleged omissions could not mislead the judge and are not material. Moreover, even had the omitted information been included, the affidavit would have stated probable cause to order a search of 801 Oak. According to the affidavit, a call to Milligan had been traced to a phone at that address registered to Waddy\u2019s sponsor, Kay Drake.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">We find no material omissions, no evidence of perjury, no reckless disregard of the truth. We must therefore conclude that the warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Scope of Search</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Waddy also argues that items not named in the warrant but seized in its execution should have been suppressed. He specifically challenges the seizure of three items: the red Arizona Glory gloves, the homemade ski mask, and the roll of chart tape. The state argues that these were properly seized under the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Under this doctrine, an officer may seize an item without a warrant if the initial intrusion leading to the item\u2019s discovery was lawful and it was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d that the item was incriminating. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 443, 466, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2038, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 583.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since police were executing a valid warrant, the intrusion was lawful. Waddy contends, however, that the incriminating nature of the items seized was not immediately apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u201cThe \u2018immediately apparent\u2019 requirement * * * is satisfied when police have probable cause to associate an object with criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Halczyszak </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 301, 25 OBR 360, 496 N.E.2d 925, paragraph three of the syllabus. Sears had probable cause to connect the tape and gloves with Mason\u2019s murder. The tape had red fuzz adhering to it, as Sears knew the tape found at the murder scene did. The fuzz was similar in color to the gloves. Sears knew that Waddy had boasted to Milligan of strangling a young woman at Jefferson and Broad. The gloves were hidden inside a paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>bag with a Halloween mask and the ski mask. The gloves\u2019 proximity to the masks gave Sears additional reason to believe that the gloves were burglar\u2019s tools. As for the ski mask, the circumstances of its discovery support Sears\u2019s conclusion that it too was a burglar\u2019s tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In any case, the mask was the least significant item of the state\u2019s evidence. Only one blue fiber was introduced and connected with the mask. Compared to the more numerous red fibers, the fingerprint on the jewelry box, and Waddy\u2019s admission to Milligan, the mask played so small a part in the case against Waddy that we can confidently say its admission was nonprejudicial beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Waddy argues that, however incriminating the items may have been in the Mason murder, police could not seize them because they had no probable cause at that time to connect them to the Wilson and Milligan crimes on which the warrant was based. Waddy\u2019s argument lacks merit. Although the police were investigating the Wilson and Milligan crimes when they executed the warrant, they could seize evidence of other crimes under the plain view doctrine. See LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 237-238, Section 3.4(k). Therefore, we overrule this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Failure to State Factual Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In his fifth proposition of law, Waddy complains that the trial court erred by refusing to \u201cstate its essential findings\u201d of fact, Crim.R. 12(E), on defense motions to suppress evidence. See <em>Bryan v. Knapp </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 64, 21 OBR 363, 488 N.E.2d 142. However, we think the record sufficient to allow full review of the suppression issues. See <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 60, 549 N.E.2d 491, 501. We reject this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Inflammatory Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Evidence of Victim\u2019s Character</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">In his sixth proposition of law, Waddy asserts that the guilt-phase testimony of Mason\u2019s boyfriend, Travis Lyon, was an irrelevant, prejudicial appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions, tainting the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">Lyon testified he met Mason in Somerset, Ohio, \u201cabout a year and a half or two years\u201d before her death. He testified that Mason moved to Columbus about six months before her death, but they continued to see each other. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Lyon also testified that, at 7:00 a.m., July 18, 1986 he tried to telephone Mason, but got no answer. A coworker of Lyon then testified that between midnight and 12:15 a.m., July 18th, Mason called Lyon at his workplace, but Lyon could not come to the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Waddy claims that Lyon\u2019s testimony was irrelevant. We disagree; it narrowed down the time of Mason\u2019s death. As for the personal details about Mason\u2019s history, they established a foundation for Lyon\u2019s testimony. Lyon\u2019s relationship to Mason explains why they called each other, which corroborates his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Ron Edgington, a college classmate, ex-boyfriend, and coworker of Mason\u2019s, also testified. Waddy complains that Edgington testified about such matters as Mason\u2019s hometown, employment history, and apartment in Columbus, how she walked to work, and how she was furthering her education. But Edging-ton also testified that Mason had a plastic box in her apartment similar to State\u2019s Ex. PM-17A, which had Waddy\u2019s fingerprint on it, that she owned a jump rope (she was strangled with a jump rope), and that her kitchen window had a \u201cflimsy screen\u201d with \u201ccracks and gaps in it.\u201d Edgington further testified that, when Mason failed to show up for work on July 18, he \u201cgot concerned\u201d and went to her apartment. After work, Edgington returned; this time he noticed that her blinds were shut, even though Mason hardly ever shut them. He went back a third time and found Mason\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Edgington\u2019s testimony about Mason, like Lyon\u2019s, corroborated and laid a foundation for his later testimony. His relationship with Mason explained his going to her apartment on July 18 and his familiarity with her apartment, possessions, and habits. We find the testimony of Lyon and Edgington relevant and therefore reject Waddy\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Gruesome Photos</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">In his seventh proposition of law, Waddy complains that gruesome photographs of Paula Mason\u2019s corpse prejudiced him. Such photographs are admissible, however, if their probative value outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the defendant and they are not repetitive or cumulative. <em>State v. Maurer, supra, </em>paragraph seven of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Eleven photographs showed parts of Mason\u2019s corpse. Only three are even arguably gruesome: Ex. PM-1BB, PM-1CC, and PM-1DD, which show Mason\u2019s battered face. However, only one focuses on the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Ex. PM-1BB shows Mason\u2019s body lying on its back after being turned over. It shows the body\u2019s lividity (discoloration from blood settling to the lowest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>part of the body), which the deputy coroner used to estimate time of death. Ex. PM-1CC shows how the rope around Mason\u2019s neck was knotted and indicates how tight it was. Ex. PM-1DD is a full-face shot of Mason, showing her bruised lips, black eye, and blood on her face. These injuries corroborate the deputy coroner\u2019s conclusion that Mason was beaten before being strangled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">These photographs are neither repetitive nor cumulative (indeed, the state showed unusual restraint). Their probative value is high, and their potential for prejudice relatively low, since only one focuses on Mason\u2019s facial injuries. We conclude that they were properly admitted. Waddy\u2019s seventh proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Tape Recordings</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In his eighth proposition of law, Waddy contends that the trial court should have prevented the repeated playing of taped conversations between Milligan and Waddy. .</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The tapes were played during the testimony of Wilson, Jackson, Milligan and Jefferson. Waddy does not contest admissibility, but claims the repetition was prejudicial. However, a trial court need not exclude evidence simply because it is cumulative. See Staff Note to Evid.R. 403. We agree with the court of appeals that \u201c[e]aeh playing of the tape had probative value * * * distinct from the others * * Thus, the first part of this proposition lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Waddy also attacks the use of transcripts to help the jurors follow the tapes. He claims this violated Evid.R. 1002, the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule. However, the transcripts were not admitted into evidence, so Evid.R. 1002 is irrelevant. See Jacobs, Ohio Evidence: Objections and Responses (1989) 287-289, Section 1002-2(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Moreover, Waddy conceded the transcripts\u2019s accuracy at trial. We have compared the tapes and transcripts ourselves and find the latter accurate. Where there are no \u201cmaterial differences\u201d between a tape admitted into evidence and a transcript given to the jury as a listening aid, there is no prejudicial error. <em>State v. Holmes </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 44, 50, 521 N.E.2d 479, 486. Accord <em>United States v. Smith </em>(C.A. 6, 1976), 537 F.2d 862, 863-864.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Waddy urges us to reject <em>Holmes </em>and find prejudice based on \u201coveremphasis or the incorrect implication caused by trying to establish something with both an original and an additional \u2018aid.\u2019 \u201d Waddy cites no authority for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>proposed rule. More important, he does not explain how an accurate transcript could create any \u201cincorrect implication.\u201d We reject his argument, and his eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u201cOffense of Violence\u201d Specification</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Each count of the first indictment (the Wilson, Jackson, and Milligan crimes) contained a sentence-enhancing specification that Waddy had previously been convicted of an \u201coffense of violence.\u201d See R.C. 2929.11(D). Under R.C. 2941.143, a defendant in a jury trial \u201cmay request that the trial judge * * * determine the existence of the specification * * *.\u201d The trial judge offered Waddy a choice between having the specifications determined by the judge or jury. Waddy chose the jury. In his eleventh proposition of law, Waddy argues that he should have been allowed to have a three-judge panel determine the specifications because the noncapital crimes were joined with a capital crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Waddy\u2019s position is both meritless and frivolous. R.C. 2941.143 offers a defendant only two options: he may have the specification determined by the jury or \u201cthe trial judge.\u201d No provision for a three-judge panel exists. Waddy cites R.C. 2929.022, but R.C. 2929.022 simply offers the same options as R.C. 2941.143: a capital defendant in a jury trial may have the existence of relevant prior convictions tried to the jury or \u201cthe trial judge.\u201d A capital defendant may be tried by a three-judge panel only if he waives a jury. R.C. 2945.06; R.C. 2929.022(A). No statute allows him to try some issues to a jury and others to a panel. Waddy\u2019s eleventh proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Instructions on Principal Offender</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">In his twenty-second proposition of law, Waddy argues that the prosecutor\u2019s guilt-phase closing argument and the trial court\u2019s penalty-phase instructions erroneously implied that being a principal offender is an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Being a principal offender is an element of the felony-murder aggravating circumstance defined by R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Obviously a trial court may so instruct. <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 243-244, 527 N.E.2d 831, 836. The court must not indicate that being a principal offender is, by itself, an additional aggravating circumstance. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 527 N.E.2d at 836, fn. 2. However, no reasonable juror could have so understood the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>instruction or the prosecutor\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Waddy\u2019s contrary contention is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In his eighteenth proposition of law, Waddy reminds us that, where a defendant who kills only one victim is convicted of two aggravated murder counts, the trial court may sentence on only one count. R.C. 2941.25(A); <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 28, 553 N.E.2d 1058, 1066. Relying on R.C. 2941.25(A), Waddy argues that the prosecution must elect, <em>before </em>the penalty phase, which count shall be submitted to the jury for sentencing. Since the trial judge merged the two aggravated murder convictions before handing down the sentence, we reject this argument. See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 520 N.E.2d 568, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Waddy further argues that the jury, in considering two counts of aggravated murder, each containing the same two aggravating specifications, may have collectively and improperly weighed four specifications against him. This argument is speculative. The trial court\u2019s instructions clearly told the jury to consider two specifications as to Count One and two specifications as to Count Two. We must presume the jury did so. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 528 N.E.2d 1237, 1246. Moreover, the state\u2019s closing argument in the penalty phase referred consistently to two aggravating circumstances, not four. Thus, as in <em>Poindexter, supra, </em>the record contains no basis for Waddy\u2019s speculation that the jury may have double-counted aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In his twenty-third proposition of law, Waddy argues that the felony-murder specifications based on aggravated burglary should have been merged with the felony-murder (kidnapping) specifications based on kidnapping, leaving one specification instead of two on each aggravated murder count.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>If aggravated burglary and kidnapping are allied offenses of similar import, merger was required. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph five of the syllabus, and <em>id. </em>at 197, 15 OBR at 339, 473 N.E.2d at 295, fn. 27. \u201cAllied offenses of similar import are those offenses whose elements correspond to such a degree that the commission of one offense will result in the commission of the other.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 416, 418, 6 OBR 463, 464, 453 N.E.2d 593, 594. If a defendant is convicted of allied offenses of similar import, the court must examine his conduct to determine \u201cwhether the offenses were committed separately or with a separate animus as to each.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Waddy was convicted of two R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) aggravating circumstances: aggravated burglary and kidnapping. Burglary consists of trespassing in an occupied structure by force, stealth, or deception with purpose to commit a theft offense or felony. If, <em>inter alia, </em>the burglar inflicts physical harm on another, or the structure is a habitation in which any person was present, the offense is aggravated burglary. R.C. 2911.11(A)(1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Obviously aggravated burglary is not implicit within kidnapping. Also, kidnapping is not implicit within aggravated burglary. Unlike robbery or rape, burglary does not inherently require the victim\u2019s restraint. Cf. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 198, 15 OBR at 340, 473 N.E.2d at 295, fn. 29; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. Nor does inflicting physical harm, as required for aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11(A)(1), necessarily require the victim\u2019s restraint; even if it did, Waddy imposed further restraint on Mason by tying her up. Thus, aggravated burglary under either R.C. 2911.11(A)(1) or (3) is not an allied offense of similar import to kidnapping. The trial court correctly refused merger. This proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Sentencing Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Waddy\u2019s twenty-fourth proposition of law attacks the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">First, Waddy argues that the trial court misunderstood the verdict. The trial court stated that Waddy had been convicted of \u201cSpecifications One and Two\u201d as to each count, when in fact he was convicted of Specifications Three and Four. But on the first page of his opinion, the trial judge correctly set forth the <em>elements </em>of the specifications Waddy was convicted of. Cf. <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 90, 571 N.E.2d 97, 120. The judge understood the verdict; his error was inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Second, Waddy complains that the trial judge misapplied R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). This provision creates a mitigating factor if \u201cthe offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d The trial judge said: \u201cThis is for all intents and purposes an insanity defense. No such defense was made.\u201d As Waddy points out, R.C. 2929.-04(B)(3), which requires a lack of \u201csubstantial capacity,\u201d is not the same as the insanity defense, which exculpates a defendant who completely lacks capacity. <em>State v. Van Hook </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 256, 263, 530 N.E.2d 883, 890; <em>State v. Lawrence </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 24, 29, 541 N.E.2d 451, 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">But the trial court specifically found \u201cthat the defendant does not suffer from a mental disease [or] defect.\u201d A disease or defect is a necessary element of R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). <em>Van Hook, supra. </em>Thus, even applying the correct standard, the trial judge could not have found this mitigating factor. In these circumstances, the error is plainly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Third, Waddy argues that the trial judge weighed each mitigating factor individually instead of collectively against the aggravating circumstances. Waddy cites the sentencing opinion\u2019s statement that insanity \u201cwas not shown by evidence outweighing the aggravating circumstances * * Waddy misinterprets this passage, in which the court determined which individual mitigating factors <em>existed. </em>When one examines the part of the opinion where the court weighed aggravation against mitigation, it becomes clear that mitigating factors were weighed collectively and not individually against aggravating circumstances. The opinion says: \u201cComparing the aggravating circumstances to the claimed mitigating factors the Court finds * * * that the aggravating circumstances are sufficient to outweigh any claimed mitigation * * The trial judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Fourth, Waddy complains that the judge did not specify Waddy\u2019s criminal record to support the judge\u2019s apparent conclusion that Waddy had \u201ca significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). But Waddy did not attempt to prove this factor \u2014 probably wisely, given his prior conviction of carrying a concealed weapon and the convictions mentioned in the search warrant affidavit. Thus, he failed to carry his burden of proving that this factor existed. See <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 171-172, 15 OBR at 317-318, 473 N.E.2d at 275.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Finally, Waddy claims that the trial court did not consider the testimony of his witnesses. But the trial court noted that Waddy\u2019s brother and Kay Drake testified, giving \u201ca brief history of his life as a child and his life with * * * Drake.\u201d Thus, the judge considered this evidence; Waddy\u2019s real complaint is simply that the judge was not impressed. That complaint is a fit subject for our independent review, but is not a valid ground of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The trial judge committed no prejudicial error. Had he done so, our independent reweighing would correct it. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 170, 555 N.E.2d 293, 304. This proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In his thirtieth proposition of law, Waddy contends that the court of appeals failed to articulate the reasons why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors, as R.C. 2929.05 requires. See <em>Maurer, supra, </em>paragraph four of the syllabus. However, the court did give its reasons. Waddy had adduced childhood spankings as a mitigating factor; the court pointed out that Waddy and his siblings \u201cwere punished <em>only </em>if they had misbehaved. * * *\u201d And it noted that \u201cmany grow up in as bad or even far worse conditions without turning to criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The court observed that Waddy\u2019s \u201clist of goals,\u201d adduced in mitigation, \u201cexpresses no remorse even though * * * purportedly written a mere four days after\u201d the murder. The court further noted that the list \u201cis centered around defendant\u2019s desires with little or no concern for anyone else * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcF\">In discussing a 1969 psychiatric evaluation of Waddy, the court said: \u201cEven at that time, defendant had little or no conscience and was found to be difficult to rehabilitate.\u201d The court found a 1969 \u201csocial history report\u201d worth little because it contained \u201cminimal information on defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The court of appeals adequately explained why aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors. Moreover, had the court of appeals erred, our independent review would cure that error. <em>Lott, supra; State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 263, 527 N.E.2d 844, 855-856.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">In his twenty-ninth and thirtieth propositions of law, Waddy also argues that the court of appeals should have included in its proportionality review cases in which life sentences were imposed. This contention lacks merit. See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Settled Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">In his twenty-ninth proposition of law, Waddy presents numerous boilerplate arguments against the Ohio death penalty statutes. All have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>rejected many times. See, generally, <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 167-179, 15 OBR at 314-324, 473 N.E.2d at 272-281. See, also, <em>Walton v. Arizona </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 639, -, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 3055-3056, 111 L.Ed.2d 511, 525-527 (plurality opinion); <em>Blystone v. Pennsylvania </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 299, 110 S.Ct. 1078, 108 L.Ed.2d 255; <em>Steffen, supra, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 124-125, 31 OBR at 284-285, 509 N.E.2d at 395-396; <em>Henderson, supra, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 28-29, 528 N.E.2d at 1242-1243; <em>State v.

R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Waddy was convicted of two aggravating circumstances. The jury found that Waddy, as a principal offender, committed the murder while committing, attempting, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit (1) aggravated burglary, and (2) kidnapping. He presented three mitigating factors: his troubled childhood, his redeeming qualities, and his low I.Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Waddy grew up in a family of nine children. Both parents and both maternal grandparents lived in the home. Waddy\u2019s father drove a truck, spending much of his time on the road. Waddy\u2019s brother Aubry testified that, when their father got home, \u201che would get the reports\u201d on the children\u2019s behavior and spank those who had misbehaved with a strap or extension cord. According to a \u201csocial history\u201d of Waddy (compiled in 1969 in connection with a juvenile charge), his mother also spanked him for teasing his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Waddy\u2019s parents had below-average intelligence. The social worker who compiled the 1969 social history described the family as \u201clower class, culturally-deprived\u201d and \u201cmatriarchal.\u201d Waddy\u2019s father seemed to have no interest in the family \u201cother than providing their basic material needs.\u201d A 1969 psychiatric evaluation quotes Waddy calling his father a \u201ccold lover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Waddy claims that his childhood home was \u201cunstructured\u201d and \u201crelatively abusive.\u201d Spanking is not necessarily child abuse. The evidence shows that the children were spanked only when bad and does not show excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Moreover, Waddy\u2019s brother, raised in the same environment, is a law-abiding citizen. Aubry Waddy, at the time of trial, was an Army sergeant with a highly responsible position in the 101st Division. He finished high school, entered college, and was studying for an associate degree. Thus, Waddy\u2019s childhood environment does little to explain his crime and has virtually no mitigating value.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Kay Drake lived with Waddy for nine years and is the mother of Waddy\u2019s daughter Natalie. She testified that Natalie is very fond of Waddy. Waddy has treated Natalie well, taken her places, played with her, and baby-sat her while Drake worked. Waddy did not expose Drake or Natalie to his drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Drake testified that Waddy was beaten up badly in the fall of 1985. After the beating, Waddy stayed home and developed an interest in real estate. He began reading real estate books and self-motivation books. On July 22, 1986 (four days after the murder), Waddy wrote a list of goals entitled \u201cMy Personal Commitment to Myself\u201d in which he pledged to have a net worth of $250,000 within the next two years, which he stated would allow him to retire. Waddy also tried to better himself by attending welding school and business college.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Drake\u2019s testimony about Waddy\u2019s good qualities is entitled to some weight. On her showing, Waddy was an attentive and loving father who at least made some effort to reform himself. While her testimony may have been biased, it was also uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">On the other hand, we give Waddy\u2019s \u201cPersonal Commitment\u201d little weight. It does indicate Waddy\u2019s desire to rehabilitate himself, make an honest living, stop committing crimes and taking drugs, and help his family and community. But his \u201cgoals\u201d are so grandiose and unrealistic as to cast doubt on Waddy\u2019s rehabilitative prospects. For instance, Waddy vows to buy \u201cat least\u201d four houses and accumulate $40,000 equity in each one. He expects to have $250,000 in two years and \u201cgenerate a yearly cash flow\u201d of $125,000 from that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The 1969 psychiatric evaluation diagnosed borderline mental retardation associated with environmental deprivation. Waddy\u2019s I.Q. dropped about ten points after he left school in 1966; in 1969, it was measured at 72. The evaluation also states that Waddy \u201chas a poorly developed conscience\u201d and \u201cpresents a real problem for rehabilitation.\u201d Waddy\u2019s low I.Q. has some mitigating weight. However, the relevance of the psychiatric evaluation is limited because it deals with Waddy\u2019s 1969 condition, not his 1986 condition. We agree with the courts below that Waddy failed to prove a \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Waddy tied Paula Mason up and murdered her while burglarizing her home. He bears sole responsibility for this crime. Few mitigating factors exist. We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh them beyond a reasonable doubt. The death sentence is therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We also find it proportionate, for we have upheld several death sentences involving murder during aggravated burglaries and kidnappings. See <em>Wiles, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 95, 571 N.E.2d at 124-125, and cases cited therein, for cases of burglary-murder; and see, <em>e.g., State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 535 N.E.2d 1351; <em>Brewer, supra; State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464, for cases of kidnap-murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b561-9\">Moyee, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.

Citing <em>United States v. Albergo </em>(C.A. 2, 1976), 539 F.2d 860, the state suggests that this rule does not apply to voice, as opposed to visual, identifications. However, we recently applied Neil's due process standard to a voice identification. <em>State v. Parker </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 82, 87-88, 558 N.E.2d 1164, 1169-1170. <em>Neil </em>itself involved a voice identification as well as a visual one, see <em>id., </em>409 U.S. at 195, 93 S.Ct. at 380, 34 L.Ed.2d at 409, and did not suggest that a different standard applied to the former. Moreover, the Second Circuit seems to have backed away from <em>Albergo. </em>See <em>United States v. Moore </em>(C.A. 2, 1978), 571 F.2d 76, 91, and <em>Brown v.
