Engle </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 281, 3 O.O.3d 434, 361 N.E.2d 239, we held that to withstand a motion to dismiss, a petition in habeas corpus must conform to R.C. 2725.04<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and attack the jurisdiction of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>court. We find the petition in this case barely adequate to meet this existing standard and grant the writ pursuant to R.C. 2725.06.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Normally, the granting of the writ would cause us to order respondent to make a return pursuant to R.C. 2725.12 and 2725.14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we treat respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss as a return of the writ and remand petitioner to custody. See <em>State, ex rel. Spitler, v. Seiber </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 117, 45 O.O.2d 463, 243 N.E.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The return, supported by the proper authenticated documents, establishes the jurisdiction of the trial court to have sentenced petitioner, notwithstanding his attack on the indictment in his motion for summary judgment. In <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, at 522-523, 18 O.O.2d 58, at 61, 178 N.E.2d 800, at 804, we held that an indictment cannot be collaterally attacked after a judgment of conviction \u201cbecause the judgment of conviction necessarily binds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>a defendant, where the court rendering it had jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and also jurisdiction of the subject matter, <em>i.e., </em>jurisdiction to try the defendant for the crime for which he was convicted. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Moreover, had petitioner disclosed his claim with particularity, the writ would not have been granted under R.C. 2725.06 because it would <em>not </em>have appeared from the petition that the writ ought to issue. Accordingly, we hold, consistent with other recent decisions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that to avoid dismissal under R.C. 2725.06, a petition filed by or on behalf of a petitioner \u201calleged to be restrained of his liberty [who] is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or magistrate, or by virtue of the judgment or order of a court of record * * * \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> must state with particularity why the court or magistrate lacked jurisdiction to enter the process, judgment, or order. Otherwise, it will appear that the writ ought not to be granted,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the petition will be dismissed pursuant to R.C. 2725.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Accordingly, we remand the petitioner to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\n<em>Writ allowed; petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b776-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
