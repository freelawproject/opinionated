The statutory \u201cten-mill limitation\u201d likewise appears in R.C. 5705.02. Under the mandate of R.C. 5705.31, the budget commission is obligated to approve without modification:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">\u201c(D) A minimum levy within the ten-mill limitation for the current expense and debt service of each subdivision or taxing unit, which shall equal two-thirds of the average levy for current expenses and debt service allotted within the fifteen-mill limitation to such subdivision or taxing unit during the last five years the fifteen-mill limitation was in effect unless such subdivision or taxing unit requests an amount requiring a lower rate. * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>In <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Lorain Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 50, 51, 526 N.E.2d 297, 299, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u201cSince the fifteen-mill limitation was in effect only from 1929 through 1933, the formula to determine a subdivision\u2019s minimum guaranteed millage is the average of all the levies for current expenses and debt service allotted for those five years multiplied by two-thirds. R.C. 5705.31(D). Unless the subdivision requests an amount requiring a lower rate, <em>this is the millage that a subdivision in existence in those years should receive.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Thus, we interpreted the statute as guaranteeing a minimum levy inside the millage. See, also, <em>Cambridge City School Dist. v. Guernsey Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 77, 42 O.O.2d 226, 234 N.E.2d 512, paragraph two of the syllabus, as adopted from the appellate decision below, 11 Ohio App.2d 77, 40 O.O.2d 239, 228 N.E.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In response to appellant\u2019s contention regarding the inequity or lack of fairness with respect to subdivisions not in existence during the period 1929-1933, the BTA observed that the \u201cnewly incorporated entities\u201d were \u201con prior notice of the millage which remains available within the constitutional limitation.\u201d The BTA then pointed out that the newly incorporated entities had recourse available in that they could request the voters to approve a levy outside the ten-mill limitation or they could petition the General Assembly for legislative change in the statutory formula. The BTA refused to make changes of a legislative nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">We agree with the BTA\u2019s conclusion. Its finding was neither unreasonable nor unlawful and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b588-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
