Lindley </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 15, 1 OBR 39, 437 N.E.2d 302, where we observed, at 16, 1 OBR at 40, 437 N.E.2d at 303:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\u201cThus, our inquiry narrows to a determination of the reasonableness and lawfulness of the board\u2019s decision concluding that the tanks constitute \u2018structures * * * on the land.\u2019 \u201d There, as here, the commissioner asserted BTA error in finding that the tanks were structures and suggested that the matter be re-evaluated in light of <em>Zangerle v. Standard Oil Co. </em>(1945), 144 Ohio St. 506, 30 O.O. 151, 60 N.E.2d 52, and subsequent cases. See, also, <em>Teaff v. Hewitt </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 511. As in <em>Pittsburgh-Des Moines, supra, </em>we reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The storage tanks here are \u201cstructures\u201d; they are \u201creal property\u201d and not \u201cpersonal property.\u201d R.C. 5701.02, now 5701.02(A), provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">\u201cAs used in Title LVII of the Revised Code, \u2018real property\u2019 and \u2018land\u2019 include land itself * * *, and, unless otherwise specified, all buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures of whatever kind on the land, and all rights and privileges belonging or appertaining thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">R.C. 5701.03 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">\u201cAs used in Title LVII of the Revised Code, \u2018personal property\u2019 includes every tangible thing which is the subject of ownership * * * and not forming part of a parcel of real property, as defined in section 5701.02 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AxQM\">In <em>Pittsburgh-Des Moines, supra, </em>we stated that <em>Bobb Bros. v. Bd. of Revision </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 81, 74 O.O.2d 195, 341 N.E.2d 573, \u201cgoverns the issue raised\u201d; \u201c \u2018[t]he property in question is personalty, as defined by this court * * *\u2019 \u201d; and \u201c[i]n <em>Shutter Bug [v. Kosydar </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St.2d 99, 69 O.O.2d 487, 321 N.E.2d 239], we held: \u2018 \u201cEven if a structure or building located on land is personal property, such structure or building will, for purposes of taxation, be included within the definition of \u2018real property\u2019 as that term is defined in R.C. 5701.02, unless the General Assembly has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>otherwise specified.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>1 Ohio St.3d at 16, 1 OBR at 40, 437 N.E.2d at 303-304. Finally, we approved the BTA\u2019s conclusion: \u201c \u2018 * * * The tanks are essentially storage facilities, or used in connection with the storage of various liquids, and are not machines or implements used in manufacturing so as to be \u201cotherwise specified\u201d * * * [within the context of R.C. 5701.02].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 1 OBR at 41, 437 N.E.2d at 304. See, also, <em>Rotek, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 81, 82-83, 552 N.E.2d 640, 641-642, and <em>Thomas Steel Strip Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 340, 575 N.E.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">By statutory definition and by judicial decision, sales or use tax does not apply to Universal Oil\u2019s purchase of these storage tanks because the tanks were \u201cstructures.\u201d Having thus determined that the decision of the BTA was not unreasonable or unlawful, it is not necessary for us to consider the alternate argument advanced by appellee as a basis for sustaining the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the BTA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b586-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
