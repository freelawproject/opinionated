Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, declared appealable under R.C. 4123.519 only those decisions involving the claimant\u2019s right to participate in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Having concluded in the matter currently before us that the right to participate is involved, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>R.C. 4123.52 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201c * * * No * * * finding or award in * * * any claim shall be made with respect to disability, compensation, dependency, or benefits, after six years from the date of injury in the absence of the payment of compensation * * * under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code, or wages in lieu of compensation * * * except in cases where compensation has been paid under section 4123.56, 4123.57, or 4123.58 of the Revised Code * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Under R.C. 4123.52, a claimant\u2019s right to continued participation in workers\u2019 compensation benefits ceases if disability compensation or wages in lieu thereof are not paid within six years after the date of injury. In this case, the commission found that no compensation or wages had been paid, effectively foreclosing further workers\u2019 compensation participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, the right to participate/statute of limitations question must be resolved before any inquiry can be made into the merits of claimant's compensation request. Obviously, if claimant no longer may receive any workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the presence of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting temporary total disability is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>Felske v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 89, 18 O.O.3d 313, 413 N.E.2d 809, is misplaced. Claimant correctly notes that <em>Felske </em>and the present case involve substantially the same merit question. <em>Felske, </em>however, was not brought in mandamus but was instead before us pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record. <em>Felske </em>does not, therefore, support claimant\u2019s assertion that this action is properly before the court in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-11\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b397-12\">Sweeney, Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b397-13\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzB\">dissenting. The majority opinion states, in part, that \u201c[t]he commission ultimately denied temporary total disability compensation, <em>finding that the claim was barred by the six-year statute of limitations. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) This was a determination of the Industrial Commission pursuant to R.C. 4123.52. The question is one of <em>commission </em>jurisdiction and does not have a thing to do, at this stage of the proceedings, with the claimant\u2019s \u201cright to participate.\u201d Accordingly, the decision of the commission is not one that is appealable under R.C. 4123.519. See <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175; and <em>State, ex rel. Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc., v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 277, 285, 586 N.E.2d 1077, 1083-1084 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><em>Even </em>the majority makes the point when it says that \u201c[cjontrary to claimant\u2019s representation, the right to participate/statute of limitations question must be resolved <em>before any inquiry can be made into the merits of claimant\u2019s compensation request. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) If, as according to the majority opinion, the inquiry is <em>not </em>into the merits of claimant\u2019s claim for benefits, then the appeal cannot lie under R.C. 4123.519.</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\">Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-6\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
