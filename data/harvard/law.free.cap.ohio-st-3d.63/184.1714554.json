Claimant\u2019s attempt to now enforce the board\u2019s order raises several questions, the first of which involves the possible existence of an adequate remedy at law. Appellants contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>R.C. 4123.519\u2019s appeal provisions constitute such a remedy. We disagree that an R.C. 4123.519 appeal is available, but find that an adequate remedy exists nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, paragraph one of the syllabus, recently declared appealable only those decisions involving a claimant\u2019s right to participate in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The present commission decision does not involve claimant\u2019s right to participate. It merely holds in abeyance claimant\u2019s motion for interim compensation pending a final determination of her claim. An appeal, therefore, will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The unavailability of appeal, however, does not foreclose the possibility of other adequate remedies. R.C. 2721.02 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u201cCourts of record may declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. * * * The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect. Such declaration has the effect of a final judgment or decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">R.C. 2721.03 additionally provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u201cAny person * * * whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a constitutional provision [or] statute * * * may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under such * * * constitutional provision [or] statute * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Claimant in essence seeks a declaration of her rights under R.C. 4123.515. The nature of this controversy falls within that contemplated by the declaratory judgment provisions of R.C. Chapter 2721. Under these facts, declaratory judgment provides an adequate remedy at law which precludes the issuance of a writ of mandamus. <em>State, ex rel. Berger, v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
