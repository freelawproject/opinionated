Future partial disability compensation was to be paid according to the method selected. However, for \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d the claimant was able to change his election. Former R.C. 4123.57(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">The appellate court\u2019s decision to vacate the commission\u2019s order prompted appeals by both the employer and the commission. The latter defends its order while the employer claims that the court should have gone further and ordered the commission to deny the request to change election. For the reasons to follow, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">\u201cTo establish good cause, a claimant must prove (1) unforeseen changed circumstances subsequent to the initial election, and (2) actual impaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>earning capacity.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Combs, v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 378, 381, 582 N.E.2d 990, 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The unforeseen changed circumstances alleged by the commission are (1) that claimant\u2019s condition has worsened and (2) her deteriorated condition now prevents her from working. The commission\u2019s position fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Claimant\u2019s subsequent physical condition is not a <em>changed </em>circumstance. In support of its conclusion, the commission relied on Doctors Fallon and Beattie. Before claimant made her initial election, Dr. Beattie found a thirty to thirty-five percent disability. In 1980, Dr. Fallon found a thirty percent disability. Comparison negates the assertion that claimant\u2019s condition has changed since her initial election.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The commission also found that claimant was not working, which does represent a change from the time of the initial election. We do not, however, consider this change to be unforeseeable, here, since there is no medical evidence relating claimant\u2019s alleged inability to work to her injury. Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, Dr. Fallon \u2014 the only doctor to have examined claimant during her claimed period of disability whose report was relied on\u2014 states only that <em>claimant </em>says her injury prevents her from working, but Dr. Fallon does not substantiate claimant\u2019s contention. Dr. Fallon noted few objective symptoms, a great deal of complaints, less than maximum effort during physical testing and a \u201cgreat deal of functional overlay.\u201d Nothing in his report suggests that the work-impairing disability alleged by claimant was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">All workers, at some time, permanently leave the work force. Absent evidence that claimant\u2019s industrial injury removed her prematurely from the labor market, we are unconvinced that when claimant initially elected, it was not foreseeable that almost twenty-four years later, at age sixty-two, she might not be working.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Having made this determination, we find it unnecessary to address AT &amp; T\u2019s statute of limitations argument. We also find it unnecessary to go beyond the appellate court\u2019s vacation of the commission\u2019s order. Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b850-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
