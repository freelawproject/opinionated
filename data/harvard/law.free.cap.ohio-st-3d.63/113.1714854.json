However, \u201cSection 1983 does not itself create any constitutional rights; it creates a right of action for the vindication of constitutional guarantees found elsewhere.\u201d <em>Braley v. City of Pontiac </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 906 F.2d 220, 223. Moreover, Section 1983 does not cover official conduct that violates only state law. Rather, the statute is limited to deprivations of federal statutory and constitutional rights. <em>Huron Valley Hosp., Inc. v. City of Pontiac </em>(C.A.6, 1989), 887 F.2d 710, 714; <em>Baker v.

Baesler </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 910 F.2d 1349, reviewed a case similar to the one at bar where the issue concerned whether the claimant was denied substantive, as opposed to procedural, due process. In <em>Charles, </em>the plaintiff successfully completed a fire department examination in January 1981, and was placed fifth on the promotion list for the rank of major. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. The list containing plaintiffs name expired in January 1983 without the plaintiff having been selected for promotion, although an opening did exist in May 1984. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff premised his claim on the fact that the government\u2019s personnel director failed to promote him based on the expired promotion list. <em>Id. </em>Since plaintiff topped the expired eligibility list and a new list had not been created, he believed he should have been selected for the vacancy. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. The <em>Charles </em>court noted with respect to the plaintiffs contract that:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201c * * * Most, if not all, state-created contract rights, while assuredly protected by procedural due process, are not protected by substantive due process. The substantive Due Process Clause is not concerned with the garden variety issues of common law contract. Its concerns are far narrower, but at the same time, far more important. Substantive due process \u2018affords only those protections \u201cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d \u2019 <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., </em>[491] U.S. [110, 122], 109 S.Ct. 2333, 2341, 105 L.Ed.2d 91 [105] (1989) (plurality opinion) quoting <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97,105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674 [677] (1934) (Cardozo, J.), <em>overruled on other grounds, Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968) * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u201cState-created rights such as Charles\u2019 contractual right to promotion do not rise to the level of \u2018fundamental\u2019 interests protected by substantive due process. Routine state-created contractual rights are not \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 and, although important, are not so vital that \u2018neither liberty nor justice would exist if [they] were sacrificed.\u2019 <em>Bowers v. Hardwick </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 186, 191-94, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 2844-46, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 [146-48] (1986) * * <em>Charles, supra, </em>at 1353; see, also, <em>Ramsey v. Bd. of Edn. of Whitley Cty., Kentucky </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 844 F.2d 1268, 1274-1275 (\u201can interference with a property interest in a pure benefit of employment, as opposed to an interest in the tenured nature of the employment itself, is an interest that can be and should be redressed by a state breach of contract action and not by a federal action under Section 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>As the Sixth Circuit properly observed in <em>Charles, supra, </em>at 1355:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u201c * * * \u2018an employee deprived of a property interest in a specific benefit, term, or condition of employment, suffers a loss which is defined easily * * * and therefore, any interference with that interest is redressed adequately in a state breach of contract action.\u2019 <em>[Ramsey v. Bd. of Edn. of Whitley Cty., Kentucky </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 844 F.2d 1268], at 1274. In contrast, a person unreasonably deprived of her fundamental liberty to marry, for instance, may suffer a more undefinable loss of physical, emotional, psychological, social and economic autonomy not readily redressed at common law. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The facts in <em>Charles, supra, </em>provide an illustration of an employee who was merely deprived of a specific benefit, term or condition of employment. The <em>Charles </em>court correctly noted that Charles\u2019s loss was easily compensable by calculating the difference between a captain\u2019s salary and a major\u2019s salary over the relevant period of time. And the vehicle for recovering his lost compensation could be a state breach of contract action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">We explicitly stated in <em>Cooperman v. Univ. Surgical Assoc., Inc. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 191, 199-200, 513 N.E.2d 288, 297, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u201c * * * Where the right asserted is a constitutional right, federal courts have accorded different treatment, under Section 1983, to different rights. Where the right deprived under color of state law is a substantive right \u2014 for example, the First Amendment guarantee of free speech or the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \u2014 a Section 1983 suit is always available regardless of supplemental state remedies. * * * [Citations omitted.] Where, however, the claim asserted rests on the deprivation of a property interest alone, the constitutional right invoked is the <em>procedural </em>due process right to notice and hearing. * * * [Citations omitted.] The constitutional infringement under the Fourteenth Amendment is not * * * the deprivation of a property interest <em>per se, </em>but is instead the <em>manner </em>by which the property is taken. * * * \u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Therefore, we hold that Section 1983 and the substantive due process protections guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment do not provide a remedy to claimants who merely allege they have failed to receive a job promotion. As the United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, observed: \u201cthe Constitution must not be trivialized by being dragged into every personnel dispute in state and local government. Disputes over overtime, over work assignments, over lunch and coffee breaks do not implicate the great objects of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Brown v. Brienen </em>(C.A.7, 1983), 722 F.2d 360, 365. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we find that the present dispute over Shirokey\u2019s alleged right to a job promotion, like the dispute in <em>Charles, supra, </em>\u201cdoes not involve an interest of sufficient weight to merit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>protection of the substantive Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Charles, supra, </em>at 1356.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, we are left to address Shirokey\u2019s remaining claim concerning the alleged violation of his procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In <em>Zinermon v. Burch </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 983, 108 L.Ed.2d 100, 114, the United States Supreme Court discussed the requirements placed on a claimant alleging a procedural due process violation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u201c * * * A \u00a7 1983 action may be brought for a violation of procedural due process, but here the existence of state remedies <em>is </em>relevant in a special sense. In procedural due process claims, the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in \u2018life, liberty, or property\u2019 is not in itself unconstitutional; what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest <em>without due process of law. Parratt [v. Taylor </em>(1981) ], 451 U.S. [527], at 537, 101 S.Ct. at 1913, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 [428]; <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 259, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1050, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 [262] (1978) (\u2018Procedural due process rules are meant to protect persons not from the deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property\u2019). The constitutional violation actionable under \u00a7 1983 is not complete when the deprivation occurs; it is not complete unless and until the State fails to provide due process. Therefore, to determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred, it is necessary to ask what process the State provided, and whether it was constitutionally adequate. * * * \u201d (Footnotes omitted and emphasis <em>sic.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>See, also, <em>Hudson v. Palmer </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3204, 82 L.Ed.2d 393, 407-408 (\u201can unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available. For intentional, as for negligent deprivations of property by state employees, the state\u2019s action is not complete until and unless it provides or refuses to provide a suitable postdeprivation remedy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33, the United States Supreme Court set forth a three-part test for courts to use to determine what procedural protections the Constitution requires in a particular case. Specifically, courts should weigh the following: \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We held in <em>1946 St. Clair Corp., supra, </em>that \u201c[w]hen the interest is purely economic, the Constitution demands only that the challenging party be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>Parratt [v. Taylor </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 527,] at 543-544 [101 S.Ct. at 1916-1917, 68 L.Ed.2d at 433-434]. If the state provides adequate post-deprivation state tort remedies for unauthorized intentional property deprivations, the state has provided all the \u2018process\u2019 required under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 36, 550 N.E.2d at 460. Furthermore, we placed the initial burden on a plaintiff who asserts a claim under Section 1983 for the deprivation of purely economic interests without due process of law that he allege and prove the inadequacy of state remedies. <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">This view is in accordance with <em>Parratt, supra, </em>where the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff is required to prove inadequate state remedies where, due to the nature of the deprivation, the state could not be expected to provide predeprivation process. 451 U.S. at 540-541, 101 S.Ct. at 1915-1916, 68 L.Ed.2d at 432. Therefore, given the nature of the deprivation, if the state cannot be expected to provide predeprivation process, there is no constitutional violation as long as the state provides adequate postdeprivation remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In this case, Shirokey\u2019s claim that he was denied a promotion and compensation as the result of the city\u2019s following a rule that had not been properly adopted does not lend itself to traditional predeprivation remedies. The very nature of the property loss here makes it impossible for the city to predict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>such deprivations and provide a predeprivation process. See <em>Parratt, supra, </em>451 U.S. at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916, 68 L.Ed.2d at 432. However, Shirokey did have the benefit of postdeprivation statutory and common-law remedies which would satisfy due process requirements. See <em>Zinermon, supra, </em>494 U.S. at 127, 110 S.Ct. at 984, 108 L.Ed.2d at 115; <em>1946 St. Clair Corp., supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 34-35, 550 N.E.2d at 459. Specifically, Shirokey could have brought a declaratory judgment action<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in order to determine his rights to the promotion under the city\u2019s civil service rules and charter. Also, he could have filed a request for an investigation and hearing with the civil service commission pursuant to Cleveland Heights Codified Ordinance 137.18, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"Avz\">\u201cThe civil service <em>\\sic </em>] shall further have the power to make investigations concerning all matters touching enforcement and effect of the provisions of this chapter and of the rules of the Civil Service Commission prescribed thereunder; and, in the course of any such investigation or at any trial on appeal, the presiding officer of the Commission shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, the power to administer oaths and affirmations and to take testimony relative to any such investigation or hearing, and the power to require the production by subpoena of any books, papers, public records or other documentary evidence pertinent to such investigation, inquiries or hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Furthermore, as noted in our previous discussion concerning substantive due process, Shirokey had the common-law remedy of breach of contract available to him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, among the various options available to Shirokey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>was a petition for a writ of mandamus claiming he had no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to protect his interest in the job promotion. See <em>State, ex rel. Zupancic, v. Limbach </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 130, 131-134, 568 N.E.2d 1206, 1207-1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Thus, in reviewing the available state law remedies, we find that Shirokey\u2019s procedural due process rights were not violated since the state\u2019s judicial review and administrative processes allow for a full consideration of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Accordingly, we express no view on the ultimate merits of Shirokey\u2019s claim except to hold that his complaint failed to state a claim under Section 1983 for the violation of his substantive or procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-8\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and H.

The <em>Meyers </em>court held with respect to the plaintiffs procedural due process rights:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u201c * * * It is true that the municipal civil service commission refused to allow plaintiff to be heard because it interpreted the plaintiffs retirement as voluntary, but this refusal does not constitute a due process violation because an adequate state corrective judicial process exists.

Under the guise of reviewing the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claims, the majority overwhelms the reader with numerous citations. However, few, if any, of these cases are germane to the instant claim for relief. In my view, plaintiff has clearly alleged a cause of action cognizable under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The majority raises the full panoply of state law remedies that plaintiff could have raised, and concludes that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cprocedural due process rights were not violated since the state\u2019s judicial review and administrative processes allow for a full consideration of his claim.\u201d By blithely dismissing plaintiff\u2019s cause of action in such a manner, the majority has essentially overruled, <em>sub silentio, </em>this court\u2019s very recent opinion in <em>Gibney v. Toledo Bd. of Edn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 152, 532 N.E.2d 1300, where this court held in the syllabus: \u201cExhaustion of state administrative remedies is not required prior to obtaining relief pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code in state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>court. <em>(Felder v. Casey </em>[1988], 487 U.S. 131, 101 L.Ed. 123, 108 S.Ct. 2302, followed.)\u201d By its holding today, the majority has added confusion to an area of law that had appeared to be settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In my view, the courts.below were correct in finding that plaintiff was deprived of a property interest because R.C. 124.45 through 124.48 accord plaintiff a legitimate claim of entitlement to be promoted based on (1) his rank on the promotional list, and (2) the number of vacancies that did in fact occur in the fire lieutenant position during the one-year period plaintiffs name appeared on the promotional list. By using the \u201cone of three\u201d rule in plaintiffs situation, the city of Cleveland Heights violated its own charter, and thereby deprived plaintiff of a legitimate claim of entitlement to a promotion to fire lieutenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">If Section 1983 is not a proper remedy in a case such as the cause <em>sub judice, </em>one wonders what type of factual scenario is now necessary in order to raise such a claim given the majority\u2019s ill-conceived opinion today.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the court of appeals below.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-8\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
