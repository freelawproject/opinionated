Ramirez, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. We must decide whether the Nagelis report, Weinstein report or prior permanent partial disability awards are \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s denial of temporary total disability compensation. See <em>State, ex rel. Burley, v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. For the reasons to follow, we find that there is no evidence supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Temporary total disability compensation was denied for the period September 28, 1987 through February 29, 1988. Addressing the medical evidence first, we note that Dr. Y.A. Nagelis did not examine claimant until February 26, 1988. His report, therefore, is not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting denial of temporary total compensation prior to that time. While the report could support a denial after February 26, 1988, the commission did not state the date on which it considered the claimant\u2019s condition to have become permanent. From the wording of the commission\u2019s order, we cannot ascertain whether the condition was found permanent as of (1) the latest permanent partial disability award of January 16, 1987; (2) Dr. Donald J. Weinstein\u2019s February 6, 1986 exam; (3) Dr. Nagelis\u2019 February 26, 1988 exam, or (4) the March 9, 1988 district hearing officer order. We refuse to speculate as to the commission\u2019s intention and, accordingly, find that Dr. Nagelis\u2019 report cannot be considered \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Dr. Weinstein stated that claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition was permanent. Claimant\u2019s alleged temporary total disability, however, was premised on <em>physical </em>conditions. Evidence that the claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition is permanent is irrelevant in determining whether claimant\u2019s temporary total disability resulted from his allowed physical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Turning to claimant\u2019s prior permanent partial disability awards, we observe that former R.C. 4123.56 and 4123.57 do not indicate whether a permanent partial disability award precludes later receipt of temporary total disability compensation. The only contemporaneous reference to the two forms of compensation occurs in former R.C. 4123.57(D), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">\u201cCompensation for [permanent] partial disability under divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this section shall be in addition to the compensation paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>employee for the periods of temporary total disability resulting from the injury or occupational disease * * *.\u201d (137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Former R.C. 4123.57(D) contains no qualification as to the chronology of the two awards. Coupled with the absence of language to the contrary in either former R.C. 4123.56 or 4123.57, these sections should not be considered to bar an award of temporary total disability compensation following receipt of permanent partial disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Appellant contends that statutory analysis notwithstanding, the \u201cpermanency\u201d element of a permanent partial disability award is sufficient to preclude receipt of temporary total disability compensation. This argument, however, necessarily assumes that \u201cpermanent,\u201d as used in former R.C. 4123.57 has the same meaning as that term is used in <em>Ramirez, supra. </em>We find otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">For our purposes herein, \u201cpermanent\u201d is not statutorily defined. (The definition of \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d implemented by Am. S.B. No. 307 and R.C. 4123.56 post-dates claimant\u2019s injury.) We defined \u201cpermanency,\u201d however, as used in <em>Ramirez, </em>as \u201ca condition that will, \u2018 * * * with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E.2d 1125, 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Previously, the Franklin County Court of Appeals held that \u201cpermanency\u201d is subject to differing interpretations. Perhaps cognizant of the dangers of using the term \u201cpermanent\u201d too loosely, the court wrote that:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">\u201c * * * [A] distinction exists between the permanency involved in a permanent partial disability award, and that considered in making an award of temporary total disability compensation.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Schafer, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Mar. 28, 1989), Franklin App. No. 88AP-130, unreported, at 5, 1989 WL 29363.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">We recently moved in Schafer\u2019s direction in <em>State, ex rel. Bing, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177, by stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">\u201cWhile Bing\u2019s injury may be permanent in the sense that she will continue to have back troubles in the future, it is not \u2018permanent\u2019 in the <em>Ramirez </em>sense * * <em>Id. </em>at 426, 575 N.E.2d at 180, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\"><em>Bing, </em>while not specifically distinguishing between permanent partial disability \u201cpermanency,\u201d and temporary total disability compensation \u201cpermanency,\u201d inferred that the term \u201cpermanency\u201d may have a unique meaning as used in <em>Ramirez. </em>This conclusion is not without precedent. Workers\u2019 compensation law uses specialized terms of art whose meanings can vary depending on context. \u201cTotality,\u201d for example, has one meaning when used to discuss permanent total disability; it means something else where temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>total disability is involved. Permanent <em>total </em>disability requires a claimant to demonstrate an inability to perform sustained remunerative employment. <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420. Temporary total disability, on the other hand, requires only an inability to return to the former position of employment. <em>Ramirez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">There are other reasons for distinguishing between permanent partial disability \u201cpermanency\u201d and <em>Ramirez </em>\u201cpermanency.\u201d First, temporary total disability compensation involves exclusively work-prohibitive disabilities, see <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>at syllabus, whereas permanent partial disability does not. More significantly, unlike \u201cpermanency\u201d which is a precondition to <em>receipt </em>of permanent partial benefits, temporary total disability \u201cpermanency\u201d is a <em>termination </em>criterion. The latter supplies compelling justification for ensuring that temporary total disability compensation is not terminated on a \u201cpermanency basis\u201d unless there is a clear indication that the claimant\u2019s condition will not improve. See <em>Vulcan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Permanent partial disability compensation is intended to compensate injured claimants who can still work. Few working claimants, however, can predict whether or not their injury will later worsen and prevent their working at their former job. A working claimant might be discouraged from seeking permanent partial disability compensation to which he would be otherwise entitled if receipt of such benefits would preclude later receipt of temporary total disability compensation should his condition worsen. We find this result unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Thus, where \u201cpermanency\u201d appears in a context other than temporary total disability \u2014 as occurred here with the earlier permanent partial disability awards \u2014 we will not automatically assume that such term is referring to \u201cpermanency\u201d in the specialized <em>Ramirez </em>sense. This conclusion does not conflict with our previous holding in <em>State, ex rel. Delk, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 187, 519 N.E.2d 638. That case held that a doctor\u2019s opinion that a claimant had a permanent partial impairment was \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the denial of temporary total disability compensation. There, however, the doctor was examining the claimant for the purpose of reinstating temporary total disability benefits, and he specifically stated that the claimant had a permanent partial, not a temporary total, impairment. <em>Delk </em>is thus distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b854-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b854-11\">Holmes, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
