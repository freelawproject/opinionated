On appeal, he claims that the court failed to exercise any discretion in denying the motion to withdraw his plea. Specifically, he argues that the court improperly limited itself to the grounds for withdrawing a guilty plea under Practice Book \u00a7 \u00a7 39-26 and 39-27, and encourages this court to adopt the \u201cfair and just\u201d reason standard for withdrawing a plea, as employed by federal courts and the American Bar Association.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant makes that particular argument for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . . The requirement that [a] claim be raised distinctly means that it must be so stated as to bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>77 Conn. App. 238, 245, 822 A.2d 366 (2003).

He never stated, however, that he was seeking to have the court consider his motion under the federal \u201cfair and just\u201d reason standard, nor did he indicate that there was <em>some </em>other authority, aside from Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-26 and 39-27, by which the court could allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
