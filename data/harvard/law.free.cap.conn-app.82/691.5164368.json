Second, the defendant claims that the court improperly declined his request to instruct the jury on manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>(3) as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The following facts are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s appeal. On May 11, 2000, the defendant and his three friends rented a room at the Colonial Park Motel in Meriden. After the defendant adamantly disputed the room charge, he fatally shot the motel clerk, Husmakh Patel, with a small caliber handgun. The state\u2019s original information charged the defendant with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of \u00a7 53a-217c. Thereafter, the defendant filed a request for essential facts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requesting that the state specify \u201c[wjhat specific . . . acts, language or behavior are alleged to constitute each offense charged?\u201d In response, the state filed a long form information, charging the defendant with committing murder \u201cby means of the discharge of a firearm\u201d in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a. At the charging conference, the defendant requested an instruction on reckless manslaughter in the first degree, as provided for in \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. The state also sought a lesser included offense instruction and requested that the court charge the jury on manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, as provided for in \u00a7 53a-55a.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The court instructed that \u201cthe third element\u201d of murder requires the state to prove \u201cthat the defendant caused the death ... by the <em>use </em>of a firearm.\u201d (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>sis added.) Moreover, the court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, charged the jury on manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. The jury found the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The defendant first claims that the court deprived him of his federal and state constitutional rights to notice by instructing the jury on manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. The defendant sets forth various theories in support of his claim. First, the defendant contends that the court improperly relied on the \u201cevidence test\u201d when it considered the state\u2019s nonessential factual allegation that he had committed murder \u201cby means of the discharge of a firearm\u201d in its lesser included offense analysis. Essentially, the defendant asserts that because manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm requires the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm as an essential element, which murder does not, the former offense cannot be a lesser offense included within the offense of murder. The defendant asserts that the court\u2019s charge contradicts decisions of our Supreme Court, which establish that an appropriate lesser included offense analysis is limited to a comparison of the essential statutory elements of the offenses at issue, rather than the nonessential factual allegations set forth in the charging document. Second, notwithstanding whether the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm constitutes the \u201cthird element\u201d of murder, as alleged in this case, the defendant argues that manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is still not a lesser offense included within the crime of murder because the manslaughter offense can be committed in three alternative ways, two of which do not require as an element the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">At the outset, we state our standard of review. The court, in determining whether manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is a lesser offense included within the crime of murder, is confronted with a question of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>266 Conn. 608, 615-16, 835 A.2d 12 (2003). Accordingly, our cases instruct us to conduct de novo or plenary review. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>257 Conn. 248, 252, 777 A.2d 627 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 939, 122 S. Ct. 1321, 151 L. Ed. 2d 229 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendant has a constitutional right \u201cto be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to meet them at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>205 Conn. 515, 518, 534 A.2d 882 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 1598, 99 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1988). \u201cThe function of an accusatory pleading such as an information is to inform a defendant of \u2018the nature and cause of the accusation\u2019 as required by our federal and state constitutions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 646, 458 A.2d 379 (1983). \u201cThe doctrine of lesser included offenses in Connecticut serves the state by precluding acquittal due to failure of proof of the greater crime, the accused by permitting conviction of a lesser crime, and the constitution by preserving the function of the fact-finder.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>MacFarlane, </em>188 Conn. 542, 546, 450 A.2d 374 (1982). \u201cThe constitutionality of instructing on lesser included offenses is grounded on the premise that whe[n] one or more offenses are lesser than and included within the crime charged, notice of the crime charged includes notice of all lesser included offenses. . . . This notice permits each party to prepare a case properly, each cognizant of its burden of proof.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Tomlin, supra, 266 Conn. 616-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant [not guilty] of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). Whistnant\u2019s second prong is implicated when the accused asserts that he was denied his constitutional right to notice of the crime of which he was ultimately convicted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Courts follow three methods to ascertain \u201cwhether a crime is a \u2018lesser included crime\u2019 when the evidence would support a conclusion that the lesser crime was committed: (1) The included crime may be one consisting solely of elements which must always be present for the greater crime to have been committed; (2) it may be one consisting solely of elements which must have been present for the greater offense to have been committed in the manner described by the information or bill of particulars thereto; (3) or it may be a crime which the evidence suggests and which could have been included in the information.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 60, 301 A.2d 547 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Connecticut\u2019s lesser included offense doctrine utilizes the second approach set forth in <em>Brown. </em>See id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>That approach includes Whistnant's second prong, \u201cwhich encompasses the cognate pleadings approach.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 618. \u201cThe cognate-pleadings approach . . . does not insist that the elements of the lesser offense be a subset of the higher offense. It is sufficient that the lesser offense have certain elements in common with the higher offense, which thereby makes it a \u2018cognate\u2019 or \u2018allied\u2019 offense even though it also has other elements not essential to the greater crime. [In addition], the relationship between the offenses is determined not by a comparison of statutory elements in the abstract, but by reference to the pleadings in the case. The key ordinarily is whether the allegations in the pleading charging the higher offense . . . include all of the elements of the lesser offense.\u201d Id., quoting 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel &amp; N. King, Criminal Procedure (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 24.8 (e), pp. 579-80; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>242 Conn. 523, 532, 700 A.2d 14 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In the present case, the defendant contends that the court improperly determined that <em>Whistnanf </em>s second prong was satisfied when the court charged the jury on manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. Specifically, the defendant contends in his brief that the court\u2019s \u201c[i]ncorporating nonessential factual allegations into its lesser included offense analysis is tantamount to employing the \u2018evidence test,\u2019 \u201d which was rejected in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 163 Conn. 60-61. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Following the cognate pleadings approach, it is apparent that the factual allegations contained in the state\u2019s information established that manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm was a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. The state originally had charged the defendant with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a. Before the defendant can be found guilty of murder, the state must prove that (1) he \u201cinten[ded] to cause the death of another person,\u201d and (2) he did \u201c[cause] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the death of such person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). In response to the defendant\u2019s subsequent request for essential facts, the state filed a long form information alleging that the defendant had committed murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a \u201cby means of the discharge of a firearm . . . .\u201d In effect, the state, by alleging those facts in its long form information, converted \u201cthe discharge of a firearm\u201d terminology into the \u201cthird element\u201d of murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">To satisfy <em>Whistnant\u2019s </em>second prong, it cannot be possible for the state to prove each element of the greater offense of murder, as previously set forth, without first satisfying each element of the offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. Essentially, an accused is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-55a (a) when (1) \u201che commits manslaughter in the first degree as provided in section 53a-55,\u201d and (2) \u201cin the commission of such offense [the accused] use[d], or [was] armed with and threatenfed] the use of or displayed] or represented] by his words or conduct that he possesse[d] a . . . firearm. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a (a). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ... (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\u201d Thus, the greater offense of murder, as alleged in the state\u2019s long form information, satisfied <em>Whistnant\u2019s </em>second prong because it would have been impossible to commit that offense without first having committed the lesser offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>we conclude that the court, in its lesser included offense instruction, properly considered the facts set forth in the state\u2019s long form information, which alleged that the defendant had committed murder \u201cby means of the discharge of the firearm . . . .\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 620 (holding that trial court \u201cproperly considered the allegation that the defendant \u2018did shoot\u2019 the victim in determining whether to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Notwithstanding whether it was proper for the court, in its lesser included offense analysis, to consider nonessential facts alleged by the state, the defendant sets forth an alternative theory to support his assertion that manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is not a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. Specifically, the defendant argues that even if the \u201cdischarge of a firearm\u201d constitutes the \u201cthird element\u201d of murder under the cognate pleadings approach, manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is still not a lesser offense included within the crime of murder under <em>Whistnant\u2019s </em>second prong because the former offense can be proved in three alternative ways. As previously mentioned, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-55a (a), the state must prove that the accused either (1) used a firearm, (2) was armed with and threatened the use of a firearm or (3) displayed or represented by his words or conduct that he possessed a firearm. The defendant contends that when the state alleged \u201cdischarge of a firearm,\u201d it merely alleged the \u201c \u2018use\u2019 of a firearm for purposes of manslaughter [in the first degree] with a firearm.\u201d Thus, because the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm is only one of the three ways in which to commit manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, the defendant contends that the state failed to satisfy <em>Whistnant\u2019s </em>second prong by failing to allege the two alternative methods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>in its murder charge. Likewise, the defendant asserts that under Whistnant\u2019s second prong, manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm cannot be a lesser offense included within the crime of murder, even as it is alleged in this case, because there are two ways in which to commit the manslaughter offense without the actual \u201cuse\u201d of that firearm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Our Supreme Court decided the \u201cissue regarding the significance of the term \u2018offense,\u2019 as it is used in [the <em>Whistnant </em>test], that [the Supreme Court] previously [had] not considered.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 623. \u201c[T]he term \u2018offense,\u2019 . . . refers to each distinct method, which may be comprised of different elements, by which a crime may be completed. The term \u2018offense\u2019 does not refer to the title of the crime encompassing each of those distinct methods.\u201d Id., 624. \u201cThe second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>is satisfied, therefore, only to the extent that it was not possible to commit the greater offense of murder, in the manner described in the information, without first having committed the lesser offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm by the actual use of a firearm.\u201d Id., 626. Because the state\u2019s allegations support a conviction only under the use of a firearm portion of the offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, the court could not properly instruct the jury on the two alternative methods of committing that offense, as the defendant would not have been afforded the required constitutional notice. See id., 626-27. Accordingly, we conclude that it was proper for the court to charge on the \u201cuse of a firearm\u201d portion of the offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his written request to charge the jury on reckless manslaughter in the first degree, as provided for in \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), as a lesser offense included with the crime of murder. Because of our resolution of the defendant\u2019s first claim in an adverse manner, there is no need to address his second claim. The defendant does not argue that the element of the use of a firearm was sufficiently in dispute to allow the jury to find that he committed manslaughter in the first degree without the use of a firearm. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gebeau, </em>55 Conn. App. 795, 799-800, 740 A.2d 906 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 922, 744 A.2d 518 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm when he commits manslaughter in the first degree as provided in section 53a-55, and in the commission of such offense he uses ...
