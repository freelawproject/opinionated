We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. During the evening hours of November 1, 1996, the defendant and an accomplice, Vaughn Walker, arrived at the West Hartford home of John Haugh and Patricia Haugh. Walker severed the telephone lines to the home, and the defendant and Walker gained entry by means of a garage window. John Haugh, who was in his living room at the time of the intrusion, resisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the defendant and Walker. The defendant struck John Haugh in the stomach and Walker struck Haugh in the head with a small baseball bat that he had brought with him. After subduing Haugh, Walker and the defendant bound Haugh\u2019s legs with duct tape that they had brought with them. John Haugh died as a result of the head injury inflicted by Walker. The defendant and Walker thereafter went upstairs, where they found Patricia Haugh asleep in her bed. Walker forcibly held a pillow over Patricia Haugh\u2019s head, smothering her to death, while the defendant stood nearby. Walker killed the victims in furtherance of a criminal scheme between himself and the defendant. The object of this scheme was to burglarize the home and to steal John Haugh\u2019s automobile. The defendant and Walker removed several items from the home, including credit cards, personal checks and a compact disc player. They left in John Haugh\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In its charge, the court instructed the jury that the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each and eveiy element of each offense charged. The court then instructed the jury with regard to reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>instruction deprived him of the due process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>afforded him under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut and the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. The defendant claims that the instruction created a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d and a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the jury believed that \u201ca doubt, to be reasonable, was greater than that needed to acquit under the state and federal constitutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The defendant challenges several aspects of the reasonable doubt instructions but did not preserve many aspects of his claim. He now seeks review under the four part test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The claim is reviewable because the record is adequate and because a claim of instructional error related to the burden of proof is of constitutional magnitude. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 686-87, 701 A.2d 1 (1997). The claim, however, fails on its merits under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong because the defendant has not demonstrated that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u201cIt is fundamental that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The [reasonable doubt concept] provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence \u2014 that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. ... At the same time, by impressing upon the [fact finder] the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused, the [reasonable doubt] standard symbolizes the significance that our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>society attaches to the criminal sanction and thus to liberty itself. . . . [Consequently] [t]he defendants in a criminal case are entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge by the court that the guilt of the defendants must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u201cIn detern\u00faning whether a trial court\u2019s charge satisfies constitutional requirements, however, individual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law: . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Reynolds, 264 Conn. 1, 105-106, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>First, the defendant challenges the following sentence from the instruction: \u201cIt is not required that the state prove guilt beyond all possible doubt.\u201d The defendant argues that this language unduly favored the prosecution. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 687-88, our Supreme Court upheld a nearly identical statement in an instruction on reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court stated that it had before it no valid reason to depart from its previous decisions approving such an instruction under either the state or federal constitutions; id., 688; and we are bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Second, the defendant challenges the following sentence from the instruction, which the court repeated twice: \u201cThe law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty.\u201d The defendant argues that this part of the instruction favored the state. This statement is not an improper component of an instruction on reasonable doubt because it accurately states the law, and our Supreme Court has upheld nearly verbatim instructions. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>256 Conn. 193, 202, 770 A.2d 491 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 343 n.2, 514 A.2d 337 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Third, the defendant claims that the court improperly omitted an instruction that he sought in his request to charge, namely, that \u201c[i]f you are not convinced in your mind to a mental state of near certitude of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt, then the state has not convinced you beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The defendant recognizes that our Supreme Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 342, ruled that due process does not require the court to use such language concerning the jury\u2019s \u201cnear certitude\u201d in reaching a verdict. The defendant, however, argues that the charge was improper because it did not include either this language or language concerning the jury\u2019s need to possess an \u201cabiding conviction\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt prior to delivering a guilty verdict. Having reviewed the charge in its entirety, we conclude that it adequately conveyed the requisite degree of certitude required by the jury in order to reach a guilty verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Fourth, the defendant claims that the court diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof in the following instruction: \u201cIf you had a reasonable doubt, it would be such a doubt of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would hesitate in the most important affairs of his or her life to act upon it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the word \u201cconvincing\u201d implied that a reasonable doubt needed to be a doubt held with a high level of confidence, a doubt that \u201cis the very biggest type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>doubt one can possess.\u201d This strained interpretation of the word \u201cconvincing\u201d runs contrary to the court\u2019s overall charge. Further, our Supreme Court has upheld nearly identical language. See, e.g., <em>State v. </em>Velasco, 253 Conn. 210, 248-49, 751 A.2d 800 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 688; see also <em>State </em>v. Nunes, 58 Conn. App. 296, 308, 752 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 944, 762 A.2d 906 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Steed, </em>54 Conn. App. 543, 549-50, 736 A.2d 918 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Fifth, the defendant challenges the following instruction: \u201cReasonable doubt. The meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, a guess or a mere conjecture, nor is it a doubt not warranted by the evidence.\u201d The defendant claims that this part of the instruction diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof because it implied that the juiy was free to dismiss a doubt suggested by the evidence or lack of evidence in the case if such doubt was a surmise, a guess or a mere conjecture. We reject this unreasonable inteipretation of the instruction. The court appropriately conveyed to the jury, several times in its charge, that the jury was to examine carefully the evidence and to acquit the defendant of the crimes with which he stood charged if a reasonable doubt existed as to his guilt. The court adequately addressed the relationship between the sufficiency of the evidence and the concept of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Sixth, the defendant challenges the court\u2019s charge because it twice contained an instruction that reasonable doubt was not a doubt \u201cnot warranted by the evidence.\u201d The defendant posits that this instruction was ambiguous because the word \u201cwarrant\u201d is susceptible of more than one meaning. We conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the word \u201cwarrant,\u201d in the customary context in which the court used it, misled the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Betances, </em>265 Conn. 493, 510-11, 828 A.2d 1248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Seventh, the defendant challenges the court\u2019s instructions that reasonable doubt is \u201cnot a surmise, a guess or a mere conjecture.\u201d He argues that such instruction may have caused the jury \u201cnot merely to exclude aberrant mental processes, but to put aside real doubts unless those doubts have in their minds a certain degree of strength . . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s strained interpretation of this aspect of the court\u2019s instruction is not persuasive. Further, our Supreme Court has upheld nearly identical instructions. See, <em>e.g., State v. Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 221 n.30, 833 A.2d 363 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>253 Conn. 195, 206, 749 A.2d 1192 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Eighth, the defendant challenges that part of the court\u2019s instruction that reasonable doubt \u201cis not a hesitation springing from any feelings of sympathy or pity for the accused or any other persons who might be affected by your decision.\u201d The court later reiterated that reasonable doubt \u201cwould not be a hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy.\u201d The defendant claims that these instructions were \u201cpro state\u201d because the court advised the jury not to have sympathy for him but did not specifically advise the jury not to have sympathy for \u201cthe victims and their family.\u201d The court\u2019s instruction in no way encouraged the jury to let feelings of sympathy for any person or persons affect its verdict; the court advised the juiy not to be affected by \u201cfeelings of sympathy or pity for the accused <em>or any other persons who might be affected by your </em>decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant\u2019s interpretation of this instruction belies the plain language of the court\u2019s explicit admonition and wholly lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Ninth, the defendant challenges the court\u2019s instructions that reasonable doubt was \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt . . . .\u201d There exists overwhelming precedent adverse to this claim. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 106; <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 249, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 293-98, 780 A.2d 53 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Tenth, the defendant challenges the instruction that if the jury finds a reasonable doubt as to guilt, \u201cthe accused must be given the benefit of that doubt . . . .\u201d The defendant posits that the instruction \u201ccould readily be taken to equate when an accused person should be acquitted with giving someone \u2018the benefit of [the] doubt\u2019 and that this would yet again suggest that reasonable doubt territory is entered in the vicinity of \u2018when the guilt or innocence is evenly balanced.\u2019 \u201d We see no practical difference between this claim and the claim that we rejected in <em>State </em>v. Vicente, 62 Conn. App. 625, 631-32, 772 A.2d 643 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Finally, the defendant challenges the following instruction, which the court delivered prior to delivering its specific instructions concerning reasonable doubt: \u201cThe state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to each and every element of the crime charged, but this burden does not operate on any subordinate evidentiary or incidental facts, as distinguished from proof of the elements of the crime or an ultimate fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u201cWhere, however, the state relies in whole or in part on circumstantial evidence to prove an element of the crime, although each link in the chain of evidence to support it need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the cumulative impact of the evidence must, in order to support that inference, prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the element of the crime has been proved.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">The court correctly stated the law with regard to the state\u2019s burden of proof. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Dorans, 261 Conn. 730, 747-48 n.21, 806 A.2d 1033 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Green, </em>62 Conn. App. 217, 222, 774 A.2d 157 (2001), aff'd, 261 Conn. 653, 804 A.2d 810 (2002). We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s statement of the law in this regard was \u201cprobably confusing.\u201d This court has held that instructions of this type are proper. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>53 Conn. App. 690, 699-700, 734 A.2d 136 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Having reviewed the court\u2019s instructions concerning reasonable doubt as a whole, we conclude that they could not reasonably have misled the jury. We review jury instructions to determine their effect on the jury in guiding it to a proper verdict. In contrast, the defendant has dissected the court\u2019s charge in a microscopic search for possible error. In so doing, he has interpreted individual words and phrases in artificial isolation, urging us to afford them interpretations that run contrary to their obvious meaning in the context of the court\u2019s charge. Further, the defendant has devoted a significant part of his claim challenging customary instructions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the appellate courts of this state have consistently upheld as being proper. The defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> The court imposed a total effective sentence of 108 years imprisonment with a 50 year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> The court\u2019s instructions were as follows: \u201cNow we come to reasonable doubt, an obviously key concept in our criminal law. I gave you some preview on this just before we started the evidence, as I recall, and, unfortunately, it\u2019s not simple. It\u2019s very important</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u201cThe law presumes [the defendant] to be innocent of the crimes charged. This [defendant], although accused, begins the trial with a \u2018clean slate.\u2019 That is, with no evidence against him. The law permits nothing but legal evidence presented to you to be considered in support of any charge against him. The presumption of innocence alone is sufficient to acquit [the defendant] unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u201cIt is not required that the state prove guilt beyond all possible doubt. The test is one of reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense, the kind of doubt that would malee a reasonable [person] hesitate to act. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt must therefore be proof of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would not hesitate to rely \u2014 a reasonable person would not hesitate to act upon it in the most important affairs in his or her own life. If you had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>reasonable doubt, it would be such a doubt of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would hesitate in the most important affairs of his or her life to act upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u201cYou remember that [the defendant] is never to be convicted on mere suspicion or conjecture. The burden is always upon the state to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden never shifts to the defendant. The law never imposes on the defendant in a criminal case the duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence. If you, the jury, after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case have a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] is not guilty of any of the charges, you must acquit him of that charge or of those charges. The exception we will get into on the affirmative defense, whether there is a burden of proof on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u201cReasonable doubt. The meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, a guess or a mere conjecture, nor is it a doubt not warranted by the evidence. It is such a doubt that in the serious affairs that concern you, you would heed. That is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance. It is not a hesitation springing from any feelings of sympathy or pity for the accused or any other persons who might be affected by your decision. It is, in other words, a reasonable doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence. It is a doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after a fair and careful examination of the entire evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all doubt. The law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty. The law requires that after hearing all of the evidence, if there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence that leaves in the minds of jurors as reasonable men and women a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt and acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u201cProof beyond areasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. Again, the meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, guess or mere conjecture. It is not a doubt that is not warranted by the evidence or lack of evidence. It is a doubt that in the serious affairs of your life you would heed. That is, such a doubt as would cause you to hesitate to act in matters of importance. It would not be a hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy. It is, in other words, a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence. It\u2019s a doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in the light of the evidence after a fair and careful examination and comparison of the entire evidence. It does not mean proof beyond all doubt. The law does not require absolute certainty before a jury returns with a verdict of guilty. The law requires that after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>hearing all the evidence, if there\u2019s something in the evidence or lack of evidence that leaves in the minds of the jurors as reasonable men and women a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> The defendant claims that the due process clause of the constitution of Connecticut affords him greater protection than its federal counterpart and, thus, even if the court\u2019s instruction survives scrutiny under the federal constitution, it would not survive scrutiny under our state constitution. The defendant claims that the inquiry under the state constitution asks whether there was \u201ca reasonable possibility\u201d that one or more jurors could have misunderstood the court\u2019s instructions so as to convict him with less than the proper burden of proof. The defendant further claims that the inquiry under the federal constitution asks only whether an improper instruction created a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jury applied an improper instruction in reaching its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that any difference in protection exists. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Otero, </em>49 Conn. App. 459, 470-74, 715 A.2d 782, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 910, 719 A.2d 905 (1998), the defendant sought review of the trial court\u2019s instruction concerning reasonable doubt, claiming that the instruction deprived him of his right to due process under both the state and federal constitutions. In addressing the claim, this court stated: \u201c[0]ur Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Court has repeatedly held that, as a general rule, the due process clauses of both the United States and Connecticut constitutions have the same meanings and impose similar limitations. . . . Furthermore, this court has noted that in an independent analysis of a state constitutional provision, departure from federal constitutional precedent is usually justified only where the United States Supreme Court has created exception to or deviated from rales previously enunciated by it ... . When we find that our citizens have relied on an understanding of their constitutional rights that is more expansive than that afforded under a recent interpretation of the federal constitution by the United States Supreme Court, we will be inclined to interpret our state constitution as affording greater protection to preserve those rights. . . . Otherwise, we will continue to follow the persuasive analysis of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 470-71 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The defendant has not persuaded us that such circumstances exist or that we should deviate from our adherence to the well settled standard of review that both this court and our Supreme Court have applied to numerous claims, brought under both our state and federal constitutions, of improper instruction on the principle of reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, 253 </em>Conn. 210, 247, 751 A.2d 800 (2000); <em>State v. Griffin, 253 </em>Conn. 195, 206, 749 A.2d 1192 (2000).
