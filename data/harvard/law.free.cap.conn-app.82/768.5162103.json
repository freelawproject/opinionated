J.</author>\n<p id=\"APTa\">The defendant George Greco<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of the trial court dissolving his marriage to the plaintiff, Eileen Greco. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court, in fashioning its financial orders, (1) overvalued the defendant\u2019s stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., (2) improperly awarded the plaintiff 98 percent of the parties\u2019 marital assets, (3) improperly relied on gross income, rather than net income, in determining the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation, (4) improperly ordered the defendant to pay alimony and other expenses that exceed his available income, and (5) abused its discretion in awarding the plaintiff $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. We agree with the defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims, which are interrelated, and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>plaintiff and the defendant were married on September 28, 1974. It was the second marriage for both parties. At the time of the marriage, the defendant had custody of his five children from his prior marriage and the plaintiff had custody of a child bom during her prior marriage. In 1997, DNA testing revealed that the defendant is that child\u2019s biological father. The parties also had a child together bom during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Before the parties were married, the defendant owned and operated a gasoline service station. After they were married, the defendant sold the service station and opened an auto parts business. The defendant\u2019s five children from his prior marriage were all involved in operating the auto parts business, Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., as was the parties\u2019 first child. The defendant also formed and controlled a partnership called LDGG Limited Partnership. Throughout the marriage, the plaintiff was a full-time homemaker, caring for the children and managing the household.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In February, 2000, the plaintiff brought this dissolution action by a one count complaint, claiming an irretrievable breakdown in the marital relationship. She sought the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 property, alimony and attorney\u2019s fees. On September 25, 2001, the plaintiff filed a three count third amended complaint. The first count was directed against the defendant and was identical to the one count in the original complaint. The second count was directed against the defendant, the defendant\u2019s five adult children from his prior marriage, two \u201cspray trusts\u201d established for the parties\u2019 two children and the LDGG Limited Partnership. That count alleged that the defendant\u2019s transfers of certain assets were fraudulent in violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-552a et seq., and, therefore, they should be set aside and the assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>returned to the marital estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third count essentially was identical to the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On October 11, 2001, the defendant filed an answer and a counterclaim for dissolution of marriage. On October 30, 2001, the defendant\u2019s five children from his prior marriage filed an answer, special defenses and a four count counterclaim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They also filed a claim for a jury trial. On that same date, the LDGG Limited Partnership and the trustee of the two trusts filed their answers and special defenses. On November 8,2001, the plaintiff filed an answer and special defenses to the counterclaims of the defendant\u2019s five children from his prior marriage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">After a lengthy trial, the court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage on January 11, 2002, on the basis of irretrievable breakdown. The court also determined that the plaintiff failed to prove her \u201cfraudulent transfer claims by the requisite clear and convincing evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court, however, stated that although it would not set aside the transfers or include the assets involved in the marital estate, it would consider the defendant\u2019s removal of those assets from the marital estate in fashioning its financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>In its orders, the court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $710 per week in alimony until the death of either party, the plaintiffs remarriage or her cohabitation. It also ordered the defendant to maintain his life insurance for the plaintiffs benefit and to provide health insurance for her for three years. The court further ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his interest in the marital residence at 24 Sunbrook Road in Woodbridge. In addition, the court ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., or, alternatively, the value of that stock, which the court found to be $250,000. Finally, the court ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his individual retirement account, which was valued at approximately $9900, and to pay to the plaintiff $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant now appeals from those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">We address the defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims together because they are interrelated. The defendant claims that the court improperly relied on gross income, rather than net income, in determining the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation. The defendant also claims that the court improperly ordered him to pay alimony and other expenses that far exceeded his available net income. We agree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Initially, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cWe review financial awards in dissolution actions under an abuse of discretion standard. ... In order to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we must find that the court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>67 Conn. App. 108, 111, 786 A.2d 525 (2001). \u201cIn making those determinations, we allow every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the correctness of [the trial court\u2019s] action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiVito </em>v. <em>DiVito, </em>77 Conn. App. 124, 130, 822 A.2d 294, cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>264 Conn. 921, 828 A.2d 617 (2003). Mindful of those principles, we now turn to the issue of whether the court incorrectly applied the law by basing its financial orders on the parties\u2019 gross incomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that a court must base . . . alimony orders on the available net income of the parties, not gross income.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. Morris, 262 Conn. 299, 306, 811 A.2d 1283 (2003); see also <em>Ludgin </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>64 Conn. App. 355, 358, 780 A.2d 198 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In the present case, although the court, in its memorandum of decision, did not \u201caffirmatively and expressly\u201d state that it relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes in determining its alimony order; see <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 306; it did find that the defendant had \u201ca $73,840 annual income from the auto parts business . . . .\u201d That amount is equal to the defendant\u2019s gross income as stated in his financial affidavit. In addition, in its financial orders, the court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $710 per week in alimony, which is precisely 50 percent of the defendant\u2019s gross income. Both parties submitted financial affidavits in which they stated their net income. The court, therefore, had before it evidence of the parties\u2019 net incomes, but failed to mention such income and, instead, focused on the defendant\u2019s gross income.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The court\u2019s reliance on the gross incomes of the parties in fashioning its financial orders is further evinced by the fact that the court ordered the defendant to pay alimony and other expenses that far exceeded his available net income.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court ordered the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>to pay alimony in the amount of $36,920 per year, life insurance premiums for the plaintiff in the amount of $12,480 per year and health insurance premiums for the plaintiff in the amount of $5972.16 per year. Those payments, when deducted from the defendant\u2019s gross income, as found by the court, leave the defendant with $18,467.84.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court also required the defendant to pay $20,000 per year toward the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which leaves the defendant with a yearly <em>gross income </em>deficit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, because the court awarded the plaintiff $720,936.56 out of the parties\u2019 $731,870.21 total marital assets, the defendant has virtually no assets that can be used to meet his annual deficit or to provide for his ordinary living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In addition, in light of the court\u2019s findings with respect to the defendant\u2019s age, health and ability to work,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>is clear that the defendant\u2019s ability to earn income is entirely dependent on his control of Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc.,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the source of that control is his sixty-five shares of stock in the corporation, which represent 53.3 percent of the total shares having voting power.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In its orders, however, the court ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., or, alternatively, to pay to the plaintiff the value of that stock, which the court found to be $250,000. If the defendant retains the stock, the court gave him two payment options (1) a lump sum of $250,000 paid within ninety days or (2) a \u201cpromissory note in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>$250,000, providing for interest of 7 percent per annum, payable monthly over a ten year period, with adequate security.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s order transfers control of Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., to the plaintiff or, alternatively, requires the defendant to pay funds to the plaintiff, which, in light of the court\u2019s other orders and findings, he does not appear to have.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The court\u2019s order, therefore, in effect, requires the defendant to transfer control of the closely held corporation to the plaintiff, which gives her control over the defendant\u2019s employment and his only significant source of income. Accordingly, the court\u2019s taking the corporation into account in both the property division and in the award of alimony and other payments is, in essence, \u201cdouble dipping\u201d and inequitable because the corporation provides the only significant stream of income by which the defendant can meet his alimony and other court ordered payment obligations. See <em>Dunleavy </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Danbury, Docket No. 334546 (September 11, 2000); <em>Cardillo </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford Norwalk, Docket No. 114248 (June 10, 1992); see also <em>Krafick </em>v. <em>Krafick, </em>234 Conn. 783, 804-805 n.26, 663 A.2d 365 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">We conclude that the court incorrectly applied the law by basing its financial orders on the parties\u2019 gross incomes and that it abused its discretion by ordering the defendant to pay alimony and other expenses that far exceed his available net income.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We further con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>elude that the court\u2019s award, in practical effect, equates to \u201cdouble dipping\u201d and, therefore, is inequitable. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment with respect to all the financial orders. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 307; <em>Ludgin </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The judgment is reversed as to the financial orders only and the case is remanded for a new hearing on all financial issues in accordance with law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\"> Also named as defendants were George Greco\u2019s five children from a previous marriage, two trusts George Greco established for two children he lathered with the plaintiff and the LDGG Limited Partnership in which he has an ownership interest. Because only George Greco has appealed, we refer to him as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-12\"> On the basis of our disposition of the defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims, we need not address the defendant\u2019s other claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\"> Between 1998 and 1999, the defendant transferred to his children, either directly or via trust, the majority of his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., and title to various parcels of real estate related to that business. Those assets were worth more than $1 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\"> One of the defendant\u2019s children, George Greco, Jr., subsequently passed away and the administratrix of his estate was substituted as a party. On November 27, 2001, the administratrix filed an answer to the plaintiffs third amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> On May 14, 2001, the court ordered that \u201cthe issues of the dissolution of marriage, property and alimony and other claims together with the counts on fraudulent conveyances and the special defenses of the defendant children will be tried to the court. After the court decides these issues and enters judgment, the court will address the issues relative to the defendant children\u2019s counterclaims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\"> We note that the court\u2019s finding that the transfers were not fraudulent is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\"> The court found that \u201c[djespite testimony about some income from [the plaintiffs] porcelain doll hobby or business, no income capacity is assigned to the [plaintiff] . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\"> We note that our jurisprudence requires the court to consider the statutory criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 in determining whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration and amount of the award. Those criteria are \u201cthe length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-81 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\"> Because the court did not make any finding with respect to the defendant\u2019s net income, there is no evidence as to what the defendant\u2019s after tax net income would be after making the alimony, life insurance and health insurance payments; however, it certainly would not be more than and likely would be less than his gross amount. In his financial affidavit, the defendant stated that his net income is $53,872 per year. If that figure is used, the defendant already is left with a deficit after making only those payments to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> Specifically, the court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees at a rate of $20,000 per year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b804-10\"> We note that although the court made no specific findings with respect to the defendant\u2019s unpaid attorney\u2019s fees, if factored in, that expense would certainly increase the defendant\u2019s deficit. Also, although the court found that the defendant gambles extensively, it did not find that the defendant\u2019s winnings exceeded his losses, thereby, serving as an additional source of income for the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\"> In it memorandum of decision, the court stated in relevant part: \u201c[The defendant] is sixty-four years of age, completed the eighth grade . . . and has been engaged in the auto repair and parts business throughout his life. His health is very poor. He suffers from angina and other related health problems which commenced in 1988. After numerous surgical procedures, he remains under the care of various physicians, takes nine different medications and is depressed. It would appear that his ability to work has been seriously compromised.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\"> Although the court found that the defendant \u201creceives regular cash gifts of up to $500 from at least one of his children,\u201d it is doubtful that those contributions will continue if the defendant no longer controls Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. Indeed, in its articulation, the court stated: \u201cThe inescapable conclusion in the instant, case is that reserving voting control [in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc.] was the [defendant\u2019s] way of preserving control over his children in the event they did not do things his way.\u201d Furthermore, in his closing argument, the plaintiffs counsel stated in relevant part: \u201c[The defendant\u2019s] income dramatically increased. . . . Your Honor, that doesn\u2019t happen because you\u2019re doing nothing, it happens because you have control, and it happens because you can impose your will on those around you to pay you those moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\u201c[W]hen [the defendant] transferred his interest in the corporation [to his children], he didn\u2019t give them a controlling interest, he didn\u2019t give them all of it. I asked him why. He doesn\u2019t know. . . . But, I think I can draw a reasonable inference why he didn\u2019t, Your Honor. I think the reason he didn\u2019t was <em>because he had to have that control. </em>You don\u2019t get a $20,000 raise over two years when you\u2019re doing nothing because your children are being generous to you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\"> In its articulation, the court stated in relevant part: \u201cIt became abundantly clear to the court that while the [defendant] transferred virtually the entire equity in the business, he cunningly retained voting control. In the court\u2019s estimation, voting control of a small corporation is often more important than equity interest \u2014 such is the case in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. Voting control has the ultimate power to elect directors, in effect elect officers, determine policy, set compensation, hire and fire employees, and in numerous other ways dictate the direction of the company. The inescapable conclusion in the instant case is that reserving voting control was the [defendant\u2019s] way of preserving control over his children in the event they did not do things his way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> The terms of the promissory note would require the defendant to pay to the plaintiff approximately an additional $34,832.52 per year for ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\"> The plaintiff contends that the court\u2019s \u201caward of alimony and insurance was reasonable in light of the [defendant\u2019s] underreported income\u201d and that the court could have based its award on the defendant\u2019s earning capacity rather than on his actual net income. Although the court stated that the defendant\u2019s testimony frequently lacked credibility and his financial affidavit had to be amended several times during the trial to conform to the testimony, its memorandum of decision is devoid of any specific finding with respect to the defendant\u2019s alleged unreported income or his earning capacity. \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>court cannot find facts or draw conclusions from primary facts found, but can only review such findings to determine whether they could legally, logically and reasonably be found and whether the trial court could thereby conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parkview Paving Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>13 Conn. App. 574, 575, 537 A.2d 1049, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 810, 541 A.2d 1240 (1988). Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
