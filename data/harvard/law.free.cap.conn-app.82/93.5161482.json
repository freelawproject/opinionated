Smoker, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>James E. Thomas, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Cathryn J. Krinitsky, </em>senior assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b123-12\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b123-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A6G\">The trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction is reversed. The defendant, Kennolley Brooks, appeals from the judgment of conviction rendered after he entered a plea of guilty to the crimes of possession of a controlled substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c) and breach of the peace in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 53a-181. The defendant claims, inter alia, that his constitutional rights were violated by the court\u2019s insufficient explanation to him of the rights that he waived upon entering the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe question of an effective waiver of a federal constitutional right in a proceeding is of course governed by federal standards. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>[380 U.S. 415, 422, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L. Ed. 2d 934 <em>(1965 )]\" Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). \u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>[378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964)]. Second, is the right to trial by jury. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>[391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968)]. Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>[380 U.S. 400, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965)]. We cannot presume a waiver of these three important federal rights from a silent record.\u201d <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendant contends, and the state concedes, that the court gave insufficient advice to the pro se defendant regarding two of his core <em>Boykin </em>rights, namely, his right to confront the state\u2019s witnesses against him and his privilege against self-incrimination. Without a record indicating that he understood those rights and voluntarily waived them, the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
