These petitioners argue that their sentences, too, are unconstitutional. This important question, which has generated divergence among the lower courts, calls out for an answer. Because this Court's decision to deny certiorari precludes petitioners from obtaining such an answer, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Petitioner Thilo Brown, like others whose petitions the Court denies today, was sentenced as a \"career offender\" under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1(a) (Nov. 2004) (USSG). At the time, those Guidelines were mandatory. They were \"binding on judges\" and carried \"the force and effect of laws.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants qualified as \"career offender [s]\" if they had \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p234\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There were different ways that a past conviction could count as \"a crime of violence,\" but only one is at issue here: A conviction counted as \"a crime of violence\" if it \"involve[d] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2002). Because it supplied an amorphous catchall at the end of a more definite list, that phrase has been known as the \"residual clause.\" If the phrase sounds familiar, it may be because in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 576 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), this Court considered the exact same language in another provision where it was binding on judges and had the force and effect of law: a statute called the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Like the Guidelines, the ACCA also required enhanced punishments for career offenders. And, like the Guidelines, the ACCA included its own residual clause. In fact, the ACCA's residual clause was identical to the Guidelines' residual clause. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) ( \"... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   struck down the ACCA's residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . You might think that if a sequence of words that increases a person's time in prison is unconstitutionally vague in one legally binding provision, that same sequence is unconstitutionally vague if it serves the same purpose in another legally binding provision. Indeed, after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Sentencing Commission deleted the residual clause from the Guidelines. See USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2016). But for petitioners like Brown, who were sentenced long before\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , this Court has thus far left the validity of their sentences an open question. See\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 580 U.S. ----, ----, ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p900\">\n    137 S.Ct. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 900-901, 901-903,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p900\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p900\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----, n. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p900\">\n    137 S.Ct., at 903, n. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring). The Court's decision today all but ensures that the question will never be answered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In these petitions, that question largely overlaps with a related, timeliness question: whether Brown and his fellow petitioners may rely on the right announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , in the ACCA context, to attack collaterally their mandatory-Guidelines sentences. Federal law imposes on prisoners seeking to mount collateral attacks on final sentences \"[a] 1-year period of limitation ... from the latest of\" several events. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). One event that can reopen this window is this Court \"newly recogniz[ing]\" a right and making that right \"retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\" \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The right recognized in the ACCA context in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , we have held, is retroactive on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 578 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1265\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1265\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The question for a petitioner like Brown, then, is whether he may rely on the right recognized in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to challenge identical language in the mandatory Guidelines. Three Courts of Appeals have said no. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/\">\n    868 F.3d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.A.4 2017) (case below);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Raybon v.

One Court of Appeals has said yes. See\n   <em>\n    Cross v.

Another has strongly hinted yes in a different posture, after which point the Government dismissed at least one appeal that would have allowed the court to answer the question directly.
