The decisions of this State have never expressly laid down the rule urged by defendants but, in practice, it has always been observed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And 1 <em>Whartons Evidence, </em>\u00a7 360 indicates that it is the general rule in the country:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cProof <em>aliunde. </em>Proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>by evidence <em>aliunde </em>is necessary as a basis for the admission of an extrajudicial confession by the accused. Where the <em>corpus delicti </em>is otherwise sufficiently established, the uncorroborated confession of the accused is sufficient to warrant his conviction of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>fense charged and confessed, even in those cases where the punishment thereof is death. In such a case the jury should first pass upon the sufficiency of the proof <em>aliunde </em>of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>but it is not required that the <em>corpus delicti </em>be proved beyond the possibility of doubt before evidence of the confession of the accused can be submitted to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">However, the decisions are not in harmony as to the quantum of proof required to be offered as a condition precedent to the admission of a confession. Certainly, it is not the general rule that the <em>corpus delicti </em>be proved conclusively prior to the offer of a confession. I <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 360, <em>supra. </em>I understand the better-reasoned cases to hold that the quantum of proof <em>aliunde </em>should be that which, though not in itself conclusive, when taken in connection with the confession, establishes the <em>corpus delicti </em>beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jones v. State, </em>188 <em>Md. </em>263, 52 <em>A. </em>2d 484, and see also 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 360 and cases cited in Note 9. And this in conjunction with proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused\u2019s criminal agency is sufficient to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> Applying this rule to the case at bar, we have these facts <em>aliunde </em>the confessions. The defendants were parked at night in a manner and place such as to arouse the suspicion of the police. When the lights of the police car were played upon defendants\u2019 station wagon, two heads \u201cpopped up\u201d from the middle of the front seat and defendants put their car in motion, apparently to attempt escape. Finally, when apprehended, their trousers were open in such manner as to expose themselves. I have no hesitation in concluding that these facts taken in connection with the complete and wholly voluntary confessions not only establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>but, moreover, I regret to say, the guilt of these defendants beyond a reasonable doubt. I say \u201cregret\u201d because, in my opinion, these two men are not so much criminals as mentally ill. However, under the present state of the law, I can make no other disposition of the matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Verdict of guilty as to each defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The old Court of Oyer and Terminer, in which I sat, so held in <em>State v.
