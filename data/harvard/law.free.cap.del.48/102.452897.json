Harmon, 9 W. W. Harr. </em>22, 196 <em>A. </em>158. In <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. Stover, </em>8 <em>Terry </em>110, 87 <em>A. </em>2d 879, 880, Judge Terry held that the word \u201cforthwith\u201d means with \u201creasonable dispatch consistent with the circumstances presented.\u201d He concluded that the sending of the registered letter required by Sec. 4590 some three months after service upon the Secretary of State was not a forthwith mailing. Defendant argues that in this case, plaintiff did not complete registered notice as required by Sec. 4590 until four months after service upon the Secretary of State and, accordingly, this case comes squarely within the holding of the <em>McLean </em>case just referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Whether or not the three months\u2019 period during which plaintiff\u2019s attorney may have been using every effort promptly to obtain a new address for defendant should be counted, I do not decide. Compare <em>Paxson v. Crowson, </em>8 <em>Terry </em>114, 87 <em>A. </em>2d 881. The fact remains that defendant\u2019s new address was received by plaintiff\u2019s Delaware counsel on May 15, 1952. He did not send the required notice by registered mail to defendant until June 10. In my judgment, an unexplained delay of 25 days is not a forthwith mailing as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Let the return of service be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
