The complaint charges that the defendant negligently drove her automobile into an automobile owned by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and operated by the plaintiff\u2019s husband. The defendant filed a third-party complaint against the plaintiff\u2019s husband alleging his negligence and seeking contribution from him as a joint tortfeasor. The plaintiff\u2019s husband moves to dismiss the third-party complaint on the ground that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can he granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The recent case of <em>Lutz v. Boltz, Del. Super., </em>100 <em>A. </em>2d 647, 648, disposes of the question here presented. After discussing our <em>Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Act, </em>10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 6301 <em>et seq., </em>Judge Carey there stated:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201cIt is clear from the very language of the statute itself that it has no application unless there is a \u2018common liability\u2019 to the injured person. This liability may be joint or several, but there is no right to contribution unless the injured person has a possible remedy against two or more persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APq\">Since a wife may not sue her husband at law in this State, the plaintiff in this case has no possible remedy against her husband for damages arising from his negligence. See <em>Plotkin v. Plotkin, 2 W. W. Harr. </em>455, 125 <em>A. </em>455. Hence, to permit a third-party proceeding for contribution against the husband, as a joint tort-feasor, would be to render him liable indirectly upon a claim for which he may not be held liable directly. Common liability, not concurring negligences, is the <em>sine qua non </em>for the invocation of the Uniform Contribution Act. Since there is no possible liability or right of action as between the third-party defendant and the plaintiff, his wife, it is held that the third-party plaintiff could have no right of contribution from the third-party defendant. See <em>Yellow Cab Co. v. Dreslin, </em>86 <em>App. D. C. </em>327, 181 <em>F. </em>2d 626, 19 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 1003 <em>et seq.; Guerriero v. U-Drive-It Co. of New Jersey, </em>22 <em>N. J. Super. </em>588, 92 <em>A. </em>2d 140; <em>American Auto Ins. Co. v. Molling, Minn., </em>57 <em>N. W. </em>2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The third-party plaintiff attempts to distinguish the <em>Lutz </em>case on the ground that a husband-wife relationship was not involved in that case. The principles announced in the Lutz case are controlling here notwithstanding the difference in the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The third-party plaintiff also urges the adoption of the rationale of <em>Fisher v. Diehl, </em>156 <em>Pa. Super. </em>476, 40 <em>A. </em>2d 912. That case is not apposite because it was not decided under the Uniform Contribution Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The motion to dismiss the third-party complaint will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
