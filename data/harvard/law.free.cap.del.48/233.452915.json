Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, </em>4 <em>Cir., </em>160 <em>F. </em>2d 496; <em>Kerstetter v. Elfman, </em>327 <em>Pa. </em>17, 192 <em>A. </em>663.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">Defendants\u2019 motion is based upon two grounds. The first is that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>will not be applied in Maryland unless the agency causing the injury was under defendants\u2019 exclusive management and control, and that since this was an accident involving a third vehicle, obviously not under defendants\u2019 control, the count is defective and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>dismissed. It is the law of Maryland that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is not applicable in cases where the injury might have been caused either by defendant\u2019s negligence or by the sole negligence of some third party, for which defendant was in no wise responsible. <em>Klan v. Security Motors, </em>164 <em>Md. </em>198, 164 <em>A. </em>235, 236. But defendant, at this point, is in no position to urge this proposition. The complaint before me merely recites that plaintiff was thrown from her seat by a sudden stop. Nowhere in the complaint, or in the subsequent amendments thereto, does it appear that some third party was even involved, let alone the sole contributing cause of the injury sustained. Now, at the trial of this case, it may be that, as in the <em>Klan </em>case, plaintiff herself will be forced to show circumstances indicating that the sudden stop which caused her injury was the result of the negligent operation of some other vehicle. In such event, defendant could move for judgment on the count under discussion at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case. Otherwise, defendant might be forced to offer exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">However that may be, while defendant is correct in its appraisal of the Maryland law on this subject, it is obviously premature in making this argument. In this respect, the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"> The second ground for dismissal of Count II is that the Maryland Courts will not apply <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>to those situations wherein passengers are injured by reason of the normal stops, starts, or jerks incident to the operation of trains, street cars, and buses. <em>Brocato v. United Rys. and Electric Co. of Baltimore, </em>129 <em>Md. </em>572, 99 <em>A. </em>792. But where the injury is occasioned by an unusual or extraordinary stop, jerk, or start, the doctrine is available to a plaintiff. <em>Grinath v. Baltimore &amp; Belair Electric Ry. Co., </em>145 <em>Md. </em>290, 125 <em>A. </em>604. The complaint here charges that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of a sudden stop. In the <em>Brocato </em>case, just cited, it was said [129 <em>Md. </em>572, 99 <em>A. </em>793]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cIt is not shown from the facts stated that the motion of the car spoken of as a \u2018jerk\u2019 was an unusual or extraordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>motion, showing any negligent operation of the car. It is true one of the witnesses said the car \u2018jerked hard,\u2019 but this expression alone, considered in connection with the facts of the case, cannot be regarded as having sufficient probative force to go to the jury as tending to show that the \u2018jerk\u2019 was unusual or extraordinary. The court, we think, acted properly in taking the case from the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">There is nothing extraordinary in an automobile making a sudden stop. There is substantial doubt in my mind whether the plaintiff here has shown that the movement of defendants\u2019 bus was sufficiently unusual or extraordinary as to bring her case within the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>as applied in Maryland. Accordingly, I will grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
