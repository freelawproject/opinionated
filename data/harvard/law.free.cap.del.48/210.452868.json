The reasons advanced at that time were (1) that the Speed Meter has never been recognized as being a reliable instrument to record speed of vehicles upon the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>way; (2) that the Speed Meter, even if admitted in evidence, standing alone should not be held to constitute conclusive evidence of the speed of the defendant\u2019s vehicle at the time of the test in order to warrant a conviction in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">I overruled the defendant\u2019s objection based upon his first reason, and reserved my decision in relation to his second reason, subject to the production of testimony by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The State produced an expert who testified in detail regarding the construction, the operation and the purpose of the Speed Meter, its margin of error if properly functioning, and the ways and means of testing its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Based upon the testimohy of the expert, I concluded that the evidence as to the accuracy of the Speed Meter was admissible, and, since the Speed Meter that the expert used in defining the construction, operation and purpose of such Meter was the same Speed Meter used to determine the speed of the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle on January 6th, I admitted the Speed Meter in evidence, subject, of course, to your determination as to its accuracy in measuring the speed of the defendant\u2019s vehicle under all the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The mere fact that the test in the present case was made by a person not skilled in electronics is not of sufficient import to render the Speed Meter inadmissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">I conclude, therefore, that an Electronic Speed Meter of the make and kind used in the present case, if found to be properly functioning and heing operated in a proper fashion, is a device that the jury may find to be a correct recorder of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In other words, this device as indicated, the Radar Speed Meter, is subject, as always, to your determination of the accuracy thereof in measuring the speed of a moving vehicle. It falls in the category of recognized instruments used to determine the speed of a moving vehicle, such as a speedometer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">In the present case, however, before you can return a verdict of guilty under this contention \u2014 that is, a finding by reason only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of the Speed Meter \u2014 you must he satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Speed Meter used in the present case was functioning properly, was properly operated at the time, and was in fact an accurate recorder of speed; further, that its accuracy had been properly tested within a reasonable time from the date of its use, January 6th, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">If these essentials are found by you to exist, you may determine that the Speed Meter recorded the accurate speed of the defendant\u2019s vehicle at the time of the test on January 6th, 1953, and such finding standing alone, if made by you, would furnish sufficient evidence for the conviction of the defendant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Whether or not you agree with the policy of hidden radar equipment to detect the speed of vehicles upon the highways of this State is not before you. In the absence of legislation to the contrary the State Highway Department in conjunction with the State Police have the power to determine the manner of patrolling the highways of this State in order to keep operators of vehicles within the bounds of statutory limits concerning speed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
