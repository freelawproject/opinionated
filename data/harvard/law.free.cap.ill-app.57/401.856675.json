Barrett and others against the Mount Greenwood Cemetery Association, the town of Worth and others, to prevent, by injunction, the building and completion by the cemetery association of a sewer in Morgan avenue, running from two cemeteries, owned by two of the defendants, to a spring creelc that crosses Morgan avenue in the town of Worth,-, and runs through the lands of the complainants.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\" pgmap=\"398\">The town of Worth answered the bill, claiming that the cemetery association had no right to build the sewer, and that the alleged \u201c contract \u201d under which the same was proposed to be built and used by the cemetery association is null and void; and also filed its cross-bill seeking to have said \u201c contract \u201d declared to be null and void. The cross-bill was dismissed in the court below for want of equity, and the town of Worth assigns errors upon the record, having duly taken an appeal from the decree in question.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\" pgmap=\"398\">The contract under which the cemeteries claim the right to build the sewer and have the same maintained for their exclusive benefit, is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\" pgmap=\"398(101) 399(244)\">\u201c In consideration of the covenants and agreements hereinafter agreed to be done and performed by the Mount Greenwood Association, a corporation, organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, and the Catholic Bishop of Chicago, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, Edward Wilson, William Henke and John Aim, commissioners of highways of and for the town of Worth, county of Cook and State of Illinois, do hereby give and grant unto the said association and said Catholic Bishop of Chicago, full right and power to excavate, in the north part of Morgan avenue, or 111th street, commencing at a point about two hundred (200) feet west of the east line of the Mount Greenword Cemetery and extending west along the said Morgan avenue, or 111th street, to a point about four thousand one hundred and seventy (4,170) feet west of said point of commencement, and to construct a sewer in said excavation, the first eleven hundred feet (1100 ft.) of said sewer west from the point of commencement to be constructed of brick, and to have an internal diameter of two (2) feet; the balance of said sewer to be constructed of plank, using three (3) inch plank for the top and two (2) inch plank for the sides and bottom; all planks to be securely braced at intervals of four (4) feet, with four (4) inch by four (4) inch braces; said balance of sewer to have an internal area of two (2) feet by two and one-half (2J) feet in the clear.

It can prevent a threatened one, or remove an existing one. It may grant remedial, as well as preventive relief. The People v. St. Louis, 5 Gilm. 351.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-7\" pgmap=\"401\">The general ground of the interference of a court of chancery is understood to be that kind of material injury to property or health, requiring the application to prevent as well as remedy an evil, for which damages, more or less, would be given in an action at law. Lancy v. Jasper, 39 Ill. 52.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-8\" pgmap=\"401\">A court of equity will not, in general, interfere until an actual nuisance is committed; but it may, by virtue of its jurisdiction to restrain acts which, when committed, will result in a ground of action, interfere before any actual nuisance has been committed, where it is satisfied that the act complained of will eventually result in a nuisance. Wahle v. Reinbach, 76 Ill. 322.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-9\" pgmap=\"401\">To constitute \u00e1 nuisance it is not necessary that the noxious trade or business should endanger the health of a neighborhood. It is sufficient if it produces that which is offensive to the senses, and which renders the enjoyment of life and property uncomfortable. Catlin v. Valentine, 9 Paige (Ch. N.
