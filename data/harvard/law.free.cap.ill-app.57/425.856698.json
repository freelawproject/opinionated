Winter was engaged in the same business at Woodbine, Iowa, buying grain at that place and shipping it to Chicago and other eastern points, while appellee was doing a banking business at Woodbine.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\" pgmap=\"422\">- In November, lSSll^Winter deposited in appellee\u2019s bank for collection, certain drafts, among them being a draft on appellants for $600. The draft on appellants was duly forwarded by appellee to its Chicago correspondent. When paid, notice to that effect was sent to appellee by the Chicago bank, and the proceeds were credited to Mrs. Minnie M. Winter, wife of the drawer, in accordance with his instructions given at the time the draft was deposited.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\" pgmap=\"422\">The draft, it appears, was honored by appellants on tie faith of certain forged bills of lading purporting to have been issued for certain cars of grain, against which the draft in question was drawn.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\" pgmap=\"422\">These bills of lading, however, did not accompany the draft. They were sent directly to the drawees by Winter himself, and not through the bank, which had no knowledge of their existence until after it had parted with the money.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\" pgmap=\"422\">Several drafts were deposited with appellee between October 31st and the 9th of November, that drawn on appellants having been brought in on the slip. Winter absconded on the 10th and has not returned. On the morning of the 16th letters addressed to him from appellants and others, saying that certain grain which he professed to have shipped had not been received, and requesting that tracers be sent out, were opened and read by Mrs. Winter. Between the hours of eight and nine o\u2019clock that morning, she called upon one II. M. Bostwick, cashier of the First National Bank of Woodbine, Iowa, and asked him what business matters Mr. Winter had left with him before he went away, exhibiting to him the letters in question.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-3\" pgmap=\"423\">Some time between nine and ten o\u2019clock, Mr. Bostwick went with her and Mr. Kibler, president of the defendant bank, to the depot to examine into the matter. Mr. Kibler was her relative. The station agent, after looking through the letters, requested Mrs. Winter to leave them, promising to report to her later in the day in regard to the grain shipments.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\" pgmap=\"423\">As she turned to go out, he called Messrs. Kibler and Bostwick back. When she got out of the door, he told them that none of the grain inquired about had ever been shipped from Woodbine by Mr. Winter, and that the whole thing was a fraud. Having a little delicacy about telling her that her husband ivas a defaulter, he requested Mr. Kibler, inasmuch as he was a relative of hers, to tell her the truth.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\" pgmap=\"423\">On the same morning, after leaving the depot, Mr. Bostwick had a conversation with Mr. Kibler, in which the latter said he had acquainted Mrs. Wint\u00e9r with all that they had learned from the station agent at the depot.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\" pgmap=\"423\">Immediately after noon upon the same day, Mrs. Winter went to the bank with her father, Stephen King, and presented a check for the full amount of her balance, $1,719.71, which was paid.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\" pgmap=\"423\">The cashier who paid her check swears that he had then no suspicion of the fraud. He also testified: \u201c My duties of cashier are the .management of the bank. Ho one else collects drafts. Ho one else disburses the money of the bank. Mr. Kibler usually comes in the bank once a day, perhaps once in two days. He deposits for the account of Kibler Bros. He gets no salary as a bank official. He has nothing to do with its actual managment.\u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-8\" pgmap=\"423\">Appellants\u2019 Brief, Heed, Brown &amp; Allen, Attorneys.</attorneys><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\" pgmap=\"423\">Whenever information is given to a president for the purpose of transmission through him to his bank, the law will regard the information as having been transmitted, Avhether the president has done so or not.

Presiding Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A_S2\" pgmap=\"425\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b425-4\" pgmap=\"425\">In this case it appears that Sidney L. Winter, having by lying, forging and swindling, obtained from various parties large sums of money, absconded. About \u00a71,800 of the funds thus obtained he deposited to the credit of his wife with the Woodbine Savings Bank; \u00a7600 of this money, Winter had by the means above described obtained from appellants.</p> <p id=\"b425-5\" pgmap=\"425\">On the morning of the 16th of November, the president of the bank, a relative of Mrs. Winter, was, in connection with the cashier of another bank, informed of what Mr. Winter had done, and being requested so to do, told Mrs. Winter. Notice to a director of a corporation, while engaged in its business, such notice being concerning the business he is engaged upon, is notice to the corporation. Angel\u00ed and Ames on Corporations, Sec. 306; Bank of United States v. Davis, 2 Hill 451-461.</p> <p id=\"b425-6\" pgmap=\"425\">Bolles upon Bank Officers, Sec. 351, says:</p> <blockquote id=\"b425-7\" pgmap=\"425\">\u201c Whenever information is given to a president for the purpose of transmission through him to his bank, the law will regard the information as having been transmitted, whether the president has done so or not.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b425-8\" pgmap=\"425\">There was evidence tending to show that the knowledge of the fraud given to Kibler Avas communicated to him for the purpose of thus giving information to the bank. And there was also evidence tending to show that Kibler received this information as the president of the bank, and in an inquiry made by him and the cashier of another bank, as to the character of the transactions through which Winter had obtained funds to deposit in the banks of Woodbine; Mr. Kibler did not testify, and there is no explanation of hoAV he, in connection with an officer of another bank, came to seek out and obtain this information, unless he did so because of his being the chief officer of appellee.</p> <p id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425(44) 426(16)\">KnoAvledge communicated to the president of a bank in his official capacity may be imputed to the bank. Ottaquechee Savings Bank v. Holt, 58 Vt. 166; Village of Port Jervis v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, 96 N. Y. 550; Holden v. N. Y. &amp; Erie Bank, 72 N. Y. 286-294; Bank of the United States v. Davis, 2 Hill 451-461.</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">The jury should not have been instructed to find for the defendant. It should have been left to them to say, whether, at the time the bank paid to Mrs. Winter\u2019s father the check made by her, it had notice that the funds thus by it paid had been obtained by Mr. Winter in such a manner that he had no right to them or to deposit them to the credit of his wife. The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
