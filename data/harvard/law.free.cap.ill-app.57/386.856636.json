Injunctions\u2014Drainage and Sewerage.\u2014A bill for an injunction, the object of which is to prevent a municipality from carrying out a system of drainage or sewerage, upon the ground that it will create a nuisance on the lands of the person filing the bill, is one which should not be entertained by a court of chancery.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-5\" pgmap=\"382\">2.

Wood on Nuisances, Sec. 428; Duke of Buccleugh v. Cowan, 5 Macp. (S. C.) 214; Holsman v. Boiling Springs Co., 14 N. J. E. 335; Board of Health v. Lederer (N. J. Ch.), 29 Atl.

If a local board makes an outfall beyond their district, and thereby pours noxious matter into a stream, they can not excuse themselves on the ground that no damage is. caused thereby. Where acts of Parliament empowered a water-works company to take water from a stream, and gave them certain rights against mill owners on the stream with respect to the quantity of water to be taken, but saved all other rights, the company was held to have no power to foul the water so as to interfere with the rights of mill owners, and an injunction was granted to restrain the pollution.

Lightowler, 3 Eq. 279; Vail v. Mix, 74 Ill. 127; McKenzie v. Elliot, 134 Ill. 160; Totel v. Bonnifoy, 123 Ill. 653; Merrifield v.

J ustioe Gaet</author> <p id=\"AWE\" pgmap=\"384\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b384-7\" pgmap=\"384\">This is a bill filed by the appellants, the object of which is to prevent the village from carrying out a system of drainage or sewerage which, it is alleged, will create a nuisance upon the lands of Robb, occupied by the other appellant as tenant of Robb.</p> <p id=\"b384-8\" pgmap=\"384\">The -application to courts of chancery to take under their charge the matters of police of the city and the adjacent country, all increasing in population with unexampled rapidity, and in so doing to solve all the engineering problems pressing upon that population, are frequent; but doubtful of their own superior wisdom in relation to subjects which they have not made a special study, and in regard to which they have not had much experience, such courts are, and should be, slow to assume the responsibility.</p> <p id=\"b384-9\" pgmap=\"384\">In addition to all that this record of six hundred and odd pages contains, the judge hearing the case, at the request of the parties, viewed \u201c the landscape o\u2019er.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b384-10\" pgmap=\"384\">The bill was dismissed \u201c for want of equity, with prejudice for and during the period of five years next hereafter, and without prejudice thereafter, and without prejudice at any time to the right of the complainant to bring an action at law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b384-11\" pgmap=\"384(9) 385(49)\">That is a singular but inoffensive decree. Had nothing been said about prejudice, the dismissal would have been a perpetual bar to another bill upon facts substantially the same as those existing when this bill was filed, and by what is said, that bar\u2014after five years\u2014and all doubt as to the right to sue at law, are removed.</p> <p id=\"b385-4\" pgmap=\"385\">Private property may not be taken or damaged for public use without compensation, but where a public use requires, it may be damaged, and the compensation made when the damage is ascertained. Stetson v. Chi. &amp; Ev. R. R., 75 Ill. 74</p> <p id=\"b385-5\" pgmap=\"385\">It may be that after all is done that the village wishes to do, a jury will make the village pay for the farm; in which case Robb will have compensation and the farm too.</p> <p id=\"b385-6\" pgmap=\"385\">This is not a case in which a court of chancery ought to interfere by injunction, and the decree is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
