And where a village ordinance prohibits the erection of wooden buildings within certain specified limits, imposing a penalty for violation of the ordinance, and also provides that the president and trustees of the village shall cause any person violating the ordinance to be enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, an injunction will not be granted to prevent the erection of wooden buildings in violation of the ordinance. High on Injunction, Sec. 748.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-4\" pgmap=\"551\">A court in chancery has no jurisdiction to restrain the threatened violation of a village ordinance, unless the act threatened to be done, if carried out, would be a nuisance. If it were otherwise, the court might be called upon in all classes of cases to restrain the doing of acts prohibited by statute. Village of St. Johns v. McFarlan, 33 Mich. 72; Mayor, etc., v.

Frink v. Heal, 37 Ill. App. 621.</p> <p id=\"b552-5\" pgmap=\"552\">The bill charges and the decree finds that such assent, though once obtained, was so obtained by misrepresentation, and was, in part, revoked. It is not necessary to go into particulars as to such assent, the brief of the appellants not relying upon it. The bill charges and the decree finds that the building, if so removed, would expose Foster\u2019s house to more danger from fire, and make the property of both the appellees less marketable and salable.</p> <p id=\"b552-6\" pgmap=\"552\">There is much more in the bill and in the decree, but these are the matters special to the appellees. The court awarded a perpetual injunction against the removal.</p> <p id=\"b552-7\" pgmap=\"552\">First National Bank v. Sarlls, 129 Ind. 201, and Kaufman v. Stein, 37 N. E. Rep. 333, are authorities for such an injunction, not simply because an ordinance is violated, but because, endangering the house of Foster and impairing the value of the property of both the appellees by an act which is unlawful by ordinance, the fact that it is unlawful changes into a nuisance, what, otherwise, would not be a nuisance, and this is in accord with the rationale of the decision in King v. Davenport, 98 Ill. 305. The decree is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b552-8\" pgmap=\"552\">Waterman, J\\, dissents.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
