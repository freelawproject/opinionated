The defendant in error paid the notes until some time in September, 1891; about the 7th of October she returned from a hospital. In the meantime several of the notes became due. The collector for Titcomb &amp; Pratt, on said 7th day of October, called on Mrs. James to collect the money. Mrs. James called his attention to the alleged inferior quality of certain curtains and a folding bed, delivered to her by Titcomb &amp; Pratt, and included in the bill of goods purchased from them, and insisted that the inferior goods be taken away and replaced with goods of the quality which she had purchased. The collector replied that he thought that Titcomb &amp; Pratt would do as she requested, and promised to report the fact to the house; immediately upon receiving this report Mr. Titcomb sent Mr. Brewerton and another man, both employes and servants of Titcomb &amp; Pratt, to the home of Mrs. James, with the mortgages, with instructions to go to Mrs. James and get the furniture.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-8\" pgmap=\"293\">On calling at the house, Mr. Brewerton told Mrs. James that he was sent over after those goods and that he wished her to pay the notes which were past due.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-9\" pgmap=\"293(35) 294(470) 295(441) 296(125)\">The testimony of the defendant in error, Mrs. James, as to what the account is, is as follows: She then said to them, \u201c You can not take all of the furniture; I am paying on the furniture and only want you to make good what is not good.\u201d To which she testifies they replied that they had come for all the furniture and were going to take it. She replied, \u201c If Mr. Pratt was here he would not allow it.\u201d \u2022 Mr. Brewerton said, \u201c Why don\u2019t you get Mr. Pratt over here ? \u201d and said he would telephone for Mr. Pratt; and he went to the telephone and came back and told me that Pratt was coming; and then Pratt came and stepped to the parlor door and says to me, \u201c What do you mean by saying that we can not take this furniture from you ? \u201d I said, \u201c Mr. Pratt, I did not say that you could not take the furniture from me, because you have the power to do so if you wish to, but I am ready here to pay for the furniture. I will get the money now.\u201d He said, \u201c I don\u2019t want your money,\u201d and swore atine. I said, \u201cWell, Mr. Pratt, all I can do is to tender the money,\u201d and I called two servants out of the basement to see me tender him the money. I said, \u201cHere is $12,0; take $72, that is due you, out of this.\u201d He said he would not do it; that I could go to the hot place with my money; he was \"going to take the furniture. I said, \u201c Mr. Pratt, it is not right; you have no right to take this furniture from me.\u201d He says, \u201c I will show you how we take furniture- when we come for it.\u201d I said, \u201c I can not help myself and I hope you will not take it until I send for my attorney.\u201d He told Mr. Brewerton to bring in the men, and Mr. Brewerton went to the door and there were three wagons with seven_ to ten men on them. The men came into the house and began to lift up the carpets. Mr. Pratt stepped out of the door and I went to shut him but. I thought if I could shut him out a minute, I could lock the men in until I had time to get a lawyer there. He pushed the door open and struck me on the side of the head with his fist, and I started down the hall and went into the back parlor and there was a bar of iron laying there, folded up, and I picked up the bar of iron and said, \u201c Don\u2019t you come near to strike me again.\u201d He pursued me and that is how I came to pick -up the bar of iron. Mr. Brewerton stepped up to me and struck me between the shoulders with his fist, and Mr. Pratt grabbed the piece of iron from me and I threw up my arms to protect myself. He struck me on the arm and I tried to pass him and he would not let me. I went through the parlor and he followed me and grabbed me by the dress and threw me against the wall and held me. My servant girl had gone for a policeman. The policeman came and asked Pratt what he was doing. He had hold of me at the time. The policeman said if he did not let go of me he would arrest him. Pratt asked him what authority he had to come in there, and he said he was an officer of the law and that he would show his authority. He asked Mr. Pratt what authority he had, and told him to show his authority. Pratt said, \u201c I will show you nothing of the kind;\u2019\u2019 and the officer said, \u201c If you have anything to show, and have any authority, let me see it.\u201d He said, \u201c Have you shown her a mortgage with her name signed to it?\u201d He said, \u201cHo;\u201d and he says, \u201cYou should get the mortgage; show me your authority or I will take you to the station;\u201d and he pulled out the mortgage then, and the policeman asked him if he had shown that to me before, and asked if that was my signature, and he said, no, he had not. The men at that time were locked in a room, and part of them were on the wagons. I had locked four of them in a room until I could get a lawyer, and after the policeman came in I went up and unlocked the door and turned the men out, and they came down and went out to the wagon. The officer said to Mr. Pratt: \u201c You have no right unless you have an officer serve this on her;\u201d and I said to the officer, \u201c I have offered him the money; I have tendered him the money and asked him to leave my furniture here.\u201d They were taking furniture that did not come from their house at all; furniture that was not covered by their mortgage; part of it had been moved out on the sidewalk at that time; when my attorney came he arranged and had it brought back inside; two pieces were brought back and some rugs; the purchase price of the furniture was about eight or nine hundred dollars. Some rugs and curtains and some crockery and a couple of four or five dollar wash stands, that did not amount to what I had paid, were left there when they went away. They took the other goods away. I was keeping roomers and boarders and doing dressmaking at that time. After I was injured I was not able to proceed with my business, and have never been able to use my hands very well since. I can not use the shears. I can use my hand, but can\u2019t use the shears. I can not lift anything heavy. At that time I was able to earn with what boarders I had and roomers, probably three or four hundred dollars a month, including the dressmaking. I suppose I was able to make three or four hundred dollars a month.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\" pgmap=\"296\">I purchased those goods from Titcomb &amp; Pratt on the installment plan.

If the jury believe from the evidence that the defendants in this case by their employes or servants under their direction, forcibly entered said premises without the permission of the plaintiff, and in a Avanton, insulting, willful and reckless manner seized and carried away said property, without the permission of the plaintiff, the jury are authorized to find exemplary or punitive damages; that is, such damages as will compensate the plaintiff for any Avrong to her, and to punish the defendants.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-10\" pgmap=\"297(110) 298(67)\">9. If you find from the evidence that the defendants assaulted, beat and bruised the plaintiff, you may alloAv the plaintiff such damages, not exceeding the amount claimed in the declaration, as seems to you to be right and proper under all the facts and circumstances in the evidence. In estimating the damages for assault and battery, you have a right to consider the bodily and mental pain, if any, endured by plaintiff, and her diminished capacity for labor resulting from defendant\u2019s wrongful act, if the evidence shows the. circumstances to exist. You may take into consideration the damages to her person by reason of said assault and the extent and duration of the same. You may also consider the injuries to her feelings by reason of any insult and indignity inflicted upon her person. It is not necessary to prove by witnesses the amount of damages resulting from personal injuries, but these are to be determined by you from your general knowledge and experience, and from all the evidence and circumstances of the case.</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\" pgmap=\"298\">12.

And if you further find that the defendants attempted to take possession of said goods under the circumstances above stated, and in doing so they committed a breach of the peace, then they would be wrongdoers under the law, and if the plaintiff sustained any damages by reason of the wrong doing at the time, you would be warranted in finding a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessing her damages at such sum as you think proper under all the circumstances, and if you find in addition to the above facts that the defendants acted with malice, or in a wanton manner, then you would be warranted in' adding to the plaintiff\u2019s actual damages such sum as you think proper by way of exemplary - damages.</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\" pgmap=\"299\">The jury returned a verdict of $10,000 against the defendants below, upon which there was judgment, and from which judgment they prosecute this writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-5\" pgmap=\"299\">Brief for Plaintiff in Error, W. 1ST.

If this were the case, still the defendant, Titcomb, would not be liable for vindictive damage, but only for the real damage done by the taking away of such goods as were not returned.</p> <p id=\"b303-6\" pgmap=\"303\">As a rule, partners ate in general bound by the contracts of each other when made in the scope of the firm business, but they are not generally answerable for the wrongs of each other. In general, acts or omissions in the course of the partnership trade or business, in violation of law, will implicate those only who are guilty of them, and a willful tort of one partner is not in and by force of the partnership alone, imputable to the firm.</p> <p id=\"b303-7\" pgmap=\"303\">If one partner maliciously prosecutes a person for stealing partnership property, the other members of the firm are not answerable unless they are in fact privy to the malicious prosecution.

Turnman, 6 Mann. &amp; Grang. 236.</p> <p id=\"b303-8\" pgmap=\"303(18) 304(25)\">Here, according to the testimony of Mrs. James, both Mr. Pratt and Mr. Brewerton made wanton and malicious assaults upon her, which it is not shown that Mr. Titcomb either directed, approved, or had any knowledge of until the bringing of this suit.</p> <p id=\"b304-5\" pgmap=\"304\">Mr. Pratt and Mr. Brewerton deny having made any such assault. Admitting, however, that in this respect they do not tell the truth, and that the plaintiff below is to be believed, it is manifest that what they did in this regard was not done in the interests of the firm of Mr. Titcomb or by direction of either, but for their own wanton and wicked purposes.</p> <p id=\"b304-6\" pgmap=\"304\">The plaintiff below also testified that she tendered to Mr. Pratt in money more than enough to satisfy all claim which the firm had upon the goods. After this Mr. Brewerton and Mr. Pratt assaulted her. Mr. Titcomb\u2019s only interest in the goods was through a lien which the firm had thereon to secure what was due to it. If, therefore, Mr. Pratt, when the amount due the firm was tendered to him, instead of taking it, as Mr. Titcomb\u2019s, as well as the firm\u2019s interest required, refused to do so, and, as Mrs. James testifies, after making a wanton and willful assault upon her, carried away a portion of the goods, Mr. Pratt in so doing was neither prosecuting the business of the firm nor acting in the interest of Mr. Titcomb, or doing anything that by virtue of the partnership he hM either authority or was an agent to do in the prosecution- of the firm business.</p> <p id=\"b304-7\" pgmap=\"304\">The instructions of the court authorizing the finding of punitory damages against the defendants below ought not to have been given.</p> <p id=\"b304-8\" pgmap=\"304\">The remarks of the court to the effect that the witnesses for the defendants below had testified that an assault was made upon Mrs. James were highly prejudicial to the defendants below. An examination of the record does not show that the witnesses for the defendants below did more than, in connection with the testimony of the plaintiff, to testify to that from which an inference might be drawn that they did not deny that an assault was made upon the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b304-9\" pgmap=\"304\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
