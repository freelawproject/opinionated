Justice Gaby</author> <p id=\"ABN\" pgmap=\"96\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b96-6\" pgmap=\"96\">On the 17th day of February, 1888, the appellant issued a policy of life insurance to Robert J. Ross in the sum of $5,000, for the benefit of his wife, the appellee, upon an application containing as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b96-7\" pgmap=\"96\">\u201c 5. Does the person desire the policy to be issued on the Tontine Dividend Policy plan, whereby surplus is only participated in at the expiration of the tontine period, according to the provisions made in the company\u2019s form of Tontine Policy now in use, and agree that no allowance shall be made on policies lapsing during the tontine term ? A. Ho.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b96-8\" pgmap=\"96\">\u201c 6. Does the person desire the policy to be issued on the Limited Tontine Dividend plan whereby surplus is only participated in at the expiration of the tontine period, according to the provisions made in the company\u2019s form of Limited Tontine Policy now in use, and agree that no allowance shall be made on policies \u2022 lapsing during the tontine term, except as may be provided for in the policy ? A. Tes. Extension.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b96-9\" pgmap=\"96\">Ross insured at the solicitation of one John F. Short\u2014 Ross being one of his friends.</p> <p id=\"b96-10\" pgmap=\"96\">Short was then in the office of Joseph H. Strong, manager of the agency of the appellant in the States of Illinois and Wisconsin, and soon thereafter Short became also a manager at St. Paul. The whole dispute in this case grows out of the non-payment of the premium due February 17, 1889. Ross died March 7, 1889.</p> <p id=\"b96-11\" pgmap=\"96\">Part of the evidence in the case is letters as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b96-12\" pgmap=\"96\">\u201c Chicago, Jan. 31, 1889.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b96-13\" pgmap=\"96\">J. F. Short, Esq., St. Paul, Minn.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b96-14\" pgmap=\"96\">Friend Short : My life insurance premium with Strong is due on the 17th of February; how much grace do I have on this, is it ten or thirty days ?

Short.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b97-15\" pgmap=\"97\">The slip thus sent was a small sheet so folded as to make four pages, entitled on the first page \u201c Days of Grace,\u201d and upon the bottom of the second page in pencil was written by Short, \u201c Your policy is a tontine. J. F. S.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b97-16\" pgmap=\"97\">The contents of the pages are as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b97-17\" pgmap=\"97\">\u201c Days of Grace.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b97-18\" pgmap=\"97\">It has always been a chronic complaint against life insurance that the contract required that the premiums must be paid on the day named therein, or the policy would lapse and be voided. In the contracts issued by most life insurance companies this is still a compulsory condition. Its effect has often proved to be a great hardship to policy holders who, through thoughtlessness or carelessness, have neglected to pay as designated in the bond.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b97-19\" pgmap=\"97\">-In liberal contrast, the United States Life Insurance Company has sought to obviate largely the effects of this condition, by allowing a month\u2019s grace in the payment of premiums on tontine policies, and a grace of ten days in the payment of premiums on all other policies.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b97-20\" pgmap=\"97\">During the period of grace the policy is kept in full force, premiums are accepted without regard to the health of the insured, and should death take place, the full amount of the insurance will be paid, less the overdue premium.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b98-3\" pgmap=\"98\">\"What could be fairer or more generous than a concession like this, whereby a life insuranc\u00e9 company seeks to protect the interests of a man\u2019s family against his own forgetfulness, or even his inability to fulfill his contract and pay the premium on the designated day ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b98-4\" pgmap=\"98\">Hext only in importance to the absolute indisputability of every policy issued by the United States Life, after it has been in force three years, is the promise of ten days\u2019 grace in the payment of premiums, and, taken together, they go further than any other concessions in the business of life insurance to give certainty to the calculations and investments of the man who wants to secure a sure protection for his loved ones.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b98-5\" pgmap=\"98\">How often has it happened that sudden illness or business cares have caused a neglect of a couple of days in the payment of a premium, whereby a policy has lapsed and the insurance has been forfeited ? \u2018 Ten days\u2019 grace \u2019 given by this company may mean, and often does mean, a sure provision for families who otherwise and under the usual life insurance contract, might be left without a dollar in the world.\u201d-</blockquote> <p id=\"b98-6\" pgmap=\"98\">The policy itself, both outside and inside, is entitled \u201c Limited-Tontine Dividend Plan.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b98-7\" pgmap=\"98\">The defendant\u2019s answer to the plaintiff\u2019s case was:</p> <p id=\"b98-8\" pgmap=\"98\">First. Eeceipts for the first premium, due February 17, 1888, and for the second premium, due August 17,1888, were obtained by defendant\u2019s counsel from the counsel for plaintiff, and were introduced in evidence, and were read, as follows, alike except as to dates:</p> <blockquote id=\"b98-9\" pgmap=\"98\">\u201c The United States Life Insurance Company,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b98-10\" pgmap=\"98\">In the City of Hew York, 261, 262, 263 Broadway.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Akz\" pgmap=\"98\">$54.45-100.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b98-11\" pgmap=\"98\">Eeceived 54 and 45-100 dollars, being the semi-annual premium due the 17th day of February, 1888, on policy on the life of Eobert J\". Eoss, Policy Ho. 56,797, subject to all the provisions, conditions and agreements contained in the above mentioned policy and the application therefor, and those indorsed hereon, all of which are hereby referred to and made part hereof.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"At\" pgmap=\"98\">C. P. Fbaleigh, Secretary.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b99-3\" pgmap=\"99\">This receipt is not binding unless countersigned by the company\u2019s cashier, or by Jos. H. Strong, Agent.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b99-4\" pgmap=\"99\">(Printed across the end:)</p> <blockquote id=\"b99-5\" pgmap=\"99\">\u201c Read the notice to policy holders on the back of this receipt.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b99-6\" pgmap=\"99\">(Printed and written across the center:)</p> <blockquote id=\"b99-7\" pgmap=\"99\">\u201c Countersigned by J.

Ross, will be due on 17 th August, 1888,if said policy be in force on that day, and that if not paid, the policy and all payments thereon will become forfeited and void. Such premium may be paid on or before that day, or within ten days thereafter (ten days grace being hereby allowed), at this office by check, draft or post office order, to the order of the company, or, if more convenient for the insured, it may be so paid in cash to an authorized agent, only upon the company\u2019s receipt, to be given by him in exchange therefor, signed by the president, secretary, assistant secretary or actuary.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b100-20\" pgmap=\"100\">C.

All premiums by the terms of this policy, are clue and payable in cash at the company\u2019s office in \u00a1New York; but for the convenience of the insured, they may be made to an agent, upon the production of a receipt signed by the president, secretary, assistant secretary or actuary, and the agent must countersign the same as evidence of payment to him. \u00a1Notice of the payment of premiums will, when the policy holder\u2019s address is known, be sent previous to the time when they fall due, by mail, to meet the existing requirements of the statute affecting premium notices, but for no other purpose; but neither the company nor the agent hold themselves responsible for their delivery or miscarriage.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b101-4\" pgmap=\"101\">Every policy holder should notify the company at its home office, of any change of his post-office address:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b101-5\" pgmap=\"101\">The sending of this notice is upon the understanding that there has not been any default in the payment of any premium, or any violation of any of the provisions or conditions of the policy.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b101-6\" pgmap=\"101\">G-eo.

Standee, Actuary.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b101-10\" pgmap=\"101\">Then there is testimony as to conversations between Strong and Boss as to how Boss might obtain time in which to pay, but it is all very inconclusive, and we think it unnecessary to take time and space to comment upon it.</p> <p id=\"b101-11\" pgmap=\"101\">Upon the evidence, with correct instructions as to the law, the appellant can never, and never ought to, escape a verdict.</p> <p id=\"b101-12\" pgmap=\"101\">We attach no importance to what Short wrote, either in a letter to Boss, or on the slip he sent.</p> <p id=\"b101-13\" pgmap=\"101\">The slip itself was issued .by the company.</p> <p id=\"b101-14\" pgmap=\"101\">If it was inconsistent with other representations in notices issued by the company, the assured was entitled to act upon the construction most favorable to himself.

That a \u201cLimited-Tontine\u201d is not a \u201cTontine,\u201d is a refinement that would never be accepted to discharge an insurance company.</p> <p id=\"b102-5\" pgmap=\"102\">Even law writers treat of limited partnerships under the head of partnership. Unless the slip referred to such policies as that in suit as tontine, it was in that respect meaningless; for the other kind of tontine were no longer issued. They had been stopped more than a year before.</p> <p id=\"b102-6\" pgmap=\"102\">It is useless to go over the able and voluminous argument for the appellant, for the merits of the case' make errors, if any were committed, of no importance.</p> <p id=\"b102-7\" pgmap=\"102\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
