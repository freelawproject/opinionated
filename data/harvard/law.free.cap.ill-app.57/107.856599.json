The proceeds of one shipment went into the bank two days before, but the residue went in on that last day. Without reference to the claim which the appellant makes to apply the- money to indebtedness held by the bank, we are obliged to hold that no trust in favor of the appellees attached to the balance in the bank standing, or which ought to stand\u2014conceding the ought without expressing any opinion upon it\u2014to the credit of Hanna, Son &amp; Co. That an action for money had and received would not lie in favor of either of the appellees against the bank seems to be proved by the case of Carpen v. Hall, 27 Ill. 386, reaffirmed in 29 Ill. 512, with the names reversed.</p> <p id=\"b105-9\" pgmap=\"105\">And that money mixed with other money loses its identity and can not be followed as a trust fund, is a doctrine often repeated by the Supreme Court.</p> <p id=\"b105-10\" pgmap=\"105(11) 106(45)\">Most of the prior cases are referred to in Mutual Accident Ass\u2019n v. Jacobs, 141 Ill. 261. We tried to get away from it in O\u2019Brien v. Wetherell, 41 Ill. App. 142, but the Supreme Court held us to it on appeal. Wetherell v. O\u2019Brien, 140 Ill. 146. The decree is reversed and the bill dismissed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
