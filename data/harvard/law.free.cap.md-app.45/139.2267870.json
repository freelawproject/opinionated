This is so because the General Assembly has specifically provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\"All statements and descriptions in any application for a life or health insurance policy or annuity contract, or for the reinstatement or renewal thereof, by or in behalf of the insured or annuitant, shall be deemed to be representations and not warranties. Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts, and incorrect statements shall not prevent a recovery under such policy or contract unless either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">(1) Fraudulent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(2) Material either to the acceptance of the risk, or to the hazard assumed by the insurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(3) The insurer in good faith would either not have issued, reinstated, or renewed the policy or contract, or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount, or at the same premium or rate, or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss, if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise.\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 374.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Ordinarily, what constitutes a material misrepresentation is a question for the trier of fact to resolve. <em>Peoples Life Insurance Co. v.

Only \u201cwhen the evidence is clear and convincing, or uncontradicted,\u201d may the trial judge rule as a matter of law that the misrepresentation is false and material. <em>Peoples Life Insurance Co. v.

Greenfeld was correct in allowing a jury, in the Superior Court of Baltimore City, to determine the materiality of a misrepresentation in a renewal application for a policy issued by The National Life and Accident Insurance Company (National). Judge Greenfeld ruled that there was a misrepresentation in the application for renewal, but he declined to hold, as a matter of law, that it was material. The jury, after being instructed as to the misrepresentation, concluded that it was not material and rendered a verdict in favor of Ethel M. Gordon, the beneficiary under National\u2019s policy on the life of Izza Gordon, her deceased husband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The record reveals that Mr. Gordon applied to National for a life policy on October 24,1974.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The policy lapsed in March 1975 for non-payment of the premium. The October 1974 application contains the information that Mr. Gordon was treated at Provident Hospital as an outpatient for three weeks in September 1974 for head injuries sustained in an auto accident. The data supplied by Mr. Gordon was \u201cComplete Recovery No Complications.\u201d The \u201cApplication for Reinstatement\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201c6 During the past five years, have you Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">(a) consulted or been treated by a doctor or other practitioner or at a dispensary or , clinic. ~ \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">(b) had any disabling illness or surgical , operation \u2014 -Y-\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The application required that \u201cfull details\u201d be furnished if \u201cany part of... No. 6 [is] answered Yes.\u201d Written in the space provided is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\u201cSinai</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">Provident Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">Head Injury Auto Accident. Sept., 74</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Dr. Lawrence Solomon\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">It is that writing that is the omphalos of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">When Mr. Gordon died in July 1976 as the result of a gunshot wound, National discovered that the application for renewal did not disclose that Mr. Gordon was in Sinai Hospital from February 9, 1975 through February 16, 1975, nor that the medical diagnosis made at that time was \u201cMallory-Weiss Syndrome,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> secondary to alcoholism.\u201d National refused to pay over the proceeds of the policy to Mrs. Gordon but, instead, tendered to her a return of the premiums paid. She rejected the tender and suit was filed on her behalf against National.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">At trial Mrs. Gordon disputed the diagnosis contained in the Sinai Hospital records. She asserted that her husband had never been an alcoholic,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that his period of confinement in Sinai Hospital was because of <em>\u201ca </em>torn esophagus.\u201d National\u2019s underwriter, on the other hand, averred that had National known of the diagnosis, it would have refused to reinstate the policy. Following the close of the evidence, Judge Greenfeld, as we have seen, found, as a matter of law, that the renewal application contained a misrepresentation. He felt, however, that there was sufficient evidence to make the issue of materiality a question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">National, in this Court, raises two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">1. The trial court erred in not ruling that the failure by the applicant to disclose a hospitalization of eight days for \u201cMallory-Weiss Syndrome, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>secondary to alcoholism, was material misrepresentation, as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">2. The evidence adduced by National of the misrepresentation\u2019s being a material fact was uncontradicted and uncontroverted, and, therefore, the court should not have submitted the materiality <em>vel non </em>to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">National asserts that the non-disclosure of the period of hospitalization at Sinai was a material fact as a matter of law. To bolster its position National points to <em>Hofmann v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>400 F. Supp. 827 (D. Md. 1975). There Judge Watkins had before him a question of material misrepresentation in a policy application. In granting a summary judgment in favor of the insurer, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cMaryland case law affords strong precedent that misrepresentation about alcoholism is, by its very nature, material to the risk. The excessive use of alcohol, a fact that the insurance company did not know, but would have known had Mr. Hofmann revealed his visits to Drs. Johnson and Nakazawa, has been held to be material to the risk as a matter of law in <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Mullan, </em>107 Md. 457, 468, 69 A. 385, 390 (1908) and <em>Forwood v. Prudential, </em>117 Md. 254, 258, 83 A. 169, 170-71 (1912).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Seeking to bring itself within the ambit of <em>Hofmann, </em>National avers that \u201cthe failure to disclose a hospitalization for an eight-day period, where the discharge diagnosis was \u2018Mallory-Weiss Syndrome, secondary to alcoholism,\u2019 establishes a material misrepresentation as a matter of law because of the very nature of such a misrepresentation.\u201d National also asserts that evidence depicted Mr. Gordon to be an alcohol abuser, \u201ca binge type drinker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">What National overlooks is that <em>Hofmann </em>and the cases cited therein, deal with uncontroverted evidence of alcoholism. The evidence produced by Mrs. Gordon in the case <em>sub judice </em>was that Sinai\u2019s hospital report was wrong. Mrs. Gordon told the jury that her husband did not abuse alcohol and, in fact, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>drank a \u201clittle wine.\u201d That, she said, was the extent of his drinking. Mrs. Gordon told the jury that her husband was in Sinai because of a torn esophagus. Her testimony, we think, generated a jury issue. If it believed her instead of the hospital report it could conclude that the misrepresentation was not material, and that had National had the true facts before it, the policy would have been issued. Patently, the jury was not required to believe the hospital record. Those records are not sacrosanct. They have been made by man, and like man, are subject to all of his uncertainties. Although they are admissible in evidence, as are other records made in the normal course of business, they are not unassailable. Mrs. Gordon, in the instant case, successfully challenged the report. The submission to the jury of the question of materiality of the misrepresentation was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\">.
