Barbano, the appellee in this case, was a probationary teacher in Aniie Arundel County. By virtue of a State Board of Education bylaw (13.06.02), two years are to be served in such capacity before a teacher may be cloaked with tenure. Within constitutional limits, and upon proper notice by the employing county board of education prior to May 1 of either of the first two years, a teacher\u2019s employment may be terminated for whatever reasons, without redress by the probationer. Unless such notice of termination is given, however, the teacher\u2019s holding of his position is protected by \"tenure\u201d. This simply means that he can not be dismissed or suspended thereafter except for cause, <em>i.e., </em>immorality, misconduct in office, insubordination, incompetency or willful neglect of duty. Md. Code, Ed. Art., \u00a7 6-202 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>While those grounds seem at first blush broad enough to provide substantial latitude to the employer sufficient to permit retaining only teachers of the highest caliber, the tenure provision in Md. Code, Ed. Art., \u00a7 6-202 provides further deterrents to dismissal. Before the individual can be removed for any of these causes, he must be provided notice, \u00a7 6-202 (a) (2), and a right to be heard, first by the county board, \u00a7 6-202 (a) (3), and if unsuccessful, then by the State Board, \u00a7 6-202 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The procedure for the dismissal is set forth in Ed. Art., \u00a7 6-202. Where the teacher has tenure, the \"charges\u201d are preferred by the county superintendent in the form of a recommendation to the county board that the teacher be dismissed for cause. Upon the proper notice, the board must hold a hearing. The practice has evolved that requires the superintendent to substantiate the cause asserted to support his recommendation. Although it is the board that makes the decision whether or not to terminate, because the teacher\u2019s contract is with it, in reality the board acts in the manner of an impartial tribunal judging the charges made by one of its employees (the superintendent) against another of its employees (the teacher) and the latter\u2019s defense to those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Because of the obvious, central role that teachers play in the educational process, the policies and practices pertaining to their employment relationship are matters of considerable importance to every segment concerned with public education. This includes legislative bodies that must appropriate the money to pay the teachers\u2019 salaries, boards of education and supervisory personnel responsible for administering the school system, students (for whom the entire system exists) who expect and have a right to be properly taught, parents who pay the taxes to fund the appropriations and, of course, the teachers whose means of livelihood are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Trying to balance these interests, the General Assembly authorized the State Board of Education to provide a tenure system. Ed. Art., \u00a7 6-202 (b) provides, however, that the State Board is not prohibited \"from adopting bylaws to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>provide for a probationary period of employment of 2 years or less,\u201d during which a teacher\u2019s adequacy to instruct may be screened.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Most of the grounds for dismissal after the obtention of tenure are highly subjective in nature and are often incapable of precise measurement by reference to any single act. Incompetency is the most subjective of these causes and perhaps more than the others it calls for careful evaluation of the teacher during the 2-year probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Bylaw 13.06.02 was the State Board\u2019s implementation of the authority providing the probationary period. It set forth a \"Regular Contract\u201d uniformly throughout the State containing the two year probationary period provision. As time passed it became apparent that such contractual uniformity did not take into account the variables of probationers\u2019 evaluations in the 23 counties. The State Board also recognized that it was not up to the task of becoming a super-evaluator so it promulgated a study to establish evaluation guidelines. Out of respect for the divergent administrative peculiarities within the 23 counties, it did not seek a rigid uniformity but did attempt to systemize the procedure. See <em>Wojtulewicz v. Board of Education of Baltimore </em>County, No. HE-17-71-MC (May 30, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The State Board by resolution resolving to adopt \"Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probationary Teachers\u201d (guidelines), seemed to recognize the need for procedural discretion among the counties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\"The Board does not wish to substitute its judgment for those of the evaluators who have the direct responsibility of supervising probationary teachers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">That approach was enforced by a more forceful addendum. The resolved \"guidelines\u201d compelled the county boards of education to adopt evaluation procedures which were \"not inconsistent\u201d with those. which it set forth as its own guidelines by resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The State guidelines <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prescribed, among other things, a minimum number of observations of the probationary teacher each year, (4), by more than one qualified observer, after each of which the observer would consult with the teacher and submit a written report.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">But the State Board\u2019s procedures <em>resolving </em>these \"guidelines\u201d left something to be desired in determining their intended effect. By Ed. Art., \u00a7 2-205, the State Board is authorized to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">\"adopt bylaws, rules, and regulations for the administration of the public schools\u201d, (c) (1),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\"[t]hese bylaws, rules, and regulations have the force of law <em>when </em>adopted and <em>published.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added) (c) (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The statute also indicates that the establishment of a probationary period should be enacted by a bylaw, and inferentially then, so should the procedures of evaluation during that period.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">\"Except for personnel of the Baltimore City public schools at the level of assistant superintendent or above, this section does not prohibit the State Board from adopting bylaws to provide for a probationary period of employment of 2 years or less.\u201d Ed. Art., \u00a7 6-202 (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Why the State Board elected to proceed by \"resolving\u201d to \"adopt guidelines\u201d rather than by enacting a bylaw, or even a rule or regulation as established statutorily for administrative procedures, is unknown. What is certain, however, is that by failing to more formally legislate or regulate as authorized, the guidelines have neither the force nor the effect of law. Even if interpretatively this resolve could be called by any other name, <em>e.g., </em>a bylaw, rule or regulation, its enactment did not comply either with \u00a7 2-205 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(c) (2) which withholds endowing them with the force of law until adopted <em>and published, </em>or with Md. Code, Art. 41, \u00a7 9 (as it then read) which required that copies of any rule or regulation enacted by a regulatory entity should be filed with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, the Secretary of State, the State Library, the circuit court libraries and with the Department of Legislative Reference, before it becomes legally effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Effective or not, the Anne Arundel County Board of Education (appellant here) presumably attempted to comply with the State Board\u2019s resolve, but again the method of compliance did not conform even to that which the State Board\u2019s resolution called for. The county board did not \"adopt evaluation procedures\u201d as the State Board\u2019s resolution provided it \"shall\u201d do; rather, according to the record, a Director of Staff Relations in the Anne Arundel County Department of Education sent out a memorandum to \"All Principals\u201d enclosing a copy of the \"Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probationary Teachers recently adopted by the State Board of Education and effective September 1, 1974.\u201d The memo then compared the guidelines\u2019 requirements with the \"TAAAC [Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County] negotiated agreement\u201d which had been previously negotiated and adopted in that County. The Director\u2019s memo explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\"In implementing Article 16 of the TAAAC \u2014 Board agreement, the principal can also satisfy the requirements of the State guidelines, except that the following provisions of the latter go beyond the requirements of the local agreement and must, therefore, be observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">1. For probationary teachers, conferences and written reports must follow each of <em>four </em>conferences per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">2. For probationary teachers the rating must be based on the conclusions and assessments of <em>more that </em>[sic] <em>one staff member.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">3. The rating must be considered as a factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>recommending non-renewal of a probationary teacher\u2019s contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u2014 this case \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In the case of probationary teacher Edward F. Barbano, it is uncon tested that there has been less than absolute adherence to the State Board guidelines; however, the State Board decided (contrary to the recommendation of its examiner) that the evaluation had been adequate because it had been fair and impartial. The deviation from categorical adherence to these guidelines, in the opinion of the State Board, was not prejudicial to Barbano in that there had been \"substantial adherence to their provisions\u201d during the period when Barbano\u2019s performance \"was found wanting\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Barbano appealed that decision to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County which ultimately reversed the State Board\u2019s affirmance of the County Board\u2019s refusal to renew Barbano\u2019s contract. The <em>only </em>issue which it decided was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\"What is the legal effect of a County Board of Education\u2019s decision not to renew a probationary (non-tenured) teacher\u2019s employment contract, when that decision is arrived at following less than absolute adherence to 'guidelines\u2019 adopted by the State Board of Education?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The trial judge held that despite the unenforceability of the State Board\u2019s resolution, not having the force of law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\"since the State Board promulgated the guidelines, both it and the County Boards are constrained to observe their terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">He further decided that even analogizing the statutory authority of the State Board to explain and interpret its own bylaws, rules and regulations, with the exclusive right to explain and interpret its own resolved guidelines, the minimum observations, reports, conferences and observers which were not met by the County authorities, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\"numbers\u201d which were too clear to be subject to explanation or interpretation. The right-to-interpret provision he referred to is another unique provision found in the broad fields of education which at the time of the State Board hearing read: <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">\"The State Board of Education shall, to the best of their ability, cause the provisions of this article to be carried into effect. They shall determine the educational policies of the State; they shall enact bylaws, rules and regulations for the administration of the public school system, which when enacted and published shall have the force of law. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, and the enacted and published bylaws, rules and regulations of the Board, the State Board of Education shall, if necessary, institute legal proceedings. The State Board of Education shall, without charge and with the advice of the Attorney General of Maryland, explain the true intent and meaning of the law, and shall decide all controversies and disputes that arise under it, and their decision shall be final; and the secretary of the State Board of Education shall have authority to administer oaths, in any part of the State, to witnesses in any matter pending before said Board.\u201d Md. Code, Art. 77, \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u2014 administrative precedent \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Prior to Barbano\u2019s case, which the State Board decided on June 29, 1977, it had previously decided two similar cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>using divergent explanations. In <em>Eugene P. Macri v. Board of Education of Washington County, </em>No. HE-9-76-FD (November 23, 1976), the majority of a divided State Board found that its \"Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probationary Teachers\u201d stated minimum standards that \"should be followed with reasonable precision\u201d even where the result is to grant tenure to a teacher whose qualifications are in doubt. In <em>Gloria Summers v. Board of Education of Frederick County, </em>No. 77-8 (No. HE-18-76-MC) (March 30, 1977), however, the State Board backed away from its decision in <em>Macri. </em>Adopting the Findings and Conclusions of the Hearing Examiner, the State Board found that its guidelines could be followed without rigid adherence if they had been substantially complied with.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">\"[T]he underlying purpose of the guidelines is not to assure that a probationary teacher will be given a fixed number of written reports, but rather that he or she will be given every reasonable opportunity to correct deficiencies and will be given adequate notice that failure to correct is likely to result in non-renewal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Subsequently, in this case, <em>Barbano v. Board of Education of Anne Arundel County, </em>No. 77-11 (No. HE-21-76-FD) (June 29, 1977), the State Board relied for its decision upon <em>Summers, </em>not <em>Macri. </em>The State Board held that so long as the facts indicated that the probationary teacher had been fairly and impartially evaluated, it was irrelevant that the guidelines were not categorically adhered to. Based upon this holding, the State Board affirmed the County Board\u2019s decision not to renew appellee\u2019s employment contract, after his second year of probationary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u2014- the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In reversing the State Board, the trial judge emphasized that he did not intend to interfere either with the interpretive right of the State Board\u2019s regulations or its power to control public schools.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\"It seems beyond dispute that numbers, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the essential characteristics of the provisions listed above, cannot have any possible meaning other than their manifest expression. Thus, the nature of the particular provisions of the guidelines involved in this case is such that it permits no interpretation or explanation. This finding in no way detracts from the concededly special powers of the State Board to control and supervise the public schools. Robinson v. <em>Board of Education of St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>143 F. Supp. 481 (D. Md. 1956); <em>Zeitschel v. Board of Education of Carroll County, </em>274 Md. 69, 332 A.2d 906 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">He then went on to hold essentially that unless the language of bylaws, rules, regulations (or analogous resolved guidelines) is ambiguous, the State Board must strictly compel adherence to them. This ruling was obviously contrary to the State Board\u2019s own opinion in <em>Summers </em>that substantial compliance would suffice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s opinion said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\"This Court only finds that, when the State Board purports to control and supervise by promulgating guidelines for evaluation of probationary teachers, it must be bound by its own decision. In accord with this finding, the following language seems particularly fitting:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">'Where an Agency confers a benefit by its regulations to a party in proceedings before it, it should not be permitted capriciously to deprive a party of that benefit.\u2019 <em>Equal Employment Op. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Com\u2019n. v. United States Pipe &amp; F. Co., </em>375 F. Supp. 237, at 247 (N.D. Ala. 1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">This holding is in accord with what seems to be the general rule in the sphere of administrative law: that action taken by an administrative agency in violation of its own procedural requirements cannot stand, and must be stricken down by the courts. E.g., <em>Hopkins v. Md. Inmate Griev. Comm\u2019n., </em>40 Md. App. 329, 391 A.2d 1213 (1978), and cases cited therein. This doctrine has been expanded to encompass administrative procedures promulgated in forms other than formal rules and regulations. E.g., <em>United States v. Heffner, </em>420 F.2d 809 (4th Cir. 1969) (I.R.S. news release); <em>Mandel v. U.S. Dept. of Health, Ed. and Welfare, </em>411 F. Supp. 542 (D. Md. 1976) , <em>modified on appeal, </em>562 F.2d 914 (4th Cir. 1977) (pamphlet or policy statement). Also, the general rule seems to be that an administrative agency must follow its own procedures, whether the particular proceedings are 'adjudicative\u2019, 'investigative\u2019 or 'legislative\u2019 in character. Cases in other Circuits have indicated that they would limit these general rules. E.g., <em>Union of Concerned Scientists v. Atomic Energy Com\u2019n., </em>499 F.2d 1069 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (violation of agency 'doctrine\u2019 distinguished from violation of a rule or regulation); <em>United States v. Leahey, </em>434 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1970) ('adjudicatory \u2014 investigatory dichotomy\u2019). However, this Court finds the rule in the Fourth Circuit, and the better rule, to contemplate that an administrative agency is required to absolutely comply with the guidelines as well as the rules and regulations it promulgates and that this rule applies equally to adjudicative and investigative agency activities. See <em>United States v. Heffner, supra; Mandel v. U.S. Dept. of Health, Ed. and Welfare, supra; Equal Employment Op. Com\u2019n. v. Western Electric Co., Inc., </em>382 F. Supp. 787 (D. Md. 1974); <em>Equal Employment Op. Com\u2019n v. Westvaco Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>372 F. Supp. 985 (D. Md. 1974); <em>Equal Employment Op. Com\u2019n. v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>366 F. Supp. 273 (D. Md. 1973); <em>Hopkins, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>[6]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">There are recognized exceptions to the rule that an agency must carefully follow its own procedural requirements. However, these exceptions seem to be limited to situations other than what is presented in the instant case. E.g., <em>American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight, </em>397 U.S. 532, 25 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1970) and <em>Matthews v. Walter, </em>512 F.2d 941 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (where procedural rules are intended to ensure 'the orderly transaction of agency business\u2019, as opposed to being 'intended to \"confer important procedural benefits\u201d upon the parties before the agency\u2019.); <em>Taylor v. Maryland School for the Blind, </em>409 F. Supp. 148 (D. Md. 1976), <em>aff'd. </em>542 F.2d 1169 (4th Cir. 1976) ('some greater interest was served by the violation\u2019). This Court agrees with the Hearing Examiner\u2019s opinion that the guidelines at issue here were meant to function in part as aids to assist probationary teachers in becoming competent. As such, the guidelines were meant to confer an important procedural benefit upon probationary teachers, a benefit which must be protected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>requiring strict adherence to the provisions of the guidelines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u2014 our opinion \u2014-</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The concluding premise underlying the trial judge\u2019s opinion, <em>i.e., </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\"the guidelines were meant to confer an important procedural benefit upon probationary teachers .. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">is at best questionable. That probationers are the beneficiaries carries a seed of correctness but other beneficiaries of the guidelines appear to sprout like springtime croci from them also. To have rested his opinion on that premise overlooks the practical purpose as well as the underlying concept from which the guidelines emanated. That purpose \u2014 and its tangential benefits \u2014 were discussed by the State Board in its opinion prefacing enactment of the resolution attempting to adopt them. It was set out at length in <em>Wojtulewicz v. Board of Education of Baltimore County </em>decided May 30, 1973. Because the State Board found it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\"... practically impossible to substitute our judgment for those of the educators who have the direct responsibility of supervising probationary teachers,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">the Board expressed a more basic concern that the administrative procedural hodge-pot would deter the dismissal of incompetents during the dismissable period.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">\"Moreover, we are concerned that an elaborate appeals procedure involving non-renewal of the contracts of probationary teachers would discourage local administrators from taking stern action against teachers who proved themselves inadequate during the probationary period and that a stream of appeals would seriously interfere with the regular workload of educational administrators and boards of education.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Added to these primary concerns was the danger of losing a good teacher by a jaded supervisor who unchecked may abuse his discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">\"At the same time we are not unmindful of the danger of abuse of discretion, of the danger that a bright and resourceful new teacher could be penalized by a principal or supervisor who has grown old and tired in his job and feels himself threatened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">These were some of the problems of which the Board was aware</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\"and want to see to it that they are avoided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The Board then directed its staff to study and develop guidelines for the evaluation of probationary teachers. The guidelines, it decided, need not be so rigidly uniform as to discount divergent administrative resources in the respective counties; however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\"[i]n each county, be it large or small, there shall thus be put into effect a system in which the arbitrary decision of a single supervising person could not stand in the way of a probationary teacher\u2019s career.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">It is apparent then, that while the State Board recognized that among the many benefits to be derived from these guidelines was \"the procedural benefit [conferred] upon probationary teachers\u201d (as indicated by the court below), it also recognized that the primary concern was the obtention of good teachers and the prevention of bad ones which is in accord with the underlying concept of the whole scheme of education. The primary purpose of the State Board of Education is not to bestow procedural benefits upon teachers of questionable competency, but to bestow upon students education by teachers of unquestionable competency. While the former frequently coincides with the latter, where the two may conflict, the former must unquestionably give way.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">But more to the point of this case are neither the tangential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>benefits bestowed by the guidelines nor the philosophical reasons for their promulgation. The point of concern is the immediate <em>purpose </em>for the guidelines. With the philosophical chaff blown off, the purpose is reduced to that expressed by the Board in <em>Wojtulewicz, i.e., </em>to provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">\"... a system . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">or, as explained by the dissent in <em>Maori </em>which was subsequently followed in <em>Summers,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\"[w]e wanted to see to it that a set of practices was followed by each local school system .... So as to make sure that each public school system would adopt appropriate rules . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">It is apparent then that the trial judge was in error in applying to this case that which we referred to in <em>Hopkins v. Md. Inmate Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Md. App. 329 (1978), as the \"Accardi doctrine\u201d, denominated by reason of its origin <em>(U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260 (1954)). To express the \"doctrine\u201d we chose the language from <em>United States v. Heffner, </em>420 F.2d 809, 811 (4th Cir. 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\"An agency of the government must scrupulously observe rules, regulations, or procedures which it has established. When it fails to do so, its action cannot stand and courts will strike it down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>American Farm Line v. Black Ball Freight Service, </em>397 U.S. 532, 538-539 (1970), however, treated the \"doctrine\u201d as an exception, while acknowledging that government agencies must comply with their own regulations. That is so when the regulations are intended primarily to confer important procedural benefits upon individuals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Absent such purpose, the \"general principle\u201d holds true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\" 'It is always within the discretion of a court or an administrative agency to relax or modify its procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of business before it when in a given case the ends of justice require it.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, quoting <em>NLRB v. Monsanto Chemical Co., </em>205 F.2d 763, 764 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 336, we acknowledged that Supreme Court holding, but recognized it only as an \"exception\u201d to the <em>Accardi </em>\"doctrine\u201d. By whatever designation it is apposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In the case at bar we are reviewing resolved guidelines without the force and effect of properly enacted rules, regulations or bylaws. More significantly, they are the resolves of a unique branch of government given peculiarly autonomous powers among which is the authority to explain the true intent and meaning of not only the rules, regulations and bylaws adopted by the Board, but the very provisions legislatively authorizing the powers and duties, etc., of the Board itself. Ed. Art., \u00a7 2-205 (e) (see old Art. 77, \u00a7\u00a7 6,59). It is just such singular authority together with similar indicia of autonomy peculiar to the education field that caused the Court of Appeals in 1963 to hold that the State Board was invested with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\"the last word on any matter concerning education policy or the administration of the system of public education.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Board of Education, </em>234 Md. 561, 565 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">This observation was reemphasized by repetition in 1979, <em>Resetar v.

The specific authority to explain the true intent and meaning of its own laws and to decide all controversies and disputes that may arise under it was acknowledged 100 years before <em>Resetar, </em>as a \"visitatorial power of the most comprehensive character\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Wiley, et al., Trustees v. Board Co. School Comm\u2019rs of Allegany Co., </em>51 Md. 401, 406 (1879). The Court in <em>Wiley </em>went on to explain both origin and purpose as regarded it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\"[A]nd it has been settled ever since the great case of <em>Phillips v. Bury, (Lord Raym., </em>5, 2 <em>Dun. &amp; East, </em>346,) that such power is, in its nature, summary and exclusive. In delivering the judgment in the case of <em>St. John's College vs. Toddington, </em>1 <em>Burr., </em>159, 200, Lord MANSFIELD said that 'the visitatorial power, if properly exercised, without expense or delay, is useful and convenient to colleges; and it is now settled and established that the jurisdiction of a visitor is summary and without appeal from it.\u2019 And it may be added, that such power is not more useful and convenient to colleges than to other well organized educational establishments. If every dispute or contention among those entrusted with the administration of the system, or between the functionaries and the patrons or pupils of the schools, offered an occasion for a resort to the Courts for settlement, the working of the system would not only be greatly embarrassed and obstructed, but such contentions before the Courts would necessarily be attended with great costs and delay, and likely generate such intestine heats and divisions as would, in a great degree, counteract the beneficent purposes of the law. It is to obviate these consequences that the visitatorial power is conferred; and wherever that power exists, and is comprehensive enough to deal with the questions involved in an existing controversy, as the case here, Courts of equity decline all interference, and leave the parties to abide the summary decision of those clothed with the visitatorial authority.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>In the face of such awesome authority, how can we fail to apply that exception to the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine, allowed more mundane agencies, when the State Board interpreting its own authority has indicated that the guidelines which resolved to avoid an elaborate appeals procedure were administrative rules for the orderly transaction of business, <em>i.e., </em>to provide \"a system\u201d applicable among the 23 counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The trial judge erred by placing inordinate emphasis upon the Hearing Examiner\u2019s conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\"the guidelines at issue here were meant to function in part as aids to assist probationary teachers in becoming competent,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">as being the primary purpose of guidelines. That may indeed have been a beneficial offshoot, but the Board\u2019s own opinions are clear that the guidelines were intended to provide a degree of uniformity (though not express uniformity) in guiding the divergent county boards in negotiating annually such procedures with the union-like representatives of the teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u2014 the next case \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The \"rights\u201d \u2014 if any \u2014 that enure to the benefit of the probationer from the guidelines may be protected by his contractual right, to the extent a contract exists, or deprivation of due process, to the extent such constitutional rights exist.

We will not address those issues either because the trial judge has not decided them. Md. Rule 1085. He will be given that opportunity upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">We find it necessary briefly to address another issue raised by appellant, that is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">'jtjhe State Board of Education had no Jurisdiction to Hear the Complaint of the Appellee, Barbano Involving as it did a Purely Legal Question Relating to the Law of Contracts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">While we are somewhat confounded by appellant\u2019s tactic of attacking the jurisdiction of the body before which it prevailed, we will address the issue, if but passingly brief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Suffice to say, we agree with the conclusion of the trial judge who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\"More recently in, <em>Zeitschel v. Board of Education, </em>274 Md. 69 (1975), the Court of Appeals, in a case involving the State Board of Education\u2019s review of a local board of education\u2019s decision to terminate a probationary teacher\u2019s employment, decided the appeal on the merits. While the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education was not raised on the appeal, the Court of Appeals clearly indicated that the matter was one within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education. This Court finds, that, <em>Zeitschel, supra, </em>is controlling on the issue of the State Board of Education\u2019s jurisdiction on the issue relating to the lack of a proper evaluation in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>case.
