Mr. Uhler argues in this Court that the lower court erred when it ruled that he had forfeited his right to defend against enforcement of the Secretary\u2019s order because he had failed to pursue an appeal pursuant to Md. Ann. Code, art. 43, \u00a7 404 (1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also contends that the Secretary does not have jurisdiction over the landfill because it is not a system \"for public use\u201d within the provisions of Md. Ann. Code, art. 43, \u00a7 394 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Mr. Uhler purchased his farm in Finksburg in 1965. A large ravine, covering about five acres, was in existence when he took possession, and he immediately attempted to reclaim the land for farming purposes by filling the ravine with farm wastes. In addition, he asked his brother, who operated a hauling business, to deposit in the ravine any rubble that he had occasion to haul. This arrangement existed for five years prior to August 14,1978. On that date Mr. Uhler was served with a written order issued by the Secretary commanding that: \"All dumping at this site cease immediately....\u201d The order also required him to cover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>landfill with a minimum of two feet of earth and to grade and seed the area. In addition he was informed that: \"Engineering plans and specifications ... must be submitted ... if the site is proposed for future use....\u201d A letter accompanying the order said: \"If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to communicate with this office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">At the hearing below, Mr. Uhler testified that he called the office and spoke to Richard Nace, a State geologist. According to appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\"[Mr. Nace] said if there\u2019s any more trouble, he\u2019d give me a call. Otherwise, if he didn\u2019t call me, the way I understood him, it would be all right to go ahead, that [the order] wouldn\u2019t apply to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">It is undisputed that Mr. Uhler took no corrective action after talking to Mr. Nace in August, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">On October 30,1978, the Secretary filed a bill of complaint in the circuit court seeking a mandatory injunction and civil penalties against Mr. Uhler for violation of the August 14, 1978 administrative order. In his answer he claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the landfill was not operated \"for public use\u201d and that the Secretary\u2019s order \"denied the defendant procedural and substantive due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In due course, a hearing was held in the circuit court, and testimony was taken from Norman Chapman, a consultant with the State, and Mr. Uhler. The court held the case, <em>sub curia, </em>and thereafter filed a \"memorandum order\u201d in which it held that Mr. Uhler had \"forfeited his right\u201d to contest the order of August 14, 1978 because he failed to seek relief under the procedure for judicial review provided by Md. Ann. Code, art. 43, \u00a7 404 (1980), <em>supra, </em>n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">On appeal his main contention is that the Secretary\u2019s order did not comport with the requirements of due process, specifically that, \"[t]he failure to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard renders the Secretary\u2019s Order void.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Preliminarily, we observe that the lower court was inaccurate in holding that the remedy established by Md. Ann. Code, art. 43, \u00a7 404 (1980) was available to Mr. Uhler at the time he received the Secretary\u2019s order. That avenue of relief was not then available; his proper course, at that juncture, was an appeal to the Board of Review of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code, art. 41, \u00a7 206B (1979 Cum. Supp.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commission on Medical Discipline v. Bendler, </em>280 Md. 326, 373 A.2d 1232 (1977). Indeed, had appellant filed suit under \u00a7 404, his action would have succumbed before a defense that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 373 A.2d at 1234.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The question properly before the lower court, therefore, and now confronting this Court, is whether Mr. Uhler\u2019s failure seasonably to pursue his administrative remedy, at the time the order issued, constituted a waiver. In our view, there could have been a waiver \u2014 but only if Mr. Uhler had received proper notice from the Secretary of his right to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>administrative appeal, a fundamental requirement of due process. <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Although, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 570 (1972), \"the range of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite,\u201d clearly Mr. Uhler\u2019s real property, including the use of his ravine, is protected. With respect to protected interests, the Supreme Court has also held, in language strikingly apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\"While '[m]any controversies have raged about ... the Due Process Clause,\u2019 ... it is fundamental that except in emergency situations (and this is not one) due process requires that when a State seeks to terminate [a protected] interest..., it must afford 'notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case\u2019 <em>before </em>the termination becomes effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\"><em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 542 (1971) (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original), quoting in part from <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Here, without any prior warning or notification of <em>any </em>kind, appellant\u2019s right to the use of his ravine was terminated \"immediately.\u201d The <em>ex parte </em>order was itself the property owner\u2019s first notification of alleged illegal landfill activity; and neither the order nor the accompanying letter informed him of his right to an administrative appeal pursuant to Md. Ann. Code, art. 41, \u00a7 206B (1979 Cum. Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">In a recent case involving \"[l]ay consumers of electrical service,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whose service had been terminated, the Supreme Court addressed itself to the constitutional requirement of notice in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">\"Petitioners\u2019 notification procedure, while ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>quate to apprise the Crafts of the threat of termination of service, was <em>not 'reasonably calculated\u2019 to inform them of the availability of 'an opportunity to present their objections\u2019 to their bills. . . . </em>The purpose of notice under the Due Process Clause is to apprise the affected individual of, and permit adequate preparation for, an impending 'hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Notice in a case of this kind does not comport with constitutional requirements when it does not advise the customer of the availability of a procedure for protesting </em>a proposed termination of utility service as unjustified. As no such notice was given respondents \u2014 despite 'good faith efforts\u2019 on their part \u2014 they were deprived of the notice which was their due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\"><em>Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 98 S. Ct. 1554, 1563 (1978) (citation omitted) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Notice is an especially compelling requirement in circumstances such as exist here where the order was issued ex <em>parte </em>and against a layman without knowledge of the intricacies, indeed the existence, of administrative and judicial procedures. Clearly, the Secretary\u2019s offer of assistance if there were \"any questions,\u201d does not immunize the \"notice\u201d provided here against Mr. Uhler\u2019s due process claim. He was never told that he had important administrative and judicial remedies which could be lost by delay in exercising them, nor was he told what those rights were.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\"[W]hen notice is a person\u2019s due, process which is a mere gesture is not due process.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 315 (1950). The notice provided to Mr. Uhler in the instant case was not reasonable, did not rise above a \"mere gesture,\u201d and certainly did not comport with the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See generally Barry Properties, Inc. v. Fick Brothers Roofing Co., </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222 (1976). <em>See also Allied American Co. v. Commissioner of Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 615-16, 150 A.2d 421, 426-27 (1959) (Fourteenth Amendment and Article 23 have the \"same meaning and effect in reference to an exaction of property\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\"The essence of procedural due process is fundamental fairness. This embodies adequate advance notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to State action resulting in deprivation of a significant property <em>interest.... It likewise entitles a litigant to timely notice of decisions which have adjudicated his property interests in relation to available appellate remedies.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Department of Labor and Employment, </em>184 Colo. 334, 338, 520 P.2d 586, 588-89 (1974) (citation omitted) (emphasis added) (due process requires that notice of decision of referee granting award of unemployment benefits be given to employer\u2019s counsel where absence of notice precluded timely filing of administrative appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">It follows, then, that because the Secretary\u2019s order did not satisfy constitutional due process requirements, it is void <em>ab initio. North Alabama Express, Inc. v. United States, </em>585 F.2d 783, 786 (5th Cir. 1978) (\"Failure to provide adequate notice is a jurisdictional defect that invalidates administrative action until the defect is cured.\u201d). The circuit court erred in not granting Mr. Uhler\u2019s prayer that the bill of complaint be dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Of course, nothing in our ruling prevents the Secretary from issuing a new order that comports with the requirements of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; cause remanded to the Circuit Court for Carroll County with instructions to dismiss the bill of complaint; costs to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">.
