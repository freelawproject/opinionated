His atrocities there were of such nature that his wife by petition alleged him to have been a sexual psychopath causing his commitment to the Mendocino State Hospital which, after 90 days, decided he was not so deranged. Violating his parole after imprisonment, Leuschner emigrated to Maryland where he subsequently kidnapped, sodomized and murdered two young boys, 10-year-old Russell Marine by stabbing and 9-year-old Troy Krause by strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Despite the attendant violence of crimes of that nature, they are nonetheless clandestine. The witnesses are dead, most physical evidence hidden or destroyed and the only living knowledge of it is locked in the mind of the perpetrator. Though he may be suspected because of his past, he cannot be reapprehended for prior crimes; nor can he be deterred from committing future ones of like nature unless law enforcement officials can somehow discover his misdeeds. The obvious, usually the best, and often the only source, is the perpetrator himself and if a confession can be extracted properly, prosecution and subsequent confinement are reasonably assured.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But if that route is followed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>officials must tread carefully lest they trespass upon an accused\u2019s constitutionally sacred grounds; that which provides him the privilege not to \"be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself....\u201d U. S. Const, amend. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">To the extent that this privilege intrudes upon the investigatory aspect of criminal law enforcement, the privilege of silence serves as a checkrein, but not necessarily an unjustifiable restraint, upon police. Even the sanction for involuntarily extracting statements \u2014 evidentiary exclusion \u2014 is not an unreasonable one in light of the questionable truthfulness of that which was, or might be, coercively extracted by physical or psychological means. However, as the Fifth Amendment right has been interpretively extended, requiring procedural niceties of interrogation formulized to fit precise patterns, it has more and more become an impediment even to legitimate methods of law enforcement. See Harlan, J., dissenting in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 493 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">One such nicety was the blending of the Fifth Amendment right not to speak, with the Sixth Amendment right \"to have the Assistance of Counsel for [one\u2019s] defense\u201d. Initially, the right to counsel for one\u2019s defense presupposed an advocate at trial, but was interpretively extended to apply pretrial for an indicted defendant interrogated by the police in a completely extrajudicial environment. <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201 (1964). Perhaps because the exclusionary rule was found to be an effective deterrent to opprobrious police conduct in violation of the Fifth Amendment, any statement elicited in the absence of counsel after indictment, regardless of how elicited, was not admissible at trial against the accused. <em>Ibid. </em>Soon to follow <em>Massiah </em>was <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478 (1964), which extended the right to counsel to a suspect \u2014 not necessarily indicted \u2014 but from the moment the investigatory phase of an interrogation becomes accusatory and focused upon the suspect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\"[Where an] investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied 'the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as 'made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 US [335 (1963)], at 342, 9 L ed 2d at 804, 93 ALR2d 733, and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. at 490-491.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>Escobedo </em>thus interwove the two rights, binding them together with the sanction of exclusion. The final touch to this pattern of protection was <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), which provided the striated brocade of procedural niceties.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Miranda\u2019s </em>holding first appears as simplicity itself,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\"... the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">but it was the \"procedural safeguards\u201d that striated the holding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\"Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>appointed. The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Fifth Amendment safeguard was abundantly clear, but that paragraph also suggested that to exercise the Sixth Amendment right to counsel might be a talisman serving to raise the Fifth Amendment shield as well.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\"If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444-445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Court then jumps back to the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\"Likewise, if the individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be interrogated, the police may not question him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Then, presumably because of the application of the similar sanctions, the Court speaks as if the Fifth Amendment privilege and the Sixth Amendment right are one and the same,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\"The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right [Fifth] to refrain from answering any further inquiries <em>until he has consulted with an attorney [Sixth] and thereafter consents to be questioned [Fifth].\u201d Id. </em>at 445 (emphasis added),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">and seems to say that a subsequent waiver must be a knowing and intelligent one.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">For 45 pages after its initial deceivingly simple holding, the Court sought to explain what was meant, apparently trying to anticipate all situation possibilities of which it could conceive. Again it alternately addressed the right and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the privilege in a single paragraph. With regard to the Fifth Amendment privilege not to speak, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.\u201d 384 U.S. at 473-474 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In the same paragraph it anticipated the exercise of one\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\"If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning. \"Id. at 474.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Then it .concluded those examples with the third possibility, an amalgam of the two.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\"If the individual cannot obtain an attorney <em>and he indicates that he wants one before speaking to </em>police, they must respect his decision to remain silent.\u201d Id. at 474 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">But, contrary to some interpretations, even if both rights are exercised by one upon whom an investigation has focused, the Court did not by that fact alone command the investigators to <em>cease </em>all interrogation. It does, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>place upon them a heavy burden if they wish to use in trial that which they elicit thereafter \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\"If the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d 384 U.S. at 475.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">And the <em>Miranda </em>Court went on to make unequivocally clear that mere silence is not enough to overcome that heavy burden. <em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Now, after more than a decade of experience, the Court in <em>North Carolina v. </em>Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286, 292 (1979), explained that the heavy burden of proving a waiver need not be restricted to an express waiver by a defendant, but may be inferred by strong evidence of the circumstances of the interrogation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\"That [waiver may not be inferred by a silent record] does not mean that the defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights. The courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s burden is great; but in at least some cases waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">With these questions of constitutional rights at issue in the case before us, we have independently and carefully reviewed the entire record, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>State, </em>12 Md. App. 684, 694 (1971). Silent it is not. Unlike the record in <em>Tague v. Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 62 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1980), the record here fairly shouts at us, as it did to the trial judge, that this case is one from which \"waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.\u201d <em>Butler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>supra </em>at 292. In so concluding, we scrupulously followed the directive of the Supreme Court which stated in <em>Butler, supra, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\"when the right so fundamental as that to counsel at trial is involved, the question of waiver must be determined on 'the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the <em>background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u2019\u201d Id. </em>at 293 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u2014 <em>Butlefs </em>variations on the <em>Miranda </em>theme \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Elwood Leroy Leuschner was convicted in the Circuit Court for Washington County of murdering and sexually offending Troy Krause, a 9-year-old boy. He had previously been convicted in Wicomico County of similarly destroying 10-year-old \"Rusty\u201d Marine. See <em>Leuschner </em>v. <em>State, </em>41 Md. App. 423 (1979). Having exhausted his appeals in the Marine case, his appeal now is from the Krause conviction. Both cases rested upon Leuschner\u2019s confessions which were elicited almost simultaneously. His assertions of improprieties in eliciting the confessions compel us to review the entire circumstances and events leading up to both confessions. Following the <em>Butler </em>directive, however, we must first consider him with whom we are dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\n<em>\"background, [and] experience\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Elwood Leroy Leuschner, as we have indicated, has a \"background\u201d and \"experience\u201d which show, by repetitive exposure, an assimilated knowledge of judicial proceedings and defendant\u2019s rights. In California, as indicated by a four page criminal record, he had been charged with two crimes against children, two rapes, assault and robbery, firearms violation, forgery, burglary, and was a registered sex offender who had been accused but not proven to have been a sexual psychopath. Such background implies a knowledge, whether, gained from books or experience, that is a distinguishing circumstance to be considered in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>whether his subsequent conduct was an intentional waiver of a known right. <em>Cf. Escobedo, supra </em>at 491-492.<footnotemark>1A</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0d\"><em>\"conduct of the accused </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">For three months the Maryland State Police in Wicomico County had been searching for a missing 9-year-old boy named Troy Krause, when in late October of 1977, another youngster about the same age, named Russell (Rusty) Marine was reported missing also. On October 29, 1977, while investigating Rusty\u2019s disappearance, the State Police were told by Rusty\u2019s stepfather that his neighbor, Elwood Leroy Leuschner (the appellant) had last seen Rusty walking down the road toward a dirt pile near their residences. Trooper David Luce went to Leuschner\u2019s trailer home and inquired about his recollection of last seeing Rusty. Because Leuschner\u2019s niece had previously related that Leuschner had a California criminal record, the trooper, upon returning to the barracks, entered Leuschner\u2019s description in a National Crime Information Center Computer and found that he was wanted in California for a parole violation. His criminal record was four pages long.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On October 30, 1977, in the early morning hours Leuschner was arrested (because California would extradite on the outstanding warrants for parole violation) and immediately advised of his rights, which he admittedly understood. He explained to the police that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\"he had been communicating with California authorities in an attempt to get his parole problem straightened out, that he only had one more year left on his parole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Upon arrival at the State Police barracks he was again informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and at that time</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\"Mr. Leuschner stated that he wanted an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>to represent him on the fugitive charges, </em>as he did not want to go back to California; he had a lot to lose: he would lose his trailer, his job, his girlfriend, and so on.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">No questions were asked of him regarding the fugitive charge; however, he was routinely processed and subsequently taken to the Criminal Investigator\u2019s office. There he was questioned</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\"concerning any information he may have [had] as to the location of the missing boy, Rusty Marine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">It is significant to note that his previous request for an attorney was expressly in regard to the fugitive charge only. That request for counsel was \"scrupulously honored\u201d as a triggering mechanism for his \"right to cut off questioning\u201d in regard to the charge for which he was arrested; however, he willingly agreed to discuss the missing boy. See <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\"Q. Did he say anything to you about an attorney at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">A. Just for the fugitive charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">Q. What do [you] mean? What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">A. He said he would like to have an attorney represent him for the fugitive charge, because he did not want to go back to the State of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">Q. Did he indicate to you at that time whether or not he was willing to talk to you about Rusty Marine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">A. Yes, sir. He was willing, and he stated that he would be perfectly willing to talk to us; that he didn\u2019t have any information concerning the location of where the missing person was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">Q. What, if anything, did he tell you concerning an attorney with respect to talking to you about Rusty Marine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>A. He did not [sic<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] say he did not desire an attorney; he didn\u2019t need one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">Q. Did he say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">A. Yes, sir, he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">No questions were asked of Leuschner as to Troy Krause. The sole concern was directed to the missing neighbor Rusty since Leuschner was the last to have seen him. Presumably, little if any connection was known between Leuschner and Troy.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">During this time, Betty Larmore, the paramour with whom appellant resided, came in and was permitted to be with, and talk to, Leuschner. Leuschner relayed his request for the retention of counsel to her.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">\"Q. What, if anything, did they talk about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">A. Mr. Leuschner requested that Betty Jean obtain an attorney for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">Q. Did he indicate to her why he wanted an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">A. Yes, sir, because he did not want to go back to California; that they would have too much to lose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">Q. What, if any, response did Miss Larmore give him at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">A. At that time she said that she couldn\u2019t do anything about getting an attorney due to the day it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-15\">Q. What day was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-16\">A. That was Sunday. However, she would go the next day and attempt to get him one. I believe, I was answering the telephone, but I believe at that time a piece of paper with an attorney\u2019s name was written down and given to Miss Larmore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Q. By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">A. By Mr. Leuschner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">Q. Other than passing the piece of paper to Miss Larmore, did Mr. Leuschner respond in any way to her indication that she would be unable to do anything about an attorney until the next day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">With M\u2019s Larmore still there, the conversation to determine the whereabouts of the missing Rusty resumed. Discrepancies from Leuschner\u2019s previous interviews became apparent but nothing incriminatory or accusatory with regard to Rusty was elicited. Cigarettes, sandwiches and coffee were provided Leuschner around 4:00 o\u2019clock. From that time until 6:00 or 6:30, Lt. Keating, who was called in to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\"... assist in the investigation of a missing person named Rusty Marine\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">participated in the inquiry with the help of TFC Milton Hall. They were also familiar with the missing Krause boy, but again the focus of investigation was only upon Rusty. Out of an abundance of caution, prior to any discussion, they too advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Leuschner never indicated a desire to stop talking about Rusty; but about an hour after Lt. Keating arrived, he recalled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\"Mr. Leuschner said T would like to have an attorney\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Although the police were not yet aware that either of the boys had been criminally abused,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lt. Keating again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>choosing to err, if at all, on the side of prudence, immediately acquiesced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\"Q. What, if anything, did you do when he said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">A. He was sitting right next to the telephone, and I advised him: 'Mr. Leuschner, there\u2019s a telephone. You can call an attorney, or I\u2019ll call one for <em>you.\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>[4]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">A. The telephone was within arm\u2019s reach of him, sitting on the desk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">Q. Did you make any comments to Mr. Leuschner about the telephone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">A. Did I make any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">A. I told him that he could use the telephone to call an attorney, or I would call one for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">Q. Did he make any effort to use the telephone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-14\">Q. Did he ask you to call an attorney for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-15\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Q. Did he make any effort to use the telephone directory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">Q. What, if anything, occurred after you advised him that he could use the telephone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">A. He said he wanted to talk to Betty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Betty Larmore was in the next room and was immediately brought in. Appellant voluntarily continued his conversation without the instigation of any further questions being asked by the officers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">\"Q. How long did he talk to Betty Larmore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">A. Fifteen, twenty minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">Q. Were you present in the room when he talked to Betty Larmore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">Q. Do you know what they talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">A. When she came into the room, I didn\u2019t get all the conversation, but he did ask her if she would contact an attorney or had she contacted an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">Q. Do you recall what she responded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\">A. No, I don\u2019t believe I can say what she said. She might have mentioned the name of an attorney, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Although Trpr. Hall\u2019s testimony indicated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-18\">.. he did not desire to talk any further; he wanted to contact an attorney\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">Lt. Keating\u2019s testimony was clearly and pointedly that he did not express any desire to terminate the inquiry,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-20\">\"Q. Did he ever at any time during that two or two and a half hours indicate at any time a desire to cut off questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-21\">A. No, sir.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>but neither did he express a desire to continue. He simply kept right on talking.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\"Q. After he talked to Miss Larmore, what, if anything, occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">A. He just kept carrying on general conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Q. With whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">A. With Trooper Hall and myself, and Betty was in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">Q. How did the conversation get started?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">A. He just kept talking that he didn\u2019t know anything about Rusty Marine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">Q. How long a period of time transpired from the time he stated that he would like an attorney to the point where he started talking again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">A. The conversation never stopped. It was just a continuous conversation with Betty when she came in, and he\u2019d speak to myself or Trooper Hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">Q. Did the conversation get back to the subject of Rusty Marine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">Q. Did it ever leave the subject of Rusty Marine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-17\">Q. Between the time that Mr. Leuschner stated that he would like an attorney and the next time that he said anything to a Police Officer, did either you or Trooper Hall or any other Police Officer ask him any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-18\">A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">But perhaps because of the discrepancies in Leuschner\u2019s narrations, Trpr. Hornung, who was also participating in the search for Rusty, asked Leuschner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-20\">\".. . if he had any knowledge of the whereabouts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Rusty, and at one point in the conversation I asked him if he would be willing to take a polygraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">Q. About what time of day was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">A. That would have been some time after 7:30 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">Q. What, if any, response did he make to your suggestion concerning the polygraph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">A. He said that before he would submit to a polygraph examination he would have to discuss it with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">Q. Did he indicate why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">A. No, he just said that he did not... it was not his desire to take a polygraph without first consulting with an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">As a consequence nothing more was said to him about such a test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">\"Q. Did you say anything further to him at that time or thereafter concerning a lie detector test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">And the day concluded by appellant being taken before a district court commissioner for charging on the fugitive warrant where once again he was provided his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">These were the references made by appellant expressing a desire for counsel. In the first instance he restricted his request solely to the fugitive charge and volunteered to help with the search for the missing boy, Rusty Marine. The officers honored the second more general request by refraining from questioning further and by offering assistance in procuring counsel. Appellant, instead of accepting the officers\u2019 assistance, preferred to talk again with Betty whom he had commissioned to get him counsel for the fugitive charge which she expressed an inability to do because it was the Sabbath. Prognosticating this precise possibility, it will be recalled, <em>Miranda </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\">\"If the individual cannot obtain an attorney <em>and </em>he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>indicates that he wants one before speaking to police, they must respect his decision to remain silent.\u201d 384 U.S. at 474 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">But Leuschner did <em>not </em>indicate that he wanted counsel before speaking further to the police. On the contrary, without any prompting, appellant\u2019s continued conversation of the subject under inquiry, both to Betty Larmore in the presence of the police and to the police, belied any inference that he was exercising his Fifth Amendment right. As in <em>North Carolina v. Butler, supra, </em>there was no doubt that appellant had been adequately, effectively, and frequently apprised of his rights; the only question was whether his conduct waived them. The test was first espoused in <em>Carnley v. Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516 (1962), and quoted in <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\" 'The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Here, as in <em>Butler, </em>the actions and words of the appellant clearly implied a knowing and intelligent waiver of the rights of which he was repeatedly advised and from his extraordinary past experience must have been keenly cognizant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Having found so clear a waiver of counsel, we note in passing that it is questionable whether Leuschner was entitled to counsel (regarding the missing Marine boy) at the time of his request. Throughout that entire day there was no crime known for which Leuschner could have been focused upon as a suspect. The Sixth Amendment right is a right of an accused, at least in jeopardy of a portending criminal proceeding. <em>Escobedo </em>extended the right from one formally accused <em>(Massiah, supra) </em>to one focused upon as a suspect. No case has yet provided the right as constitutionally available upon a missing person inquiry, absent knowledge that a crime has been committed. If that were the law, not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>would legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement be \"unjustfully fettered\u201d (as concerned Justice Harlan in <em>Escobedo), </em>public protection would, in manacles and leg irons, be itself imprisoned. But even if he were entitled to counsel in regard to the missing Rusty Marine,, presumably even the police had made no connection between Leuschner and Troy Krause; no suspicion was expressed or indicated by even a single question.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">It would be judicially naive to infer that the police had not focused their attention upon appellant in regard to Rusty, especially in light of Leuschner\u2019s record; however, the investigation could hardly turn accusatory, even as to Rusty, until some knowledge that a crime has been committed is apparent to the police. That precise point</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\"when the process shifts from investigatory to accusatory ... our adversary system begins to operate ....\u201d <em>Escobedo, supra </em>at 492.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\n<em>psychological stimulation or psychological coercion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The next day, Monday, October 31, 1979, appellant was brought from the jail where he had been confined as a fugitive, back to the barracks for further questioning. He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights which he acknowledged having previously heard and that he understood them. During this interview Lt. Keating was advised that Rusty Marine\u2019s body had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Leuschner was told but, still indicating that he didn\u2019t know anything about it, expressed disbelief. Perhaps to convince him,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\"[w]e talked it over, Sgt. Luce and myself, and it was my opinion that Mr. Leuschner didn\u2019t believe anything we were telling him, and I thought if we took him down there and showed him that the body had been recovered, then he\u2019d know that we knew what we were talking about or telling the truth\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">perhaps because now the commission of a crime by someone had surfaced and suspicion focused on appellant, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>taken to the scene. The reaction of appellant, now that it was known that a crime had been committed, was itself sufficient to focus suspicion upon him as an accused even absent his record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\"He had, by the time I saw him, had seen the body, and had become very upset, physically upset. I turned him away from the body at that time and attempted to calm him for several minutes. We left very shortly thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Prudently, if not necessarily, no questions were posed at this time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\"Q. Did you ask him any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">Q. Did he say anything of an incriminatory nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">A. No, sir. He was just very shaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Upon returning to the barracks appellant was permitted to stop by his trailer and ask Betty Larmore to come with him. She arrived a little after he did, and upon her entry into the room appellant told her, in the presence of Hall and Keating, that \"he had taken Rusty\u201d. He continued to talk with Betty for five or ten minutes and was then asked by police if he would give them a statement. <em>Miranda </em>rights were repeated <em>and appellant then signed a waiver form, </em>witnessed by Betty Larmore, prior to giving the statement. Indeed, appellant himself typed part of his statement which described that which he had done to Rusty Marine culminating in the boy\u2019s murder. To this point, still no inquiry had been made with regard to Troy Krause with whom we are here concerned, and when Leuschner was now asked about him, upon concluding the Rusty Marine confession, he at first denied any knowledge and again asked to see Betty Larmore.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">\n<em>the case we are considering</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Now that the police were aware that Rusty had been murdered by Leuschner, in light of the content of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>confession, he was apparently suspected of similarly disposing of the missing Troy Krause. After talking to Betty Larmore, he called for Lt. Keating and asked him, not for a lawyer, nor to recant his former <em>Miranda </em>waiver, but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">\"if Betty could give information with reference to Troy Krause, would she be entitled to the $5,000 reward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">This conduct itself indicates that even at this crucial juncture in the extrajudicial proceedings, the experienced and court-wise accused was capable of conniving for additional benefits as prerequisite to further confession. When the Lieutenant replied that he had no control over the reward offer, appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\"turned to Betty and said words to the effect that T took him, too.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\"When he said that, Betty sort of cried out 'No, you didn\u2019t\u2019 or 'You couldn\u2019t.\u2019 He said 'Yes, I took him.\u2019 He started telling me in her presence what had happened, where he picked him up on the road, and the boy wanted a ride to the YMCA, and as soon as the boy got in the truck he made a right turn, he didn\u2019t know the name of the road. He said shortly thereafter he made another right turn and came to a place where he could pull off the side of the road. He got out of the truck, and he said he could see the roof of an old home or a large home which was red. The roof was red. He said he couldn\u2019t see the whole house, he could just see part of the roof. He said he pulled the boy out of the truck and tied his hands and took him a short distance in the woods, approximately fifty yards and had sex with him. He said he held his hand over his mouth, and when he left the boy was laying on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">I questioned him, too, as to whether the boy was dead or alive, and he said he didn\u2019t know; that he was just laying there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Appellant then agreed to help the police locate Troy and they left the barracks guided by appellant\u2019s direction. They found nothing and returned just before midnight. Precipitously appellant was presented to a commissioner and charged with the murder of Rusty Marine.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The next morning Lt. Keating, Trpr. Lewis, Betty Larmore (whom they picked up at her home) and Leuschner again \"rode around\u201d, presumably with Leuschner trying to recall where he had left Troy. Leuschner, apparently recalling the polygraph discussion the previous day, asked then to take the test</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\"to see if it would assist him and help, and he wanted to do everything he could to locate the Krause boy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellant was then taken to the Easton barracks for the polygraph test, after which he was returned to Salisbury for a bond review before \"Judge Dallas\u201d of the District Court there. Judge Dallas not only advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\"[h]e advised him not to talk to the police or anyone about this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The next day, Wednesday, November 2nd, appellant was taken back to Easton to continue his polygraph examination. The examiner again advised appellant of his rights,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\"at which time Mr. Leuschner advised me that he was familiar with the rights and further that he had been advised by Judge Dallas to not to talk to the police and not to take any type of test; however, he wished to clear this matter up; he wished to help locate the body of Troy Krause; and therefore elected to continue with the test and to continue discussing the matter with the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Appellant even had the police try to find him a hypnotist to help him remember the location where he had left Troy, but they were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Upon returning from Easton, Leuschner rode with Betty in the back seat. That night Betty called the officers and told them that appellant had given her exact directions to Troy\u2019s body. Two officers went with Betty; two others brought appellant into a woods on a farm in the area. Finally, midmorning (Thursday, November 3rd) Troy\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the early afternoon an arrest warrant was obtained and, in the presence of a public defender who had recently appeared for appellant, was served upon him. He was promptly presented before the district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">From our review of the circumstances it is clear, especially in regard to the Troy Krause crime, when appellant requested counsel on October 30th, appellant had not been focused upon as an accused sufficiently to trigger his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Escobedo, supra. </em>But even if that were not so, it is equally clear from his words and conduct that before confessing or even before a single question was asked regarding Troy Krause, appellant, in writing, waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Butler, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>peripheral Miranda issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Although appellant contends that the Krause confession was inadmissible because the <em>Miranda </em>advisements were not given between the conclusion of his statement on Rusty Marine and the commencement of his admissions as to Troy Krause, we think the contention a specious one. Having obviously argued that the two were \"connected in appellant\u2019s mind\u201d \u2014 a premise to which we had to accede simply to address the foregoing concerns \u2014 he can hardly now be heard to argue that the dozen or so warnings given and the waiver signed just prior thereto, were not valid, recalled and clearly understood by appellant. Under the circumstances of this case, the waiver was so interrelated by time and circumstance, <em>Miranda </em>warnings having been repeatedly given by the same interrogators, there was no requirement nor legitimate purpose to be served by again administering them. <em>Smith v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 577, 587 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 748 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 909 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Finally, in the <em>Miranda </em>regard, appellant contends that because no fugitive warrant was obtained pursuant to Md. Code, Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 28A, his initial arrest was illegal and the statements were inadmissible as the fruit of such illegality. Appellant having failed to raise this below has for practical purposes waived it on appeal. Md. Rules 736 and 1085.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u2014 traditional concepts of voluntariness \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>Betty Larmore</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Because appellant asserts the contrary, we preface this issue by noting that the admissibility of the statements made by appellant to Betty Larmore, his paramour, is not subject to constitutional standards of voluntariness. There is no contention that Betty Larmore was a police agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In <em>Brown v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 462, 472-473 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 722 (1971), we found no fault even with permitting an officer to testify to that which he had overheard spoken between two inmates in a contrived setting in jail. We noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\"Here it is clear that the incriminating statements were not the product of any sort of coercion, legal or factual, physical or psychological. The conversations of Brown and Montgomery were wholly voluntary. Nothing said by either was prompted, inspired or solicited by Elliott [the undercover policeman] nor was it caused by or the result of any questioning of either by the officer. On the contrary the evidence is that he never even spoke to them. They simply talked without threat, promise or inducement on the part of the authorities in such circumstances that what they said could be overheard. Elliott, in a position to overhear, was under no obligation to close his ears. As the Court said in <em>Hoffa </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 293 (1966)], <em>supra, </em>at 303, quoting with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>approval the words of the dissenting opinion in <em>Lopez v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, at 465:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">'The risk of being overheard by an eavesdropper or betrayed by an informer or deceived as to the identity of one with whom one deals is probably inherent in the conditions of human society. It is the kind of risk we necessarily assume whenever we speak.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">We hold that the receipt of Elliott\u2019s testimony with regard to the conversations of Brown and Montgomery did not violate the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. See <em>Jefferson v. State, </em>228 Md. 331.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Even if the cell into which Brown and Montgomery went to converse be considered a constitutionally protected area, Elliott did not intrude therein physically and there was no electronic bugging. Nor was he in any sense a trespasser by his position in the tier aisle when he overheard the conversations. The Supreme Court said in <em>Hoffa, </em>at 302: 'Neither this Court nor any member of it has ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amendment protects a wrongdoer\u2019s misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it.\u2019 Certainly then, it cannot protect the wrongdoer voluntarily confiding his wrongdoing in such a manner that he can be overheard by a third person legally in a position to overhear. See also <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 206.\u201d 10 Md. App. at 472-474.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">See also <em>Leuschner v. State, </em>41 Md. App. at 429-434, <em>cert. denied, </em>285 Md. 731 (April 23, 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 933 (October 29, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The exclusionary rule is simply not applicable as to the statements made to Betty Larmore either in the presence of the officers or out of their hearing; but because we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>affirm the use of appellant\u2019s confessions to the police, that ruling is hardly necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\n<em>the viewing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellant contends that the first inculpatory statement he made to Betty Larmore and the police regarding Rusty Marine, i.e., that \"he had taken Rusty\u201d, was the involuntary product of a psychological coercion emanating from the graveside viewing of Rusty Marine\u2019s body, and as such was inadmissible. See <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 36 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002 (1977). Quoting <em>Combs v. State, </em>237 Md. 428, 435-436 (1965), he proceeds to reason that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\"where one confession is held to be involuntary and inadmissible, the State must overcome a presumption that the improper influence which produced the first confession is still in effect until a cessation of that influence is definitely shown, and the evidence to overcome and rebut such a presumption must be clear, strong and satisfactory, and any doubt on this point resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">While appellant alleges several factors contributing to the \"psychological coercion\u201d, he discusses but one \u2014 \"the act of taking appellant to the grave of Rusty Marine and showing him the body\u201d, aggravated by \"continuous questioning\u201d. He contends that the six sessions on the first day of arrest (consuming approximately the same number of hours of interrogation) culminating in the act intending to shock a confession from the accused the following morning, must, in combination, be seen as psychologically coercive. He relies primarily upon a series of cases in other jurisdictions which have considered viewings of victims\u2019 corpses and \"found that this technique, which seems always promptly to produce a confession, renders that confession involuntary. <em>See e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>State v. Peterson, </em>75 A.2d 368 (Maine 1950); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crittenden, </em>36 So. 2d 645 (La. 1948); <em>Williams v. State, </em>22 So. 2d (Fla. 1945); <em>Cavazos v. State, </em>172 S.W.2d 348 (Tex. 1943).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We note initially that the mere viewing alone is by no means sufficient \"coercion\u201d to induce an accused to confess involuntarily. That which was viewed, of course, was the subject matter of the crime, the commission of which we will assume appellant was by then suspect. Showing him evidence of the subject matter was obviously intended by the police to elicit information, an investigative technique which has become a \"standard procedure of interrogation\u201d condoned by this Court in <em>Vines v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 658 (1978), and the Court of Appeals affirming in <em>Vines v. State, </em>285 Md. 369 (1979). See opinion dissenting on <em>Miranda </em>grounds in 40 Md. App. at 672. In that case, Jasper Vines was convicted of possession of heroin. The heroin contained in tinfoil packets, the subject matter of that crime, had been legally obtained under warrant from Vines\u2019 home and was displayed by the police to Vines, after he had invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights, to elicit an inculpatory admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">This Court and the Court of Appeals both condoned that police procedure, holding that it neither violated <em>Miranda </em>nor consisted of involuntary psychological coercion. In regard to the issue of voluntariness in the traditional sense, our majority\u2019s reasoning was adopted by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\" 'It is not disputed that shortly before making the inculpatory disclosure, [Vines] had been fully apprised of his right to remain silent and that anything he said might be used against him in a court of law. It is also undisputed that he understood those rights. <em>Merely because the police entertained the hope (not expressed to [Vines]) that the display of narcotics would produce an incriminating statement does not mean that in allowing [Vines] to view the display they were improperly compelling, coercing, or inducing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>[Vines] to speak.\u2019... Vines, </em>40 Md. App. at 661.\u201d <em>Vines v. State, </em>285 Md. at 380-381 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Because of the western world\u2019s ingrained belief in the sanctity of human life, the viewing of a child\u2019s cadaver recently exposed in a shallow grave is psychologically more grotesque than a viewing of heroin recently possessed by an accused; but both viewings are purposed to the same end, <em>i.e., </em>to elicit a confession. The viewing procedure itself is not conclusive of involuntariness, <em>Vines, supra. </em>A victim\u2019s remains would no more coerce, compel or improperly induce an innocent person to confess to a murder that he did not commit than a heroin display would coerce, compel or improperly induce an innocent person to confess to owning narcotics that he had not possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Of course, the statement in <em>Kidd, supra, </em>relied on by appellant, that a confession may be rendered involuntary by either psychological or physical coercion is constitutionally supported by any number of Supreme Court opinions. <em>E.g., Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199 (1960); <em>Fikes v. Alabama, </em>352 U.S. 191 (1957); <em>Watts v. Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49 (1949) separate opinion; <em>Upshaw </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 410 (1948). The contemporary responsibility of law enforcement officers to use more sophisticated methods of extracting confessions makes our review of the circumstances surrounding a confession more difficult because of the more delicate judgments to be made. <em>Spano </em>v. <em>New York, </em>360 U.S. 315, 321 (1959). Thus, the range of inquiry in this type of case must be broad and the Supreme Court insists that the judgment in each instance be based upon the \"totality of circumstances\u201d. <em>Blackburn, supra </em>at 206. Whether psychological coercion exists depends not only on a circumstance of pressure exerted but the effect of that pressure vis-a-vis the power of resistance of the person confessing. <em>Fikes, supra, </em>at 197.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\"What would be overpowering to the weak of will or mind might be utterly ineffective against an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>experienced criminal.\u201d <em>Stein v. New York, </em>346 U.S. 156, 185 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">And as we conduct our independent review of the record, mandated by the Supreme Court, see <em>Walker v. State, </em>12 Md. App. at 694, we are not restricted to that which is revealed at the suppression hearing prior to admission of the confession but may \u2014 and should \u2014 review the record in its entirety from stem to stern.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\"... [W]e reject the notion that the scope of our review can be thus restricted. Where the involuntariness of a confession is conclusively demonstrated at any stage of a trial, the defendant is deprived of due process by entry of judgment of conviction without exclusion of the confession.\u201d <em>Blackburn, supra </em>at 210.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Obviously then, if such review is mandated from the defendant\u2019s view, the sauce for the goose is so for the gander as well. If we are to review the entire record for circumstances indicative of involuntariness, we should range that far in the record for evidence of voluntariness as well. Justice is (or should be) concerned with the truth, whether it convicts or exonerates. In this case such latitude will help us to determine whether appellant is one \"weak of will or mind\u201d easily overpowered by psychological pressures or whether he is \"an experienced criminal\u201d against which such devices would be \"utterly ineffective\u201d. At the time of this review we know from information derived at sentencing, as well as testified to in the suppression hearing, that Leuschner had been thrice convicted of violent crimes prior to his conviction in this case. Beyond that, he was convicted of nonviolent crimes and was a fugitive from California justice. He is, as pointed out by the trial judge, and as indicated above, court-wise and experienced in the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">In the light of that experience, we then look at the circumstances giving rise to the confession, <em>Bram v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>States, </em>168 U.S. 532 (1897).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is presumably no restriction upon factors that may be considered but the cases generally have emphasized those which should not be overlooked. These include: 1) the accused\u2019s age, <em>Spano, supra; Chambers v. Florida, </em>309 U.S. 227 (1940); 2) his character, <em>Harris v. South Carolina, </em>338 U.S. 68 (1949); 3) his record as to former crimes, <em>Spano, Stein </em>and <em>Fikes, </em>all <em>supra; </em>4) educational background, <em>Ward v. Texas, </em>316 U.S. 547 (1942) and <em>Spano, Harris </em>and <em>Fikes, </em>all <em>supra, </em>but see <em>Lisenba v.

Denno, </em>347 U.S. 556 (1954); see also <em>Ward, Blackburn, Spano, Harris </em>and <em>Fikes, </em>all <em>supra, </em>but compare <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443 (1953) and <em>Lisenba, </em>and <em>Stein, </em>both <em>supra, </em>see also comment note 69 L.Ed. 131 \u2014 with deprivation of refreshment, rest or relief, <em>Payne, Watts </em>and <em>Stein, </em>all <em>supra, </em>by relays of interrogators, <em>Fikes, supra, </em>while isolated for a substantial time, <em>ibid, </em>without counsel, friends, relatives or disinterested persons, <em>Blackburn, Spano, Payne, Fikes, Chambers </em>and <em>Harris, </em>all <em>supra; </em>and 11) the failure to warn or apprise the accused of his rights, <em>Payne, Watts, Harris, Turner </em>and <em>Haley, </em>all <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It is important to emphasize that none of these factors standing alone would have been conclusive. In this case, standing alone, no single factor was so dominant even so as to give us pause. The interrogation was not so prolonged or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>unremitting as to place undue physical or mental strain on appellant who was a mature, intelligent and court-wise person, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\"not young, soft, ignorant or timid. [He was] not inexperienced in the ways of crime or its detection, nor [was he] dumb as to [his] rights.\u201d <em>Stein, </em>346 U.S. at 185-186.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">To the contrary, he was reapprised of his rights each time his location or interrogators changed. That there were different interrogators at different times is not sufficient to indicate an overbearing of appellant\u2019s will by \"relays\u201d used to wear him down. See <em>Lisenba, supra. </em>The Supreme Court has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\"never gone so far as to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment requires a one-to-one ratio between interrogators and prisoners, or that extensive questioning of a prisoner automatically makes the evidence he gives in response constitutionally prohibited.\u201d <em>Stein, supra </em>at 185.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Appellant was legally arrested as a fugitive, apprised repeatedly of his rights, granted an opportunity to call an attorney, permitted to see and be with his paramour, uncaged, courteously treated and refreshed by food, drink and tobacco. To preclude a confession obtained by such an interrogation, under these circumstances, is to deny the use of interrogation as a police tool.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\"Interrogation is not inherently coercive, as is physical violence. Interrogation does have social value in solving crime, as physical force does not. By their own answers many suspects clear themselves, and the information they give frequently points out another who is guilty. Indeed, interrogation of those who know something about the facts is the chief means to solution of crime. The duty to disclose knowledge of crime rests upon all citizens. It is so vital that one known to be innocent may be detained, in the absence of bail, as a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>witness. This Court never has held that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from such detention and interrogation of a suspect as under the circumstances appears reasonable and not coercive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Of course, such inquiries have limits. But the limits are not defined merely by calling an interrogation an 'inquisition,\u2019 which adds to the problem only the emotions inherited from medieval experience. The limits in any case depend upon a weighing of the circumstances of pressure against the power of resistance of the person confessing.\u201d <em>Stein, supra </em>at 184-185 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Nor did the viewing of the victim at the burial scene, alone or in circumstantial context, imply that the appellant\u2019s will was overpowered. As acknowledged in <em>Vines, </em>it was obviously an inducement to a confession by a guilty person, but hardly so to an innocent one.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">So much concludes our response to appellant\u2019s first issue which was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">\"I. The trial court erred in admitting into evidence numerous inculpatory statements made by Appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">a. implicitly ruling that they were voluntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">b. ruling that they were made in compliance with <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">c. overlooking the question of whether they were the product of an illegal arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">The twelve issues that follow require less need for verbosity to address. The issues remaining are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">\"II. The trial court erred in sentencing Appellant to life without parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">III. There was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict that Appellant was sane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>IV. Appellant was denied his constitutional right of confrontation, along with evidentiary and procedural rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">V. The trial court erred in permitting Sgt. Griffith to testify as to statements made by Appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">VI. Appellant was deprived of a fair trial by the prejudicial remarks made by the prosecution in closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">VII. The trial court erred in failing to conduct individual voir dire of the jurors on the issues of prejudicial pretrial publicity and prejudice relating to the defense of insanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">VIII. Appellant was prejudiced by the instructions to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">IX. The evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">X. Appellant was tried on an indictment that was illegal, duplicitous, and insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">XI. Appellant was tried illegally on the 'greater charges\u2019 relating to Troy Krause following their severance from the 'lesser charges\u2019 relating to Russell Marine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">XII. Appellant was illegally tried in violation of Maryland Rule 746.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">XIII. Appellant was denied the adequate assistance of counsel.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">and we shall address them briefly seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">\u2014 the sentence \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">Appellant\u2019s complaint of an illegal mandatory sentence is without foundation. Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (b) provides that any person who has \"served\u201d three separate terms for violent crime convictions, shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole possibilities. His argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that he has not \"served\u201d three sentences because even counting the two rape convictions in California (from which he is a parole fugitive) as being \"served\u201d, the third sentence was for the murder of Rusty Marine. Even if the Rusty Marine sentence requires completion as the third under the statute, however, appellant will not have commenced serving his Krause sentence until that third sentence has been \"served\u201d. The Krause sentence being consecutive so ordains.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u2014 sanity \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Appellant\u2019s attack upon the sufficiency of the evidence to prove appellant sane is merely a questioning of the relative weights that he feels should be given the opinions of the experts who testified. Our review clearly indicates that there was ample from which a factfinder could conclude appellant was sane, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u2014 the psychiatric testimony \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Appellant attempts to seize upon our holding in <em>Gregory v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 297 (1978), that psychiatric reports containing opinions of absent witnesses are improperly admitted over objection in violation of the right of confrontation; however, appellant has waived that claim by failing to make a timely objection below and by having instigated the evidence he now deplores. <em>Leonard v. State, </em>36 Md. App. 385, 387 (1977); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>25 Md. App. 309, 316 (1975). By having opened the door to the staff opinion of Perkins State Hospital through cross-examination, appellant affirmatively waived objection. <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 144 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 1001 (1965); <em>Leuschner v. State, </em>41 Md. App. at 435-436 (1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u2014 the polygraph examiner\u2019s testimony \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">There is no testimony before the jury in the record relating to the polygraph examination. <em>Akonom v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 676 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>284 Md. 741 (1979), as relied upon by appellant, is totally inapposite. See also <em>Mason v. State, </em>44 Md. App. 710 (1980). No issue was raised as to the coercive effect it may have had as a tool of interrogating to psychologically induce a confession. See <em>Johnson v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 303 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u2014 prejudicial closing argument \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Appellant has waived any complaint he may have had to the closing argument by failing to object thereto. <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265, 270-271 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u2014 individual voir dire \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Again, appellant\u2019s afterthoughts failed to preserve his complaint for review. His objection made at the conclusion of the trial, to failure of individual voir dire at the commencement of the trial, comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">\u2014 instructions \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Appellant was not merely too late with objection to the instructions regarding the felony-murder law, he failed to enter one. This too waives his right to raise it on appeal. Md. Rule 757 f.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">\u2014 sufficiency of the evidence \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Appellant\u2019s contentions in ' regard to evidentiary sufficiency are predicated upon our holding that the confessions and admissions were inadmissible. We have decided otherwise; the evidence was abundant. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">\u2014 sufficiency of the indictment \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">Appellant has waived the right to challenge the charging document by failure to comply with Md. Rule 736 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u2014 the chicken or the egg \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Appellant contends that he was tried illegally on the \"greater charges\u201d relating to Troy Krause following their severance from the \"lesser charges\u201d relating to Rusty Marine. Again, appellant has waived this argument by failure to raise it below. Md. Rule 1085. Furthermore, we are not quite certain why, of these separate crimes, one is greater and the other lesser. The rationale of the case cited, <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21 (1974), is, if apposite, lost to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u2014 Md. Rule 746 \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Again, the question of compliance with Md. Rule 746 (or of a speedy trial right) was not made below and is waived here. The rule was only mandatory after July 25, 1979 in any case. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 336 (1979). Appellant was tried on June 19 and 20 of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u2014 competency of counsel \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">We have traditionally held that competency of counsel is a question best left to post conviction procedures although we can review the record if it is propitiously raised and decided below. See <em>Turner v. State, </em>45 Md. App. 168 (1980). Appellant voiced his complaint at the close of all the evidence and prior to instructions to the jury; however, even if the court having observed counsel\u2019s conduct could have made a valid judgment, all the facts were not in. In the first instance, how can one judge competency of counsel at that point until the case has been decided? Had the verdict been in appellant\u2019s favor, he would hardly have condemned success.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">More practically, however, such an issue places the attorney on trial and the better practice is to permit him to explain whether the questioned judgments he has made were tactical or not. Furthermore, a trial judge as factfinder is then given an opportunity whether to believe such explanations. We will leave that issue for a procedure better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>equipped to decide it initially. <em>White v. State, 17 </em>Md. App. 58, 64 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>268 Md. 754 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-12\">. \"[A]dmissions or confessions ... when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence ....\u201d Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 596 (1896).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1A\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\">. Underscoring appellant\u2019s legal acumen is a handwritten, well organized and perceptive \"Supplemental Brief\u2019 submitted to his appellate attorney along with a critique of that counsel\u2019s brief as previously filed. While there is no provision in our law recognizing the right to file a per se brief supplementing an already filed obviously competent and indeed superior brief by counsel, we acknowledge it as supporting our determination from the record that Mr. Leuschner is legally knowledgeable and practically sophisticated in the judicial processes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-17\">. It is apparent from a contextual reading of the record that the word \"not\u201d was inadvertent either on the part of the witness or the stenographer. The meaning was abundantly clear and expressed elsewhere that Leuschner did not want an attorney for any purpose except the fugitive charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\">. Until the next day the police did not know if the boys were alive or dead, safe or sound, restrained or free, or simply run-a-ways. The police were simply seeking information about one of the boy\u2019s whereabouts from the last person known to have seen him. Although it is apparent that the police had more than a passing interest in Leuschner and obviously had some suspicion that he was not disclosing all he knew about the missing Rusty, in a criminal sense he was not focused upon as an accused. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964). Had Leuschner not been lawfully in custody as a fugitive, he could not have been held or charged as an accused in the absence of some probable cause by the police to believe he had committed a crime. While one may be a suspect in an investigatory sense, he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>hardly bo focused upon as an accused until a crime with which he might have been connected is known to have been committed \u2014 by someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">But we are reciting the \"particular facts and circumstances\u201d upon which waiver must be decided if a criminal investigation had begun to focus on the accused. We will continue selectively to set out the testimony of what transpired, keeping in mind, however, the \"fact\u201d that there is as yet no crime known to the police as to either boy \u2014 there not having even been a question asked regarding Troy. Consequently, appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right \"to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense\u201d had not come to fruition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b357-18\">4. It should be noted that no case has as yet placed the burden of <em>providing </em>counsel upon the police. It is the denial of a request to permit an accused to contact counsel that violates the constitution, Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433 (1958), and Lt. Keating obviously provided ample opportunity and assistance to effect that purpose. Nor is there a per se rule as appellant would urge upon us that the police must terminate any contact with an accused unless counsel is present, once a request for counsel is made. Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96 (1975). It is unlikely that Maryland would follow the dissent in Mosley, as urged by appellant, since Maryland does not go that far even <em>after </em>indictment. State v. Blizzard, 278 Md. 556 (1976), but see Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b359-21\">. Whether or not appellant expressly exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege as well as his Sixth Amendment right, the trial judge believed the testimony that no further questions were asked, and we find no reason to believe the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\">. As pointed out in appellee\u2019s brief, the record indicates compliance with the statute in any case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">. See also Clewis v. Texas, 386 U.S. 707 (1967); United States v. Bayer, 331 U.S. 532, 540 (1947); Jackson v. State, 209 Md. 390 (1956); Edwards v. State, 194 Md. 387 (1950); Fried v. State, 42 Md.

Ohio, 332 U.S. 596 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\">. Appellant also attempted by footnote to raise a constitutional attack on the statute. We have chosen the same means to apprise him that we will not address that constitutional question since it was not raised and decided below, von Lusch v. State, 279 Md. 255, 262-263 (1977); Vuitch v. State, 10 Md.
