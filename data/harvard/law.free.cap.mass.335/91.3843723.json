The defendants Keneklis and Colonial Spa, Inc., filed objections to the master\u2019s report, which stand as exceptions (Rule 90 of the Superior Court [1954]), excepted to and appealed from the interlocutory decree confirming the report and overruling the exceptions, and appealed from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">The master found that the individual defendants admitted their liability. Sergio\u2019s answer set up a claim to fifty of the one hundred shares of the corporate defendant and averred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Ms willingness to have them applied to the debt against him. The master found that the defendant Keneklis is the owner of record of nmety of the subject shares and that he had agreed to give Sergio fifty of them (the body of the report shows that this was for substantial consideration in connection with the joint venture in wMch the indebtedness to the plaintiff was incurred), that Keneklis then \u201cwould have owned forty shares and possibly controlled the remaining ten shares . . . wMch then stood in the name of Ms brother, Peter Keneklis,\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201chas the right to reach and apply ninety shares of the . . . stock . . . .\u201d The final decree directed that, if the stated amount due and costs should not be paid by the individual defendants withm twenty days, all right, title and interest, legal or equitable, wMch they had at the time of the service of process upon them to the one hundred shares should be sold and the proceeds applied to the commissioner\u2019s costs and then to the debt, and that the balance if any should be paid to the individual defendants equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Keneklis and the corporate defendant objected to the refusal of the master to strike from the report evidence which supported the finchng that Keneklis had agreed to give Sergio fifty of the shares on the ground that Sergio\u2019s answer in this respect \u201cis in effect a separate action . . . and therefore an improper pleading.\u201d There is notMng in tMs. Sergio was a proper party not only as a principal debtor but also as the claimant of an mterest in the shares sought to be reached. Had Keneklis been the only debtor and Sergio not been joined originally the latter could have mtervened to set up the claim which he stated in Ms answer. \u201cOne common occasion for intervention arises when a court of equity has taken into its control property as to which the intervener claims a lien or other interest. In such a case the court has ancillary jurisdiction to determine, protect and enforce the claim of the inter-vener.\u201d <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>290 Mass. 560, 563-564. Whether or not Sergio\u2019s claim was witMn the intent of the first sentence of Rule.32 of the Superior Court (1954) (\u201cThe an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>swer . . . must set up any counterclaim, against any one or more of the parties, arising out of the transaction which is the subject matter of the suit, which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity\u201d), we think that, apart from this rule, he had a right and an obligation to assert his claim in this suit to which he was a party, a purpose of which was to determine Keneklis\u2019s ownership of the shares. Under Rule 32, a \u201csubject matter of the suit\u201d so far as it is of equitable cognizance is the question of the ownership of the shares, and where as here the claim is so surely within the apparent intent of the rule, we do not think that inaptness of the word \u201ctransaction\u201d is controlling. \u201cThe word \u2018transaction\u2019 in this rule should be construed in a sense \u2018to effectuate the settlement in one proceeding of controversies so closely connected as appropriately to be combined in one trial in order to prevent duplication of testimony, to avoid unnecessary expense to the parties and to the public, and to expedite the adjudication of suits. . . .\u2019 <em>Potier </em>v. A. <em>W. Perry, Inc. </em>286 Mass. 602, 608.\u201d <em>Davis &amp; O\u2019Connor Co. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. Inc. </em>311 Mass. 401, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The objection that there is no evidence to support the finding that Keneklis is the owner of stock in the corporation cannot be considered. The master was requested to make a summary of the evidence, but there is no showing that the evidence was taken by a stenographer under Rule 90 of the Superior Court (1954), nor was there a special order of the court under that rule that such summary be made. <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>313 Mass. 531, 533-534. There was no appeal from or exception to the denial of the motion of Keneklis and Colonial Spa, Inc., to recommit which in effect asked for such a special order. In any event its disallowance does not appear to have been an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The master\u2019s report is insufficient to support the provision of the final decree for the sale of the ten shares standing in the name of Peter Keneklis. The decree must be modified to order the sale of only the ninety shares standing in the name of the defendant James Keneklis (also referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>James T. Keneklis) and the division of any surplus proceeds in the proportion of five ninths to the defendant Sergio and four ninths to the defendant Keneklis.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The interlocutory decree is affirmed. The final decree is to be modified in accordance with' the opinion and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
