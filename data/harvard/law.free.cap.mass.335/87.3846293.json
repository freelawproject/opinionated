[the plaintiff] in the barbering business for a period of four years nor within a radius of four miles of 1159 Broadway, Somerville,\u201d and \u201cnot to accept employment with any other barber\u201d within that time and area.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The case was referred to a master who found that the defendant within seven months of the sale had opened a barber shop, which was one and seven eighths miles in a straight fine and two and one half miles along the shortest travelled route from the plaintiff\u2019s shop, that none of the defendant\u2019s former customers had followed the defendant to his new place of business, and that \u201cThere was no evidence that the business of the plaintiff suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s opening of his barber shop-\u201d He found also that the defendant\u2019s business is not competitive with the plaintiff\u2019s business, and that \u201cIn So far as it is a question of fact ... a restraint if limited to a radius of one mile and enforced within that space would be sufficient to protect the plaintiff.\u201d He also \u201crecommended that the negative covenant ... be modified to a radius of one mile and that the bill of the plaintiff be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The master\u2019s report was confirmed. The final decree, entered March 22, 1956, enjoined the defendant \u201cfrom engaging in the barbering business . . . within a radius of two miles of 1159 Broadway, Somerville ... for a period of three years next succeeding the date of the entry of this decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The defendant\u2019s appeal from this decree must be sustained. There is nothing to show that the factual conclusion of the master as to the extent of the competitive area was wrong; there is no basis for a different conclusion. <em>Perry </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Oliver, </em>317 Mass. 538, 538. It is well established that a \u201ccontract in restraint of trade in which the territory is unreasonably extensive may be divisible as to space and enforced in equity within a reasonable area. <em>Edgecomb </em>v. <em>Edmonston, </em>257 Mass. 12.\u201d <em>Whiting Milk Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>277 Mass. 570, 574. <em>Cedric G.
