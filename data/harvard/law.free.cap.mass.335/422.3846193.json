A jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Under leave reserved, the trial judge entered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff excepted. The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The plaintiff was employed as a plumber at premises to which the defendant was about to deliver a boiler section, about six feet wide, six and a half feet long, and eight to ten inches thick, and weighing seven hundred fifty pounds. This \"had been purchased by\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s employer. A vice-president of the defendant called the plaintiff by telephone at about noon on the day of the accident to say that the boiler was coming about 4:30 that afternoon, if the plaintiff \"would be there and have a couple of men there.\u201d The plaintiff said he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The boiler section, \u201cstanding on its edge,\u201d arrived on a truck operated by one Crawford, an employee of the defendant. Crawford backed the truck up to the sidewalk near a \"full-sized\u201d door to the building. The door was about three feet from the curbstone and opened on a platform about three feet wide which led to a stairway, six feet wide, of five steps to the basement. The plaintiff was there with two other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">The truck driver produced skid boards and the plaintiff\u2019s two men and Crawford together laid the boiler section flat, brought it to the rear of the truck and skidded it to the door of the cellarway without touching the sidewalk, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the assistance of a rope threaded through a rack in front of the truck and tied by Crawford to the boiler section by passing the rope through a hole on the top and then through the chimney hole. The rope was used by Crawford as a winch to ease the section down the skids. The boiler section was then tipped on end and pulled through the door by Crawford and the two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The plaintiff testified that he did not participate, but \u201cwas just standing there, watching them, supervising them,\u201d and that he \u201cwas instructing them, how to put it in.\u201d He assented in substance to the description of himself in a question on cross-examination as the \u201csuperintendent of the operation.\u201d He was satisfied that the boiler section would go down the stairs all right if \u201cthe rope would hold it,\u201d and admitted he saw to it that the rope was all right before they started but \u201chad nothing to do with the tying of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The plaintiff further testified that Crawford then took a skid from the truck, put it on the cellar stairs, and began to slide the boiler section down the skid, easing the section down the stairs with the rope which was still threaded through the truck rack and tied to the boiler section. When the section was about three feet from the plaintiff, he \u201csaw the knot become untied and the section slid down the stairs \u201d and injured the plaintiff, who was \u201cstanding on the next to the last step, on the cellar stairs.\u201d There was no evidence of any tying of the knot after Crawford first tied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">There was no evidence presented by either party as to the terms of the delivery agreement. The defendant\u2019s vice-president testified that he knew of no arrangements as to where the boiler was to be delivered. The defendant, he said, was a wholesaler and, on wholesale deliveries, made \u201ctailboard delivery.\u201d This term means that where, as in the present case, there is no loading platform, they lower the \u201clittle elevator called the tailboard gate up to the sidewalk.\u201d The witness further testified that the defendant only delivers \u201ceither tailboard or sidewalk, whichever is more convenient for that truck, never in a man\u2019s house or a cellar or place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The evidence relating to the extent of the defendant\u2019s responsibility with respect to delivery of the boiler section beyond the sidewalk or the tailboard of the truck is meager.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury did not have to believe the testimony of the defendant\u2019s vice-president that the usual extent of the defendant\u2019s obligation on items sold by it as wholesaler was \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>sidewalk\u201d or \"tailboard\u201d delivery. However, this disbelief does not constitute proof of a greater obligation. See <em>Trott </em>v. <em>Yankee Network, Inc., ante, </em>9, 14. The presence of the plaintiff with two men to assist him and his testimony that he was superintendent of the operation show that some responsibility was assumed, in behalf of the plaintiff\u2019s employer, for getting the boiler section off the truck and into the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We think, however, that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding by the jury that the defendant at least undertook to contribute Crawford, its driver, and the equipment which he had with him for use in the task of unloading. This can be inferred from the noonday telephone call between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s vice-president, from the active participation of Crawford in the work, and from the fact that he arrived at the premises with, and used, the boards. The jury were warranted also, in the light of the telephone conversation, in concluding that Crawford was acting in normal furtherance of the defendant\u2019s business, in selecting the method of unloading which he did, going only slightly beyond the sidewalk or tailboard delivery which the defendant\u2019s vice-president had testified was customary. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Croteau, </em>322 Mass. 291, 293-294; <em>Giacomuzzi </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>324 Mass. 689, 691; Restatement: Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229; Harper and James, Law of Torts (1956 ed.) \u00a7 26.7. See also <em>Peay </em>v. <em>Reidy, </em>321 Mass. 455, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he was supervising the operation does not require the conclusion that Crawford be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>came for the time being the servant of the plaintiff (compare <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>317 Mass. 721, 723-724) or of the plaintiff\u2019s employer, but presented a question of fact for the jury. See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>159 Mass. 570; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>181 Mass. 416, 418-420; <em>Oulighan </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>189 Mass. 287, 290. Compare <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Association, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 135, 141-147. See also Restatement: Agency, \u00a7 476. That testimony could be reasonably interpreted by the jury as showing merely (a) that the plaintiff was directing the group in ail matters affecting his employer\u2019s interest, as, for example, where to place the boiler and in the route to be followed and (b) that the plaintiff himself was not actually participating in the physical work. It certainly does not require a finding that the plaintiff either could control, or purported to control, Crawford in the details of the unloading process and in the use of the equipment brought with him. The issue of the existence and extent of control was one of fact for the jury. Compare <em>Enga </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>315 Mass. 120, 122-123, and cases cited. The jury would be warranted in finding that the plaintiff and his two associates (in behalf of the plaintiff\u2019s employer), and Crawford (in behalf of the defendant) were engaged together in the unloading process on a basis in which Crawford owed a duty to exercise ordinary care for the safety of each other member of the group. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Dunton, </em>284 Mass. 63, 66-67.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The testimony with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s authority to supervise the work of Crawford was not so definite as to show that, as a matter of law, he was guilty of contributory negligence in failing to check the knot, with the tying of which, by Crawford, the plaintiff had nothing to do. Different inferences could be drawn from the evidence and it could have been found that the plaintiff\u2019s precautions for his own safety were reasonable (see <em>Runnells </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Mass. 128, 129-131). This is not a case where the facts relied on to show that the defendant was negligent (here that the knot became untied) equally tend to show that the plaintiff was negligent. Compare <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Hagen-Burger, </em>327 Mass. 159, 162. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the inspection of the knot by the plaintiff would have revealed any defect or that the plaintiff, a plumber, unreasonably relied on Crawford\u2019s skill in matters of a type in which the latter might be expected to be more expert. See <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Link-Belt Co. </em>324 Mass. 673, 677-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">There is no direct evidence of any negligence of Crawford, except that which arises from the fact that the knot came loose. However, this is the type of event, the mere occurrence of which constitutes evidence from which negligence may be inferred. As Holmes, J., said in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>164 Mass. 42, 47 (failure of splice in rope), \u201cthe jury from their experience . . . may be warranted in thinking that an accident of this particular kind commonly does not happen except in consequence of negligence.\u201d <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Mannex, </em>214 Mass. 502, 504 (where \u201cthe very fact that the cable broke as it did was some evidence that it had become unsound\u201d). <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Berkshire Street Railway, </em>217 Mass. 361, 362-363 (broken trolley pole). <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Toomey, </em>218 Mass. 242, 244 (slipping of cake of ice carried by iceman). <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>219 Mass. 281, 283 (broken elevator cable). <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>269 Mass. 337, 339-340 (brakes of parked automobile failed to hold). <em>Bachand </em>v. <em>Vidal, </em>328 Mass. 97, 99 (parked automobile slipped on hill). See also <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>200 Mass. 522, 525. Compare <em>Musolino LoConte Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Consolidated Gas Co. </em>330 Mass. 161, 163-164 (broken gas mains); <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>193 Mass. 495, 497-498 (breaking of inadequate rope selected by plaintiff\u2019s regular \u201csuperintendent\u201d); <em>Long </em>v. <em>Kaplan, ante, </em>94, 95-96. It was open to the jury to find, on the basis of their knowledge of knots, a matter reasonably within the range of their experience in ordinary life, (a) that it was more probable that the plaintiff was injured because Crawford failed to use due care in tying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the knot than that it occurred from any other \"cause, and (b) that a knot properly tied for a purpose of this character does not easily become untied. See <em>Bachand </em>v. <em>Vidal, supra, </em>at page 99. Cases where there is no evidence of any act which could have constituted negligence, or where the event or injury which occurred was foreseeable, or where there are no facts giving rise to a reasonable inference of negligence, can be distinguished. Compare, for example, <em>Mucha </em>v. <em>Northeastern Crushed Stone Co. Inc. </em>307 Mass. 592, 594-596. On the testimony, the jury could have found that Crawford had sufficiently exclusive control of the tying of the knot and of the rope and other equipment so that the strong probability was that Crawford was responsible for all matters relating to the rope.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Couris </em>v. <em>Casco Amusement Corp. </em>333 Mass. 740, 742; Harper and James, Law of Torts (1956 ed.) \u00a7 19.7. Compare <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>247 Mass. 124, 126-127; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Colonial Air Transport, Inc. </em>278 Mass. 420, 425-426. There was no evidence that anyone but Crawford had anything to do with the tying of the knot and the record indicates no interference or likelihood of interference with it by anyone else during the unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Since there was evidence which would warrant the jury in finding that Crawford, acting within the scope of his employment by the defendant, was negligent and that his negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury, it was, therefore, error to enter a verdict under leave reserved. The exceptions are sustained and judgment is to be entered on the verdict returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 32 (1), gives no assistance where, as here, it. is plain that the defendant had a greater obligation than that statute would have imposed, since the defendant\u2019s vice-president plainly undertook to deliver the boiler section at least outside the premises of the plaintiff\u2019s employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> Even if the jury found that Crawford and the others, directly and in behalf of their respective employers, were acting in a joint enterprise, the negligence of Crawford would not be imputed to the others in an action against a participant in, or party to the enterprise. <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>296 Mass. 30, 31-33. Compare <em>Beaucage </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>206 Mass. 492, 497-498.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> The ownership of the rope is here wholly immaterial since no defect in it contributed to the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
