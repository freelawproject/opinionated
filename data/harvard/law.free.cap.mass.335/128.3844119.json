She was hired at the suggestion of Mrs. Russell\u2019s son who occupied an adjoining apartment in a twenty-four apartment building. She was paid by funds furnished to the mother by the son. She also did some household duties for the son. The reviewing board found that she was hired by the mother as agent of the son. The son purchased the property on or about January 1, 1951. He and his mother retained their quarters. The claimant, who considered herself a domestic employee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>continued her services going back and forth to the premises each day. On his acquisition of the property Russell arranged for the insurance but so far as workmen\u2019s compensation was concerned he covered only the janitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On January 17, 1951, the claimant was requested by Mrs. Russell to wash the outside and inside of the apartment windows, and while engaged in cleaning the outside of one of these windows in Mrs. Russell\u2019s apartment she fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The single member made an award which was reversed by the reviewing board which found that the claimant\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment as a domestic servant and that she was not included in the workmen\u2019s compensation policy that covered the janitor. The findings, rulings, and decision of the reviewing board supersede the decision of the single member, <em>Di Giovanni\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 241, 242, <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>314 Mass. 610, 612, <em>Khachadoorian\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 625, 627; and findings of fact by the board are final unless lacking in evidentiary support or tainted with some error of law. <em>Wanders\u2019s Case, </em>308 Mass. 157. <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 75, 76. <em>Karelis\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 224. Whether the claimant was a domestic servant was a question of fact for the determination of the board. She did the cleaning, cooking, and various activities associated with household duties. See <em>Sjostedt </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>306 Mass. 344; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>313 Mass. 250; <em>Le Gere </em>v. <em>Lorenc, </em>282 App. Div. (N. Y.) 791. There was no error in the finding that the claimant was employed as a domestic servant by Russell as a householder and that she was not an employee of his as the owner or operator of the apartment property in which latter capacity the board inferred he was conducting a business separate and distinct from his regular occupation and on account of which he carried workmen\u2019s compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">There was no evidence that the janitor had previously washed the windows or that it was a part of his duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The claimant argues that an employer is not permitted to insure some of his employees in his business and to leave others uninsured, <em>Cox\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 220, 225, <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merrimac Mills Co. </em>325 Mass. 676, 679; but the principle contended for applies only to the same class of industrial employees and does not extend to employees in a separate and distinct business. An employer is not required to insure, nor is he penalized if he fails to do so, if he has \u201cthree or less persons, or persons employed as domestic servants and farm laborers.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 369; \u00a7 66, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9A; \u00a7 67, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 10. <em>Keaney\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 5. <em>Pallotta\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The final decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
