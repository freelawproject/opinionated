The action is in contract by a broker for a commission of $1,795 for negotiating a bank mortgage upon real estate. The writ, which is in trustee process, carries an ad damnum of $2,500, and states that it is \u201cin an action of contract for personal services.\u201d The ground of the motion is lack of jurisdiction because of violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 246, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 17, \u00a7 1, in that a suit by a broker for a commission is not \u201can action of contract for personal services\u201d and not one of the exceptions to the requirement that a bond be furnished in actions commenced by trustee process when the ad damnum exceeds $1,000. See <em>Farber </em>v. <em>Lubin, </em>327 Mass. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The case is prematurely here. By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96, \u201cno appeal or exception shall be entered in the supreme judicial court until the case is in all other respects ripe for final disposition by the superior court.\u201d <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Battista, </em>311 Mass. 372. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowe, </em>315 Mass. 217, 219. It is a principle of general application that \u201cthis court cannot be required to deal with cases in interlocutory stages, except where the trial judge has exercised his discretion to that end by reporting the action taken by him under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 111, or in equity under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 30. ... In the absence of a report by the trial judge the proper course is to proceed in accordance with his orders until the case is ready for final disposition.\u201d <em>Rines </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>330 Mass. 368, 373. See <em>John Gilbert Jr. Co. </em>v. <em>C. M. Fauci Co. </em>309 Mass. 271, 273; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Plecker, </em>319 Mass. 560, 563n. Compare <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway, </em>224 Mass. 253, 254-255. The rule applies to the denial of a motion to dismiss even when the motion is based on jurisdictional grounds; the denial is not immediately reviewable. <em>Catlin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 U. S. 229, 236.
