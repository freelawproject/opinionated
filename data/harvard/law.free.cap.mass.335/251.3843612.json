The administrator of veterans\u2019 affairs, United States Veterans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Administration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a party in interest. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 2; \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1956, c. 314, \u00a7 3. See <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Director of the United States </em>Veterans\u2019 <em>Bureau, </em>272 Mass. 212. The ward is a patient at the United States Veterans\u2019 Hospital at Bedford. On February 26, 1953, the veterans\u2019 administration made a determination that the ward\u2019s mother, Antoinette, and his father, Antonio, were dependent upon him and granted the ward monthly war service compensation. Upon petition of the guardian the Probate Court authorized the expenditure of $150 monthly from the funds of the ward for the support of the parents. On December 5, 1955, the father died leaving no estate. By a decree dated January 27, 1956, the guardian was authorized to expend $100 from the ward\u2019s funds for the support of the mother, who has no other funds available to her. The ward receives $198.50 monthly war service compensation by reason of her dependency. At present there is approximately $3,000 in the ward\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">According to the petition, the cost of the funeral was $895, the cemetery lot $215, and the offering for church services $30, a total of $1,140, none of which has been paid. At the hearing below counsel for the veterans\u2019 administration stated that he could not agree as to the cost of the funeral and burial. No evidence was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The judge stated in his report of the material facts found by him that \u201cthere is no statutory authority for the expenditure of ward\u2019s funds for the purpose of burial of a parent or parents of the ward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The material statutes are these: The guardian \u201cshall manage the estate of his ward frugally and without waste, and shall, except as otherwise provided, apply the same, so far as may be necessary, to the comfortable and suitable maintenance and support of the ward and his family.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 38. \u201cThe probate court, upon the application of the guardian or dependent parent of a mentally ill person . . . may authorize such guardian to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>towards the support of such dependent parent such portion of the estate of such mentally ill person not required for his own maintenance and support as it may order.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 43A, as appearing in St. 1956, c. 314, \u00a7 15. \u201cThe word \u2018support\u2019 is often used in our statutes, and in its ordinary signification it includes not merely board, but everything necessary to proper maintenance.\u201d <em>Gould </em>v. Lawrence, 160 Mass. 232. Section 43A was enacted in its original form by St. 1931, c. 420. The only change was made last year in substituting \u201cmentally ill\u201d for \u201cinsane.\u201d We are unable to read \u201csupport\u201d of a dependent parent as including funeral and burial expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">It is urged upon us that no specific statutory authority is necessary to empower the expenditures here sought. We must, however, give heed to the statute as drawn, and, regardless of personal preferences, we deem ourselves foreclosed from adopting the inclusive construction of such cases as <em>Matter of Connolly, </em>88 Misc. (N. Y.) 405, <em>Matter of Neville, </em>147 Misc. (N. Y.) 171, and <em>In re Fitzwaier\u2019s Guardianship, </em>69 Fed. Sup. 866 (D. C. D. C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The remedy, if there be need of one, rests with the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">This opinion is that of a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> U. S. C. (1952 ed.) Title 38, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 11a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
