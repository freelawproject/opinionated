A record of this vote was filed in the office of the town clerk on February 1, 1956. It also appears from the said bill that the defendants appointed one DeFronzo as temporary manager. He and the selectmen constitute all the defendants. The town is not named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The plaintiff paid no attention to this proceeding commenced by the defendants other than filing the instant bill on February 3, 1956. The plaintiff\u2019s contention then was and now is that the preliminary resolution adopted by the selectmen on January 31, 1956, and filed with the town clerk did not set forth \u201cin detail the specific reasons for his proposed removal\u201d as required by St. 1947, c. 17, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1952, c. 199, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Said c. 17 provides a form of government for the town of Saugus. The selectmen were authorized to remove the manager by \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>of removal was not complied with, \u00a7 11 as amended, and relies upon <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>White, </em>287 Mass. 495. The case cited, however, distinguishes between causes and reasons in the application of statutes requiring the statement of specific reasons, rather than of mere causes, in the removal statute. The usual remedy, in the absence of a specific statutory remedy like the one supplied for the removal of one in the classified civil service, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 45, as amended, is a petition for a writ of mandamus. Indeed, <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>White </em>was a case seeking a writ of mandamus. See also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Third District Court of Eastern Middlesex, </em>316 Mass. 663, 665, where it was pointed out that even in the case of one in the classified service the remedy for one removed not in accordance with the statute is by a petition for a writ of mandamus. See <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, </em>253 Mass. 590; <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>302 Mass. 111, 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">No ground for equitable relief is shown by the bill. There was no jurisdiction in equity to try title to public office. An effective vote to remove him might not have been taken on March 3, 1956, and if a vote was taken, he was not without an available remedy. <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>148 Mass. 285, 287-289. <em>Brierley </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>299 Mass. 292. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484, 490. High, Law of Injunctions (4th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1312, 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of the appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> \u201cThe selectmen, by a majority vote of the full membership of the board, may remove the town manager. At least thirty days before such proposed removal shall become effective, the selectmen shall file a preliminary written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>resolution with the town clerk setting forth in detail the specific reasons for his proposed removal, a copy of which resolution shall be delivered to the town manager. The manager may reply in writing to the resolution and may request a public hearing. If the manager so requests, the board of selectmen shall hold a public hearing not earlier than twenty days nor later than thirty days after the filing of such request. After such public hearing, if any, otherwise at the expiration of thirty days following the filing of the preliminary resolution, and after full consideration, the selectmen by a majority vote of the full membership of the board may adopt a final resolution of removal. In the preliminary resolution, the selectmen may suspend the manager from duty, but shall in any case cause to be paid to him forthwith any unpaid balance of his salary and his salary for the next three calendar months following the filing of the preliminary resolution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
