G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. Each count alleges that Roger, eight years of age, had been a patient in Monson State Hospital since 1950. On March 24, 1955, he was placed out of doors, and disappeared. Weeks later he was found dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Counts 1 and 2 are brought against the defendant Oster-held, who is alleged to he the superintendent of Monson State Hospital. Counts 3 and 4 are brought against the defendant Bernice Vennert, whose precise position is not clear, but who is alleged to have been in charge of Roger \u201cunder the direction of\u201d the defendant Osterheld. Counts 1 and 3 are for death. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 229, \u00a7 2C, inserted by St. 1949, c. 427, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1951, c. 250. Counts 2 and 4 are for conscious suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The defendant Osterheld, as superintendent of Monson State Hospital (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 123, \u00a7 25, as amended; \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1954, c. 598, \u00a7 3), is a public officer. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>203 Mass. 539, 543-545. A public officer is not hable for any omission to perform his statutory duties or for the misfeasance of his servants or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>agents under the doctrine of respondeat superior; but he may be subject to liability for a tort of active misfeasance committed in the discharge of his ministerial duties as such officer. <em>Trum </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>329 Mass. 434, 438-439, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In considering count 1 this anomalous doctrine is unimportant. In actions under the death statute the measure of liability is ordinary negligence irrespective of the test of common law liability. <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Forest, </em>233 Mass. 392, 398-399 (liability of landlord to tenant for gratuitous repairs). <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>254 Mass. 110, 115, and <em>Gallup </em>v. <em>Lazott, </em>271 Mass. 406, 408 (liability of host to guest). <em>Oliveria </em>v. <em>Oliveria, </em>305 Mass. 297, 300-301 (liability of minor child to parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The question, therefore, is whether count 1 sufficiently states a cause of action based upon negligence. We summarize allegations of this count which are not hereinbefore enumerated. The defendant Osterheld, as superintendent in charge of the hospital and the patients, \u201cwas responsible for the care, training and safety of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate,\u201d and \u201chad instituted various methods of caring for the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and others there located.\u201d Following admission as a patient, Roger was treated by this defendant in the Hodskins Building in which he was kept under observation in an area surrounded by a fence and where his ingress and egress were controlled. Thereafter by direction of this defendant \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s intestate was treated in a building without restraint and was allowed access to a recreation area which was unenclosed\u201d known as the children\u2019s colony. While in the children\u2019s colony Roger showed a tendency to climb fire escapes and structures and to separate himself from his fellow patients, a tendency which was made known to this defendant. At the plaintiff\u2019s request Roger was \u201creturned\u201d to the Hodskins Building for a time, but later \u201cas a means allegedly designed to make the plaintiff\u2019s intestate more independent and self reliant\u201d he was \u201creturned\u201d by this defendant to \u201cthe children's colony where no restraint was placed upon him or upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>others, and he was permitted to come and go and run about without surveillance and without the presence of attendants known or unknown, nor was any provision made therefor by the defendant Osterheld although the plaintiff\u2019s intestate\u2019s condition, both physical and mental, was such that he was unable to care for himself .... [T]he method of training and handling of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate as devised and put into operation by the defendant Osterheld was poorly conceived, inadequately implemented and executed without proper provisions being made for the safety of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and other patients being treated with him, and with no precautions in effect to ascertain the plaintiff\u2019s intestate\u2019s whereabouts or activities, and because of the inadequacy of these training techniques conceived and made operative by the defendant Osterheld the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was placed out of doors on a cold rainy March day . . . under a system thus negligently promulgated by the defendant Osterheld which failed to provide for adequate observation of or protection for the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and others . . . and . . . due to the failure and incompleteness of the method instituted by the defendant Osterheld for the care of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and improperly and negligently executed by him, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate disappeared and was lost and unaccounted for and died .... QEQis decomposed remains were not discovered until on or about May 15, 1955, all as a result of the misconduct and misfeasance of the defendant Oster-held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">As we interpret count 1 as a whole, its substance is that the defendant Osterheld as superintendent in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon him by statute established a method or policy not approved by the plaintiff which accorded Roger a greater freedom of movement and action than he should have had and as a result led to his disappearance and death. For this there would be no liability to the plaintiff. <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Wheeler, 8 </em>Gray, 409, 413. <em>Denniston </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>125 Mass. 216, 219. <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>191 Mass. 78, 88. <em>Jaffarian </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>280 Mass. 402, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>405. Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) page 781. It is not a case of personal custody in this defendant who, while in active personal charge of his ward, negligently allowed him to escape. It may be noted that the plaintiff\u2019s brief describes the counts against the defendant Osterheld as based upon \u201cmisfeasance and misconduct,\u201d whereas it describes the counts against the defendant Vennert as based upon \u201cnegligence, misconduct and misfeasance.\u201d We think that the demurrer was rightly sustained as to count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">Count 2 contains substantially the same allegations as count 1 and is brought for conscious suffering. The test here is not ordinary negligence but active misfeasance, and is an a fortiori case. The demurrer was rightly sustained as to count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Counts 3 and 4 do not contain allegations which make the defendant Vennert a public officer. At most they show that she was an agent. The fact that one is an agent does not necessarily preclude his liability for torts. Restatement: Agency, \u00a7 343, comment a; \u00a7 350, comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The question under counts 3 and 4 is whether each alleges a cause of action based upon negligence. We are of opinion that they do not. Most allegations are substantial repetitions of the language of counts 1 and 2. The allegation that the defendant Vennert \u201cunder the direction of the superintendent . . . was in charge of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate on March 24, 1955,\u201d followed by substantially the same lengthy allegations as to instituting methods of training and care, \u201ca system . . . negligently promulgated,\u201d and \u201cthe failure and incompleteness of the method carried out by the defendant\u201d and \u201cimproperly and negligently executed by her,\u201d falls short of adding anything substantial to the allegations in counts 1 and 2. The demurrer was rightly sustained as to counts 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Orders sustaining demurrers affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
