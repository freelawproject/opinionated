(All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.) We conclude that it does not and affirm the order of the trial court awarding certain expert witness fees and costs under that statute in favor of the offeror.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Elite Show Services, Inc. (Elite) and Staffpro, Inc. are both event-staffing companies that provide licensed security guards and other staff for public and private events in San Diego. In May 2001, Elite brought this action against Staffpro, Inc., and Cory Meredith (collectively Staffpro) for unfair competition, unfair business practices and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, alleging that Staffpro engaged in various wrongful acts (including the use of unlicensed personnel as guards, the use of compensation arrangements designed to avoid payroll taxes, and the failure to provide workers\u2019 compensation and disability insurance for employees who Staffpro provided as \u201cgroup labor\u201d) to reduce its costs and allow it to provide services at artificially low prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In December 2001, Staffpro made a settlement offer pursuant to section 998, in which it offered to agree to the precise injunctive relief that Elite prayed for in its complaint, to wit, that it would (1) \u201cnot provide personnel to perform security guard functions to public and private customers when such personnel does not possess the mandatory state \u2018guard card\u2019 . . .\u201d (2) \u201cproperly license and register all persons performing security guard work for which a license is required prior to their deployment as security guards, pursuant to California Business and Professions Code sections 7580 et seq.,\u201d (3) not \u201cprovide or offer to provide to private and public customers \u2018group\u2019 labor personnel who are not provided Workers\u2019 Compensation, State Disability and other required benefits and without withholding and paying appropriate state and federal income taxes on the earnings of said personnel,\u201d (4) \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>allow employees to direct traffic on San Diego City streets without proper traffic control certification,\u201d and (5) \u201cnot deploy security guards at San Diego Unified School District venues when such security guards do not possess a permanent California \u2018guard card\u2019 . ...\u201d In the provision that is the crux of the parties\u2019 current dispute, Staffpro also agreed to pay Elite \u201ca sum equal to the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and taxable costs that [Elite] has incurred in investigating and prosecuting this action to and including December 26, 2001, as it relates to [Staffpro\u2019s] alleged conduct sued upon herein.\u201d Elite did not accept the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">At the outset of trial in December 2002, Elite dismissed its intentional interference claim and withdrew its claim for monetary damages pursuant to its unfair business practice cause of action and the case proceeded to a bench trial on its request for injunctive relief. After a consideration of the parties\u2019 evidence and briefs, the court denied Elite\u2019s request for injunctive relief pursuant to the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), but issued an order requiring Staffpro (A) to either provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage to its group labor personnel or ensure that the nonprofit organizations who use such personnel provide such coverage; and (B) to utilize only licensed personnel for (1) restraining or limiting the movement of the general public which, if conduct escalated, would require the use of force or physical restraint, (2) patdowns requiring physical intrusion into the personal space of a member of the general public, and (3) car searches requiring physical intrusion into the personal space of a member of the general public. The court concluded that neither party prevailed at trial and ordered each party to bear its own costs and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Thereafter, Staffpro filed a motion for an award of expert witness fees pursuant to section 998, subdivision (c)(1) (section 998(c)(1)). The trial court rejected Elite\u2019s argument that the offer could not be enforced under section 998(c)(1) because the offer was too uncertain and not unconditional; it entered an order awarding Staffpro $22,125 in fees incurred for one of its defense experts. Later, Staffpro filed a memorandum of costs, seeking costs incurred for filings, depositions, service of process, witness fees, exhibits, court reporter fees and expert witness fees. Elite brought a motion to tax the cost memo, challenging the amounts requested for exhibits and expert witness fees. The court granted Elite\u2019s motion in part as to each of the challenged items and entered an order directing the clerk to interlin\u00e9ate a cost award of $53,648.90 in Staffpro\u2019s favor into the judgment. Elite appeals the court\u2019s cost orders, contending the offer was too uncertain to be enforceable and thus did not provide a basis for making an award under section 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\n<em>Section 998</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">As a general rule, a prevailing party in a civil action is entitled to recover its costs from its opponent. (\u00a7 1032.)  However, section 998 establishes a procedure for shifting costs if the prevailing party obtains a judgment less favorable than a pretrial settlement offer made by the other party. <em>(Barella </em>v. <em>Exchange Bank </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 793, 798 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 167] <em>(Barella).) </em>In that situation, the prevailing party is precluded from recovering its own postoffer costs and must pay its opponent\u2019s postoffer costs, including expert witness fees, if awarded in the court\u2019s discretion. <em>(Ibid., </em>citing \u00a7 998, subd. (c)(1).) The purpose of the cost-shifting statute is to encourage the settlement of litigation without trial, by punishing the party who fails to accept a reasonable settlement offer from its opponent. <em>(Carver v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 132, 152 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Where the offeror obtains a judgment more favorable than its offer, the judgment constitutes prima facie evidence showing the offer was reasonable and the burden lies with the offeree to show that the offer was not in fact reasonable. <em>(Carver v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 152.) However, in seeking to enforce an offer pursuant to section 998, the offering party bears the burden of demonstrating that the offer was otherwise valid. <em>(Barella, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 799.) An offer will be strictly construed in favor of the party against whom it would operate under section 998 and although the inclusion of nonmonetary terms and conditions therein does not necessarily render an offer invalid, the offer must be unconditional to be enforceable. <em>(Barella, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 799.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">A. <em>Uncertainty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">In interpreting a section 998 offer, general contract principles apply when they neither conflict with nor defeat the statute\u2019s purpose of encouraging the settlement of lawsuits prior to trial. <em>(T.M. Cobb Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 278 [204 Cal.Rptr. 143, 682 P.2d 338].)  Under California law, a contract is enforceable if it is sufficiently definite that a court can ascertain the parties\u2019 obligations thereunder and determine whether those obligations have been performed or breached. <em>(Ersa Grae Corp. v. Fluor Corp. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 613, 623 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 288].)  The issue of whether Staffipro\u2019s settlement offer was sufficiently certain to be enforceable involves a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>(Roden v. Bergen Brunswig Corp. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 620, 625 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 549].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Elite contends that the inclusion of the attorney fee provision rendered the offer too uncertain to be enforced because the provision did not specify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>amount of fees to be paid, but rather left that for future determination or agreement. However, neither law nor equity requires that every term and condition of an agreement be set forth in the contract. <em>(Hennefer </em>v. <em>Butcher </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 492, 500-501 [227 Cal.Rptr. 318].) \u201cThe usual and reasonable conditions of such a contract are, in the contemplation of the parties, a part of their agreement.\u201d <em>(King v. Stanley </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 584, 588 [197 P.2d 321].) In the absence of express conditions, a court may look to custom and practice to determine incidental matters, so long as such matters do not alter or vary the terms of the agreement. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 588-589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Applying the foregoing principles, we conclude that Staffpro\u2019s failure to specify a dollar amount for the attorney fees in the offer does not render the offer so uncertain as to be unenforceable. Many contracts contain a provision authorizing the prevailing party in litigation arising out of the contract to recover reasonable attorney fees from another party to the contract, yet Elite is unable to cite any published authority holding the inclusion of such a provision renders the subject contract uncertain or unenforceable. More importantly, the failure of the offer to specify the dollar amount of reasonable fees would not have precluded a court from ascertaining with reasonable certainty Staffpro\u2019s obligations thereunder if Elite had accepted the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The offer provided that Staffpro would pay Elite \u201ca sum equal to the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and taxable costs that [Elite] has incurred in investigating and prosecuting this action to and including December 26, 2001 [the date of the offer], as it relates to [Staffpro\u2019s] alleged conduct sued upon [in this action].\u201d If Elite had accepted the offer, section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(5) would have provided the mechanism for determining the amount of attorney fees allowable as costs. <em>(Ibid, </em>[providing that attorney fees recoverable pursuant to a contractual provision \u201cshall be fixed either upon a noticed motion or upon entry of a default judgment, unless otherwise provided by stipulation of the parties\u201d]; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 870.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Because applicable statutory and rule provisions set forth a procedure for determining the amount of attorney fees to be awarded pursuant to a contractual provision <em>(Santisas </em>v. <em>Goodin </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 618 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399]), the fact that the offer does not specify a particular amount of attorney fees does not leave the matter open for the parties\u2019 future agreement, nor does it create an uncertainty that renders it unenforceable. In this regard, a settlement offer that includes an agreement to pay reasonable attorney fees is analogous to the inclusion of an award of unspecified costs in a judgment, a very commonplace occurrence. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that the amount of reasonable costs (in this case, fees) must be determined thereafter does not render the offer fatally uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Elite further objects that the offer was uncertain because it would be required to incur additional, nonrecoverable attorney fees to bring a motion to have the court determine the fee amount if the parties could not reach agreement on the matter. However, courts are frequently asked to determine the reasonableness of attorney fees and do so on the basis of declarations rather than live testimony and at hearings that are usually short in duration. <em>(Padilla </em>v. <em>McClellan </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1106-1107 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 680].) There can be no doubt that if Elite had accepted Staffpro\u2019s offer, which was made early in the case, Elite would have avoided incurring additional attorney fees necessary to complete discovery and to bring its claims to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Elite points out that our Supreme Court has held \u201cthe legislative purpose of section 998 is generally better served by \u2018bright line rules\u2019 that can be applied to these statutory settlement offers\u2014at least with respect to the application of contractual principles in determining the validity and enforceability of a settlement agreement. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Barella, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 799.) We agree wholeheartedly and believe our determination that a settlement offer\u2019s inclusion of a provision agreeing to pay the offeree\u2019s reasonable attorney fees does not render the offer unenforceable under section 998 is such a bright-line rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">B. <em>Was the Offer More Favorable Than the Outcome at Trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">For the first time in its reply brief on appeal, Elite argues that the nonmonetary aspects of Staffipro\u2019s offer were not \u201cmore favorable\u201d to Staffpro than the nonmonetary orders included in the judgment. This argument is too little, too late. <em>(Bay World Trading, Ltd. v. Nebraska Beef, Inc. </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 135, 138 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 632] [points raised for the first time in a reply brief will not be considered, unless the party shows good reason for failing to present them earlier].) Even if we were to consider Elite\u2019s argument on its merits, we would have a difficult time accepting Elite\u2019s position that, although Staffpro offered to stipulate <em>to the exact injunctive relief requested in Elite\u2019s complaint, </em>the offer was less favorable to Staffpro than the nonmonetary components of the trial court\u2019s judgment, which were more limited in scope, although more detailed in certain respects. Elite\u2019s argument does not establish a basis on which the trial court\u2019s award of fees and costs to Staffpro must be set aside..</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The orders are affirmed. Staffpro is entitled to recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A6V\">McConnell, P. J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
