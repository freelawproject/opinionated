(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 182, subd. (a)(1), 187, subd. (a), 12022, subd. (a)(1).) On appeal, he argues, inter alia, that insufficiency of the evidence and instructional error on reasonable doubt require reversal. We will reject the insufficiency of the evidence argument, but instructional error on reasonable doubt will require that we reverse the judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">1. Sufficiency of the Evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">2. <em>Instructions on Reasonable Doubt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">\u201cThe reasonable-doubt standard plays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure. It is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014that bedrock \u2018axiomatic and elementary\u2019 principle whose \u2018enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 363 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068].) Due process \u201cprotects the accused against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he [or she] is charged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The record shows that during jury selection the court amplified at length on the standard reasonable doubt instruction (CALJIC No. 2.90):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">\u201cQ. [Prospective juror], tell us what you\u2019ve done in your life, decisions you\u2019ve made, where there has been absolutely no doubt in your mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201cA. Starting a family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">\u201cQ. Starting\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">\u201cA. No doubt in my mind that I wanted children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">\u201cQ. No doubt in your mind that you wanted children. Did you have some doubt whether you could support them and nurture them properly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-12\">\u201cQ. So there was doubt, wasn\u2019t there[?] [][] Is this the right time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-13\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-14\">\u201cQ. That went through your mind, [ft] So we have eliminated that one. [ft] Can you come up with another one\u2014absolutely no doubt in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-15\">\u201cA. I wanted to go to college.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did you go to college?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">\u201cQ. But when you went to college, when you left home, is there a little bit of question in your mind\u2014did you leave home to go to college?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-20\">\u201cQ. Was there a little bit of question in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-21\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>\u201cQ. Okay. We have eliminated that one. [][] Can you come up with absolutely no doubt[?] [][] Still looking for that. We will be here for a long long time and never come up with anything\u2014you won\u2019t, [f] What are you going to do when you\u2019re here on a jury and you want to be convinced beyond all possible doubt when it\u2019s never happened in your life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-4\">\u201cA. Good question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">\u201cQ. There is a solution to it. What\u2019s the solution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">\u201cA. Beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">\u201cQ. Very good. See how smart this jury is getting. You\u2019re really now getting into it. That\u2019s what I like. [][] If you work at it, all of you can figure it out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The court authorized the prospective jurors to find Johnson guilty even if they were to have \u201csome doubt\u201d about his guilt and characterized a juror who renders a guilty verdict with \u201cno doubt\u201d about his guilt as \u201cbrain dead\u201d: \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond all possible doubt. [][]... [I]f any of you think you can sit in a jury trial in a criminal case and render a guilty verdict and walk out of this courtroom feeling good about the verdict because there is absolutely no doubt in your mind, it will not happen. Even if you render a guilty verdict, there will be some doubt in your mind[s]. [f] If there is no doubt in your mind, then I can tell you you were brain dead during the trial\u2014you are brain dead. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The court gave the prospective jurors the \u201clegal definition\u201d of reasonable doubt: \u201cWhen we say you have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, we mean an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge. That\u2019s what you have to have, an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The court equated proof beyond a reasonable doubt to everyday decision-making in a juror\u2019s life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">\u201cQ. . . . Let me just try something, because, you know what, just like the decisions that [prospective juror] made ... in her life that she thought she was sure of until we questioned her, every decision you make in your life is based on . . . what\u2019s reasonable and possible. [][] Can you think of anything you did today where you made decisions based on reasonable or possible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">\u201cA. Yes, went to lunch close by so I wouldn\u2019t be late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>\u201cQ. Possible <em>[sic] </em>went to a restaurant close by\u2014that you went to a place that had food poisoning problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cA. Hopefully not, but possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cQ. If you had gone to one of the restaurants you\u2019re familiar with, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that. Was it reasonable for you to go that distance and try to be here on time[?] [][] The answer is no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">\u201cQ. So that\u2019s reasonable to go to a local restaurant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">With another prospective juror, the court continued to equate proof beyond a reasonable doubt to everyday decisionmaking in a juror\u2019s life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">\u201cQ. How many of you drive an automobile[?] [f] Everybody, [f] How many of you are good drivers[?] [f] Well, quite a few. [f] All right. Let\u2019s try [prospective juror].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">\u201cA. My name\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">\u201cQ. [Prospective juror], let me ask you a question first. You\u2019re a good driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-13\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-14\">\u201cQ. How many years have you been driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-15\">\u201cA. Five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-16\">\u201cQ. You\u2019re still in the thinking stage after five years of driving. Been driving as long as I do, you don\u2019t have a mind anymore when you\u2019re behind a wheel, [f] When you come to an intersection, the intersection controlled with lights and the light is green, what do you do[?] [f] What do you as a good driver do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-17\">\u201cA. Drive through, look for pedestrians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-18\">\u201cQ. What else do you do[?] [f] [Prospective juror], are you a good driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-19\">\u201cA. I guess when I want to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>\u201cQ. When you want to be. [][] What do you do when you come to an intersection and the light is green?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">\u201cA. Look both ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">\u201cQ. Good. Look both ways. [][] Have your foot on the gas, get ready to take it off if you have to. Anything could happen in the intersection, [f] Am I right so far[?] [f] Okay. As you get close to that intersection with the green light, actually take it off the gas, put it on the brake, stop, get out, walk around the front, look at the cross-traffic lights to make sure they\u2019re red. [|] Do you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u201cQ. Is it possible those lights could malfunction, electrical mechanical malfunction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">\u201cA. Possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">\u201cQ. Sure. If they malfunction, couldn\u2019t there be a serious accident there? [f] Why don\u2019t you get out and check that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">\u201cA. \u2018Cause I guess I ain\u2019t a good driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-11\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t, because it is not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-12\">\u201cA. Reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-13\">\u201cQ. Very good, [prospective juror]\u2014not reasonable. [][] Everything you do, you can look at what\u2019s reasonable and possible, and I tell you every decision you make along in your life are [szc] based on\u2014that human beings\u2014power of reason\u2014something animals don\u2019t have, [f] So we have that power of reason, and with that we can make these decisions along the way. ['][] So that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not a definition of reasonable doubt, but that\u2019s what we want you to bring to court with you, the same thing you use every day in making your decision^]. [][]... [f] We found out now what you have to do. Go back to the jury room and figure out what happened beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond all possible doubt. [][] But the first thing you have to decide as jurors is: Is what happened beyond a reasonable doubt, because you are never going to know what really happened beyond all possible doubt, nor am I. We weren\u2019t there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">After one prospective juror acknowledged difficulty in passing moral judgments on others, the court gave the instruction that jurors are not to \u201cpass a moral judgment\u201d but are simply to make the \u201ckind of decisions you make every day in your life\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>\u201cThere is no place for you to pass a moral judgment in this court. The thing that you\u2019re doing is kind of decisions you make every day in your life, figuring out what happened, whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing, the secular things, that you decide every day in your life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">After another prospective juror expressed an inability as a matter of conscience and religion to participate in a jury trial, the court instructed that jurors who find an accused person guilty or not guilty engage in the same decisionmaking process they \u201cuse every day. When you get out of bed, you make those same decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In argument to the jury, the prosecutor took his cue from the court\u2019s reasonable doubt instructions, characterized a juror who could return a guilty verdict without \u201csome doubt\u201d about Johnson\u2019s guilt as \u201cbrain dead,\u201d and equated proof beyond a reasonable doubt to everyday decisionmaking in a juror\u2019s life;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201cAs Judge Oberholzer explained to you even with yourself, the things that you\u2019ve done in your own life, there has always been, at the minimum, some kind of bit of doubt in the back of your mind about whether or not what you\u2019re doing is right or wrong. Even though you felt really strongly about it, there is still kind of lingering doubt. That\u2019s always going to be there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">\u201cThe Judge said something to you which I thought was a pretty good explanation. He said if you walk out of here after rendering a guilty verdict without some sort of doubt in your mind, then you were brain dead during the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-10\">\u201cHe\u2019s right. You are not\u2014if you come out of here, you are not\u2014after rendering a guilty verdict, I can guarantee you will have some doubt, but that\u2019s not the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-11\">\u201cThe issue, is that a reasonable doubt, is it a doubt based upon reason, not is it just a possible doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-12\">\u201cIs it possible? Is it possible that [] Lenix would not discuss the murder that he was about to commit with [] Johnson?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">Johnson\u2019s counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s use of the term \u201cpossible\u201d as \u201cmisstating the reasonable doubt concept.\u201d The court noted that \u201cthe jury instructions, which are controlling,\u201d define reasonable doubt as \u201cabiding conviction of the truth of the charge\u201d and overruled the objection. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>prosecutor argued that although Lamar\u2019s murder was \u201cpossible\u201d even without Lenix arranging his escape beforehand with fellow gang member Johnson \u201cclearly it\u2019s not reasonable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s the question, ladies and gentlemen. That\u2019s the threshold you have, [f] Anything is possible. Anything is possible, but it\u2019s not reasonably possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">After both parties rested and argued their cases to the jury, the court instructed with CALJIC No. 2.90:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">\u201cA defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether his guilt is satisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This presumption places upon the People the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">\u201cReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The Attorney General argues Johnson forfeited his right to appellate review by failing to object to the court\u2019s reasonable doubt instructions. First, the general rule is settled that even in the absence of an objection the accused has a right to appellate review of any instruction that affects his or her substantial rights. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1259; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 539, fn. 7 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137].)  Second, since the argument to which the court overruled Johnson\u2019s objection paraphrased the court\u2019s own instructions during voir dire, the inference arises that an objection to the instructions would have been futile, so the general rule barring appellate review does not apply. (See <em>People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 822 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Third, \u201c[t]he fact that a party, by failing to raise an issue below, may forfeit the right to raise the issue on appeal does not mean that an <em>appellate court </em>is precluded from considering the issue. \u2018An appellate court is generally not prohibited from reaching a question that has not been preserved for review by a party. . . . Whether or not it should do so is entrusted to its discretion.\u2019 \u201d (6 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Reversible Error, \u00a7 36, p. 497, quoting <em>People v. Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 162, fn. 6 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429]; see <em>People v. Marchand </em>(2002) 98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1056, 1061 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 687] [appellate court has discretion to adjudicate important question of constitutional law despite party\u2019s forfeiture of right to appellate review].) Here, nothing less fundamental is at stake than the denial of Johnson\u2019s due process protection \u201cagainst conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at pp. 362-364.) We reject the Attorney General\u2019s forfeiture argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Well over a century ago, the issue before the California Supreme Court was an instruction authorizing a guilty verdict if the evidence satisfied the jury of the accused\u2019s guilt to a \u201c \u2018certainty as would influence the minds of the jury in the important affairs of life.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Brannon </em>(1873) 47 Cal. 96, 97.) On the ground that equating proof beyond a reasonable doubt to everyday decisionmaking in a juror\u2019s life lowers the burden of proof to a preponderance of the evidence, the court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial: \u201cThe judgment of a reasonable [person] in the ordinary affairs of life, however important, is influenced and controlled by the preponderance of evidence. Juries are permitted and instructed to apply the same rule to the determination of civil actions involving rights of property only. But in the decision of a criminal case involving life or liberty, something further is required.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Just months ago, a Court of Appeal case confirmed <em>Brannon\u2019s </em>enduring vitality. During jury selection, the court \u201camplified on the concept of reasonable doubt\u201d by noting that although \u201c \u2018we all have a possible doubt whether we will be here tomorrow\u2019 \u201d we \u201c \u2018take vacations\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018get on airplanes\u2019 \u201d because we \u201c \u2018have a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that we will be here tomorrow.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1169, 1171 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 781].) The court rejected the notions \u201cthat people planning vacations or scheduling flights engage in a deliberative process to the depth required of jurors,\u201d or \u201cfinalize their plans only after persuading themselves that they have an abiding conviction of the wisdom of the endeavor,\u201d and \u201cmake such decisions while aware of the concept of \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1172.) In reliance on <em>Brannon, </em>the court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial on the ground that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s attempt to explain reasonable doubt had the effect of lowering the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Here, as in <em>Brannon, </em>the court\u2019s tinkering with the statutory definition of reasonable doubt, no matter how well intentioned, lowered the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof below the due process requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at pp. 363-364; see <em>Cage v. Louisiana </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 39, 40-41 [112 L.Ed.2d 339, 111 S.Ct. 328], disapproved on another ground in <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 62, 73, fn. 4 [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 112 S.Ct. 475]; <em>Brannon, supra, </em>47 Cal. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>p. 97; cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1096.) Lamentably, \u201cthe essential connection to a \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 factual finding cannot be made where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of proof, which vitiates <em>all </em>the jury\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 275, 281 [124 L.Ed.2d 182, 113 S.Ct. 2078].) The error \u201cunquestionably qualifies as \u2018structural error\u2019 \u201d and compels reversal per se. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 282; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 407, 427 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 886 P.2d 1193]; <em>People v. Evans </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 186, 195-196 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Over a quarter of a century ago, a thoughtful Court of Appeal opinion collected cases from a number of jurisdictions on the fate of \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201c[w]ell .intentioned efforts\u201d by trial courts \u201cto \u2018clarify\u2019 and \u2018explain\u2019 \u201d reasonable doubt that instead created \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d and led to reversals on appeal. <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 61, 63 [126 Cal.Rptr. 275].) A few excerpts from those cases are instructive: \u201c[Citation]: \u2018. . . [T]he term \u201creasonable doubt\u201d best defines itself. All attempts at definition are likely to prove confusing and dangerous.\u2019 [Citation]: \u2018Every attempt to explain [the definition of reasonable doubt] renders an explanation of the explanation necessary.\u2019 [Citation]: \u2018It is in a term which needs no definition, and it is erroneous to give instructions resulting in an elaboration of it.\u2019 [Citation]: \u2018[Generally, the attempted definitions of [reasonable doubt] ... are simply misleading and confusing, and not proper explanations of their meaning at all.\u2019 [Citation]: \u2018As it is difficult, if not impossible, to give a precise and intelligible definition of what a reasonable doubt is, without extending an instruction into almost a treatise upon the subject, ... the better practice is to follow as nearly as practicable the language of the [statute], which is certainly as intelligible and as easily comprehended as the definition given in this case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">To any trial judge who feels the urge to clarify or explain reasonable doubt, we commend the concise history of the reasonable doubt standard that appears in the latest CALJIC compendium.

Originating in English cases of centuries ago, that history came to fruition only in the past decade with \u201cthe universal approval\u201d by federal and state courts alike of CALJIC No. 2.90, \u201cconclusively settl[ing]\u201d its \u201clegal sufficiency and propriety.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1240.) We trust that any trial judge who reads that history will heed the two English bards whose sage advice antedated <em>Garcia </em>by only a few years: \u201cLet it be.\u201d (Lennon &amp; McCartney (Northern Songs 1970) \u201cLet It Be.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We reverse the judgment and order a new trial.
