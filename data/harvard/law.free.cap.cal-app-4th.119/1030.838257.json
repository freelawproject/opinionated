In our previous opinion, we remanded the case to the trial court with directions to make a factual finding on the record supporting its \u201cH%\u201d calculation\u2014which is a component of the equation used by trial courts when making child support orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It represents the \u201c. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>approximate percentage of time that the high earner has or will have primary physical responsibility of the child[] compared to the other parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">On remand, the trial court initially concluded Jose\u2019s timeshare was 42 percent but, a few months later, reconsidered the issue on its own motion and changed the figure to 29.1 percent. The \u201ccorrection\u201d was based in large part on the court\u2019s reading of this court\u2019s newly published opinion <em>In re Marriage of Rosen </em>(2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 808, 826 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] <em>(Rosen). </em>On appeal, Jose argues the court misinterpreted <em>Rosen </em>as changing the rules on how to calculate timeshare percentages. We agree and again reverse the court\u2019s ruling based on this error, remanding the matter, hopefully, for the last time. In all other respects, the court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s child support statutes are a legal world unto themselves.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Hall </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 313, 316 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 772].) When making a child support order, trial courts are faced with a \u201crigid algebraic formula\u201d found in Family Code section 4055.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe actual text of section 4055 would probably not be called the Legislature\u2019s most lucid work by anyone. It is ... a \u2018glorified math problem.\u2019 One doesn\u2019t so much read it as plug numbers into the basic equation. (\u2018CS = K [HN-(H%)(TN)]\u2019\u2014There, we trust that\u2019s perfectly clear.) The statute virtually beckons the eyes to glaze over.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Hall, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The rules regarding how to calculate the \u201cH%\u201d factor of the uniform guideline formula were not changed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rosen, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 808. The rules are well established by case law: The trial court is required to determine the \u201capproximate\u201d percentage of time Jose has or will have \u201cprimary physical responsibility\u201d for his son Justin. This calculation \u201c \u2018is based on the parents\u2019 respective periods of primary physical \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the children rather than physical \u201ccustody.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Drake </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1160 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 466] <em>(Drake), </em>citing Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law (The Rutter Group 2001) \u00b6 6:168, p. 6-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">\u201cThe relevant phrase is \u2018primary physical responsibility\u2019 \u201d and as such timesharing \u201cproperly may be \u2018imputed\u2019 to a parent (or between parents) when the child is not in either parent\u2019s physical custody. ... FI] Conversely, however, no timesharing adjustment should be made in the guideline formula where the child is not under either parent\u2019s physical supervision. [Citation.]\u201d (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 6:168.1, pp. 6-66 to 6-67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Timesharing has been credited to parents having full responsibility for the physical situation and care of a disabled adult child <em>(Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1160), and may also include the time spent during court-ordered \u201cgrandparent\u2019s visitation (\u00a7 3103, subd. (g)(1)), as long as that parent is responsible for the child during that time.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Katzberg </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 974, 981 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 157] <em>(Katzberg).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In the case of <em>In re Marriage of Whealon </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 132, 145 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 559], the court rejected the father\u2019s argument he should be given credit for the time his son spent in day care because he paid half of the tuition. The court reasoned his argument \u201cultimately founders on the practical reality of day-to-day responsibility for a child. It is the custodial spouse who, after all, has the burden of finding, arranging and fronting the money for appropriate day care, who must deliver and pick up the child, and whose work day will be interrupted if there are any medical or other emergencies.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\"><em>Katzberg, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th 974, is also instructive. There, the parents disputed how to apportion the time their child spent in boarding school. The trial court had imputed all the time to the father, who was the primary custodial parent and whose home was the child\u2019s primary residence. The <em>Katzberg </em>court found this was not an abuse of discretion because the record showed the child\u2019s \u201c. . . transportation costs to and from school, as well as his incidental expenses, were borne exclusively by father; that the education trust that was being used to pay the cost of [the child\u2019s] school-related expenses represented the \u2018majority share of [the father\u2019s] personal inheritance\u2019 and would be \u2018completely depleted by the time of [the child\u2019s] graduation from high school\u2019; and that mother refused to sign the school contract assuming responsibility. It can be inferred that should an emergency arise, financial or otherwise, the father would be primarily responsible for taking whatever action was necessary to remedy the situation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 983.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In summary, if a parent desires credit for time the child is not physically with him or her, then the parent has the burden of producing admissible evidence demonstrating he or she is primarily responsible for that child during those challenged times.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relevant factors include: (1) who pays for transportation or who transports the child; (2) who is designated to respond to medical or other emergencies; (3) who is responsible for paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>tuition (if any) or incidental school expenses; and (4) who participates in school activities, fundraisers, or other school-related functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">It is often the case that the above categories, on any given day, are shared by both parents to some degree. We recognize many families have complex arrangements (and various backup plans) for dealing with transportation issues, school hours, and related extracurricular activities that can change on a daily basis. In recognition of this reality, courts are asked to \u201capproximate\u201d hours of responsibility and have the. discretion to apportion time for school hours depending on the particular parent\u2019s overall level of involvement in the school day routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In our case, the record showed the parents shared the responsibility of delivering and picking up their son from school, but there was little evidence regarding who was responsible for Justin during school hours. At issue was the allocation of approximately 1,260 hours, which computes to approximately 52 days. (This calculation is based on several assumptions. We recognize each school district is different, but estimate there are approximately 180 school days in a year. Due to Justin\u2019s age, we will assume a seven-hour school day. Of course, these figures can be adjusted according to proof at trial.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">However, allocating hours of \u201cresponsibility\u201d was not an issue before the court in <em>Rosen, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at page 824. In that case, a different panel from this court determined the court\u2019s award of spousal support and child support had to be recalculated because it was based on erroneous findings of the father\u2019s cash flow and ability to pay. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 815.) In so ruling, this court also rejected the father\u2019s additional argument that \u201cthe trial court calculated child support based upon an incorrect calculation of [the mother\u2019s] custody time with the children.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">In <em>Rosen, </em>the father was awarded primary physical custody of the children. The mother\u2019s visitation/custody hours were delineated in a schedule contained in the judgment. There was no dispute over whether the father had primary physical responsibility during any of the mother\u2019s designated hours of custody. Nor did the mother claim she was primarily responsible for the children at any time other than her scheduled custody hours. The parties only disputed whether the court miscalculated the mother\u2019s total hours with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>In the <em>Rosen </em>case, this court independently calculated the hours and concluded, \u201c[t]he trial court... did not err in calculating child support based upon a finding that [the mother] has custody 30 percent of the time.\u201d <em>(Rosen, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 826.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This court did not engage in a comprehensive discussion of the child support formula. Nowhere in the <em>Rosen </em>opinion did this court hold trial courts are to disregard the large body of case law and rules regarding calculation of the \u201cH%\u201d factor. <em>Rosen </em>was a rare case in which the term \u201chours of custody\u201d and \u201chours of primary responsibility\u201d were interchangeable. It should not be implied from the <em>Rosen </em>opinion that this court disagrees with or disapproves of the cases interpreting the \u201cH%\u201d factor to require calculations based on \u201c \u2018the parents\u2019 respective periods of primary physical \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the children rather than physical \u201ccustody.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Unfortunately, the trial court believed it was following the law <em>{Rosen) </em>when it mistakenly calculated the \u201cH%\u201d factor solely on Jose\u2019s awarded hours of physical custody.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears from the record that Jose should have been credited for at least some of the time his son spent at school. Accordingly, the court\u2019s orders to the contrary must be reversed and the matter remanded for the timeshare percentage to be recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">II-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The court\u2019s orders concerning Jose\u2019s (past and current) timeshare percentages are reversed. The trial court is directed to reconsider \u201c \u2018the parents\u2019 respective periods of primary physical \u201cresponsibility\u201d for . . .\u2019 \u201d Justin during school hours <em>(Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1160), as well as any other mathematical errors contained in its previous orders. The court\u2019s March 2003 ruling, changing the joint custody residential arrangement, is affirmed. Jose\u2019s request for attorney fees is denied. Sharon\u2019s motion to dismiss' and request for sanctions/attomey fees are denied.

There might be some overlap between [mother\u2019s] weekend custody and holidays that could reduce that percentage to 30 percent, the amount used by the court.

The court had previously determined: (1) Jose was listed (in addition to Sharon) on the school emergency card; (2) Jose often took Justin to school; (3) Jose chaperoned at school events and acted as a field trip supervisor; (4) Jose cared for Justin when he was ill; and (5) both parents worked 20 hours per semester \u201c. . . as active parents at the child\u2019s school[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1030.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
