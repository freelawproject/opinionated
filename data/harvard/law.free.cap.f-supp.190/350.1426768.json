Plaintiff asks this statutory three-Judge Court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325, to set aside the order and enjoin the Commission by mandatory injunction to hear and determine plaintiff\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>This controversy stems from plaintiff\u2019s submission of Section 7(c), 72 Stat. 573, \u201cgrandfather\u201d and \u201cinterim\u201d applications to the Interstate Commerce Commission seeking authority to transport citrus juices in tank vehicles from points in Florida and Texas to points in several northern states. The applications were dismissed by an order dated September 4, 1959, without a hearing. Plaintiff\u2019s petition for reconsideration was denied by the Commission on December 22, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The broad issue is whether an interstate commerce motor carrier in bona fide transportation of citrus juices prior to the 1958 Transportation Act has an absolute right, under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause of that Act, to continue transporting citrus juices without obtaining a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A short explanation of the issue in the light of the undisputed facts may be helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Interstate Commerce Act provides in Part II, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 301-327, for comprehensive regulation of motor carriers operating in interstate commerce. Basic to the Act is the prohibition contained in Sections 206 and 207 (49 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 306, 307), against motor carriers operating in interstate commerce without holding a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. This certificate requirement is waived in the situations set forth in Section 203(b), (49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(b) ). .The exemption involved in this controversy relates to agricultural commodities and as pertinent reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">\u201cSee. 203</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">\u201c(b) Nothing in this part, except the provisions of Section 204 relative to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation or standards of equipment shall be construed to include * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">\u201c(6) Motor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of * * agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof), * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP8\">Much litigation developed over the years as to whether certain products were agricultural commodities and hence \u201cexempt\u201d from the certificate requirement or were \u201cmanufactured products thereof\u201d and thus \u201cnon exempt\u201d from the requirement. The principal question involved the determination of how much processing could be done to an agricultural commodity before it changed to a \u201cmanufactured product thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">Section 7(a) of the 1958 Transportation Act amended Section 203(b) (6), (49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(b) (6) ), and made more specific the provisions concerning the \u201cexempt\u201d or \u201cnon exempt\u201d status of many commodities. The pertinent parts, of the amended section are contained in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citrus juices are listed as \u201cnon exempt\u201d in Commission Ruling 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>incorporated in the amended section. They have therefore been \u201cnon exempt\u201d -commodities since the 1958 Act became law. Consequently, a motor carrier operator who now desires to transport -citrus juices in interstate commerce is required to have a Certificate of Public 'Convenience and Necessity from the \u25a0Commission unless the carrier can prove that it was in bona fide transportation \u2022of citrus juices prior to the 1958 Act and that it has a right to continue transporting citrus juices by virtue of the \u25a0\u201cgrandfather\u201d clause enacted in Section 7(c) of the 1958 Transportation Act. The pertinent provisions of that section read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201c * * * if any person * * * was in bona fide operation on May 1, 1958, * * * in the transportation of property for compensation by motor vehicle <em>made subject to </em>the provisions of Part II of that Act by paragraph (a) of this section, * * the Interstate Commerce Commission shall without further proceedings issue a certificate or permit * * *\u00bb [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It is undisputed that plaintiff was a bona fide transporter of citrus juices pri- or to 1958. All parties agree that a basic requirement of the right to continue hauling a particular commodity under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause is that the commodity must have been \u201cexempt\u201d prior to the 1958 Act and was made \u201cnon exempt\u201d by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Plaintiff contends since there\u2019s no dispute that it was a bona fide hauler of \u2022citrus juices prior to 1958, the only issue for this court is whether citrus juices were \u201cexempt\u201d commodities prior to the 1958 Transportation Act amendment of Section 203(b) (6). If citrus juices were exempt, plaintiff claims the Commission must under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause issue plaintiff a certificate without proof of public convenience and necessity. Plaintiff argues that even though the Commission had held citrus juices to be \u201cnon exempt\u201d prior to 1958 in Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., Interpretation, 64 M.C.C. 455 (Div. 1, 1955), later U. S. Supreme Court and Federal District Court cases, see East Texas Motor Freight Lines v. Frozen Food Express, 1956, 351 U.S. 49, 76 S.Ct. 574, 100 L.Ed. 917; Frozen Food Express v. United States, D.C., 148 F.Supp. 399, affirmed Akron, C. &amp; Y. R. Co. v. Frozen Food Exp., 1957, 355 U.S. 6, 78 S.Ct. 38, 2 L.Ed.2d 22; I.C.C. v. Allen E. Kroblin, Inc., D.C.1953, 113 F.Supp. 599, make it clear that citrus juices would have been declared \u201cexempt\u201d had an appropriate controversy reached the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The defendants contend the issue of whether citrus juices were \u201cexempt\u201d pri- or to 1958 is not relevant to this proceeding. They argue that \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights were conferred only on the eleven commodities<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically listed in Section 7(a) as now being \u201cnon exempt.\u201d Defendants argue that the wording of Section 7(c) plus the Congressional intent as evidenced by committee reports indicates that only the eleven commodities listed were \u201cmade subject to\u201d the certificate requirement of Part II of the Act, and consequently \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights were given only to carriers of those specific commodities. Since citrus juices were not included in the commodities specifically listed in Section 7 (a), they submit the question of whether citrus juices were \u201cexempt\u201d prior to 1958 is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">We agree with the defendants that the first issue to be met is whether citrus juices were covered by the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause. If citrus juices were not included, we need not determine whether they were \u201cexempt\u201d prior to 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">It is axiomatic that Congress could include or exclude any commodities from the benefit of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause. Congress could have refused to include any \u201cgrandfather\u201d benefits in the 1958 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Act. Consequently, assuming that a particular commodity had been specifically held \u201cexempt\u201d prior to 1958 and then declared \u201cnon exempt\u201d by the 1958 Act, Congress could have excluded this particular commodity from \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights while giving the benefit to other commodities. We must therefore look to the statute to determine whether citrus juices were accorded \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The essential provisions of Sections 7 (c) and 7 (a) have been previously quoted in this memorandum. The primary question in resolving this dispute is the determination of what the words \u201cmade subject to\u201d mean in the context of the statute. Plaintiff contends the phrase means that all commodities in Section 7(a), including those in Ruling 107 in the first proviso are subjected to the requirements of Part II of the Act. Defendants argue that the only items \u201cmade subject to\u201d Part II are the eleven specified commodities in the second proviso. No determination as to the status of several of these commodities had ever been made, but Ruling 107 listed most of the eleven items as having been found \u201cexempt\u201d by the courts or the Commission, and defendants contend that these items were being brought back under regulation by Section 7(a). They argue that Congress gave \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights only to carriers which had been legitimately hauling these eleven commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We agree with the defendants\u2019 interpretation of Section 7(c). Congress did not have to make the items in Ruling 107 subject to the Act, with the exception of the eleven commodities which had either been declared \u201cexempt\u201d or on which no ruling had been made. It is perhaps true, as plaintiff argues, that Congress would have specifically afforded \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights to citrus juices had they been declared \u201cexempt\u201d in any appropriate controversy which reached the courts. Remembering, however, that Congress could limit \u201cgrandfather\u201d benefits as it chose, it matters only that Congress gave its approval to the Commission\u2019s characterization of citrus juices as \u201cnon exempt\u201d commodities. Citrus juices had been held \u201cnon exempt\u201d prior to 1958 by the Commission, Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., Interpretation, 64 M.C.C. 455 (Div. 1, 1955), and Congress was providing \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights only for carriers of those eleven commodities which had been \u201cexempt\u201d and were being specifically made \u201cnon exempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> Where the terms of a statute are not clear, we may look to the legislative history in an attempt to determine the intent of Congress. United States v. International Union, etc. UAW-CIO, 1957, 352 U.S. 567, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed. 2d 563; Woods v. Western Holding Corp., 8 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 655, 659. The committee reports clearly indicate Congressional intent in the enactment of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause. The report of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, H.R.Rep. No. 1922, 85th Cong. 2d Sess. 17 (1958) reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cThis amendment would halt further expansion of the scope of the exemption, and it would return to economic regulation the transportation of frozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables, coffee, tea, cocoa, hemp, imported wool and certain categories of domestic wool. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u201cAny person engaged on June 1, 1958, in trucking <em>the aforementioned commodities </em>which are returned to regulation by this amendment would be entitled upon application to a certificate or permit * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">The conference report, H.R.Rep. No. 2274, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1958) indicates further Congressional intent to provide \u201cgrandfather\u201d benefits only for the mentioned commodities as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">\u201cUnder the conference agreement the agricultural commodities exemption is frozen in accordance with ruling 107, referred to above, with the following modification, which is a compromise between the Senate and House provisions: Returned to economic regulation is the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>portation by motor vehicle of frozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables, cocoa beans, coffee beans, tea, bananas, hemp, wool imported from any foreign country, wool tops and noils and wool waste which has been carded, spun, woven, or knitted * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">\u201cUnder the House amendment any person engaged on June 1, 1958, in trucking the <em>aforementioned commodities </em>which are returned to economic regulation by this amendment would be entitled, upon application, to a certificate or permit allowing him, under regulation, to continue the transportation of the same commodities within the same areas or between the same points. The Senate bill used the date January 1, 1958. The conference agreement uses the date May 1, 1958.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">It is clear from this language that Congress intended only the eleven specified commodities, and not including citrus juices, to have \u201cgrandfather\u201d benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Plaintiff also argues that the Commission itself, Inland Motor Freight \u201cGrandfather\u201d Application; No. MC59077 (Sub. No. 33), 14 Fed.Carr. Cas., Para. 35,004 (C.C.H.) (Div. 1, Oct. 1960), determined that the words \u201cmade subject to\u201d should not be read in a restrictive sense. That decision relates solely to the situation where an otherwise \u201cexempt\u201d commodity loses its exemption when hauled with a \u201cnon exempt\u201d commodity in the same vehicle at the same time. The Inland case is not applicable to this controversy,</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Plaintiff lastly contends that the scope of review is limited to a consideration of the grounds set forth in the Commission\u2019s order for its decision. Plaintiff argues that the Commission order of September 4, 1959 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> dismissed plaintiff\u2019s applications solely for the reason that citrus juices were not \u201cexempt\u201d commodities prior to the 1958 Transportation Act. Consequently, plaintiff submits that, under the holding in the Chen-ery cases, S. E. C. v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626, and S. E. C. v. Chenery Corp., 1947, 332 U.S. 194, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995, this court cannot uphold the Commission on grounds other than those specified in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">In the first Chenery case, 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462, the Supreme Court reviewed an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission which refused to allow preferred stock acquired by management officials during a reorganization period to participate in the reorganization on an equal footing with all other preferred stock. The corporation involved was registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Commission had to determine whether the terms of the new stock issuance were \u201cfair and equitable\u201d or \u201cdetrimental to the interests of investors\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The Commission based its order on principles of equity as announced by the courts, but the Supreme Court held that the authorities cited were not sufficient to sustain the order and the ease was remanded to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The first Chenery case did hold that a reviewing court must judge an agency order only on the grounds on which the order was based, but the court limited this rule to determinations which the administrative agency alone is author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ized to make. The court, 318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, used these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aty\">\u201cIn confining our review to a judgment upon the validity of the grounds upon which the Commission itself based its action, we do not disturb the settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the result is correct \u2018although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.\u2019 Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245 [58 S.Ct. 154, 158, 82 L.Ed. 224]. The reason for this rule is obvious. It would be wasteful to send a case back to a lower court to reinstate a decision which it had already made but which the appellate court concluded should properly be based on another ground within the power of the appellate court to formulate. But it is also familiar appellate procedure that where the correctness of the lower court\u2019s decision depends upon a determination of fact which only a jury could make but which has not been made, the appellate court cannot take the place of the jury. Like considerations govern review of administrative orders. If an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment. For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative Agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We are not concerned here with a judgment which only the Interstate Commerce Commission can make. The expertness of the Commission does not make it better qualified than this court to interpret the phrase \u201cmade subject to\u201d involved in this action. The interpretation here is wholly different from what it is in the case where Congress specifically entrusts an administrative agency, because of its special competence, with the task of defining or interpreting general words<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or setting up standards or rules of conduct. We are interpreting the scope of a federal statute and this task is not peculiar to an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Having decided that the transportation of citrus juices was not afforded \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights under Section 7(c) of the 1958 Transportation Act, we need not determine whether citrus juices were \u201cexempt\u201d commodities prior to 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. \u201c(b) Nothing in this part, except the provisions of Section 204 relative to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation or standards of equipment shall be construed to include * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u201c(6) motor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of ordinary livestock, * * *, or agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof), * . * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWg\"><em>\u201cProvided, </em>That the words \u2018property consisting of ordinary livestock, * * \u00bb, or agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\u2019 as used herein shall include property shown as \u2018Exempt\u2019 in the \u2018Commodity List\u2019 incorporated in ruling numbered 107, March 19, 1958, Bureau of Motor Carriers, Interstate Commerce Commission, but shall not include property shown therein as \u2018Not Exempt\u2019 : <em>Provided further, however, </em>That notwithstanding the preceding proviso the words \u2018property consisting of ordinary livestock, * * *, or agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\u2019 shall not be deemed to include frozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables, cocoa beans, coffee beans, tea, bananas, or hemp, and wool imported from any foreign country, wool tops and noils, or wool waste (carded, spun, woven, or knitted). * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">. \u201cfrozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables, cocoa beans, coffee beans, tea, bananas, or hemp, and wool imported from any foreign country, wool tops and noils, or wool waste (carded, spun, woven, or knitted)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. \u201c * * * It further appearing, That in Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., Interpretation of Certificates, 64 M.C.C. 455, it was found that the term \u2018agricultural commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\u2019 as used in Section 203 (b) (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act does not include citrus juices;</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\"><em>\u201cAnd it further appearing, </em>That as citrus juices, in bulk, in tank vehicles, was not included in the term \u2018agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products thereof)\u2019, as used in Section 203(b) (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act prior to the Transportation Act of 1958:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\"><em>\u201cIt is ordered, </em>That the applications * * * be, and they are hereby, dismissed * \u2022 * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-5\">.
