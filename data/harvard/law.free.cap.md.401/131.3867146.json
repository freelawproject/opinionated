Sommer, an attorney, and Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy &amp; Ecker, P.A., his law firm, (collectively referred to in the singular as \u201cSommer\u201d) filed a complaint to enforce an attorney\u2019s lien against Lori D. Rhoads, petitioner. We granted certiorari to consider three questions. <em>Rhoads v. Sommer, </em>396 Md. 524, 914 A.2d 768 (2007). First, we consider whether respondents\u2019 right to a statutory attorney\u2019s hen, as set forth in Md.Code (1999, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-501 of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article, was waived by the language of the parties\u2019 retainer agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall hold that the retainer agreement did not waive respondents\u2019 right to a statutory attorney\u2019s lien under \u00a7 10-501. Second, we consider whether a \u00a7 10-501 attorney\u2019s lien survives a bankruptcy discharge even if no notice of the intent to claim a lien was given prior to the bankruptcy. We shall hold that the \u00a7 10-501 lien survives the bankruptcy discharge and that Sommer properly gave notice of the lien under Maryland Rule 2-652. Finally, we consider whether petitioner\u2019s constitutional due process rights were violated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>We shall hold that petitioner did not suffer any due process violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Rhoads, a financial analyst, began work for Standard Federal Savings Bank (SFSB) in September of 1987.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rhoads was terminated from her position as Director of Financial Analysis at Standard Federal Savings Association (SFSA), the successor to SFSB, on September 15, 1993. In December 1993, Rhoads initiated a charge of discrimination with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Maryland Commission on Human Rights, asserting that she was wrongfully discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In January 1994, Rhoads retained Sommer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to file an employment discrimination lawsuit against her former employers, SFSB and its successor SFSA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sommer filed a federal suit on behalf of Rhoads alleging violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2654 (2000) (FMLA), the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12117, 12203 (2000) (ADA), the common-law duty to provide a safe workplace, and the county human rights law arising from Rhoads\u2019 exposure to secondhand smoke in her workplace and her employer\u2019s allegedly retaliatory termination after she threatened to file an ADA discrimination claim. <em>See Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., </em>257 F.3d 373, 377-79 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>In February 1997, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland granted summary judgment to the former employer on nine of Rhoads\u2019 ten claims including Rhoads\u2019 ADA claims\u2014for failure to make reasonable accommodations, discriminatory termination, and retaliation\u2014as well as the state law claims. <em>See Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>956 F.Supp. 1239 (D.Md.1997). A jury subsequently found in the employer\u2019s favor on the remaining FMLA claim. <em>See Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., </em>257 F.3d at 376. Sommer filed various post-trial motions on Rhoads\u2019 behalf, including a motion for judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">On March 27, 1998, Rhoads filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In her bankruptcy schedules, Rhoads listed Fred S. Sommer, Esq. as a creditor holding an unsecured nonpriority claim in the amount of $190,000 for legal services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sommer was individually identified as a creditor and was served with Rhoads\u2019 petition, but he did not file any response or other claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Rhoads also disclosed on her petition\u2019s statement of financial affairs that she was party to a \u201c[cjivil claim for damages,\u201d which had resulted in a \u201cjudgment for defendant 3/4/96, time for appeal has not expired.\u201d Any action on the civil case, however, was automatically stayed when Rhoads filed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>After reviewing Rhoads\u2019 petition, the bankruptcy trustee concluded there was \u201cno property available for distribution from the estate.\u201d Based on this conclusion, the trustee filed a report of no distribution on May 8, 1998, releasing to Rhoads any interest she might have in the stayed litigation. On July 2, 1998, the bankruptcy court granted Rhoads a discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">From April to August 1998, Rhoads and Sommer exchanged several letters concerning whether Sommer would continue to represent Rhoads. The correspondence began with Sommer asking whether Rhoads wanted him to file a reply brief or take some other action on her behalf regarding her motion for judgment as a matter of law and her motion for new trial, originally filed in March 1998 and now active again because the bankruptcy trustee relinquished her claim. Sommer stated that he was \u201cwilling to file a reply brief on the motion for new trial (and if the motion is granted, try the case),\u201d but that he was \u201cnot willing to incorporate into the reply brief [Rhoads\u2019] suggested revisions.\u201d In response, Rhoads asserted that the reply brief should \u201cinclude all relevant arguments available to us\u201d but that \u201cit is preferable to have some response rather than no response at all.\u201d Thus, Sommer filed the reply brief on May 27, 1998. On August 12, 1998, the motions for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial were denied. <em>See Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., </em>257 F.3d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Sommer discussed with Rhoads an appeal of the district court judgment. On August 14, 1998, Sommer wrote Rhoads that he was \u201cwilling to bring an appeal challenging the special verdict form used\u201d to try the FMLA claim, and, pending further research, <em>\u201cmight </em>also be willing to challenge the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling\u201d dismissing the ADA claim and limiting the period of back pay. Sommer stated that he was \u201cnot willing to raise any other issues or arguments on appeal.\u201d In addition, Sommer proposed that Rhoads \u201cwould remain responsible for all unpaid fees and costs incurred to date and any future fees and costs, pursuant to the terms of our original fee agreement.\u201d Rhoads responded that \u201c[b]efore being able to seriously consider your letter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>today, I must know whether you intend to sent [sic] the record straight on the malicious verbal and written attacks that have been perpetrated against me by the Defense.\u201d Rhoads also questioned, inter alia, whether a new retainer agreement would revive the debt that she believed had been discharged in bankruptcy. In response, Sommer stated that although he did \u201cnot intend to seek recovery from you of the unpaid attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred prior to bankruptcy filing,\u201d he still had \u201ca statutory lien for those fees and costs against any recovery you obtain in this case,\u201d and that this lien was not discharged in bankruptcy. Disagreements between Sommer and Rhoads continued. As a result, Sommer officially withdrew as Rhoads\u2019 attorney, effective August 29, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On September 28, 1998, Sommer sent notice of his attorney\u2019s lien to Rhoads and to counsel for the FDIC. Sommer stated that pursuant to \u00a7 10-501 and Md. Rule of Civil Procedure 2-652, he \u201chas a lien on any judgment, award, or settlement\u201d Rhoads may receive in connection with the instant litigation, <em>Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>Civil Action No. B-94-1548 (D.Md. 1998). Sommer asserted a right to \u201cno less than (i) $159,729.74 or (ii) the amount of any attorney\u2019s fees awarded for legal services provided by Sommer prior to August 28, 1998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On September 9, 1998, Rhoads filed notice that she was appealing the judgment of the district court. Rhoads proceeded with the appeal largely <em>pro se. </em>On July 12, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court on one issue, holding that Rhoads had presented evidence sufficient to preclude a grant of summary judgment to the employer on Rhoads\u2019 retaliation claim under the ADA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Rhoads, </em>257 F.3d at 394. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Fourth Circuit remanded the case for a new trial on that cause of action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Rhoads continued to represent herself during the second trial on her remaining retaliation claim under the ADA. In December 2002, more than four years after Sommer withdrew as Rhoads\u2019 attorney, a federal jury found that Rhoads proved \u201c \u2018by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons given by the FDIC for her termination were false and that retaliation for her protected conduct under the ADA was the true reason for that termination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rhoads v. FDIC., </em>286 F.Supp.2d 532, 537 (D.Md.2003) (quoting the Verdict Form). The jury awarded Rhoads damages of $120,006. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As a prevailing party in an ADA action, Rhoads then moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (2000); <em>see also Mammano v. Pittston Co., </em>792 F.2d 1242, 1244 (4th Cir.1986). Rhoads requested a total award of $175,744.99, which included fees and expenses for legal work performed by her first attorney, Sommer, and herself. In her memorandum in support of her claim for attorney\u2019s fees, Rhoads cited Sommer\u2019s \u201cstatutory lien in the amount of $159,729.74\u201d and stated that she had already paid Sommer a total of $20,398.52. Rhoads asserted that during the five years of Sommer\u2019s representation he billed \u201capproximately 270 hours per year\u201d and that \u201cthe number of hours Sommer expended on this case was, in all regards, reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In June 2003, Sommer moved to intervene for the limited purpose of being heard on the fee issue. Sommer asserted two interests in the lawsuit: (1) an interest in any attorney\u2019s fee awarded to Rhoads for his work; and (2) an interest in any final judgment entered by the court, by virtue of the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ney\u2019s lien. <em>See Rhoads, </em>286 F.Supp.2d at 544. The FDIC responded by opposing Sommer\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The federal district court denied Rhoads\u2019 claim for fees and costs and denied Sommer\u2019s motion to intervene. <em>Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>286 F.Supp.2d at 543, 545. The district court agreed that Rhoads was a prevailing party, but considered several factors in determining whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees should be granted to Rhoads for her former counsel\u2019s work in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In its ruling, the federal district court first stated that any entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees belonged to Rhoads alone, rather than her attorney or former attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 542. The court then considered whether Sommer performed services that contributed to Rhoads\u2019 success in the lawsuit. Noting that Rhoads repeatedly asserted that her former counsel performed no services that contributed to the ultimate success of the litigation, the court concluded that Rhoads was not entitled to receive attorney\u2019s fees for any work performed by her former counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 542-43. The court also concluded that since \u201cthe purpose of awarding attorney\u2019s fees is to enable plaintiffs to retain \u2018competent counsel,\u2019 \u201d it would be improper to allow fees when Rhoads repeatedly characterized her former counsel as incompetent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Even assuming that the district court were to allow fees, it pointed out that the fees allowed would be very small because \u201cthe prevailing party is not entitled to fees incurred in pursuing unsuccessful claims\u201d and \u201c[o]f the approximately ten original claims, only one was ultimately successful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541 n. 7. Thus, due to Sommer\u2019s withdrawal \u201cbefore Rhoads pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>vailed at the Fourth Circuit and second trial,\u201d Sommer \u201cwould need to establish that [his] efforts, and not those of Rhoads or <em>amicus, </em>produced the final judgment in favor of Rhoads.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Finally, the court analyzed whether the award of fees would be unjust. The court noted that, shortly after the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Rhoads filed a malpractice suit against Sommer in state court, praying for recovery of fees paid to Sommer and dismissal of his lien. <em>Id. </em>at 543. The federal district court acknowledged that if Rhoads\u2019 malpractice suit against former counsel is successful, she could potentially recoup all of the attorney\u2019s fees she paid to Sommer. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Rhoads could receive a windfall if she were to be awarded fees in both forums. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Furthermore, the court noted that Rhoads herself proffered that she owes nothing to Sommer as a result of her bankruptcy discharge. The court did not opine on the effect of the bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge on Sommer\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien, but acknowledge that it \u201cwould be manifestly unjust to award her attorney\u2019s fees to cover expenses that already have been discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For all of those reasons, the federal district court denied Rhoads\u2019 motion for attorney fees and, given that, determined that Sommer\u2019s interest in the fees was moot. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Sommer also asserted, in his motion to intervene, an interest in any final judgment entered by virtue of an attorney\u2019s lien. The court noted that Rhoads and her former counsel did not state that their fee arrangement addressed entitlement to a statutory attorney\u2019s lien. The court noted that the interest to the attorney\u2019s lien was in dispute, but concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over an action to execute a statutory attorney\u2019s lien. <em>Id. </em>at 544. Moreover, the court reasoned that its denial of fees would not impair or impede any interest Sommer may have by way of the attorney\u2019s lien. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court denied Sommer\u2019s motion to intervene and made no holding regarding the statutory attorney\u2019s lien. Rhoads\u2019 second appeal to the Fourth Circuit was unsuccessful and the district court\u2019s judgment became final. <em>See Rhoads v. FDIC, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>286 F.Supp.2d at 545 (D.Md.2003), <em>aff'd, </em>94 Fed.Appx. 187 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On December 20, 2004, Sommer filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking a declaration \u201cthat the attorney\u2019s lien is valid and enforceable against the\u201d $120,006 judgment Rhoads obtained in the second federal district court trial, and asking the court to \u201cenforce the attorney\u2019s lien against\u201d that judgment. Sommer claimed a lien of $159,729.74, the same amount Sommer claimed when he gave notice to Rhoads and the FDIC after he withdrew as counsel in 1998. Along with the complaint, Sommer filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to ensure payment of his fees from any FDIC payment made to satisfy the judgment in favor of Rhoads. In response, the Circuit Court ordered the FDIC to pay $40,000 of the $120,000 judgment into the court registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Rhoads moved to dismiss Sommer\u2019s lawsuit. While that motion was pending, Sommer moved for summary judgment. After briefing and oral argument, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted judgment in favor of Rhoads, treating her motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. The Circuit Court noted that \u201cgenerally an attorney\u2019s lien is perfected upon the commencement of the representation. Therefore, such liens typically would not be extinguished in bankruptcy.\u201d The court concluded, however, that a plain reading of the retainer agreement led it to conclude that Sommer had waived his right to a statutory lien in the event that he did not obtain a judgment in favor of his client. The court held that Sommer agreed to forego his statutory lien rights by agreeing that, if his representation did not yield a judgment or settlement in Rhoads\u2019 favor, she would not be obligated to pay more than $500 per month toward the outstanding fee balance. The court noted that \u201cin general [Sommer\u2019s] position is the correct one,\u201d and that \u201cit is only because of the wording of this particular agreement that the court has concluded that [Sommer] waived his right to assert the lien and therefore, his claim was extinguished.\u201d Sommer filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>On October 31, 2006, the Court of Special Appeals reversed. <em>Sommer v. Rhoads, </em>171 Md.App. 392, 910 A.2d 514 (2006). The Court of Special Appeals reviewed the parties\u2019 retainer agreement, Maryland attorney lien law, and bankruptcy law in its analysis. The court concluded that nothing in the retainer agreement could reasonably be interpreted to mean that Sommer waived his right to assert a lien after a loss in the first trial and his later withdrawal because no language in the agreement says or implies such a waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 910 A.2d at 522-23. The court held also that the lien took effect upon the commencement of Sommer\u2019s services, was not lost by Sommer\u2019s failure to serve written notice under Md. Rule 2-652 before the bankruptcy petition, was not dependent on the viability of an <em>in personam </em>claim, and was not extinguished in the bankruptcy despite the fact that Sommer did not file proof of claim in bankruptcy. <em>Id. </em>at 408-17, 910 A.2d at 523-29. Furthermore, the court concluded that Rhoads\u2019 procedural due process rights were not violated. <em>Id. </em>at 419-29, 910 A.2d at 530-36. Rhoads filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Rhoads v. Sommer, </em>396 Md. 524, 914 A.2d 768 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Rhoads and Sommer entered into a retainer agreement on January 31, 1994. The agreement provides for both a \u201cguaranteed fee\u201d and, in the event that Rhoads obtains a judgment or settlement in her favor, a \u201ccontingent premium.\u201d The agreement states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\"><em>\u201cGuaranteed Fee. </em>Client will pay Attorney $100 per hour as a Guaranteed Fee for all hours worked. This Guaranteed Fee is payable regardless of whether a judgment or settlement is obtained in Client\u2019s favor. Attorney will obtain authorization from Client in any calendar month that he anticipates working in excess of 10 hours. Attorney has advised Client that, absent settlement, he anticipates it is very likely that he will be required to work in excess of 10 hours in many months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>\u201cContingent Premium. </em>In the event that Client obtains a judgment or settlement in her favor, Client will pay Attorney a Contingent Premium, <em>in addition to the Guaranteed Fee, </em>of $100 per hour for all hours worked. The Contingent Premium shall not result in total fees (i.e., the Guaranteed Fee and the Contingent Premium) exceeding 30 percent of the Total Recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">\u201cThe Total Recovery is the total amount recovered by settlement or judgment, including any amount recovered as interest, attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages with respect to any claims brought or asserted on behalf of Client, whether brought or asserted separately or together, and whether brought or asserted in a lawsuit, a charge with an administrative agency (including Client\u2019s pending EEOC and Department of Labor charges) or informally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">With respect to the payment of fees and costs, the Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\"><em>\u201cMonthly Payments. </em>Client will be billed monthly for all fees and costs incurred. Except for certain additional fee payments set forth below, Client will be required to pay within 30 days of the monthly bill:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u201c\u2014Either the balance of the fees outstanding or $500 toward the outstanding balance, whichever is less, <em>plus </em>\u201c\u2014all costs advanced by Attorney</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">\u201cIn addition to the $500 monthly installment toward fees, Client will also be required to pay on a monthly basis for all hours worked in excess of 25 in a calendar month, <em>provided </em>that Attorney has obtained authorization for Client from such hours....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">\u201cPayment Upon Receipt Of Judgment Or Settlement Proceeds Or Conclusion Of Case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">\u201cAttorney will be entitled to payment of all fees and costs owed upon Client\u2019s receipt of the proceeds of a judgment or settlement upon the conclusion of any action brought by Attorney upon Client\u2019s behalf. If there is no judgment or settlement in favor of Client, Client will pay the outstanding balance to Attorney in $500 monthly installments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>\u201cTermination. </em>Attorney may withdraw his representation of Client if Client fails to pay any amount owed when due. In such event, Client will remain responsible for all outstanding charges, and such charges will become due and payable immediately, or payable on a mutually acceptable payment schedule to include interest at the prime rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">\u201cAttorney may withdraw his representation of Client for any other reason, subject to any required court approval, and upon reasonable notice. In such event, Client will remain responsible for all outstanding charges in accordance with the monthly payment schedule set forth above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cClient may terminate Attorney\u2019s representation at any time for any reason. In the event that Client does so, Client will remain responsible for all outstanding charges, and such charges will become due and payable immediately, or payable on a mutually acceptable payment schedule to include interest at the prime rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Before this court, petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred by reversing the trial court\u2019s holding that the plain language of the retainer agreement precludes preservation of an attorney\u2019s lien. Rhoads asserts that the language of the agreement limits Sommer\u2019s right to assert a lien under \u00a7 10-501 in the event of an unsuccessful conclusion to the initial trial and, therefore, Sommer was limited to collecting the outstanding attorney\u2019s fees in $500 monthly installments from Rhoads <em>in personam. </em>Rhoads argues also that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Sommer could assert an attorney\u2019s lien after Rhoads\u2019 bankruptcy discharge and without pre-bankruptcy notice.

Sommer asserts also that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Rhoads\u2019 discharge of her <em>in personam </em>debts does not affect Sommer\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien, which is an <em>in rem </em>claim created at the time the action began. Furthermore, Sommer asserts that notice of the lien is not required before a bankruptcy case is filed because the lien was already in existence and Md. Rule 2-652(b) governs only the enforcement or execution of the lien. Finally, Sommer contends that the attorney lien statute is constitutional and that its application in this case does not violate Rhoads\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Whether summary judgment was entered properly is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.

Rule 2-652(b). The rule states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">\u201c(b) Statutory lien. An attorney who has a lien under Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7 10-501, may assert the lien by serving a written notice by certified mail or personal delivery upon the client and upon each person against whom the lien is to be enforced. The notice shall claim the lien, state the attorney\u2019s interest in the action, proceeding, settlement, judgment, or award, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>inform the client or other person to hold any money payable or property passing to the client relating to the action, proceeding, settlement, judgment, or award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201c(c) Adjudication of rights and lien disputes.

If a lien is asserted pursuant to this Rule and a related action has not been filed in a circuit court of this State, the attorney, the attorney\u2019s client, or any person who has received a notice pursuant to section (b) of this Rule may file a complaint with a circuit court to adjudicate the rights of the parties in relation to the lien, including the attorney\u2019s entitlement to a lien, any dispute as to the papers subject to a lien under section (a) of this Rule, and the amount of the attorney\u2019s claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Maryland\u2019s statutory attorney\u2019s lien takes effect upon the commencement of representation. \u00a7 10-501(a) (\u201can attorney at law <em>has </em>a lien on: (1) a cause of action ... <em>from the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). There is no question that Sommer represented Rhoads in the federal district court proceeding. Therefore, an inchoate statutory lien was effective from the time Sommer began his efforts on behalf of Rhoads.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Rhoads argues, however, that the language of the retainer agreement provides that Sommer waived his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>assert a lien if Rhoads lost at the first trial. Rhoads relies on the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">\u201cAttorney will be entitled to payment of all fees and costs owed upon Client\u2019s receipt of the proceeds of a judgment or settlement upon the conclusion of any action brought by Attorney upon Client\u2019s behalf. If there is no judgment or settlement in favor of Client, Client will pay the outstanding balance to Attorney in $500 monthly installments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Rhoads interprets \u201cthe conclusion of the action brought by the Attorney upon Client\u2019s behalf\u2019 to refer to the judgment entered in favor of the FDIC after the first district court trial. Thus, Rhoads interprets this portion of the agreement to mean that Sommer did not have a security interest, whether in the form of lien or otherwise, in what remained of Rhoads\u2019 cause of action because there was not a judgment or settlement in her favor at the conclusion of the initial trial. Therefore, Rhoads asserts, the agreement provides that Sommer was limited to collecting the $500 monthly payments from Rhoads <em>in personam. </em>Moreover, because the <em>in personam </em>debt was discharged in bankruptcy, Rhoads argues that Sommer has no remaining claim on the judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We disagree with Rhoads\u2019 reading of the retainer agreement. As we have often stated, Maryland adheres to the objective interpretation of contracts; because the agreement is clear and unambiguous, we give effect to its plain meaning. <em>See, e.g., Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16-17, 919 A.2d 700, 709-710, (2007); <em>Slice v. Carozza Properties, Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A.2d 687, 693 (1958). Nothing in the language of the agreement can reasonably be interpreted to mean that Sommer waived his right to assert a lien if Rhoads did not win at the first trial. First, the agreement makes no mention of a waiver of the right to assert a lien; in fact, it makes no mention of a lien at all. We do not presume that the contract intended to waive a statutory right when there is no waiver in the language of the agreement. Furthermore, nothing in \u00a7 10-501 or Md. Rule 2-652 requires that a retainer agreement note the right to an attorney\u2019s lien, and such requirement will not be inferred. Maryland\u2019s statutory attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ney\u2019s lien takes effect upon the commencement of representation regardless of whether the right to an attorney\u2019s lien is addressed in the parties\u2019 retainer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Second, the Party\u2019s agreement at no point refers merely to the initial trial, or a judgment or settlement from the initial trial. Instead, the agreement consistently uses language such as \u201cin the event that Client obtains a judgment or settlement in her favor\u201d and \u201cClient\u2019s receipt of the proceeds of a judgment or settlement upon the <em>conclusion of any action brought </em>by Attorney upon Client\u2019s behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (emphasis added). The plain meaning of this language is that it refers to any judgment or settlement that results at the final conclusion of the lawsuit that Sommer filed in district court on Rhoads\u2019 behalf in 1994, not merely the conclusion of the initial trial where judgment was entered in favor of the FDIC. Indeed, the 1994 action was concluded in 2004 when Rhoads\u2019 second appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was unsuccessful, not when Rhoads lost her initial district court trial. We note also that the language in the retainer agreement corresponds with the language in \u00a7 10-501(a), which states that an attorney at law has a lien on \u201ca settlement, judgment, or award that a client receives as a result of legal services that the attorney at law performs.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u00a7 10-501(a)(2). The language of \u00a7 10-501(a)(2) makes clear that an attorney may claim a lien on legal services performed\u2014at any time throughout the action\u2014so long as there is a judgment, settlement, or other award.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Finally, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court relied improperly on the clause regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>$500 per month payment schedule. The agreement states, \u201c[i]f there is no judgment or settlement in favor of Client, Client will pay the outstanding balance to Attorney in $500 monthly installments.\u201d The Circuit Court interpreted this language only in the context of the first trial and concluded that, because judgment was entered initially for the FDIC, Rhoads\u2019 was relieved of any obligation to pay the entire sum outstanding in the event she obtained a judgment in her favor at some future date upon a retrial. We disagree for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">As we have noted, the judgment in favor of the FDIC at the district court was not the conclusion of the action. Because there was a judgment in Rhoads\u2019 favor, this language is not applicable. In no way does this language expressly waive Sommer\u2019s right to assert a lien against the subsequent judgment in Rhoads\u2019 favor. The agreement provided specifically that monthly payments of $500 were expected, and it is reasonable to structure a retainer agreement such that a guaranteed and immediate stream of $500 payments is received if there is not a settlement or judgment in the client\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is no inconsistency between payment by installments over a period of time and holding a security for payments, <em>ie., </em>a lien against the cause of action. Finally, although the Circuit Court reasoned that a monthly payment schedule of $500 per month was inconsistent with the notion that the payment would be secured by any judgment and, therefore, inferred a waiver, we conclude that there is nothing in \u00a7 10-501 or Md. Rule 2-652 that precludes the filing of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>lien where the retainer agreement also provides for a monthly-payment obligation. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Rule 2-652 allows the Circuit Court to direct that, for example, the appropriate part of the amount owed under the judgment or settlement be paid into court or an escrow account and held as security or paid to the attorney in monthly increments.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As we have noted previously, the attorney\u2019s lien was created \u201cto protect attorneys from being cheated by their clients by preventing the clients from receiving the fruits of recoveries without paying for the valuable services by which the recoveries were obtained.\u201d <em>Consolidated Construction v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 461, 813 A.2d 260, 277 (2002) (quoting <em>Ashman v. Shecter, </em>196 Md. 168, 174, 76 A.2d 139, 142 (1950)). Sommer provided legal services that contributed to the judgment in Rhoads\u2019 favor. We hold that Sommer has the right to assert an attorney\u2019s lien on Rhoads\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Our conclusion that Sommer may assert the lien, however, does not address the question of what portion of the judgment resulted from Sommer\u2019s legal services. The Maryland statute states clearly that an attorney may assert a lien from the time the action or proceeding begins on a \u201cjudgment or award that a client receives <em>as a result of legal services </em>that the attorney at law performs.\u201d \u00a7 10-501 (emphasis added). Sommer is entitled to assert an attorney\u2019s lien on the judgment, even though he was not representing the client at the time of judgment, because he provided some legal services <em>{e.g., </em>filing the initial complaint, at a minimum) that contributed to the judgment. We leave the question of what portion of the judgment was a result of legal services performed by Sommer to be addressed by the Circuit Court upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Whether a \u00a7 10-501 attorney\u2019s lien survives a bankruptcy discharge even if no notice of the intent to claim a lien was given prior to the bankruptcy is a matter of first impression before this court. Rhoads argues that any debt owed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Sommer under the retainer agreement and that could have been redeemed under a \u00a7 10-501 lien was discharged in bankruptcy before any lien was claimed or created. Sommer asserts that the lien came into existence at the beginning of his representation, that notice is required only to assert the lien, and Rhoads\u2019 bankruptcy had no effect on his ability to enforce an <em>in rem </em>lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We consider first when the lien is established and what notice is required, if any, to establish the lien. As we have noted, the plain language of \u00a7 10-501 states that \u201can attorney at law <em>has </em>a lien on: (1) a cause of action or proceeding of a client of the attorney at law from the time the cause of action arises or the proceeding begins ...\u201d (emphasis added). Rhoads asserts that this language creates only a right to assert a lien, as opposed to an actual enforceable lien, and that \u00a7 10-501 requires an attorney to give notice under Rule 2-652 and bring an action to establish the lien. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 10-501 establishes a lien from the inception of a cause of action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, \u00a7 10\u2014501(d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>entitled \u201cExecution\u201d states that an attorney may bring an action under the lien only in accordance with the rules that the Court of Appeals adopts. Under Md. Rule 2-652, \u201c[a]n attorney <em>who has a lien </em>under [\u00a7 10-501] <em>may assert the lien </em>by serving a written notice by certified mail or personal delivery upon the client and upon each person against whom the lien is to be enforced.\u201d (emphasis added). Rule 2-652 presumes that an attorney actually has a lien, as set forth in \u00a7 10-501, and that the attorney merely is asserting the lien in accordance with this Court\u2019s rules. Nothing in Rule 2-652 requires an attorney to perfect the lien or lose the lien for failing to serve written notice within a particular time or before a bankruptcy proceeding. Indeed, the Rule presumes a lien exists and provides for a method to enforce or assert the lien. Thus, we hold that Sommer\u2019s lien was created before Rhoads filed her bankruptcy case, even though Sommer had not asserted the lien by providing notice in accordance with Rule 2-652 until after the bankruptcy discharge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Before analyzing whether Sommer\u2019s lien survived Rhoads\u2019 bankruptcy discharge, we consider whether the \u00a7 10-501 attorney\u2019s lien is an <em>in rem </em>or an <em>in personam </em>claim. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has noted that \u201cproceedings to enforce such [attorney\u2019s] lien[s] are considered as proceedings <em>in rem </em>and may be enforced only against the proceeds of a judgment secured in the particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Hoxsey v. Hoffpauir, </em>180 F.2d 84, 87 (5th Cir.1950), <em>cert denied, </em>339 U.S. 953, 70 S.Ct. 841, 94 L.Ed. 1366. We agree. An attorney\u2019s lien under \u00a7 10-501(b) is an action <em>in rem. </em>Although \u00a7 10-501 (b) recognizes the lien only \u201cto the extent that, under a specific agreement between an attorney at law and a client, the client owes the attorney at law a fee or other compensation for legal services that produced the settlement, judgment, or award\u201d this requirement does not change the <em>in rem </em>nature of the claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">As Rhoads notes, a bankruptcy discharge releases the debtor from <em>personal </em>liability for pre-petition debts. Rhoads listed Sommer as a creditor holding an unsecured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>nonpriority claim in the amount of $190,000 for legal services. This <em>in personam </em>claim was discharged after her bankruptcy filing. The discharge did not affect Sommer\u2019s <em>in rem </em>claim, however. <em>See Johnson v. Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 2154, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991) (holding that, in a case involving a mortgage on real property, a bankruptcy discharge \u201cextinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim\u2014 namely, an action against the debtor <em>in </em>personam\u2014while leaving intact another\u2014namely, an action against the debtor <em>in rem.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In her bankruptcy filing, Rhoads acknowledged an asset that could potentially subject her to an <em>in rem </em>claim, namely, that she was party to an active civil case. The bankruptcy trustee concluded there was no property available for distribution from the estate, and released to Rhoads any interest she might have in the stayed litigation. Because the trustee relinquished the action back to Rhoads, the property became unaffected by the bankruptcy and was available to debtors or creditors. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 506(d), 522(c)(2) (2000); <em>see Hernandez v. Suburban Hosp., </em>319 Md. 226, 236-37, 572 A.2d 144 (1990)(\u201c \u2018We instead follow the majority of courts which hold that the Bankruptcy Code and its legislative history plainly establish the better rule of law\u2014that valid liens that have not been disallowed or avoided survive the bankruptcy discharge of the underlying debt.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Estate of Lellock v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>811 F.2d 186, 189 (3rd Cir.1987); <em>see also In re Moody, </em>277 B.R. 858, 861 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.2001) (\u201cThe effect of abandonment by a trustee is to divest the bankruptcy estate of control over the abandoned property and revest title in the debtor. In doing so, the property becomes part of the debtor\u2019s non-bankruptcy estate, just as if no bankruptcy occurred.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Saltarelli &amp; Steponovich v. Douglas, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1, 5, 46 Cal.Rptr.2d 683, 686 (1995) (\u201c[T]he discharge of an obligation to pay an attorney for prepetition legal services does not prevent the attorney from enforcing a lien securing payment for those services unless the lien has been disallowed or avoided during bankruptcy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Rhoads argues that Sommer was notified that his claim for legal services was classified as unsecured and that Sommer failed to file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. Sommer did not contest the unsecured <em>in personam </em>debt and, as we have discussed, he cannot recover it because it was discharged in bankruptcy. Because the <em>in rem </em>claim was abandoned and reverted to a status such that no bankruptcy had occurred, Sommer was not obligated to file any proof of claim in the bankruptcy estate in order to make his statutory attorney\u2019s lien claim. As a result, Sommer\u2019s lien, an <em>in rem </em>claim on any judgment or recovery in Rhoads\u2019 civil action, survived Rhoads\u2019 bankruptcy discharge of her <em>in personam </em>debts even though notice of the lien under Md. Rule 2-652 was not provided until after the bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We turn to whether petitioner\u2019s constitutional due process rights were violated. The federal due process claim asserted here is based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; the State claim derives from Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We have previously held that these two provisions \u201chave the same meaning; and ... Supreme Court interpretations of the federal provision are authority for interpretation of Article 24.\u201d <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 415-416, 474 A.2d 191, 203 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Rhoads asserts that a statute that creates a lien \u201cwithout notice and opportunity for a prior hearing\u201d deprives the owner of her property without procedural due process. Rhoads argues that for \u00a7 10-501 to be constitutional, no lien can \u201cexist\u201d until the opposing party has notice and an opportunity to be heard in opposition. Sommer responds that the statute is constitutional and that Rhoads did not suffer a violation of due process rights because (1) she knew of the attorney\u2019s lien several years before Sommer\u2019s complaint was filed, (2) Rhoads was not deprived of a substantial property interest, and (3) Md. Rule 2-652 provides both notice and a mechanism to adjudicate the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Although constitutional due process is not a technical concept, there are established principles for analyzing whether the procedural protections demanded by a particular situation are present. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The analysis focuses on the governmental and private interests that are affected. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, it is well accepted that \u201cidentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. To invoke protections of procedural due process, however, a party must show that state action has been involved to deprive that party of a substantial interest in property. <em>Golden Sands Club v. Waller, </em>313 Md. 484, 488 n. 4, 545 A.2d 1332, 1334 n. 4 (1988) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We consider whether the imposition of an attorney\u2019s lien statute deprived Rhoads of a substantial property right. In <em>Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>(1976), we held that Maryland\u2019s mechanics\u2019 lien statute<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> was unconstitutional because it allowed prejudgment seizures of a debtor\u2019s property \u201cwithout notice and opportunity for a prior hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 353 A.2d at 225. Rhoads asserts that the attorney\u2019s lien statute, like the mechanics\u2019 lien statute, creates a lien \u201cwithout notice and opportunity for a prior hearing.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The mechanics\u2019 lien in <em>Barry </em>was created as soon as work was performed or materials were supplied, with no requirement of prior notice to the owner. Under the statute, \u201ca lien is created and attaches to the property as soon as work is performed or materials are supplied, and lasts until \u2018the expiration of 180 days after the work has been finished or the materials furnished, although no claim has been filed for them (with the clerk of the court).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 353 A.2d at 225-26 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In order to secure a mechanics\u2019 lien, the statute provided that the contractor or subcontractor must file a claim, within 180 days after the work is finished or the materials furnished, containing specified information concerning the claim with the clerk of the circuit court of the county where the property is located, at which time the lien was recorded on a special \u201cMechanics\u2019 Lien Docket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 353 A.2d at 226.

We reviewed Supreme Court precedents and concluded that, \u201clacking extraordinary circumstances, statutory prejudgment creditor remedies which even temporarily deprive a debtor of a significant property interest without notice and an opportunity for a prior probable-cause-type hearing are ... unconstitutional____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 353 A.2d at 231; <em>see North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 606, 95 S.Ct. 719, 722, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975); <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 614, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 1903-04, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974); <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 96-97, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 2002-03, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 338-42, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 1821-23, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). Thus, we held that the mechanics\u2019 lien statute was unconstitutional because it permitted an owner to be deprived of a significant property interest without notice or a prior hearing. <em>Barry, </em>277 Md. at 31, 353 A.2d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The attorney\u2019s lien at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>differs in several important ways from the mechanics\u2019 lien at issue in <em>Barry. </em>At the outset, we note that the attorney\u2019s lien applies only to parties\u2014the attorney and the client\u2014who are in a contractual relationship with each other, whereas in <em>Barry </em>the subcontractor did not have a contractual relationship with the owner. <em>Barry, </em>277 Md. at 21, 353 A.2d at 226. Additionally, the attorney\u2019s lien differs from the mechanics\u2019 lien because, although the attorney\u2019s hen commences upon the start of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>representation, the attorney\u2019s lien is <em>inchoate </em>until proceeds from a settlement, judgment, or award exist to which the lien can attach. In order to execute the lien, the procedures set forth in Md. Rule 2-652(b) must be followed. \u00a7 10-501(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The provisions of Md. Rule 2-652(b) and (c) provide for notice and an opportunity to be heard. Importantly, the Rule requires that an attorney assert a lien by \u201cserving a written notice by certified mail or personal delivery upon the client and upon each person against whom the lien is to be enforced.\u201d Md. Rule 2-652(b). Only <em>after </em>providing this notice is the lien asserted and, thus, is the client potentially deprived of his or her right to the proceeds. Prior to the attorney serving notice, the third party is free to pay any proceeds to the client or any other person entitled to the proceeds. Furthermore, the Rule provides an opportunity to be heard because the client may immediately file an action in the \u201ccircuit court to adjudicate the rights of the parties in relation to the lien, including the attorney\u2019s entitlement to a lien ... and the amount of the attorney\u2019s claim.\u201d Md. Rule 2-652(c)(2). If an adjudication action is filed, the attorney may not seize or take possession of his or her portion of the proceeds until <em>after </em>the adjudication of the dispute. We conclude that the provisions of Md. Rule 2-652(b) and (c) adequately provide for notice and an opportunity to be heard and protect the procedural due process rights of the client.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Sommer complied with the requirements of Md. Rule 2-652 by serving notice of his lien and Rhoads exercised her right under the Rule to adjudicate the lien. The Rule protects the dual interests of the creditor and the debtor in the property. Rhoads did not have an opportunity to be heard before notice of the lien was given, but upon notice she has the right to adjudicate the claim before any money may be transferred. These provisions do not allow a deprivation of property with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>out procedural due process; the procedural protections are adequate for the demands of this particular situation. <em>See Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 902-03. We hold that Rhoads was not significantly deprived of property without notice and that she has had an opportunity to be heard regarding the adjudication of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Because we have held that there was no deprivation of a substantial property right without notice or the opportunity to be heard, we need not analyze whether state action was involved. We hold that invocation of Maryland\u2019s statutory attorney\u2019s lien did not violate Rhoad\u2019s procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Based on our analysis of \u00a7 10-501 and Md. Rule 2-652, we hold that Sommer is entitled to assert an attorney\u2019s lien against Rhoads\u2019 judgment. Sommer\u2019s lien, however, is limited by the terms of the parties\u2019 retainer agreement. The retainer agreement specifically states that Sommer may be entitled to a contingent premium if Rhoads obtains a judgment, but that the \u201cContingent Premium shall not result in total fees (i.e. the Guaranteed Fee and the Contingent Premium) exceeding 30 percent of the Total Recovery.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, Sommer is entitled to up to 30% of the $120,006 judgment obtained by Rhoads. In Rhoads\u2019 December 3, 2001 Motion and Affidavit for Permission to Appeal In Forma Pauperis filed with the Supreme Court, Rhoads acknowledged that she had already paid $35,000 to Sommer.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Consequently, we note that Sommer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>has received almost all of the contingent premium he may redeem. On remand, the Circuit Court should resolve the accounting of costs, in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

This opinion provides only those facts necessary for our consideration of the questions for which certiorari was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. Rhoads was briefly represented by another attorney before retaining Sommer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">. Rhoads sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in its capacity as receiver for Standard Federal Savings Bank (SFSB) and Standard Federal Savings Association (SFSA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">. These post-trial motions, including a motion for judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new trial, were filed before Rhoads filed for bankruptcy. The motions were not decided until after Rhoads' bankruptcy filing was discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. Fred S. Sommer represented Rhoads as a sole practitioner until June 1998, and continued to represent Rhoads when he joined Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy, &amp; Ecker, P.A. until he withdrew from the case after the first trial. Sommer\u2019s law firm, a respondent in this case, was not listed or referenced in Rhoads' bankruptcy schedules because Sommer was not associated with the firm at the time of the bankruptcy filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. Rhoads\u2019 motion to stay the district court case was formally granted on April 20, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court in every respect except for its award of summary judgment on the ADA retaliation claim. <em>Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., </em>257 F.3d at 394(4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 933, 122 S.Ct. 1309, 152 L.Ed.2d 219 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. According to Rhoads, Sommer refused to pursue the ADA retaliation claim on appeal, while the FMLA arguments that Sommer advocated as grounds for appeal were rejected as contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. Sommer disputes Rhoads\u2019 contentions, asserting that she prevailed by relying on theories and evidence that he developed in discovery, pleadings, and trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">. The district court noted that Sommer vehemently disputed Rhoads\u2019 contention that she alone raised the argument upon which the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s summary judgment on her ADA retaliation claim. Nevertheless, the court relied upon the representations Rhoads made in the course of the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">. The court took \"no position whatsoever on the merits of [Rhoads'] allegations,\u201d but stated that it had \"no choice but to value [Sommer\u2019s] work at zero for purposes of this motion.\u201d <em>Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>286 F.Supp.2d at 543.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">. Attorney\u2019s liens are categorized as either a retaining lien or a charging lien. <em>See Ashman v. Shecter, </em>196 Md. 168, 173-74, 76 A.2d 139, 141-42 (1950) (noting that a charging lien binds to a judgment recovered through the attorney's efforts, whereas a retaining lien is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>general lien, dependent on possession, that gives an attorney the right to retain all papers, securities and money belonging to his client which comes into his possession until all his charges against his client are paid.). Under Maryland common law, attorneys do not have a charging lien, but a retaining lien is recognized. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-652(a); <em>Tucker v. Dudley, </em>223 Md. 467, 472, 164 A.2d 891, 895 (1960). The charging lien has only been available in Maryland since 1985, when the General Assembly established a statutory attorney\u2019s lien. <em>See </em>1985 Md. Laws, ch. 723; <em>Consolidated Construction v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 460-61, 813 A.2d 260, 276 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\">. See Part VI for a further discussion of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">. The latter portion of this language is located in a paragraph in the retainer agreement entitled, \"Payment Upon Receipt Of Judgment Or Settlement Proceeds Or Conclusion Of Case.\u201d The plain meaning of this heading also refers to the conclusion of the action as a whole, not merely the initial trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">. Rhoads' judgment partially was a result of the legal services performed by Sommer, as he filed the initial claims in the case. The issue of how much Sommer\u2019s work directly contributed to the final judgment is not before us and therefore we do not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b179-5\">. Sommer argues that Rhoads was obligated to pay all amounts she owed immediately, without the $500 per month payment schedule, because Rhoads breached the retainer agreement 1) by failing to make timely payments under the agreement, and 2) because she filed bankruptcy. These arguments were not grounds on which the Circuit Court entered summary judgment, and we decline to consider them. <em>Sadler v. Dimensions, </em>378 Md. 509, 537 n. 10, 836 A.2d 655, 671 n. 10 (2003) (\"Ordinarily, an appellate court should review a grant of summary judgment only on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>(quoting Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478, 659 A.2d 872, 873 (1995))); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\">. We note that, as pointed out by the Court of Special Appeals, many courts interpreting attorney\u2019s liens have agreed that although the lien does not attach until after the bankruptcy, once it does attach, it relates back and takes effect from the commencement of the attorney\u2019s services or the action. <em>See In re Pac. Far E. Line, Inc., </em>654 F.2d 664, 669 (9th Cir.1981) (\"Under California law, the lien takes effect from the date it was created; upon the fund\u2019s production, the lien attaches to the specific asset\u201d); <em>Hanna Paint Mfg. Co. v. Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin &amp; Robb, </em>298 F.2d 371, 373 (10th Cir.1962) (\"The lien of an attorney for services rendered in an action relates back to, and takes effect from, the time of the commencement of the services; when it attaches to a judgment, it is superior to the claim of a creditor in whose favor execution has been levied, or to a subsequent attachment, garnishment, or trustee process\u201d); <em>In re Reinhardt, </em>81 B.R. 565, 569 (Bankr.D.N.D. 1987) (attorney\u2019s pre-bankruptcy charging lien related back to the date the services commenced, and despite failure to give notice, and without explicit relation-back language, lien survived bankruptcy discharge); <em>In re Kleer-Span Truss Co., Inc., </em>76 B.R. 30, 31 (Bankr.N.D.N.Y.1985) (relation back applied when statute provided: \u201cFrom the commencement of the action, ... the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action, claim, or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, [or] ... decision, judgment or final order in his client's favor, and the proceeds thereof\u201d); <em>In re TLC of Lake Wales, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>13 B.R. 593, 595 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1981) (\"Although the charging lien does not attach until after judgment or recovery has been obtained, it relates back and takes effect from the date of the attorney\u2019s first commencement of services\u201d); <em>In re E.C. Ernst, Inc., 4 </em>B.R. 317, 320 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1980) (\"The lien relates back and takes effect from the time the attorney\u2019s services were commenced\u201d). These courts did not require that the statute or common law expressly use a term like \"relates back.\u201d Rather they rested their decisions on their interpretation of the statute or common law as to the effective date of the lien. <em>See, e.g., In re Reinhardt, </em>81 B.R. at 569 (noting lack of relation back language in North Dakota and Alaska attorney's lien statutes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">. We note that the lien could not have been asserted in accordance with Md. Rule 2-652 prior to the bankruptcy because a final judgment had not yet been entered in Rhoads\u2019 favor. The distinction between whether Sommer actually had the lien, however, in the sense that the lien had attached, or whether he had a right to a lien, is not our focus. What is material is that Maryland law intended that the attorney\u2019s lien be effective at a time prior to Rhoads\u2019 bankruptcy. Md. Rule 2-652(b) does not affect the date the attorney\u2019s lien was created, as it concerns only the enforcement of an already existing lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b183-5\">. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was concerned with a New York attorney\u2019s lien statute. The New York statute stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\"Attorney\u2019s lien in action, special or other proceeding. From the commencement of an action, special or other proceeding in any court or before any state, municipal or federal department, except a department of labor, or the service of an answer containing a counterclaim, the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client's cause of action, claim or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, report, determination, decision, judgment or final order in his client's favor, and the proceeds thereof in whatever hands they may come; and the lien cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment, final order or determination. The court upon the petition of the client or attorney may determine and enforce the lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APl\">N.Y. Judiciary Law \u00a7 475 (McKinney 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">. Many courts that have held that an attorney's lien relates back and takes effect from the commencement of the attorney's services or the action, even though the lien does not attach until after bankruptcy, acknowledge implicitly that the attorney's lien is an <em>in rem </em>claim. <em>See In re Pac. Far E. Line, Inc., </em>654 F.2d 664, 669 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Hanna Paint Mfg. Co. v.

Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978), that the attorney\u2019s lien statute does not constitute state action. In <em>Flagg, </em>the Supreme Court held that a warehouseman's proposed sale of goods entrusted to him for storage, as permitted by the self-help provision of New York\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code, was not an action attributable to the State of New York and thus did not constitute state action. <em>Id. </em>at 151-53, 98 S.Ct. at 1731-32. Rhoads counter argued that, similar to mechanics\u2019 liens, attorney\u2019s liens involve state action because they are created, regulated and enforced by the State. <em>See Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222 (1976). In their briefs to this Court, the parties did not address the state action element of due process. Because we hold that there was no substantial deprivation of a property right and therefore that no due process violation occurred, we need not reach the issue of whether the attorney\u2019s lien constitutes state action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\">.

We note that the Rules Committee was aware of and considered due process requirements before it recommended Md. Rule 2-652 to the Court of Appeals. For example, the minutes of the Rules Committee meeting on June 17, 1994 include a member stating that the rule \"includes appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">. The retainer agreement defines the total recovery as \"the total amount recovered by settlement or judgment, including any amount recovered as interest, attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages with respect to any claims brought or asserted on behalf of Client, whether brought or asserted separately or together, and whether brought or asserted in a lawsuit, a charge with an administrative agency (including Client\u2019s pending Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Department of Labor charges) or informally.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">.
