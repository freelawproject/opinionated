Cahill, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Cahill held a hearing on January 31, 2007 and issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on April 19, 2007, in which he found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated MRPC 1.4(a), 1.5, 1.15, and 8.4 and Maryland Rules 16-604 and 16-609:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHNk\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201cOn February 8, 2006, the Court of Appeals of Maryland transmitted this matter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>County for the purpose of conducting a hearing pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757. Edward Smith, Jr., Esquire, entered his appearance for the Respondent on November 21, 2006. Before commencement of the hearing, the Court granted in part the Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions, precluding Respondent from testifying that he had used an attorney trust account to escrow the legal fee that forms part of the subject matter of this action, based on his refusal to disclose information about that account properly sought in discovery. The hearing was held on January 31, 2007. <em>CHARGES</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\u201cAll of the charges lodged against the Respondent arise from an attorney-client relationship which commenced on April 24, 2005 when Timothy Dean (\u201cDean\u201d) retained the Respondent to represent him in litigation filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Dean and two (2) related corporate entities had been sued by Dean\u2019s business associate, Shedric Wallace (\u201cWallace\u201d), over disagreements concerning their ownership of a restaurant. The Respondent, who had been admitted to practice law in Maryland for some thirteen (13) months before being retained by Dean, accepted a legal fee of $5,000.00 from Dean, and prepared and had Dean sign a written fee agreement on April 24, 2005. Respondent entered his appearance on behalf of Dean and the two related entities on April 28, 2005. He confirmed in an email to Dean on May 23, 2005 that he would \u201cvigorously represent all Defendants\u201d in the litigation. He filed a Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment and sent discovery pleadings to Wallace on behalf of Dean and the related entities on May 26, 2005. In late May, he began insisting that he be paid an additional $5,000.00 to represent the two (2) related corporate entities. Dean, on behalf of the other entities, refused. Respondent immediately began threatening to withdraw. Respondent prepared and sent to Dean, on June 21, 2005, a Motion for Leave to Withdraw as Counsel for the Defendants. Dean filed a pro se opposition to this, based on the fact that he had made a flat fee payment to Respondent for representation through trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>On August 11, 2005, the Circuit Court ordered that Respondent\u2019s appearance be withdrawn. Previous to this Order allowing Respondent to withdraw his appearance on behalf of the Defendants, specifically on July 19, 2005, another attorney, Edward A. Malone, Esquire, had entered his appearance on behalf of these Defendants. Also on July 19, Mr. Malone filed a Counter Complaint on behalf of all Defendants and a Third-Party Complaint. On December 1, 2006 a Settlement Order was filed and the case was dismissed on December 22, 2006, with Dean paying Wallace in excess of $65,000.00 to resolve all disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201cAs a result of a complaint letter purportedly authored by Dean on August 8, 2005, dealing primarily with the unreasonableness of the Respondent\u2019s fee, and his failure to refund it or any part of it after withdrawing his appearance, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland has charged Lawson with violating certain of Maryland\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as procedural Rules governing attorney trust accounts. Specifically, it is alleged that the Respondent has violated the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cRule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cRule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201cRule 1.5 Fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">(a) A lawyer\u2019s fees shall be reasonable. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">(4) the amount involved and the result obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">(b) When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cRule 1.15 Safekeeping Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">(b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this Rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by. the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>(c) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which both the lawyer and another person claim interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until there is an accounting and severance of their interests. If a dispute arises concerning their respective interests, the portion in dispute shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201cRule 1.16 Declining or Terminating Representation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cRule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2x\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201cMaryland Rule 16-603 Duty to Maintain Account</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">An attorney or the attorney\u2019s law firm shall maintain one or more attorney trust accounts for the deposit of funds received from any source for the intended benefit of clients or third persons. The account or accounts shall be maintained in this State, in the District of Columbia, or in any state contiguous to this State, and shall be with an approved financial institution. Unless an attorney maintains such an account, or is a member of or employed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>law firm that maintains such an account, an attorney may not receive and accept funds as an attorney from any source in whole or in part for the benefit of a client or third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">\u201cMaryland Rule 16-604 Trust Account-Required Deposit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">Except as otherwise permitted by rule or other law, all funds, including cash, received and accepted by an attorney or law firm in this State from a client or third person to be delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person, unless received as payment of fees owed by the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client, shall be deposited in an attorney trust account in an approved financial institution. This Rule does not apply to an instrument received by an attorney or law firm that is made payable solely to a client or third person and is transmitted directly to the client or third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cMaryland Rule 16-609 Prohibited Transaction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As2\">An attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by these Rules to be deposited in the attorney\u2019s trust account, obtain any remuneration from the financial institution for depositing any funds in the account, or use any funds for any unauthorized purpose. An instrument drawn on an attorney trust account may not be drawn payable to cash or to bearer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201cEssentially, in the Petition, the Attorney Grievance Commission charges the Respondent in four (4) discrete areas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQLS\">\u201cFirst, with regard to the provisions governing attorney diligence, promptness, and failure to protect a client\u2019s interest upon termination, the Respondent is charged with failing to file a Counterclaim against Wallace; and failure to promptly transmit his office file to his successor counsel, Mr. Malone. Respondent defends by asserting that the Counterclaim could have been and, in fact, was filed by his successor and that, in any event, he was ethically prohibited from filing the Counterclaim. He asserts that he transmitted his office file to his successor in a timely fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201cSecond, with regard to the provisions governing communication with a client, the Respondent is charged with failing to inform Dean that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City had scheduled a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment on July 6, 2005 and failing to inform Dean after the hearing that the motion was denied. He is also charged with failure to properly communicate the terms of the Fee Agreement and failure to communicate to Dean the reasons for not filing the Counterclaim. Respondent asserts that the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss did not require Dean\u2019s attendance, and so there was no need to inform him of the hearing date or the outcome of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201cThird, with regard to the cited provisions governing attorney dishonesty, fraud or deceit and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, Respondent is accused of misleading Dean concerning his plans for charging legal fees in the future. It is alleged, in essence, that the Respondent planned to initially charge Dean a $5,000.00 flat fee, and then to insist upon additional payments, in the form of separate fees for the representation of the two (2) corporations, at a later date. In the alternative, it is alleged that the fact that Respondent attempted to change the agreement in the midst of his representation was dishonest and deceitful and amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Respondent asserts that the proof does not meet the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard on thee questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cFourth, with regard to the provisions concerning reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the holding and disposition of those fees after being engaged, the Respondent is charged with charging an unreasonable fee; failing to escrow the fee before it was earned; and failing to segregate and return the fee once he learned that Dean was insisting upon a refund of all or part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cRespondent asserts that the amount of the flat fee charged, $5,000.00, was patently not unreasonable in light of the scope of the initial undertaking; that he never had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>duty to escrow or safe-keep the fee payments because they had been earned (if compared to what Respondent would have charged on an hourly basis) by the time the dispute arose; and that the flat fee arrangement was, in any event, permissible without the need to place the fee in trust. He maintains that Respondent \u201chad a right to demand additional compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cRespondent was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on April 1, 2004. At all times relevant to this mater, he maintained an office for the practice of law in Baltimore County, Maryland. At the inception of the engagement giving rise to this disciplinary action, the Respondent had been practicing law for some thirteen (13) months. He was, at all times relevant hereto a solo practitioner. He testified that he had maintained a law clerk\u2019s position with Jimmy A. Bell, PC, an Upper Marlboro practitioner, before being admitted to the Bar, and on his Professional Sketch indicates that he was an \u201cAssociate, Law Office of Jimmy A. Bell, PC, 2003.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cOn or about April 13, 2005, an action was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City bearing the caption <em>SHEDRIC WALLACE v. TIMOTHY DEAN and DEAN AND WALLACE INCORPORATED and T.D. BISTRO, INC., </em>Case No. 24-C-05-04165 CN. Wallace alleged in his suit that he and Dean formed Dean and Wallace Incorporated for the purpose of owning and operating a restaurant in the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore City. He alleged that Dean had shut him out of the business in early April 2005. He sued Dean and the corporations for breach of contract, interference with prospective advantage, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The fifth count in the Complaint was a shareholder\u2019s derivative action. The theory advanced against T.D. Bistro, Inc. was that when Dean shut Wallace out of the business, he \u201ctransferred\u201d the lease of the restaurant property \u201cinto the name of T.D. Bistro which Dean solely owned.\u201d A jury trial was prayed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cWhile service on the Defendants was not made until April 26, 2005, sometime before April 22, 2005, an attorney with whom Dean had a prior lawyer-client relationship, Jimmy A. Bell (\u201cBell\u201d), received a copy of the Complaint from Dean, or from the attorney for Wallace. Bell determined that he had a \u201cpossible conflict\u201d and could not represent Dean or any of the other defendants in the litigation; and would refer the matter to other counsel. Accordingly, Bell arranged a meeting between Dean and the Respondent at Dean\u2019s restaurant in Baltimore to accommodate the referral. While Bell believed that he could not represent Dean or the entities because of a conflict of interest, he had himself drafted (or had someone else do so at his direction) responsive pleadings to be filed in the Baltimore City litigation, and had charged Dean $2,500.00 to draft these pleadings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He brought these with him to the meeting or otherwise delivered them to Respondent just after the meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201cAt the meeting (or before), Respondent was also given a copy of the Complaint setting forth the names of all three (3) Defendants. Bell testified, credibly, that the Respondent knew that there were three (3) Defendants to be represented at the time of the meeting. He testified, again credibly, that he and the Respondent discussed whether or not there might be a conflict with one attorney representing all three (3) Defendants, but ultimately, the Respondent agreed with Dean that he would represent all three (3) Defendants. Bell testified that he thought a $5,000.00 flat fee for representation of all three (3) Defendants through trial would be fair, and he so advised the Respondent. He testified that he thought this to be the case because he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>already drafted responsive pleadings on behalf of the three (3) Defendants, or in other words, \u201cdone all the work....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cOn April 22, 2005, Respondent wrote a letter to Dean and had it hand delivered. In this letter, Respondent acknowledged that he had received a copy of the Complaint from Bell and he specifically discussed that the Complaint named three parties as Defendants, namely, Dean, Dean and Wallace, Incorporated and T.D. Bistro, Inc. In the letter, Respondent discussed the fact that the case was probably not removable to Federal Court because of the absence of complete diversity as to these Defendants. Respondent ends his letter by asking Dean to \u201cplease read the enclosed Attorney-Client Fee Agreement.\u201d It is not clear which version of the Fee Agreement was attached to this letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cUltimately, on April 24, 2005, Respondent hand delivered another letter to Dean transmitting another iteration of the Attorney-Client Fee Agreement. This Agreement, which was between Lawson Law, LLC and Dean only was signed by Dean on April 24.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence and beyond any doubt that the Respondent knew, before April 22, 2005 that there were three (3) individual Defendants who had been sued in the Baltimore City litigation and who required representation. The Respondent\u2019s testimony at trial that he did not have a copy of the Complaint at the meeting at Dean\u2019s restaurant or when he presented the Fee Agreement to Dean was not credible. The Respondent\u2019s testimony that he did not know or appreciate that there were three (3) individual Defendants who were the subjects of this suit in Baltimore City and who needed representation when he initially set the fee for that representation is not credible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cThe Attorney-Client Fee Agreement itself, that is, the version ultimately signed by Dean on April 24, 2005, is somewhat confusing. It was not made less so when Respondent attempted to explain the Agreement to Dean in emails, or to testify as to what it meant before this Court. In the written Agreement, Respondent agrees that he will represent Dean \u201cthrough trial of your civil case in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City filed or to be filed by Shedric Wallace.\u201d The Agreement states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c4. <em>NON-REFUNDABLE CHARGEABLE RETAINER.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">You agree to pay Lawson Law, LLC a fee for legal services in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) (U.S.D.), in exchange for our agreement to represent you through trial in this matter. This amount will cover a non-refundable retainer in the amount of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) (U.S.D.), with the balance of the fee representing a substantial discount of the anticipated costs of this litigation, which will include, at least, a counter suit against Mr. Wallace. In exchange for this benefit, Lawson Law, LLC will receive a one-third (1/3) of any recovery, up to and including trial, plus costs. Any unearned portion of the $5,000.00 fee will be refunded to [sic] although, due to discounted rate you have been charged in lieu of the hourly fee of $250.00 per hour, the amount of legal time required for your case will likely exceed the amount your are [sic] required to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>out of pocket and this possibility is not likely under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">\u201c5. <em>COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">(a) In general\u2014Lawson Law LLC will bill client for additional costs and expenses in performing legal services under this agreement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">\u201c6. <em>DISCHARGE AND WITHDRAWAL</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">You may discharge Lawson Law, LLC at any time. We may withdraw with your consent or for good cause. Good cause includes your breach of this agreement, your refusal to cooperate with us or to follow our advice on a material matter or any fact or circumstance that would render our continuing representation unlawful or unethical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">When our services conclude, all unpaid charges will become due and payable. After our services conclude, we will, upon your request, deliver your file to you along with any funds or property of yours in our possession, except to the extent that such property serves to secure payment of some outstanding charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">When you discharge Lawson Law, LLC, you become liable for payment of the hourly rate for all charges incurred to date. This means that if you receive a discount for legal services, your early termination will require you to pay all costs and fees through termination as if you retained Lawson Law, LLC strictly on an hourly basis....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">\u201cUltimately, Dean did pay Respondent $5,000.00, in installments of $2,500.00 each, on April 26, 2005 and May 23, 2005. Respondent\u2019s testimony as to what the Attorney-Client Fee Agreement meant was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t the fee agreement that you provided to Mr. Dean indicate that you would represent him in the litigation through trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cA. That I\u2019d represent him through trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cQ. And that the fee would be $5,000.00, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u201cQ. All right. As of April the 26th, had you represented him through trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">\u201cA. As of April 26th\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">\u201cQ. \u2014of 2005, when you received the first check, had you represented him through trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">\u201cA. Yeah, I received the first check on April 26th. It wasn\u2019t payable on April 26th, from what I recall. It was payable in May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">\u201cQ. All right. In May of 2005, had you represented Mr. Dean through trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">\u201cA. No, I had not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-16\">\u201cQ. Well, then how can you say that you\u2019d earned the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-17\">\u201cA. Because, as I said in the retainer, that the retainer was a non-refundable, chargeable retainer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-18\">\u201cQ. All right. What about the second $2,500.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-19\">\u201cA. I wasn\u2019t finished. Can I finish my answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-20\">\u201cAs I said in the retainer, the retainer was a nonrefundable, chargeable retainer, meaning that the hourly rate that I would normally charge is the basis for the amount that I charged. That\u2019s how I get to the chargeable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-21\">\u201cIf there would be anything that would be due to Mr. Dean as a refund, it would be based on that.

Let\u2019s move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-20\">\u201cThe Court finds that the Respondent entered into a flat fee arrangement with Dean, which required him to defend Dean, Wallace and Dean Incorporated and T.D. Bistro, Inc., through the conclusion of trial in the Wallace matter, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. This fee also included the preparation of a \u201ccounter suit\u201d against Wallace. The fee for these services was $5,000.00. If there was an affirmative recovery against Wallace, Respondent would be entitled to an additional fee equivalent to one-third (1/3) of the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of that recovery. In addition, Dean agreed to pay \u201ccosts\u201d as incurred by Respondent including long distance telephone charges, messenger and delivery fees, postage, transcript fees, subpoena fees, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">\u201cThe terms \u201cNon-Refundable Chargeable Retainer\u201d and \u201cNon-Refundable Retainer\u201d used in paragraph 4 of the Agreement are without meaning. It is plain that the flat fee <em>was, </em>in fact, refundable (paragraph 4: \u201cAny unearned portion of the $5,000.00 fee will be refunded____\u201c; paragraph 6: \u201cAfter our services conclude, we will, upon your request, deliver ... any funds or property of yours in our possession----\u201d), and it is equally clear that Respondent failed to place any portion of the $5,000.00 payment into an escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cRespondent entered his appearance on behalf of all three (3) Defendants on April 28, 2005. On May 23, 2005, the Respondent e-mailed Dean stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cAs we discussed on the issue of conflict of interest in the litigation by Mr. Wallace, each party sued could have independent counsel. This would be particularly true if Dean and Wallace, Inc. sued in proper capacity. It should be a Plaintiff along with Mr. Wallace. However, as Mr. Wallace has listed Dean and Wallace, Inc. as a Defendant and as you have consented to representation by Lawson Law, LLC of all Defendants at this time, such should satisfy the Rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201cIn time, it may be wise to bring in other counsel. We will monitor the events as they unfold. I do want to continue to represent T.D. Bistro, Inc./Timothy Dean Bistro. As you know, I will vigorously represent all Defendants in the interim. Please do not retain separate counsel without first discussing it with me and seeking my input. Such is not necessary at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">\u201cOn May 24, 2005, Respondent informed Dean, for the first time, that he would require that \u201cretainers\u201d be signed for Dean and Wallace, Incorporated and T.D. Bistro, Inc. This was done by e-mail and the Respondent use the word \u201cretainer\u201d to mean written agreement. On May 26, 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgement/Statement of Grounds and Authorities and a Discovery Notice (certifying that he had sent Interrogatories, a Request for Production of Documents and a Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents to Wallace\u2019s attorney) in the Circuit Court action. The Motion was filed on behalf of all three (3) Defendants; the discovery pleadings on behalf of Dean and Wallace Incorporated only. On May 31, 2005, Respondent e-mailed Dean again and informed him that he would require an additional $2,500.00 -fee for representation of Dean and Wallace, Incorporated, and yet an additional $2,500.00 fee for the representation of T.D. Bistro, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the same day, Dean returned the Respondent\u2019s e-mail rejecting any further payment. He wrote that \u201cit is impossible to pay $12,000.00 for one motion being filed.... \u201d Apparently, Dean was referring to the original $2,500.00 payment which he had made to Mr. Bell, the $5,000.00 payment that was made to Respondent, and the additional $5,000.00 payment that was being requested by the Respondent. Dean appears to have miscalculated and was $500.00 short of the total fee that Respondent was actually requiring at that point. In any event, the Respondent replied by e-mail of June 1, 2005 stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201cAll that\u2019s owed is $5,000.00\u2014not $12,000.00.

Even if I leave, it won\u2019t change the fact that I will still need to be paid for my work____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201cDean responded to this e-mail, again taking the position that he and the Respondent had a deal, requiring representation through trial for the $5,000.00 fee. Dean stated that \u201cIf you fail to continue representation I will have no choice but to contact Bar Counsel for your misconduct.\u201d Respondent replied stating that \u201cneither Bar Counsel nor any attorney can negate the fee for services payable by Dean and Wallace, Inc. and T.D. Bistro, Inc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cOn June 7, 2005, Dean wrote a letter to Respondent, again stating that he was \u201cconcerned about the given fees and would like to have this matter discussed in greater detail with both attorney, Jim Bell, and yourself.\u201d On the same date, Respondent faxed a letter back to Dean, continuing in his effort to persuade Dean to pay an additional $5,000.00 for the representation of Dean and Wallace Incorporated and T.D. Bistro, Inc. He stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">\u201cYou will also find a copy of the original Entry of Appearance, a copy of which you possess. This Entry was not filed, but was the one prepared before Lawson Law, LLC received the Complaint and summonses for each of these defendants in the action. You will note that on the Entry, as well as on the Fee Agreement, you are listed in your individual capacity alone, not with Dean &amp; Wallace, Inc. or T.D. Bistro, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cEven if you had been listed together, Maryland courts interpreting the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct have acknowledged that a fee which may have been reasonable when made may become unreasonable in light of changed circumstances. A fee of $5,000.00 for one law firm to represent three separate clients in this complex litigation is unreasonably low, particularly in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>time, labor, skill required, the amount of time to be taken from other cases, etc....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cOn June 21, 2005, Respondent and Dean exchanged communications. Dean sent an e-mail stating: \u201cGood morning Jeff I hope all is well. The purpose of this e-mail is to find out what is the status of the Motion to Dismiss? When time permits please give me a call.\u201d Respondent wrote back but did not answer Dean\u2019s question concerning the Motion to Dismiss. Instead, Respondent sent Dean a copy of a Motion for Leave to Withdraw as Counsel in the litigation. Though Respondent\u2019s cover letter stated that \u201cLawson Law LLC and Jeffrey Lawson, Esquire intend to file this Motion to Withdraw as Counsel in your case,\u201d Dean believed that the Motion had been filed, since it had a certificate of service, and, on June 30, 2005, Dean actually filed Timothy Dean\u2019s Opposition to Counsel\u2019s Motion to Withdraw as Counsel. On the same date, Respondent filed a Motion for Judicial Notice and Reply to Plaintiffs Response to Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment, asking that the Court accept certain facts as established for the purposes of the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201cOn July 6, 2005, Respondent attended a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment. Respondent did not inform Dean that a hearing had been scheduled and did not inform Dean that the Motion to Dismiss was denied without prejudice on the same date. On July 14, 2005, Respondent actually filed his Motion to Withdraw as Counsel on behalf of all three (3) Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cHe wrote Dean that same day stating that \u201cAs your actions and course of conduct, along with others, have led me to conclude that you attempted to utilize Lawson Law, LLC to foster your efforts to commit fraud on the court and, perhaps the Plaintiff in the civil action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Lawson Law cannot, in good faith, submit further pleadings and papers on your behalf....\u201d On July 19, 2005, Edward Malone, Esquire entered his appearance in the Baltimore City litigation on behalf of all three (3) Defendants. On the same date, he filed a Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ter-Complaint on behalf of Dean and Wallace Incorporated and T.D. Bistro, Inc., only against Wallace, and a Third-Party Complaint against Wallace\u2019s wife and another corporation as well. On August 8, 2005, Mr. Malone wrote Respondent, asking for his file in the <em>Wallace v. Dean </em>case, and stating that \u201cany further delay will hinder this office in compelling Wallace to produce discovery.\u201d On August 11, 2005, the Court ordered that Respondent\u2019s appearance be withdrawn. On August 31, 2005, that Order was docketed, and the Respondent sent his office file to Mr. Malone on the same date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cSubstantial pleading and, apparently discovery took place in the action during the ensuing fifteen (15) months, culminating in a settlement of all claims, evidenced by the filing of a Settlement Order on December 1, 2006 and stipulations of dismissal thereafter. Dean paid Wallace some $65,000.00 to resolve all claims and presumably to acquire Wallace\u2019s interest in the restaurant business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cRespondent never filed a Counterclaim against Wallace as agreed. Edward Malone filed the Counterclaim against Wallace on the date that he entered his appearance. Respondent\u2019s testimony on this issue was that he consciously decided not to file a Counterclaim against Wallace because he had developed concerns about Dean\u2019s \u201cbeing truthful,\u201d and reached a conclusion that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be ethical for me to file a complaint against Mr. Wallace.... \u201d Respondent testified repeatedly that he informed Dean of this in a letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent never produced such a letter at trial despite repeated attempts of he and his attorney to locate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\n<em>DILIGENCE, PROMPTNESS AND FAILURE TO PROTECT A CLIENT\u2019S INTERESTS UPON TERMINATION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201cThe Petitioner has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 1.3 or Rule 1.16(d). With regard to the alleged violation of Rule 1.16(d), the evidence before the Court is that the Respondent sent his office file to Mr. Malone on August 31, 2005-the exact date on which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City docketed the August 11, 2005 Order allowing the Respondent to -withdraw. There is no evidence that during the time period July 19, 2005 (when Mr. Malone entered his appearance) through August 31, 2005 (when Respondent ultimately did send his office file to Mr. Malone), Dean or the related entities were in default with regard to discovery obligations. Indeed, there is no evidence that Malone had any particular need for Respondent\u2019s office file during this time period. He had drafted and filed a Counter-Complaint and a Third-Party Complaint and did not appear hampered in his preparation of the defense by not having Respondent\u2019s office file during that time period. In any event, the Petitioner has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent did not \u201ctake steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests\u201d in not transmitting his office file to Malone sooner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cWith regard to the allegation that the Respondent breached Rule 1.3 by failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in filing a Counterclaim, again, the Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to meet the burden of establishing a violation by clear and convincing evidence. Based on the assertions made in his letter of complaint, Dean would appear to believe that the Respondent risked a time bar by not filing a Counterclaim along with the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgement in late May. However, the Motion was filed pursuant to Rules 2-311, 2-322(b)(2) and 2-501. Rule 2-321(c) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201cAutomatic extension. When a motion is filed pursuant to Rule 2-322, the time for filing an answer is extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>without special order to 15 days after entry of the court\u2019s order on the motion or, if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, to 15 days after the service of the more definite statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cRule 2-331 (d) which governs the timing of the filing of a Counterclaim, provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cTime for filing. If a party files a counterclaim or cross-claim more than 30 days after the time for filing that party\u2019s answer, any other party may object to the late filing by a motion to strike filed within 15 days of service of the counterclaim or cross-claim....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cSince the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment was denied on July 6, 2005, Respondent had until July 21, 2005 to file and answer pursuant to Rule 2-321 (c); and he had 30 days after that within which to file a Counterclaim pursuant to Rule 2-331 (d). Even if he had filed the Counterclaim beyond that extended date, it would not have been time barred, but rather, simply subject to being struck if the Defendants were unable to ultimately establish that any delay did not prejudice other parties to action. <em>See, </em>Rule 2-331(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201cIn any event, Mr. Malone had entered his appearance within 15 days of the July 6, 2005 denial of the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgement and filed the Counter-Complaint. None of the Defendants was prejudiced by the timing of the filing of the Counter-Complaint, and none was placed in jeopardy by the fact that the Respondent did not file the Counterclaim at the same time that he filed the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgement. There is simply nothing grievable about the Respondent\u2019s failure to earlier file a Counterclaim except, possibly, that he failed to inform Dean that there was ample time within which to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201cDespite this, the Respondent robustly and repeatedly asserted at trial that he consciously decided not to file a Counterclaim against Wallace because he had developed grave concerns about Dean\u2019s honesty, and reached a conclusion that it would not be ethical to assert a Counterclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>against Wallace in the litigation. Respondent testified that he put all of this in a letter to Dean to explain why he was not filing the Counterelaim, a letter that he was never able to produce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">\u201cWhile the proof is wanting with regard to the charges of failing to act promptly and diligently, this Court must observe that Respondent lacked credibility in his defense on this issue-this Court is not persuaded that ethics caused Respondent to refrain from filing this pleading and is likewise not persuaded that Respondent wrote Dean with his concerns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>COMMUNICATION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cPetitioner maintains that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) by failing to inform Dean that the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgement was scheduled for July <em>6, </em>2005, and thereafter, that the Motion had been denied. Petitioner also asserts that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) by not explaining: (1) the terms of the fee agreement; and (2) the reason for not filing a Counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cPetitioner has established a violation by Respondent of Rule 1.4(a) by clear and convincing evidence. Respondent correctly observes at page 11 of his Memorandum that \u201cthe Motion to Dismiss hearing did not require Dean\u2019s appearance.\u201d He then argues that because Dean did not have to appear to testify, it was unnecessary to inform him of the hearing date. The facts, however, have less to do with whether Dean was necessary as a witness than -with the notion that every lawyer\u2019s client is entitled to answers to basic questions concerning the progress of litigation. On June 21, 2005, Dean sent a specific e-mail stating \u201cThe purpose of this e-mail is to find out what is the status of the Motion to Dismiss?\u201d The Circuit Court docket entries indicate that notices of the Motion Hearing were sent to Respondent on June 20, 2005 and June 22, 2005 establishing the hearing date of July 6, 2005. Respondent responded to Dean\u2019s e-mail the same day it was sent, June 21, 2005\u2014not by simply informing Dean of the July 6, 2005 hearing date\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>but by transmitting the proposed Motion to Withdraw as Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201cWhile Dean\u2019s appearance was not necessary at the July 6, 2005 hearing, and while the client is not necessarily required to be informed of every proceeding or development in a case, clearly, at a minimum, when a client addresses a specific inquiry to his attorney like this, he is entitled to an answer under the Communication rule. Likewise, having expressed a specific interest in the Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment, Dean was entitled to have been informed that it had been denied. Respondent plainly violated Rule 1.4(a) by not keeping Dean reasonably informed about the status of the matter and by not promptly complying with a reasonable request for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cThe Petitioner has failed to establish a Rule 1.4(b) violation by clear and convincing evidence. Dean was, at the very least, a sophisticated consumer of legal services. There was no evidence presented warranting a conclusion that he required an explanation of the terms of the Attorney-Client Fee Agreement. Moreover, since this Court has not been persuaded that the Respondent consciously examined the landscape of facts in the Wallace matter and determined to refrain from filing a Counterclaim for ethical reasons, there would not logically have been a need to have communicated with Dean about those reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\n<em>DISHONESTY, FRAUD, DECEIT AND CONDUCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cThe Court does not conclude that the Respondent entered into the Attorney-Client Fee Agreement with Dean, planning or intending to later increase his flat fee for representation of the Defendants in the Baltimore City litigation from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00. Rather, this Court determines that between April 24, 2005 and May 24, 2005, the Respondent reached a conclusion that the Wallace litigation was neither a \u201cpimple\u201d nor a \u201csmall case,\u201d as characterized by Mr. Bell; and that a $5,000.00 flat fee was grossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>insufficient to cover his time exposure for even a minimally competent representation of the Defendants through trial. The Respondent determined to deal with this by seeking to extract from Dean an additional $5,000.00, using a pretext of a realization that there were two additional related defendants sued in the Baltimore City case who required representation. Instead of simply informing Dean that he had grossly underestimated the scope of the undertaking and asking to renegotiate the flat fee, the Respondent engaged in a ploy to increase his fee by suggesting that he did not know there were additional defendants; or that, somehow, those additional defendants were being unjustly enriched by receiving the benefit of his representation without being charged for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cIn <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. 228, 438 A.2d 501 (1981), the Court of Appeals concurred in a trial judge\u2019s determination that an attempt to change a fee arrangement mid-way through representation was dishonest, deceitful and prejudicial to the administration of justice. There, the trial court found that Kerpelman had undertaken the representation of a client in a family law matter, agreeing to charge a $2,000.00 retainer and $70.00 per hour for his services. During the actual trial of the underlying case, Kerpelman presented his client with a new, written \u201cAgreement as to Fee.\u201d The client signed this new agreement under the circumstances, which basically stated that the fee could be increased based on success at trial. After trial, Kerpelman sent his client a bill for $8,500.00. He later sued the client and attempted to raise the fee to $25,000.00. With regard to the original effort to change the fee agreement, the trial judge found clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cEither the respondent quoted a fee based on an hourly rate of $70.00 knowing that he was not going to abide by such an agreement if the case was won or, having won the case, decided that the time was propitious to extract a larger fee than had been agreed upon. Engaging in such conduct involves dishonesty and deceit and is prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>to the administration of justice and furthermore reflects on the respondent\u2019s fitness to practice law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals concurred in that result. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. 228, 242, 438 A.2d 501, 509 (1981). <em>See also, Attorney Grievance Commission v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 518, 704 A.2d 1225 (1998) (Court of Appeals upholds a finding that receipt of a fee in full and failure to perform any work whatsoever is dishonest, deceitful, fraudulent and prejudicial to the administration of justice). While Kerpelman\u2019s effort was more egregious than that of the Respondent (Kerpelman\u2019s effort to extract a higher fee having been made during the actual course of a trial), this Court believes that the Kerpelman Decision stands for the proposition that, generally, it is deceitful and dishonest for a lawyer to threaten to cease advancing or protecting his client\u2019s interests in litigation in order to renegotiate his fee agreement. This is precisely what occurred in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cThe conduct here should be distinguished from that of the attorney in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 813 A.2d 1145 (2002), where the attorney accepted a fee of $72,000.00 from four (4) clients knowing that \u201che had not done and \u2018clearly did not plan to do\u2019 \u201d the legal work that he was hired to complete. The evidence in this case does not support a conclusion that this Respondent intended to take a flat fee of $5,000.00 and not do the work required to get the underlying litigation through trial. Rather, this Court concludes that Respondent wanted to continue to represent Dean and the related entities\u2014he simply decided that he was entitled to a higher fee for doing so at some point after agreeing to accept a fee of $5,000.00. While he did not wait for a time in the progress of the litigation as \u201cpropitious\u201d as the moment chose by Kerpelman, this Court is convinced, to the clear and convincing standard, that the Respondent made a deliberate choice to try to renegotiate the fee agreement in this case under threat of withdrawing and causing Dean to lose the value of the fee arrangement which he had struck with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the Respondent originally. This, under the standard established in <em>Kerpelman, supra, </em>constitutes a violation of Rules 8.4(c) and (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201cThere is no evidence that the Respondent lied to or attempted to defraud Dean\u2014he never wrote to Dean or otherwise communicated with him to suggest that he did not know there were three (3) Defendants when he set the original fee, in his various efforts to convince Dean to pay more on and after May 31, 2005. However, he did take that position at the hearing, while under oath, and, having done so, likely violated Rule 3.3 before this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>ATTORNEYS FEES</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cIt is alleged in the Petition that Respondent failed to maintain an attorney trust account in violation of Maryland Rule 16-603. As indicated, because Respondent failed to disclose information about his attorney trust account in discovery, this Court ruled, before trial, that the Respondent was precluded from testifying that he had used an attorney trust account to escrow funds paid to him by Dean in the subject matter. Counsel for Respondent proffered, before commencement of the hearing, that Respondent did, indeed maintain an attorney trust account at the Chevy Chase Bank, but conceded that no portion of the $5,000.00 payment made to him by Dean was placed in that account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201cThis Court is not persuaded that the Respondent failed to maintain an attorney trust account in violation of Maryland Rule 16-603. This Court has accepted and does accept counsel\u2019s proffer that the Respondent did maintain an attorney trust account at the Chevy Chase Bank. Accordingly, this Court shall proceed to determine the real questions at issue here, which are: whether the Respondent\u2019s fee may have become and unreasonable one under Rule 1.5; and, whether, reasonable or not, Respondent was required to have placed the flat fee in an attorney trust account upon receipt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">\u201cExamining the attorney trust account question first, Rule 16-604 provides, in relevant part, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201c[A]ll funds, including cash, received and accepted by an attorney or law firm in this State from a client or third person to be delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person, unless received as payment of fees owed the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client, shall be deposited to an attorney trust account in an approved financial institution....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">\u201cRule 16-609 provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">An attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by these rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account, obtain any remuneration from the financial institution for depositing any funds in the account, or use any funds for any unauthorized purpose.

Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. \u201cThis Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMKc\">Respondent violated each of these provisions in failing to deposit the $5,000.00 fee into his attorney trust account upon receiving those funds. While the Court of Appeals has not held that all. \u201cflat fees\u201d paid for future legal work, or \u201cadvance payment fees\u201d must, under all circumstances, be placed in an attorney trust account <em>(See, Attorney Grievance Commission v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 517 (note 14), 704 A.2d 1225 (1998)), the Court has regularly determined, in its case-by-case examinations, that such flat fee payments must be placed in escrow upon receipt, if the work has not been performed at the time of receipt. <em>See, Attorney Grievance Commission v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 53, 891 A.2d 1085 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 818 A.2d 219 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance </em>Commis<em>sion v.

Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 745 A.2d 1037 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cDespite use of the words \u201cnon-refundable\u201d and \u201cchargeable\u201d in the written Agreement, and the Respondent\u2019s efforts to try to explain what he meant by employing those terms, it is clear from the fourth sentence of paragraph four of the Agreement (\u201cAny unearned portion of the $5,000.00 fee will be refunded to [sic] although, due to discounted rate you have been charged in lieu of the hourly fee of $250.00 per hour, the amount of legal time required for your case will likely exceed the amount your are [sic] required to pay out-of-pocket and this possibility is not likely under the circumstances.\u201d) and from paragraph six (\u201cAfter our services conclude, we will, upon your request, deliver your file to you along with any funds ... of yours in our possession ....\u201d) that a refund of these fees was contemplated if Respondent\u2019s representation was to conclude prematurely. He also testified that he understood that the payment was refundable under certain circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cMoreover, since the Agreement required the Respondent\u2019s representation \u201cthrough trial in this matter,\u201d the fee would not be earned until conclusion of the trial. For all of these reasons, this Court concludes that the evidence is clear and convincing that the Respondent violated Rule 1.15 and Rules 16-604 and 16-609 in failing to place a legal fee in a trust account, and to hold it there through trial, and certainly, pending resolution of the dispute that evolved between he and Dean over a refund of the fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201cWith regard to the reasonableness of the fee charged by the Respondent in this matter, he argues that Dean was \u201can experienced business person\u201d who entered into the arrangement with Respondent at arms length, and that this is proof <em>vel non </em>that the flat fee arrangement was reasonable. Moreover, there was proof that other lawyers of prominence had set fees of $10,000.00 for representation of the defense through trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cThis Court agrees that the fee arrangement initially entered into by and between the parties was not unreasonable. However, a legal fee that is initially reasonable can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>become unreasonable or excessive in cases where the attorney does little or no work. <em>See, Attorney Grievance Commission v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 794 A.2d 92 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Dietz, </em>331 Md. 637, 629 A.2d 678 (1993). The fee can also become unreasonable when the large bulk of work to be performed under the original agreement is left unperformed at the time of withdrawal, which is what occurred here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">\u201cRespondent did not represent Dean or any of the other entities through trial. He filed a Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment and a Motion for Judicial Notice and Reply to Plaintiffs Response to Motion to Dismiss/for Summary Judgment; propounded some written discovery requests and attended a single hearing on the Motion to Dismiss before withdrawing from the case. The evidence is not clear as to whether the pleadings that the Respondent fled were, in fact, the pleadings that had been drafted by Mr. Bell (or his associate), which had been the subject of the previous $2,500.00 charge. However, even if the Respondent authored all of the pleadings and discovery requests without resort to Mr. Bell\u2019s drafts, a charge of $5,000.00 for prosecution of this unsuccessful motion is not a reasonable fee. It is clear that a more-than-reasonable $5,000.00 fee for representation through trial became an unreasonable $5,000.00 fee for filing of a single Motion and the propounding of some discovery pleadings in this case. Had the funds been maintained in the Respondent\u2019s trust account, where they belonged, perhaps a sensible and reasonable refund could have been arranged. In any event, this Court concludes that the Petitioner has established, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated Rule 1.5 in this matter, because his fee became unreasonable based on his withdrawal. His time records are confusing and contradictory and do not compel a different conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASjt\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cThe Petitioner has failed to establish violations of Rules 1.3; 1.4(b); 1.16(d) or Maryland Rule 16-603. The Petitioner has established, by clear and convincing evidence, violations of Rules 1.4(a); 1.5; 1.15; 8.4 and Maryland Rules 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>604 and 16-609. This Court observes that much of what transpired here may be ascribed to the Respondent\u2019s relative youth and inexperience, and also to the conduct of Mr. Bell in not only failing to thoughtfully mentor a younger lawyer to whom he had referred a case, but also, perhaps, in consorting with Dean after the relationship between Dean and the Respondent soured to precipitate these charges. Ordinarily, these could be seen as mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201cOn the other hand, this Court is concerned about the Respondent\u2019s apparent lack of candor during his testimony in the hearing: his testimony that he did not know that there were three (3) defendants sued in the Baltimore City litigation before setting the fee was not credible; nor was his testimony that he could not file a Counterclaim on behalf of Dean for ethical reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cThere is no doubt that the Respondent has failed, and seems to continue to fail to recognize the special obligations of a lawyer in setting a fee agreement with a client, and, more importantly, in adhering to it. When courts are asked to pass upon the reasonableness of legal fees, they must apply and will continue to apply far more rigorous standards than when examining sales commissions and performance bonuses in the business marketplace, particularly in the modern legal climate, where leave to enter and withdraw appearances in litigation continues to be sought and granted virtually without restriction, and with increasing frequency. Lawyers must not be permitted to threaten to abandon clients whenever it strikes them that they are in a position to renegotiate fees. Respondent should be taught, at a minimum, that bargaining techniques, posturing and subtle intimidation, all of which he employed with Dean in an effort to increase his fee, have no place in the lawyer-client relationship, particularly after a fee agreement is consummated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">(emphasis in original) (\u201c[sic]\u201ds in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>pendent review of the record. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 28, 922 A.2d 554, 570 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MRPC were violated, \u201cour consideration is essentially <em>de novo.\u201d </em>Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We have reviewed the record and conclude that Judge Cahill\u2019s findings of fact are supported by clear and convincing evidence, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>for his finding that Dean paid Wallace $65,000.00 in settlement of his claims. We will discuss this below. With this one exception, we accept the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction. Both Petitioner and Respondent took exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, each of which we shall address.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">\n<em>A. Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Bar Counsel (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) took exception to Judge Cahill\u2019s finding that \u201cDean paid Wallace some $65,000 to resolve all claims and presumably to acquire Wallace\u2019s interest in the restaurant business\u201d as it was not supported by any evidence in the record. As we have indicated, findings of fact made by a hearing judge are ordinarily entitled to deference unless clearly erroneous. Petitioner correctly states that it was Dean\u2019s uncontested testimony that he paid Wallace $65,000.00 at the termination of their joint venture, <em>prior </em>to the filing of Wallace\u2019s suit against Dean, not in settlement of Wallace\u2019s legal claims. The hearing judge did not cite the basis for his finding, and it appears to be merely a misunderstanding of Dean\u2019s testimony. We therefore conclude that the hearing court\u2019s interpretation represents clear error and we sustain Petitioner\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Bar Counsel also took exception to the hearing court\u2019s failure to find that MRPC 1.16(d) was violated by Respondent\u2019s failure to refund the unearned portion of the $5,000.00 prepaid fee. Petitioner argues that the findings which were the basis for Judge Cahill\u2019s conclusion that the prepaid fee was unreasonable in violation of MRPC 1.5 also provide clear and convincing evidence that MRPC 1.16(d) was violated. Rule 1.16(d) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>rendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In drawing his conclusion that Respondent had not violated 1.16(d), the hearing judge focused on whether Respondent violated the rule by failing to hand over his office files to Mr. Malone, the attorney who succeeded him in representing Dean and the other two defendants in Wallace\u2019s suit: Wallace and Dean Incorporated and T.D. Bistro, Inc. The hearing judge was correct in concluding that Respondent\u2019s failure to turn over his files prior to August 11, 2005, the date on which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City docketed the order allowing Respondent to withdraw from his representation, did not establish by clear and convincing evidence a violation of MRPC 1.16(d). The hearing court, however, neglected to consider whether Respondent\u2019s failure to return part or all of the $5,000.00 retainer violated the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We have held that MRPC 1.16(d) can be violated when an attorney fails to protect his client\u2019s interests by refusing to refund unearned fees or by failing to return such fees in a timely fashion. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cherry-Mahoi </em>388 Md. 124, 157, 879 A.2d 58, 79 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 517, 704 A.2d 1225, 1240 (1998). In the present case, the hearing court found that Respondent\u2019s claim to the $5,000.00 retainer represented an unreasonable fee and that his testimony that he had properly earned these funds was not credible. Respondent failed to return to Dean any portion of the $5,000.00 flat fee, and so violated MRPC 1.16(d). We therefore sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>B. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Respondent took exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he knowingly agreed to represent all three defendants in the Wallace suit, arguing that as only Dean signed the April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>24, 2005 written fee agreement, Respondent was only obligated to represent Dean, regardless of his knowledge of the other co-defendants. We overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Judge Cahill\u2019s finding that Respondent knew that there were three defendants who had been sued in the Baltimore City litigation and that he was to represent all three was clearly supported by the record. While it is true that the record reflects that Dean alone signed the fee agreement, it also is true that other evidence in the record substantiates a finding that Respondent undertook and continuously represented all three defendants. Jimmy A. Bell, the lawyer who referred this matter to Respondent, testified that Respondent knew that there were three defendants to be represented in the action prior to April 24, 2005. Also, on April 22, 2005, Respondent sent a letter to Dean which specifically discussed that three parties were named as defendants for which Respondent subsequently entered his appearance. Additionally, on May 23, 2005, Respondent emailed Dean and stated that \u201cI do want to continue to represent T.D. Bistro, Inc./Timothy Dean Bistro. As you know, I will vigorously represent all Defendants in the interim. Please do not retain separate counsel without first discussing it with me and seeking my input.\u201d Mr. Bell\u2019s testimony and the actions of the Respondent which occurred both before and after the April 24, 2005 execution of the fee agreement are the underpinnings for Judge Cahill\u2019s findings that Respondent both knew about and intended to represent all three defendants despite the conflict with the fee agreement. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Respondent also took exception to a number of Judge Cahill\u2019s conclusions of law. Specifically, he took exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that he violated MRPC 8.4(c) and (d), 1.4(a), and 1.15. We overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Respondent excepted to Judge Cahill\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPC 8.4(c) and (d), arguing that the evidence did not support his findings. Rule 8.4, sections (c) and (d) state in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">While the hearing judge did not conclude that Respondent entered into the Attorney-Client Fee Agreement with Dean with the intent to later increase his flat fee from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00, he did find that Respondent improperly sought to renegotiate his fee in the midst of representation with threats of withdrawal of representation. Judge Cahill compared the present case to <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. 228, 438 A.2d 501 (1981), in which this Court concurred with the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that an attempt to alter a fee arrangement mid-way through representation through coercion \u201cinvolves dishonesty and deceit and is prejudicial to the administration of justice.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 438 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Judge Cahill correctly noted that Kerpelman\u2019s presentation to his client of a new fee agreement during trial represents more egregious conduct than occurred here, but he also recognized that <em>Kerpelman </em>\u201cstands for the proposition that ... it is deceitful and dishonest for a lawyer to threaten to cease advancing or protecting his client\u2019s interests in litigation in order to renegotiate his fee agreement.\u201d Respondent, like Kerpelman, improperly threatened withdrawal from representation in attempting to renegotiate his fee with Dean\u2014clearly a coercive and intimidating act. Respondent, unlike Kerpelman, was not found credible when he testified before the hearing judge concerning his reasons for seeking the increased fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Respondent improperly attempted to renegotiate his fee after commencing representation of his client and then later misrepresented his motives for doing so during the hearing before Judge Cahill. These actions involved dishonesty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>deceit and were prejudicial to the administration of justice. We therefore find that there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s actions in renegotiating his fee under threat of withdrawal and misrepresenting his motives before the hearing court violated MRPC 8.4(c) and 8.4(d), and we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Respondent also took exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 1.4(a), asserting that his conclusion was \u201ctotally wrong.\u201d Judge Cahill found that Respondent violated MRPC 1.4(a) by failing to respond to his client\u2019s direct questions concerning the Motion to Dismiss filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Rule 1.4(a) states that (a) A lawyer shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">(4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">On June 21, 2005, Dean sent an email specifically stating \u201c[t]he purpose of this e-mail is to find out what is the status of the Motion to Dismiss?\u201d Respondent\u2019s reply to this email was not to inform his client of the hearing scheduled for July 6, 2005 but to transmit his proposed Motion to Withdraw as Counsel. While Respondent is correct in stating that Dean\u2019s appearance at the July 6, 2005 hearing was not necessary, Dean was still entitled to a timely response to his specific question. Additionally, after having expressed concern over the status of the Motion to Dismiss, Dean should have been informed when the motion was denied, which Respondent did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>We have held that failure to keep a client reasonably informed about the progress of his representation is a violation of MRPC 1.4(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>390 Md. 517, 525-26, 890 A.2d 273, 277-78 (2006); <em>McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. at 501, 813 A.2d at 1165. The hearing court found that Respondent neglected to respond to his client\u2019s question about the date of the hearing on his Motion to Dismiss in a timely manner and likewise never informed Dean of the outcome of that hearing. Respondent argues that this was error as Dean admitted to some uncertainty in his memories of specific communications with Respondent. Judge Ca-hill found credible Dean\u2019s testimony that he had concerns about Respondent\u2019s representation and did not feel that Respondent addressed to those concerns appropriately. Respondent presents no evidence or specific arguments to support his contention that the hearing judge\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. We therefore find that Respondent did violate MRPC 1.4(a) by failing to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of the Motion to Dismiss, especially when the client directly requested specific information.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Respondent also took exception to Judge Cahill\u2019s conclusion that he violated 1.15, arguing that there was clear and convincing evidence that he had earned his $5,000.00 flat fee. Rule 1.15 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Respondent argues that he did not violate MRPC 1.15 because he had already earned the fee when he received it from Dean as it was \u201cnon-refundable\u201d and \u201cchargeable.\u201d Judge Cahill properly incorporated in his decision our holdings that fee payments, such as the one provided to Respondent by Dean, must be placed in escrow upon receipt, if the work had not yet been performed at that time. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 53, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 297-298, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>818 A.2d 219, 232-233 (2003); <em>McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. at 504, 813 A.2d at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We also agree with the hearing court\u2019s analysis that in the Fee Agreement itself, the $5,000.00 fee was contemplated to be refundable, particularly if Respondent\u2019s representation were to conclude prematurely, as in fact happened. Likewise, as the Agreement stated that the fee was in exchange for Respondent\u2019s representation \u201cthrough trial in this matter,\u201d it was envisioned in this case that the fee would remain unearned until the end of the trial. We, therefore, concur with the hearing judge and conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that the fee was not earned at the time that Respondent received it from Dean and failed to properly place it in his attorney trust account. Accordingly, we conclude that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15 and overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>C. Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The hearing judge determined that Respondent acted in violation of MRPC 1.5 when he agreed to represent Dean through trial for $5,000.00, failed to complete the representation by withdrawing prior to trial, and then refused to refund any of the $5,000.00 fee. Rule 1.5 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">(b) The scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation, except when the lawyer will charge a regularly represented client on the same basis or rate. Any changes in the basis or rate of the fee or expenses shall also be communicated to the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Judge Cahill noted that while the $5,000.00 fee may have been reasonable at the time it was negotiated, it became an unreasonable fee when the Respondent withdrew his representation prior to trial, leaving unperformed much of the work originally contemplated when the parties entered into the Agreement. Additionally, the record is unclear as to the amount of work that Respondent did prior to his withdrawal, particularly given Mr. Bell\u2019s testimony that he prepared drafts of the pleadings and provided them to the Respondent. The hearing court found that even if Respondent made no use of the drafts, however, $5,000.00 remained an unreasonable fee for the filing of a single motion and the propounding of some discovery pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">This Court has held that an initially reasonable fee, even a flat fee, may become excessive in cases where the attorney does little or no work. <em>See Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 53-53, 891 A.2d 1085, 1096-97; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 392-93, 794 A.2d 92, 103 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dietz, </em>331 Md. 637, 647, 629 A.2d 678, 683 (1993). Given that Respondent withdrew his representation before the matter had proceeded through trial, and in light of his failing to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount of work he performed justified the fee, we find that Respondent violated Rule 1.5 by charging a fee that was unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The hearing judge also found that Respondent violated Maryland Rules 16-604 and 16-609 by failing to deposit the prepaid unearned $5,000.00 fee into an attorney trust account. In failing to place the fee into the proper account, Respondent also failed to hold any portion of the fee in trust until it was earned by representation through trial and neglected to hold the funds in trust pending resolution between himself and Dean over refund of the fee. Maryland Rule 16-604 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">Except as otherwise permitted by rule or other law, all funds, including cash, received and accepted by an attorney or law firm in this State from a client or third person to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person, unless received as payment of fees owed the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client, shall be deposited in an attorney trust account in an approved financial institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Maryland Rule 16-609 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">An attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by these Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account, obtain any remuneration from the financial institution for depositing any funds in the account, or use any funds for any unauthorized purpose. An instrument drawn on an attorney trust account may not be drawn payable to cash or to bearer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Before commencement of the January 31, 2007 hearing before Judge Cahill, counsel for Respondent proffered that while Respondent did maintain an attorney trust account, no portion of the $5,000.00 payment he obtained from Dean was ever placed in that account. The hearing court accepted this proffer and therefore found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rules 16-604 and 16-609 by failing to place unearned attorney fees in his attorney trust account. Having already dispensed with Respondent\u2019s argument that the fee was earned at the time it was deposited in our discussion of MRPC 1.15 <em>ante, </em>we agree with the hearing court and conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that the $5,000.00 was not earned at the time that Respondent failed to place it in his attorney trust account and that he thereby violated Rules 16-604 and 16-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In the case sub judice, Respondent has violated MRPC 1.4(a), 1.5, 1.15,1.16(d), 8.4(c) and (d), and Maryland Rules 16-604 and 16-609. Petitioner has recommended a sanction of disbarment, arguing that Respondent\u2019s engagement in dishonest and deceitful conduct in violation of MRPC 8.4(c) compels imposition of the sanction of disbarment, absent compelling extenuating circumstances. Respondent suggests that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction and urges us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>consider the hearing court\u2019s findings that the events that are the subject of this inquiry \u201cmay be ascribed to the Respondent\u2019s relative youth and inexperience, and also to the conduct of Mr. Bell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The appropriate sanction for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct generally \u201cdepends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 375, 872 A.2d at 693, 713 (2005), in furtherance of the purposes of attorney discipline: \u201c \u2018to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Awuah, </em>374 Md. at 526, 823 A.2d at 663. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 741 A.2d 1143 (1999), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">Because \u201can attorney\u2019s character <em>must remain beyond reproach\u201d </em>this \u201cCourt has the duty, since attorneys are its officers, to insist upon the <em>maintenance </em>of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Disciplinary proceedings have been established for this purpose, not for punishment, but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 27, 741 A.2d. at 1157, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Deutsch, </em>294 Md. 353, 368-69, 450 A.2d 1265, 1273 (1982) (emphasis in original). When imposing sanctions, we have enunciated that, \u201c\u2018[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gore, </em>380 Md. at 472, 845 A.2d at 1213. Therefore, in this case we consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 598-99, 911 A.2d 440, 447-48 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We have looked at the aggravating factors found in 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Sanctions (1991). <em>See Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. at 575, 846 A.2d at 376. These include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">(c) a pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">(h) vulnerability of victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">(j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-14\"><em>Id. </em>Several of these factors are present in this case, specifically (f), (g), and (i). This Court shares Judge Cahill\u2019s grave concerns about Respondent\u2019s lack of remorse and failure to recognize his obligations in setting a fee arrangement with a client. Respondent has not returned unearned fees to his client and has not demonstrated contrition. Respondent\u2019s lack of comprehension of the responsibilities peculiar to the legal profession gives us pause. We therefore agree with Judge Cahill that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">Respondent should be taught, at a minimum, that bargaining techniques, posturing and subtle intimidation, all of which he employed with Dean in an effort to increase his fee, have no place in the lawyer-client relationship, particularly after a fee agreement is consummated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">The facts in the current case are very similar to those in <em>Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. at 228, 438 A.2d at 501. In <em>Kerpelman, </em>we considered what sanction was appropriate for an attorney who renegotiated his fee in the midst of representation under the threat of withdrawal in violation of Maryland Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(4) and (5), the predecessors to MRPC 8.4(c) and (d), as well as Disciplinary Rule 2-106(A), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the predecessor to MRPC 1.5. While we found that Kerpelman\u2019s conduct \u201cinvolve[d] dishonesty and deceit and [was] prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d we did not find that his actions involved the type of deceit that merited disbarment. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 438 A.2d at 508. Instead, we found that Kerpelman\u2019s actions represented an isolated incident and that the proper sanction was suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 438 A.2d at 509-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In addition, one case of more recent vintage also involved an attorney attempting to renegotiate or raise fees subsequent to the commencement of representation while threatening withdrawal, and is therefore instructive in determining the sanction in the present case. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Korotki, </em>318 Md. 646, 569 A.2d 1224 (1990), an attorney was found to have violated Disciplinary Rule 2-106, the precursor to MRPC 1.5, and Disciplinary Rule 5-103(A), the predecessor to MRPC 1.8(h)(2)(i), by demanding that his clients sign amended fee agreements at two crucial points in the proceedings, lest he cease to represent them. After successfully litigating his client\u2019s claims at the trial level under a contingency fee agreement by which he was entitled to forty percent of their award, Korotki sought to force his clients to sign a new agreement under which he would be entitled to a total of sixty percent of all monies collected. Korotki told his clients that if they did not agree to the increase he would no longer represent them. Subsequent to the Court of Special Appeals rendering a decision in favor of Korotki\u2019s clients, he once more requested that they sign a revised fee agreement which raised his contingency fee to seventy-five percent. Again, he threatened to withdraw unless his clients signed the new agreement. In deciding the proper sanction for Korotki\u2019s behavior, this court analogized to <em>Kerpelman, </em>as Korotki\u2019s actions also involved fee gouging which harmed the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession. As the fees charged by Korotki were significantly higher than those charged by Kerpelman, this Court felt that a harsher sanction was warranted, suspending Korotki for eighteen months. <em>Id. </em>at 671-72, 569 A.2d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Like the attorneys in <em>Kerpelman </em>and <em>Korotki, </em>Respondent sought to increase his fees once he had begun representation of his client\u2019s interests under the umbrella of withdrawal. Respondent\u2019s actions can be said to be less egregious than those of the attorneys in the earlier two cases in that he did not wait until a crucial point in the proceedings to renegotiate his fees (as occurred in <em>Kerpelman </em>and Korotki), and the fees associated in the present case were less expansive compared with those in <em>Kerpelman </em>($25,000) and <em>Korotki </em>($471,424.36). The Respondent\u2019s actions, however, compare unfavorably with those of these attorneys in that he not only violated MRPC 8.4(c) and (d) by attempting to renegotiate his fees while threatening to withdraw, but also by misrepresenting his reasons for doing so before the hearing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In determining the appropriate sanction, we also consider any mitigating factors. These include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1kL\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Floyd, </em>400 Md. 236, 258-59, 929 A.2d 61, 74 (2007); <em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 599, 911 A.2d at 448, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996). Looking to these factors, Respondent\u2019s relative youth and inexperience are considered in choosing the appropriate sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Obi, </em>393 Md. 643, 660, 904 A.2d 422, 432 (2006). Respondent also has no prior disciplinary record, and the instant violations are not part of pattern of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">After analyzing analogous cases and considering all of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, including both Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>spondent\u2019s relative youth and inexperience and his lack of remorse and apprehension of the wrongness of his actions, we determine that Respondent\u2019s deceitful and dishonesty conduct warrants an indefinite suspension from the practice of law with the right to reapply for admission after one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED;RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">.

His failure to recognize that there was <em>absolutely </em>a conflict in either he or the Respondent representing a Defendant that is partially owned by the Plaintiff (Dean &amp; Wallace Incorporated was owned in part by Wallace); his failure to appreciate that \"ghost writing\u201d pleadings in litigation where the lawyer is in a conflict is a violation of Rule 1.7; and his referrals to this litigation as \"a pimple\u201d and a \"small case\" were, to be charitable, troubling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> The version of the Agreement that was signed by Dean is part of Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 (attachment 1 to Exhibit 1).

It is unclear how Respondent could have run up $12,750.00 in fees, principally to put together a motion that, apparently, had already been prepared and billed for by Mr. Bell.
