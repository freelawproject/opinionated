Specifically, the appellants, plaintiffs below, citing vulnerabilities in the system\u2019s security and accuracy, sought injunctive relief in the form of the decertification<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the DRE voting machines, or, in the alternative, the addition of a voter-verified paper audit trail of all ballots cast, which would permit an independent audit of the machines. The question presented on this appeal is whether the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County erred in finding that the State Board acted reasonably in purchasing and certifying the Diebold voting system, thus denying the appellants\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. In addressing this issue we consider whether the Circuit Court applied the correct standard in assessing the security and accuracy of Maryland\u2019s voting system and whether it properly exercised sound discretion in examining the factors necessary to support a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Electronic voting machines have been used in Maryland since 1996, when Baltimore City became the first jurisdiction to procure and deploy a DRE voting system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Precipitated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>part by the 1994 Gubernatorial Election, in which, in a very close election for governor, there had been problems with vote counting accuracy and conducting recounts, Maryland began looking for ways to improve its voting process. As part of the State\u2019s election reform, a series of commissions were appointed to study the elections process in Maryland. As a result of that examination, it was suggested that elections in Maryland needed to be modernized and that uniformity should be the benchmark for any such efforts. In addition, a revision to the then antiquated election code was recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">In response, the General Assembly mandated the \u201cmaximiz[ation of] the use of technology in election administration, including the development of a plan for a comprehensive computerized elections management system[,]\u201d EL \u00a7 2-102(b)(7),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, on December 4, 2000, Governor Glendening, pursuant to Executive Order 01.01.2000.25, formed a Special Committee on Voting Systems and Election Procedures in Maryland (\u201cthe Special Committee\u201d). The Special Committee issued a report in February 2001, recommending that Maryland adopt, in an attempt to eliminate a myriad of administrative problems which existed as a result of the differing systems that were being used at the time by the various counties around the State, a uniform statewide voting system for both the polling places and for absentee voting. It preferred, citing their reliability, accuracy and security, a DRE voting system for all polling places and an optical scan voting system for absentee ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The Special Committee indicated that there were several advantages to a DRE system, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the machines are programmed to prevent overvotes, reduced cost, no questionable marks resulting in the need to guess at voter intent during a recount, no need for the printing of paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ballots, the blind and visually impaired voters would be able to cast their votes without assistance, and ballots can be programmed in multiple languages. The Special Committee also noted the potential difficulties with the implementation of a DRE system: compared to optical scan systems, such a system may cost more for some local jurisdictions because of the sophisticated technology and the need for multiple units per precinct, rigorous, comprehensive testing would have to be performed in order to insure the accuracy and security of the system\u2019s software, and additional personnel would have to be hired or available to the State and Local Boards of Elections. Some specific recommendations of the Special Committee included that the system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">\u201cProvide the voter the highest degree of secrecy as practicable when casting his or her vote[;]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201cBe capable of creating a paper record of all votes in order that an audit trial [sic] [be] available in the event of a recount[;]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201cAllow, during the pre-election testing of voting systems, a random number of ballots or votes to be tested to ensure accurate tabulation[;]\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cBe available for leasing rather than purchasing in order to take advantage of anticipated technological advances.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The Maryland General Assembly adopted some of the Special Committee\u2019s most significant recommendations at its 2001 session, enacting Chapter 564, Laws of Maryland 2001, which added portions of the language now embodied in EL, Title 9, Subtitle l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That enactment required that the uniform statewide voting system be fully implemented by July 1, 2006.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Adhering to the directives of the General Assembly, the State Board issued a Request for Proposals to purchase DRE voting machines for use in all Maryland polling places. The State Board also hired an evaluation agent with expertise in voting systems and created an ad hoc committee, the Election System Evaluation Committee (\u201cESEV\u201d), to assist in examining the proposals and ultimately with the selection of a vendor. At the conclusion of its investigations, after meeting with various vendors and evaluating the DRE voting machines, the ESEV declined to endorse any of the vendors and recommended that the State invoke its right to reject all proposals and not move forward with the purchase of electronic voting machines altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Ultimately, the State Board purchased the Diebold system for use in Maryland polling places. The voting system was to be implemented in three phases: Phase I included deployment of the DRE machines in four counties\u2014Allegany, Dorchester, Montgomery, and Prince George\u2019s\u2014for the 2002 elections; Phase II included implementation in 17 (eventually 19) counties for the 2004 elections;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Baltimore City was to receive the system in 2006 as part of Phase III. The Diebold machines were used successfully in the four \u201cPhase I\u201d counties during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the 2002 elections,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> thus confirming for the State Board that it should continue with Phase II of the system\u2019s implementation. Therefore, the State Board purchased Diebold machines for the remainder of the counties, other than Baltimore City, for the 2004 March Primary Election. This decision by the State Board was not without a great deal of controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The first criticism of the State Board\u2019s actions was contained in a report, entitled \u201cAnalysis of an Electronic Voting System\u201d (\u201cthe Hopkins Report\u201d), published by Dr. Aviel Rubin, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, and his colleagues. Claiming to have reviewed the source code used in the Diebold machines, the Hopkins Report questioned the security of the newly acquired machines, identifying several theoretical<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> problems in the source code that could permit someone to alter the election results. The report also emphasized the need for a voter-verified audit trail in order to secure the integrity of the entire election process.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In response to the Hopkins Report, attempting to assess whether the theories proposed by Dr. Rubin were valid, Governor Ehrlich ordered an independent risk assessment of the Diebold machines. Accordingly, the Department of Budget and Management engaged Science Applications International Corporation (\u201cSAIC\u201d), an independent consultant, to examine the Diebold machines as implemented, at the conclusion of which SAIC released a report. While on the one hand criticizing Dr. Rubin, claiming that he did not have a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>understanding of the system, including the procedural controls and general voting environment, SAIC\u2019s report also identified a series of vulnerabilities in Maryland\u2019s voting system and elections process as a whole, noting several areas in which improvements could be made. The report went on to make recommendations for the mitigation of these vulnerabilities. Taking into consideration SAIC\u2019s report, the State Board crafted a \u201cVoting System Security Action Plan,\u201d specifying the steps it would take to improve the security of elections in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Subsequently, the Department of Legislative Services, in an attempt to conduct its own analysis of the security issues raised by the Hopkins and SAIC reports concerning the Diebold system, hired RABA Technologies, LLC (\u201cRABA\u201d), an Information Technology security consulting firm. The RABA group was led by Dr. Michael A. Wertheimer, a National Security Agency security expert, specializing in cryptologic mathematics. The RABA report criticized both Dr. Rubin\u2019s and SAIC\u2019s report, and it identified additional vulnerabilities in the voting system. Moreover, similar to the earlier reports, the RABA report made recommendations for changes and improvements to both the voting system, as well as Maryland\u2019s elections process.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The State Board evaluated the RABA report and adopted several, but not all, of the recommended security measures in time for the 2004 primary election. Further security enhancements were also made after that year\u2019s primary election.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although it did not implement all of RABA\u2019s recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tions, the State Board examined each recommendation fully and produced two written reports of its own: \u201cResponse to: Department of Legislative Services Trusted Agent Report on Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting Systems\u201d and \u201cProgress Report: Department of Legislative Services Trusted Agent Report on Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting Systems.\u201d In these reports, the State Board offered an explanation as to why recommendations were not adopted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The use of the Diebold machines during the 2004 March primaries, in the additional 19 counties, brought the State Board one step closer to executing Phase II of its implementation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On April 21, 2004, still sensitive to the concern held by many that the Diebold machines were still not secure and would not protect the integrity of the voting process for the approaching November 2004 elections, a group of registered Maryland voters and candidates for public office<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> sought expedited judicial relief in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, pursuant to EL \u00a7\u00a7 12-202<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>12-203,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the State Board\u2019s decision to purchase and certify the Diebold voting machine. The appellants, plaintiffs below, later filed an Amended Complaint and Verified Complaint on May 13, 2004. Specifically, the appellants requested the entry of a permanent injunction requiring the State Board to decertify all Diebold voting machines \u201cuntil such time as they can be updated to comply with the strictures of Maryland law that safeguard the security and integrity of Maryland\u2019s voting systems.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If upgrades to the voting system could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>implemented before the November elections, the appellants proposed that the State Board revert to the pre-existing optical scan system that had been previously used throughout the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">One day prior, on May 12, 2004, the National Federation for the Blind (\u201cNFB\u201d) filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-214,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a Motion to Intervene in the action. Having recently brought suit against the State in federal court on behalf of blind voters so that they could vote independently and privately, the NFB sought to uphold the use of the Diebold machines. The State Board and the NFB, both moved to dismiss the appellants\u2019 verified complaint, filing motions on May 21, 2004 and May 26, 2004, respectively. In addition, on May 27, 2004, the State Board filed a Motion for a Protective Order. By that motion, claiming that the \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 proposed discovery is intrusive and burdensome,\u201d and that the \u201cCourt should exercise its discretion to prevent the plaintiffs from diverting election officials from their important governmental tasks, unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>holds that a claim has been stated,\u201d it sought to preclude all discovery in the case until there had been a ruling on its Motion to Dismiss.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather than rule on the protective order motion, the Circuit Court ordered a scheduling conference for June 28, 2004 to \u201cdiscuss the discovery problems, the Motion to Dismiss, and an orderly, but expeditiously set scheduling procedure for all to follow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Before the scheduling conference, however, on June 25, 2004, the appellants filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction \u201cto maintain the status quo and enjoin [the] Defendants from using the Diebold ... voting system in the November 2004 elections [,]\u201d claiming that the remedy they sought was \u201cin danger of being extinguished not by a ruling [on] the merits but by the passage of time.\u201d They claimed further that the State Board \u201crecklessly certif[ied] the Diebold ... voting system,\u201d and that it did not \u201cfix or decertify the machines once numerous reports commissioned by the state of Maryland ... confirmed that the machines could not preserve the security and reliability of Maryland elections.\u201d Both the State Board and the NFB filed oppositions to the appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">At the scheduling conference, the court ordered discovery stayed until there was a ruling on the State Board\u2019s and the NFB\u2019s motions to dismiss, the hearing for which had been set for July 22, 2004. In addition, the court set the matter for a three-day evidentiary hearing, from August 25-27, regarding the appellants\u2019 motion for injunctive relief. At the July 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>2004 hearing, the court held both motions to dismiss <em>sub cu\u00f1a.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">At the evidentiary hearing, the Circuit Court heard testimony from a number of witnesses. The appellants offered the testimony of three experts, one State Board official and two non-party lay witnesses, while the State Board called one expert and several State Board officials, and the NFB called one NFB official.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Conceding that decertification of the Diebold voting machines was no longer feasible, the appellants made three arguments. First, they alleged that the Diebold DRE voting system, as theretofore implemented, did not protect the security of Maryland\u2019s voting process and did not count votes accurately. At the crux of the appellants\u2019 argument were the numerous vulnerabilities in the machines. The appellants offered expert testimony that underscored these vulnerabilities in addition to testimony detailing some of the specific problems encountered during the March primaries.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The appellants, moreover, maintained that the State Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>failed to respond adequately to the security and accuracy concerns related to the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The appellants\u2019 next argument pertained to the system\u2019s lack of capacity to provide an audit independent of the already existing security and accuracy concerns of the system itself. They claimed that without a voter-verified audit trail, the State, in the event of a recount, would only have the same inaccurate system which may have called into question the results of the election in the first place to rely upon.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the results, the appellants maintained, would never be completely accurate and, in any event, would not inspire confidence in their accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Finally, the appellants asserted that the remedies sought at trial, i.e. parallel monitoring of machines, poll worker training, a paper ballot option for voters, and complete implementation of the RABA recommendations, would minimize the security and accuracy failings of the machines, were feasible and could be put into place prior to the November election, and would not significantly disrupt the election process. The appellants maintained, in addition, however, that whatever the results of the November election, whether some or all of the system\u2019s deficiencies were cured, the lack of public trust in the system itself, due to the many public reports criticizing it, undermined the integrity of the election and its results.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Drs. Rubin and Wertheimer, defending their reports, were the appellants\u2019 expert witnesses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The cornerstone of Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Rubin\u2019s opinion, applying a \u201cperfection\u201d standard, was that it is impossible for a paperless electronic voting machine to protect the security and accuracy of the voting process. As a solution, he proposed a voter-verified audit trail.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Dr. Rubin further testified that, in July 2003, approximately 13 months prior to the hearing in the Circuit Court, he had examined an older version of the source code found in the Diebold machines and that the system was inherently susceptible to security vulnerabilities, which could potentially result in an undetected alteration of election results. It was stipulated, however, that he did not know whether the source code that he had previously examined was the same version of the source code that was presently in the machines and that would be used during the November elections. In addition, Dr. Rubin testified that he was not aware of the changes made by the State Board since the date of his study and whether those changes improved the security of the voting system overall.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He testified further that he was unaware of the security standard imposed by Maryland law pertaining to voting systems, and that he had solely focused on the security of the system\u2019s software and did not take into consideration any other equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>important factors of the election process. Finally, Dr. Rubin admitted that many of his initial assumptions about the Die-bold machines were incorrect and unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Dr. Wertheimer testified at length with respect to the evaluation that he and his team, collectively, \u201cthe RABA team,\u201d conducted on the Diebold voting system. The RABA team, unlike Dr. Rubin, did not focus only on a single element of the system, i.e. the software; instead, it focused on the technical, operational and procedural components of the system, applying a \u201cmilitary\u201d standard to the system\u2019s review. As explained by Dr. Wertheimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cIn my view, I think voting is a fundamental infrastructure for this country. That\u2019s the attitude I brought to this analysis. I think it\u2019s as important as a software that controls flight traffic. I think it\u2019s as important as our banking system, things I\u2019ve had to defend____I prefer to apply a model, in my opinion as an intelligence official, that if you\u2019re going to protect this at the level we protect other critical infrastructure, the model has to be that what is your adversary, how much is he willing to spend to throw an election. And we applied that methodology. As a result of that, we made a number of recommendations and graded the system quite low.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Dr. Wertheimer went on to recognize that the level of security imposed when evaluating any system is a policy choice and that he, like Dr. Rubin, did not know if the standard he applied in his analysis was the same as that imposed by Maryland law. Dr. Wertheimer acknowledged that there is no uniform standard applied to the evaluation of Maryland\u2019s, or any, voting system and that \u201creasonable people can have differences of opinion on virtually any aspect of the electronic voting machine debate.\u201d Finally, Dr. Wertheimer, while noting that the Diebold machines did not pass the RABA team\u2019s rigorous attack, testified that he was not sure as to how many hackers would be deterred by implementing the RABA recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The State Board and the NFB advanced various arguments in response. To begin, the State Board pointed out that the appellants were not, in fact, seeking to maintain the status quo with their preliminary injunction motion, for the status quo in Maryland was, after the March primaries, the use of the Diebold DRE machines. With the deployment of the machines statewide in the primary election, the State Board argued that the status quo could not be maintained with the addition of any other system. Specifically, it posited that the introduction of a paper ballot option, or any other voter choice, would violate the \u201cuniform\u201d system requirement of EL \u00a7 9-101(b). The State Board asseverated that giving voters a choice of systems would destroy uniformity and establish a bad precedent. Moreover, such a choice was, the State Board insisted, impractical and impossible to administer at such a late date.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The State Board argued further that the certification of a voting system in the State is delegated, by the General Assembly, to the Board itself. According to the State Board, the question before the trial court was not whether it had acted correctly, but, instead, whether it had acted arbitrarily or capriciously. The State Board maintained that its decision to purchase and certify the Diebold machines was reasonable and that, once concerns were raised about the security of the machines, it evaluated and thoughtfully responded to each recommendation. In the State Board\u2019s view, no further action was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The NFB\u2019s main argument, not surprisingly, related to accessibility. The NFB noted that, for the first time, blind voters were able to vote independently and secretly. It noted further that many of the interim remedies proposed by the appellants did not involve issues of accessibility, other than the paper ballot option which, the NFB pointed out, in fact, would be a matter of inaccessibility for blind voters, as their votes would, as a result, be private no longer. In addition, the NFB questioned whether a paper option would satisfy the statutory requirements, outlined in EL \u00a7 9-102, that the appellants alleged the DRE machines did not satisfy. Expounding upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>some of the many vulnerabilities of a paper ballot option, i.e. residual votes, under-voting, over-voting, stray marks, ballot box stuffing, the NFB contended that the appellants could not prove that such an option would be any more secure than electronic voting; thus, it urged, the court could, and should, not compel the State Board to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The witnesses for the defense, many of whom were, as mentioned earlier, State Board officials, maintained that the State Board would be able to conduct a secure and accurate election in November with the use of Diebold DRE machines. According to their testimony, many of the preliminary criticisms of the machines were largely hypothetical and inconsistent. Additionally, they described, in detail, the corrective measures that the State Board had taken to correct some of the valid security concerns that affected the system. The defense witnesses concluded that the greatest threat to the security and accuracy of the election was not the DRE machines, but an eleventh hour challenge, such as the one brought by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The defense called one expert witness, Dr. Michael Shamos.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Dr. Shamos testified that he had reviewed all of the reports on the Diebold voting machines, as well as the State Board\u2019s responses. He had also reviewed the applicable Maryland law. From his extensive research, Dr. Shamos concluded that Maryland would be able to provide a secure November election using Diebold machines. According to Dr. Shamos, there does not exist a voting system that is impervious to fraud, a notion he believes should be reflected in the standard applied when evaluating such systems. Applying a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard, he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201c[T]he standard of security is not 100 percent inviolability, or 100 percent safety against any conceivable risk that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>somebody may dream up. It is a balancing of the kinds of activities that occur in polling places, the kinds of activities that hackers attempt to perform versus the realism and expense of adopting counter measures. And when that balancing is done, the Board, or whatever state or whatever authority it is that is empowered to make that decision does that balancing and decides some systems are safe and some systems aren\u2019tf.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">As a certifier of electronic machines himself, Dr. Shamos went on to admit that he would \u201cnever say [a system is] 100 percent secure because [he] would be lying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Dr. Shamos\u2019 testimony also directly refuted some of the opinions offered by Drs. Rubin and Wertheimer.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> More specifically, Dr. Shamos disagreed with Dr. Rubin\u2019s view that a voter-verified paper audit trail is necessary. According to Dr. Shamos, no commercial system provides for a voter-verified paper audit trail, and even if there were such a system, it would do no more than provide partial assurance to the voter that his or her vote has been accurately counted. As Dr. Shamos explained, such a paper trail \u201cdoes not solve the problems that are alleged to affect or afflict DRE machines.\u201d Moreover, Dr. Shamos noted that a paper audit trail would \u201csimply restore[ ] us to the 1850\u2019s when all manner of chicanery was performed through manipulation of pieces of paper. And we don\u2019t have any better technology now than we had 150 years ago for assuring the security of pieces of paper.\u201d It was Dr. Shamos\u2019 testimony that paper-based ballot options, <em>i.e. </em>paper ballots and optical scan systems,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> were less, not more, secure than DRE machines, and that paper ballots and optical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>scan systems were not remedies, but instead alternatives, at best, to the alleged vulnerabilities in DRE machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In a written opinion, the Circuit Court denied the appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief. The trial court rejected the appellants\u2019 arguments, finding, instead, that Dr. Shamos presented \u201cthe true voice of reason\u201d and was \u201cthe most credible expert in th[e] matter.\u201d The Circuit Court enunciated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cWhile the Court is extremely concerned with the allegations of vulnerabilities and security flaws in th[e Diebold] system, as well as any other system, the credible testimony by Dr. Shamos indicated the State of Maryland is now employing all reasonable solutions and fixes suggested by all experts and has developed a system that could and should withstand external attack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Adopting Dr. Shamos\u2019 \u201cmore appropriate standard of care,\u201d the Circuit Court went on to consider and evaluate the pertinent factors for injunctive relief. The court was not convinced that the appellants had established a real probability of prevailing on the merits and remarked that the harm that the State would suffer if it had to implement a very costly paper option for the \u201csmall number of plaintiffs\u201d who wished to have that option far outweighed the risk of those plaintiffs\u2019 votes not being counted due to some breach in the DRE machines. In other words, the hypothetical harm proposed by the appellants, in the trial court\u2019s opinion, did not outweigh the real harm that the appellees would suffer were it to rule otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In addition, the Circuit Court found that the DRE machines \u201cclearly protected\u201d \u201cthe secrecy of the ballot\u201d for visually impaired voters. The implementation of DRE machines, the court reasoned, allowed \u201cblind voter[s], for the first time, [to] vote without the need of another looking over their shoulder and guiding them through the process.\u201d The Circuit Court also questioned the imminency of the appellants\u2019 harm. It noted, in that regard, although not finding the action barred by laches, that the appellants \u201chad ample notice, as early as 2002, of the use of the Diebold machines and clearly could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>have taken steps earlier than late April 2004 concerning the November 2004 presidential election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Although the Circuit Court acknowledged that there was a possibility that some votes may not be counted, it was confident that, due to the State Board\u2019s implementation of \u201cthe more reasonable requests and recommendations made by all the studies,\u201d the many \u201cdoomsday-type scenarios\u201d advanced by the appellants would not occur, in fact. Accordingly, it determined that they could not cause the appellants irreparable harm. According to the court, \u201cthe overwhelming factual evidence clearly shows there have been no verified incidences of tampering with these machines anywhere in the United States. The votes have been counted accurately. Recounts have occurred with complete accuracy, and there is no reason to believe this will not continue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Finally, the Circuit Court found that the interests of the public were being served and protected \u201cby the careful and complete review by the State Board of Elections of all reports, independent testing, and the eventual implementation of those factors deemed appropriate to be instituted for the protection of the public and the voting system.\u201d Granting the appellants\u2019 injunctive relief so close to the election would, the court reasoned, only cause voter confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In response to the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling, the appellants noted an appeal to this Court<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which this Court granted. <em>Schade v. Maryland State Bd. of Elections, </em>383 Md. 211, 857 A.2d 1129 (2004). Oral argument was heard on September 14, 2004, and, on that same day, the Court issued its Order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court. We now set forth the reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Before this Court, the appellants argue that the Circuit Court both erroneously found that the State Board acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>reasonably in its purchase and certification of the Diebold voting system, and erroneously denied their request for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Conceding, as they did below, that decertification of the DRE machines and the creation of a paper audit trail were no longer feasible remedies, on appeal, the appellants requested this Court to compel the State Board to implement certain security upgrades and measures to improve the security and reliability of the Diebold machines for the November 2004 election. Specifically, they sought the implementation of nine RABA recommendations,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the adoption of a series of federal best practices election guidelines,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>paper ballot option for those voters who do not wish to use DRE machines. Conversely, finding no error in the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling, the appellees, defendants below, urged this Court to affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">At the core of the appellants\u2019 argument is that the Circuit Court applied an incorrect standard in assessing the security and accuracy of Maryland\u2019s electronic voting system. They allege that the Circuit Court, by adopting wholesale the testimony of defense witness Dr. Shamos, read into the applicable statutory requirements, <em>see </em>EL \u00a7\u00a7 9-102 and 9-103, a \u201clesser\u201d standard for the evaluation of the State Board\u2019s actions. This application of the statutory requirements by the Circuit Court, the appellants posit, \u201cignored the statutory purpose of protecting public confidence in the integrity of the election, discounted the importance of elections to our democratic system, disregarded the unique multitude of risks presented by electronic voting systems, and brushed aside the appropriate standard suggested by the security experts hired by the Maryland legislature,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>Dr. Wertheimer and the RABA team\u2019s higher, \u201cmilitary,\u201d standard.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is the appellants\u2019 assertion that, \u201cabsent this clear legal error, the court below could not have reached its conclusion that [they] showed no likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The appellants insisted that \u201cthe circuit court\u2019s decision to settle with \u2018reasonable\u2019 security and \u2018reasonable\u2019 accuracy as opposed to the higher level of security applied to other critical systems that support our democracy is both inexplicable and legally incorrect\u201d given the serious nature of the November 2004 election where there exists \u201cthe very real possibility that a small margin of votes will determine the results.\u201d Recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing that the election at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>was not an \u201cordinary\u201d one, but instead a Presidential election, <em>see Bush v. Gore, </em>531 U.S. 98, 112, 121 S.Ct. 525, 533, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000), the appellants maintained that \u201cthe critical need to secure the integrity of the election process is further underscored!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Moreover, the appellants claimed that the Circuit Court\u2019s application of a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard caused the court, in turn, to implement the incorrect standard to its review of the State Board\u2019s actions. According to the appellants, the State Board\u2019s duty to select and certify a voting system, as outlined by the election code, involves a legislative mandate as opposed to an agency decision warranting discretion, making it ministerial in nature. Thus, the appellants averred that the State Board is not entitled to the more deferential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard imposed by the Circuit Court. Instead, the appellants posited that, by allowing for judicial review of the State Board\u2019s actions, <em>see </em>EL \u00a7 12-202, the Code ultimately leaves the decision as to which voting system should be certified to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Disagreeing with the appellants\u2019 characterization of the State Board\u2019s role in the selection and certification of voting systems as ministerial, the appellees argued that the State Board, through the delegation of the General Assembly, see EL \u00a7 \u00a7 9-101 through 9-103, was acting in a policy-making or quasi-legislative capacity. Citing <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 458, 654 A.2d 449, 458 (1995), the appellees posited that the Circuit Court was bound to give deference to the State Board\u2019s decision. More specifically, the appellees, relying on <em>Proctor v. Brookhart, </em>195 Md. 200, 204-05, 72 A.2d 682, 683-84 (1950), asserted that the State Board\u2019s decision to purchase and certify the Diebold DRE machines must be reviewed under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review, the standard applied by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In applying this standard, the appellees proffered that the State Board\u2019s decision was supported by a rational evaluation process. It is the appellees\u2019 contention that the appellants did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>not, and could not, demonstrate that the State Board acted arbitrarily and that the State Board had, in fact, \u201cshown that it addressed the alleged vulnerabilities in the older versions of the software and improved other aspects of security, after reviewing the critical Rubin, SAIC, and RABA reports.\u201d According to the appellees, the appellants could not \u201cclearly articulate a proposed remedy ... that: has not already been considered and implemented or rejected by the SBE; would effectively increase security by a significant amount in light of the cost of implementation, and, that is feasible at this late date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Likewise, the appellees argued that it cannot be shown that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in finding that the Deibold voting system was secure. Citing to the testimony of Dr. Shamos, and to the appellees\u2019 own witnesses, who agreed that, on the issues of security, \u201cknowledgeable persons could disagree,\u201d the appellees asserted that the Circuit Court \u201ccertainly properly exercised its discretion to credit that testimony.\u201d Moreover, the appellees posited that the Circuit Court exercised sound discretion in weighing the testimony of all of the experts and crediting the most \u201creasonable,\u201d as there is nothing in the applicable statutory law that requires absolute security. The appellees explained, even if the standard were the \u201cmost secure\u201d system, there was an ample record available for the Circuit Court to conclude that the Diebold DRE system was, in fact, the most secure system available.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the correctness of the Circuit Court\u2019s incorporation of Dr. Shamos\u2019 \u201creasonableness\u201d standard, the appellants argue, that the record, as a whole, did not support the denial of injunctive relief. First, the appellants alleged that there was present at the hearing, conclusive evidence that they were likely to succeed on all of the issues raised in their preliminary injunction motion. Again criticizing the Circuit Court\u2019s reliance on Dr. Shamos\u2019 testimony, the appellants proffered that their experts, who are regarded as \u201cforefront researchers in the field,\u201d were more qualified than Dr. Shamos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>and that, therefore, their opinions should have been given greater deference. The appellants urged this Court to set aside the Circuit Court\u2019s findings \u201cin light of the weight of evidence to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The appellants also asserted that the Circuit Court erred in its rejection of their request for partial relief. They submitted that the Circuit Court \u201cfocused almost exclusively on the paper ballot option,\u201d and summarily concluded that the State Board had implemented all reasonable recommendations. Moreover, the appellants alleged that the Circuit Court abused its discretion by not taking into account all of the evidence, claiming that the court \u201cdid not assess or mention\u201d various reports<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and \u201cfailed to address\u201d the testimony of certain witnesses, particularly their witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Next, the appellants contended, balancing the harm to them with that to the appellees, that their \u201cmodest request\u201d for relief would only require the State Board to \u201cexert a little more effort.\u201d The appellants stated further that any extra effort required on the part of the State Board can be attributed to its own unwillingness to act sooner, thus not truly causing the State Board any \u201charm.\u201d On the other hand, the appellants maintained that they were harmed by the Circuit Court\u2019s delay in hearing their complaint. They argued that their right to the relief they initially sought, <em>i.e. </em>decertification and a voter-verified audit trail, was lost, not on the merits of the case, but as a result of the Circuit Court\u2019s inaction. Moreover, the appellants posited that the Circuit Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ultimate denial of their claim for partial relief on the grounds that it was too late for its implementation, caused them irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Finally, the appellants contended, <em>quoting Common Cause v. Jones, </em>213 F.Supp.2d 1110, 1113 (C.D.Cal.2002), that it is \u201cself-evident that replacing voting systems that deprive individuals of the right to vote is clearly in the public interest.\u201d They asserted further that the interest of the public will be served by the occurrence of a \u201ctimely election that reflects the will of the voters.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The appellees, on the other hand, contended that it was unlikely that the appellants would succeed on the merits. According to the appellees, the appellants failed \u201cto show the relative merits of alternative voting systems with respect to security!,] nor was there any \u2018basis for a claim that some other voting system more closely satisfies the certification requirements of the statute.\u2019 \u201d In addition, the appellants\u2019 relief sought is illegal under federal and Maryland law, violating \u201cthe mandate to make voting equally accessible to the blind [under the Americans with Disabilities Act] and the State statutory requirement that a voting system, to be certified, must protect the secrecy of the ballot.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-102(c)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The appellees maintained that the trial court \u201cexpressly undertook to balance the hardships\u201d and correctly found it \u201cto tilt markedly against injunctive relief.\u201d As stated above, blind voters would be harmed by the grant of an injunction. No system suggested by the appellants was accessible to blind voters, thus causing these individuals ultimately to have to choose between \u201csecrecy and confidence in the system.\u201d The appellees also argued that the exorbitant cost of the appellants\u2019 paper ballot option, coupled with the risks that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>introduction of that system would potentially create, would cause them considerable harm. The appellees claimed that the appellants, on the other hand, would not suffer any harm if injunctive relief were not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The appellants, the appellees submitted, managed to demonstrate only a hypothetical risk of irreparable harm. They argued further that the harms proposed by the appellants \u201chad never materialized in any of the more than 20 Maryland elections where the Diebold AccuVote-TS DRE machines have been used\u201d and that the appellants delay in bringing their action undermined their claim of irreparable harm. Moreover, the appellees posited, the appellants acted unreasonably in waiting months, arguably years, to bring their claim. It was the appellees\u2019 belief that \u201cthere is no injury, much less irreparable one, if injunctive relief is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Finally, in looking at whether the public interest will be served by a grant of injunctive relief, the appellees proffered that the public interest is not represented by the eight appellees in this matter, but, instead by the millions of Maryland voters who will use the Diebold DRE machines in the November 2004 elections. Thus, the public interest, the appellees argued, would be served by not allowing eleventh hour challenges to the elections process, which could result in changes that would undoubtedly cause much voter confusion. Moreover, as they did below, the appellees asseverated that \u201cit is not in the public interest to create a precedent where each dissatisfied voter or group of voters has the power to select their own voting system.\u201d Nor is it in the public interest to replace a secure DRE voting system with a less secure paper option.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">As stated above, the assignments of error made in the case <em>sub judice </em>are the appellants\u2019 contentions that the Circuit Court erred in its adoption of Dr. Shamos\u2019 \u201creasonableness\u201d standard and in its denial of their injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>To be sure, the attribution of credibility to a witness is a finding of fact.

As the summary of testimony earlier illustrates, there is substantial evidence which tends to support the disputed factual allegations of all of the parties. In other words, evidence offered by the parties was conflicting to some degree in many aspects. Accordingly, the responsibility for resolving those conflicts lies with the Circuit Court, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 8-131 (c), <em>supra, </em>as it is in the best position, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>position far more superior than that of an appellate court, to evaluate and weigh such evidence. As noted earlier, if there is any competent, material evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s factual findings, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record is laden with material evidence supporting the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to credit Dr. Shamos\u2019 testimony over the other experts. We agree with the appellees that it is evident from its written opinion that the Circuit Court acknowledged and weighed the testimony of all of the trial experts. Although the appellants would urge this Court to credit the testimony of Dr. Wertheimer over Dr. Shamos, and, thus, find error in the Circuit Court\u2019s actions, we simply cannot, and will not, do so. The appellants argue that, because the Maryland Legislature commissioned Dr. Wertheimer and his RABA team, that Dr. Wertheimer\u2019s higher, \u201cindustry norm\u201d standard is the correct standard, and that standard should be applied in the assessment of Maryland\u2019s voting system. Stated more precisely, the appellants proclaim that \u201cthe very fact that the Maryland legislature hired RABA to determine whether the election system was sufficiently secure indicates <em>a fortiori </em>that the standard of security applied by RABA and Dr. Wertheimer is what the legislature viewed as the appropriate standard of care.\u201d The appellants are simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Albeit regarding administrative proceedings, this Court finds guidance on the issue of witness credibility in <em>A.H. Smith Sand and Gravel v. Department of Water Resources, </em>270 Md. 652, 667, 313 A.2d 820, 828 (1974), where we \u201cobserved that an expert\u2019s opinion is of no greater probative value than the soundness of his reasons given therefor will warrant.\u201d See <em>Surkovich v. Doub, </em>258 Md. 263, 272, 265 A.2d 447, 451 (1970); <em>Creswell v. Baltimore Aviation, </em>257 Md. 712, 721, 264 A.2d 838, 843 (1970); <em>Miller v. Abrahams, </em>239 Md. 263, 273, 211 A.2d 309, 314 (1965). That the RABA team was commissioned by the Legislature does not make its assessment of the voting system correct, nor does it bind the trial court to accept that opinion. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no doubt that, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>believe one expert would be to disbelieve another; the issue is, thus, credibility. The Circuit Court found Dr. Shamos to be more credible than the other witnesses. It is of no consequence whether his opinion was the only contrary one, or whether he was commissioned by the appellees instead of the Legislature, as these considerations are not determinative of his credibility. Affording it \u201cdue regard in its opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d this Court holds that the Circuit Court was well within its discretion to deem Dr. Shamos\u2019 testimony credible.

In determining whether entry of a preliminary injunction was appropriate, we consider the following factors: \u201c(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; (2) the \u2018balance of convenience\u2019 determined by whether greater injury would be done to the defendant by granting the injunction than would result by its refusal; (3) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) the public interest.\u201d <em>Perez, </em>394 Md. at 708, 908 A.2d at 1230, <em>citing Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 404-05, 474 A.2d at 197; <em>Fogle, supra, </em>337 Md. 441, 455-56, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995); <em>State Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>281 Md. at 554, 383 A.2d at 55.

We shall hold that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in its consideration and balancing of the factors pertinent to the review of the appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In order for the appellants to prevail on the merits, they would have to establish that the State Board erroneously selected and certified the Diebold DRE machines. As we have seen, the appellants argue that the Circuit Court erred in its use of deferential review, under an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard, of the State Board\u2019s decision. In proffering their argument, the appellants miseharacterize both the role of the State Board, as well as that of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">To be sure, this Court has held that we review \u201cthe discretionary functions of [an] agency under a standard more deferential than either the <em>de novo </em>review afforded an agency\u2019s legal conclusions or the substantial evidence review afforded an agency\u2019s factual findings,\u201d that is, the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>Spencer v.

We have enunciated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amb\">\u201c \u2018In those situations where an administrative agency is acting in a manner which may be considered legislative in nature (quasi-legislative), the judiciary\u2019s scope of review of that particular action is limited to assessing whether the agency was acting within its legal boundaries.\u2019 <em>Weiner v. Ins. Admin., </em>337 Md. 181, 190, 652 A.2d 125 (1995) (quoting <em>Linchester, supra, </em>274 Md. at 224, 334 A.2d 514); <em>Judy v.

Zoning Bd. of Howard </em>Co., 267 Md. 476, 487, 298 A.2d 8 (1972).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><em>Fogle, </em>337 Md. at 454, 654 A.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It is our view that the selection and certification of a uniform voting system, a function that we agree with the appellees to be a matter of policy or quasi-legislative in nature, taking into consideration the nature of the statutory requirements which give the State Board broad discretion to weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>various factors and ultimately decide on a system, should be reviewed under \u201cthe arbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. Accordingly, the Circuit Court, in reviewing the State Board\u2019s actions, was, as the appellees argue, bound to give the decision deference. The State Board is, no doubt, in a better position to carry out the charge delegated to it than any other entity, including this Court. The appellants, as mentioned early, would urge this Court to compel the State Board to adopt certain security measures; however, we are not in the position to do so. Contrary to the appellants\u2019 belief, it is not this Court that should ultimately decide on the State\u2019s voting system, but the State Board, to which that power was expressly delegated. Our role in this matter is that of arbiter, not policy maker. That being said, it is evident that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when, after considering the decision of the State Board and the record as a whole, and reviewing the action for regularity, it found that the State Board acted reasonably in its selection, and subsequent certification, of the Diebold voting system, thus denying the injunction. Accordingly, the Circuit did not err in its finding that the appellants were not likely to prevail on their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">To be sure, the Circuit Court characterized the harm to the appellants as hypothetical and that to the appellees as real. The record demonstrates that that characterization was not unsupported. The record reflects that the appellants did not prove that they would be harmed in any way if the Diebold system was implemented. Conversely, the State Board proffered evidence that it would suffer real harm if an injunction were granted. If this Court were to grant an injunction, the evidence showed, the State Board would have to absorb the cost of implementing a paper ballot option and the extensive education that would then be required. <em>See Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., </em>952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201c \u2018[Ijrreparable harm\u2019 must be \u2018neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\u2019 \u201d), <em>quoting Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, </em>888 F.2d 969, 975 (2d Cir.1989); <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 283 (4th Cir.2002); <em>ECRI v. McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>809 F.2d 223, 226 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Cir.1987) (\u201cEstablishing a risk of irreparable harm is not enough. A plaintiff has the burden of proving a clear showing of immediate irreparable injury\u201d); <em>Dan River, Inc. v. Icahn, </em>701 F.2d 278, 284 (4th Cir.1983) (noting that the irreparable harm to be suffered must be both \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cimmediate\u201d). Further, such an option, as both the appellees and the Circuit Court correctly recognized, had the potential to cause voter confusion, particularly when implemented at such a late date in the election process. There is also the matter of visually impaired voters being disenfranchised. The balance of hardships is in the appellees\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Finally, the record indicates that the State Board\u2019s selection and certification of the Diebold machines was reasonable, thus, serving the interest of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">This Court has held that \u201cinjunctive relief may be inappropriate in an elections case if the election is too close for the State, realistically, to be able to implement the necessary changes before the election.\u201d <em>Liddy v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 233, 245, 919 A.2d 1276, 1284 (2007). <em>See, e.g., MacGovern v. Connolly, </em>637 F.Supp. 111, 115 (D.Mass.1986), <em>quoting Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 585, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, 541 (1964) (recognizing that \u201cin awarding or withholding relief, a court should ... endeavor to avoid a disruption of the election process which might result from requiring precipitate changes that could make unreasonable or embarrassing demands on a State in adjusting to the requirements of the court\u2019s decree\u201d); <em>Farnum v. Burns, </em>548 F.Supp. 769, 774 (D.R.I.1982) (noting that \u201cequitable principles may require a court <em>not </em>to interfere with the conduct of rapidly upcoming elections where the election machinery is already in gear\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Barthelmes v. Morris, </em>342 F.Supp. 153, 160 (D.Md.1972) (stating that although \u201cthe election process is one fraught with uncertainty[, i]t does not follow [ ] that a court should add a further element of wholly unanticipated uncertainty into the process at the eleventh hour\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We agree with the appellees, and with the trial court, that a change in voting systems at the late date that this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>involved, would have done more harm than good. There was no guarantee that the appellants\u2019 proposed remedy, <em>i.e. </em>the implementation of specific security measures and a paper ballot option, would have resulted, in fact, in a \u201csecure\u201d election. No system is infallible.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In sum, the Circuit Court\u2019s weighing of the evidence and careful consideration of each applicable factor led it to the conclusion that the appellees would not likely prevail on the merits of any of the claims they advanced. We agree. Despite there being conflicting evidence, the record contained ample evidence to support the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\">.

Although there was no evidence that the Diebold machines were tampered with, hacked into, or manipulated to affect the results of the 2002 elections, the State Board did have some complaints as to the quality and number of personnel assigned by Diebold to assist Maryland in implementing the system, and security concerns began to emerge when the source code for the DRE machines was discovered on the Internet and widely distributed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\">. One such theory proposed by Dr. Rubin was that persons could breach the system by conceivably manufacturing their own voting cards, which would allow them to vote multiple times.

Among the many recommendations adopted by the State Board were: the hiring of a chief information security officer and other staff members to supplement its existing technical and security staff; the hiring of an outside computer security consulting company to review all of the reports and work with the State Board to improve the voting system; the addition of encrypted passwords for supervisor smart cards; the addition of an authentication procedure for transmitting preliminary results via modem; the parallel monitoring of random voting machines; the updating of anti-virus software; and the provision of security training for all persons involved in the election, from members of the State Board to local election judges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\">. One such instance involved RABA\u2019s recommendation that the State Board install Microsoft security patches on the machines to tabulate official election results. The State Board and its security contractor decided against such installation, noting that the patches may in fact interfere with the system and cause it to crash. Instead, the State Board took measures to protect the machines by physically securing and password protecting the servers, and safeguarding all input devices, such as disk drives, with tamper tape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">.

The \"updates\u201d proposed by the appellants, all of which, according to the appellants, \"should be confirmed by independent experts,\u201d included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\"without limitation the full implementation of the procedural safeguards identified in the RABA report ..the institution of a voter-verified paper audit trail, and such other measures as prove necessary to ensure the security, reliability, and accessibility of the new machines.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\">.

The motion was undoubtedly in response to service of a Request for Production of Documents upon the State Board and Notice of Deposition and Subpoena upon Diebold Election Systems, Inc. Subsequently, the appellants filed, on June 4, 2004, a Notice of Deposition of a State Board representative and, on June 18, 2004, served on the State Board their First Set of Interrogatories and First Requests for Admissions. In response to the appellants' additional discovery requests, the State Board filed two supplements to its May 27, 2004 protective order motion. The NFB also filed a Motion for Protective Order on June 11, 2004, objecting to the appellants' request of documents from Diebold, Inc. involving the corporation\u2019s relationship with the NFB on the basis that information sought by the appellants was \"constitutionally protected and irrelevant to th[e] case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">. In addition, the <em>de bene esse </em>deposition, in videotape form, of Denise Lamb, the Director of the New Mexico Bureau of Elections, was presented by the NFB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">. As to the specific election day malfunctions that occurred, the appellants offered the testimony of Maty von Euler, the democratic chief election judge in Montgomery County and Mr. Jeffrey Liss, a registered voter and attorney. Ms. von Euler testified that, as an election judge, she received several complaints from voters concerning the malfunction of machines, <em>i.e. </em>one screen appeared horizontally in a landscape format, while another repeatedly highlighted the name of a candidate that did not correspond with the voter\u2019s actual selection before finally highlighting the correct selection. In both cases the machines were shut down for the remainder of the election. In addition, Ms. von Euler testified that the visual equipment on the machines could not be tested and the votes could not be cumulated at the end of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Mr. Liss\u2019 testimony recounted his personal experience with the Die-bold machines on election day. To begin, Mr. Liss, after repeatedly pressing the \u201creview ballot\u201d option on the Diebold screen, was unable to review his ballot before actually casting it. He also claimed that he was not presented a \"complete\u201d ballot. According to Mr. Liss, the ballot that he filled out did not include all of the races. Mr. Liss was later allowed to complete a provisional ballot to ensure that he voted in all the races.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\">. The State Board\u2019s audit system at the time depended on printing out ballot images that were stored in the voting machines themselves after the election. Therefore, in the appellants' view, the ballot image technology was subject to the same vulnerabilities as the machines which used it, with the result that the election results of this non-voter verified system could not be properly authenticated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">. The appellants also called Dr. Kimball Brace as an expert on election administration. The motion to qualify Dr. Brace, however, was opposed. After a lengthy <em>voir dire </em>examination, the court qualified Dr. Brace as an expert, stating: \"I\u2019m going to do this. I\u2019m going to allow the gentleman to testify as an expert. What weight I give to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>experts in any of these cases is solely at my discretion, so feel free to question him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">Dr. Brace was not very familiar with Maryland's voting system, and, while advocating for the paper ballot option, he had no substantive recommendations as to its implementation. The State Board, through the testimony of Mr. Joseph Torre, its operations officer for voting system procurement, estimated that a paper ballot option, which would include, <em>inter alia, </em>the cost of printing the ballots and purchasing secrecy sleeves, ballot boxes and privacy booths, would cost approximately $6 million dollars. Extensive voter education and training on how to fill out such ballots would also have to be conducted and additional election judges would have been required, he opined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">. The appellants admitted at the evidentiary hearing that a voter-verified audit trail, like the decertification of the machines themselves, was no longer a feasible remedy, as it would have been impossible to have implemented such a system before the November election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b45-8\">. At trial, it was revealed that Dr. Rubin was unaware of the State Board\u2019s published responses to not only his report, but also to the SAIC and RABA reports, and he had, thus, not reviewed them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\">. Dr. Shamos was qualified as an expert in the history of voting in the United States, operation of voting systems, certifications of voting systems, computer systems, and computer security. Although the appellants had no objection to his expertise in the other areas, they did oppose Dr. Shamos\u2019 qualification as an expert on computer security. That challenge was unsuccessful, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">. Dr. Shamos squarely disagreed with Dr. Wertheimer\u2019s claim that Microsoft patches needed to be placed on the machines. He testified that, after determining that the disadvantages of installing the patches outweighed the potential advantages, the State Board\u2019s decision to not incorporate that RABA recommendation was reasonable. See note 13, at 10-11 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">. Dr. Shamos made note that optical scan systems are not, and have never been, subjected to the exhaustive testing that has been performed on DRE machines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\">. <em>See </em>EL \u00a7 12-203, <em>supra </em>note 16, at 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b52-5\">. On brief, the appellants presented the following statements of questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\"I. The Circuit Court applied an incorrect standard in assessing the security and accuracy of Maryland's electronic voting system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\"II. Even if \u00a7 9-102 and \u00a7 9-103 implicitly incorporates Dr. Shamos\u2019s 'reasonableness' standard, the record as a whole does not support the Circuit Court\u2019s findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\">. The appellants specifically requested that the State Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201cInstall all known security patches from Microsoft on the GEMS server!;] \"Establish a procedure to effectively evaluate security patches as soon as they are released!;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">\"Turn off all services and ports except those explicitly required by the GEMS software;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">\"Install a software package called \"Tripwire\u201d onto the GEMS Servers!;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">\"Place a printed image of the ballot next to every polling station!;] \"Implement a procedure to ensure that the software has not been modified during the election day!;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">\"Increase election judge training!; and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">\"Conduct independent evaluations of the source code when the source code is changed or upgraded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">During oral argument, as they did below, the State Board argued that the implementation of many of the RABA recommendations sought by the appellants had already occurred, while those that had not been implemented were considered and then reasonably rejected. Thus, the State Board proffered that the RABA recommendations, and the testimony of its author, Dr. Wertheimer, were stale. According to the State Board, the Diebold machines were not proven to be vulnerable as deployed and as updated since the various studies criticizing them were performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b52-16\">. The appellants sought the adoption of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s (\"EAC\u201d) \"Best Practices in Administration, Management and Security in Voting Systems and Provision Balloting.\u201d The publica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tion of the guidelines was in response to a mandate of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15301 <em>etseq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\">. The appellants contend that Dr. Wertheimer did not in fact adopt a standard of \"military impregnability,\u201d and, instead, refer to his standard as the \"industry norm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">. The reports to which the appellants refer are the CalTech/MIT study, the EAC Guidelines, and the Brennan Center-LCCR Report. These reports, however, were admitted into evidence and, thus, were available for the Circuit Court\u2019s review. The fact that the court did not mention this evidence in its written opinion does not suggest that it was not considered. It is within the Circuit Court\u2019s discretion to weigh and credit the evidence as it sees fit. It may pick and choose which items to credit. <em>See Sessoms v. State, </em>357 Md. 274, 293, 744 A.2d 9, 19 (2000) (\"[A trial court] may believe or disbelieve, credit or disregard, any evidence introduced, and a reviewing court may not decide on appeal how much weight must be given to each item of evidence\u201d). We are, thus, not persuaded by the appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">. The appellants, on brief, set forth an additional argument pertaining to the record, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u2018\u2018[T]he Circuit Court abused its discretion by refusing to consider the record as a whole and allowing the appellees to develop a one-sided and untested partial record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">We will not address this evidentiary issue, in view of the Circuit Court\u2019s credibility findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
