Judge Hughes held a hearing on April 26, 2007, and issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on June 7, 2007, in which he found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated MRPC 1.15(a) and (b), 8.1(a), and 8.4(c) and (d), Maryland Rules 16-607 and 16-609, and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>FINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">1. Testimony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe Respondent graduated from the George Mason Law School in 1979, and began his legal career drafting legislation for the Maryland Legislature. He then became a tax lawyer for the Internal Revenue Service, and left that employment in 1984 after obtaining his Masters degree in Taxation from Georgetown University Law School. Respondent was admitted to practice before the Maryland Court of Appeals on December 1, 1983. Since 1984, the Respondent has been in private practice in Annapolis, Maryland. He is presently <em>55 </em>years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201cFrom 1984 until the present, his practice has remained the same, with approximately 80% of his time being spent on tax work and the balance being spent in estates and trust, corporate and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Since 1984, the Respondent estimates that he has represented over 2000 clients, with about 5% of those representing bankruptcy clients and 95% of those clients representing referrals from other attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cThe events giving rise to this case took place between the years of 2003 and 2005. During that time, the Respondent testified that he maintained a single attorney escrow account at the Bank of America. He also maintained an operating account and a payroll account for his law practice, which are referred to herein as \u201coperating account(s).\u201d In 2003 the Respondent began experiencing severe cash flow difficulties with his practice, rendering him unable to pay the normal operating expenses of his law practice. Specifically, the Respondent testified that in 2003 over $150,000.00 in receivables became uncollectible by virtue of failed bankruptcy reorganization plans. Generally, such fees are contingent upon the success of the reorganization, and, when unsuccessful, the receivables earned in the reorganization effort become uncollectible. A second difficulty encountered by the Respondent was the delay in the Bankruptcy Court approving earned fees. Ordinarily, bankruptcy fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>are placed in escrow, but can only be dispersed upon Bankruptcy Court approval. Those disbursements took up to 120 days to be approved. As a result of these difficulties, the Respondent sought and exhausted financing assistance, but was still unable to meet the operating expenses of his law firm or to repay his personal loans. It should be noted that in the year 2003, the Respondent earned approximately $106,000.00 from the practice of law and was paying college tuition for two of his children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\u201cWhat developed in 2003, and extended into 2005, was a practice whereby the Respondent would write checks from his escrow account, and deposit the same in his operating accounts as needed and without legal authority. When funds were due to be remitted to proper payees from his escrow account, he would cover shortfalls with short term borrowing, by the deposit of rents he received for office space in his law building in Annapolis and/or by using other clients\u2019 funds. The Respondent testified that all proper payments from his escrow accounts were made when due, and no client at any time suffered any financial loss as a result of this practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cThis misuse of escrow funds continued through 2004 and into 2005. The Respondent earned income of approximately $106,000.00 in 2003, $110,000.00 in 2004 and $90,000.00 in 2005 from the practice of law, and had assumed full responsibility for payment of college expenses for two of his children. This misuse of escrow funds came to the attention of the Petitioner when a check drawn on the Respondent\u2019s escrow account was returned by his bank for insufficient funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cOnce contacted by the Petitioner, Respondent submitted to the Petitioner ledgers which he told the Petitioner had been contemporaneously maintained by Respondent and which accurately documented his handling of client funds in the escrow account. Neither representation was true. Eight months later, Respondent voluntarily made known to Mr. Botluk that he had made several entries after the fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that the ledgers contained \u201cmultiple inaccuracies\u201d and did not accurately reflect his handling of the client funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201cWhen the Court contacted the parties to set the Scheduling Order, the Respondent indicated that he would work with Mr. Botluk to prepare a stipulation of facts. Respondent further indicated that he would only present character witnesses at the judicial hearing. In addition to the Respondent, four individuals appeared at the hearing before this Court and testified on the Respondent\u2019s behalf. These individuals were Attorney John Newell, the Honorable James F. Schneider, Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Attorney Stephen Krohn, and the Honorable Joseph P. Manck, former Administrative Judge of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cAttorney John Newell testified that he has been an attorney since 1973, specializes in estates and has been a Court Auditor for the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County since June of 1981. Mr. Newell testified that he has known the Respondent for approximately fourteen years; that he has referred work to the Respondent; that the Respondent\u2019s handling of those referred matters was \u201coutstanding\u201d and that Respondent\u2019s character and integrity were \u201cwithout blemish\u201d; that Mr. Newell recruited the Respondent as Counsel to the Anne Arundel County Library Board, that the Respondent gave generously of his time, attended every meeting, and also devoted much time as counsel to the Anne Arundel County Library Foundation. Notwithstanding having read the Stipulation (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1), Mr. Newell\u2019s opinion of the Respondent has not changed. Mr. Newell was of the opinion that the Respondent has the capacity to do a lot of good for a lot of people in the future, even if he is not practicing law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cThe Honorable James F. Schneider, Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland has been a judge for twenty-five years. Judge Schneider testified he knows the Respondent from his bankruptcy practice, and he evaluated the Respondent\u2019s competence as being within the top 25% of bankruptcy attorneys appearing before him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Based on numerous professional contacts with the Respondent, Judge Schneider opined that the Respondent\u2019s character and integrity were the \u201chighest\u201d and that his trustworthiness was \u201cparamount.\u201d The Judge could not recall any complaint from anyone concerning Respondent\u2019s legal work. Notwithstanding having read the Stipulation, Judge Schneider stated that he still trusts the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\u201cAttorney Stephen Krohn testified that he has been an attorney for 29 years and is a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. Mr. Krohn has known the Respondent for 30 years, and developed a personal friendship with the Respondent approximately 20 years ago. Since knowing the Respondent, Mr. Krohn has referred tax and bankruptcy matters to him, and has never received any complaint concerning the Respondent\u2019s legal performance. Mr. Krohn testified that he has never had an occasion to be concerned about Respondent\u2019s character or integrity. Having read the Stipulation in this case, Mr. Krohn offered the opinion that while he still has trust in the character and integrity of the Respondent, he believes that some trust needs to be rebuilt. He characterized the Respondent as a good, caring and loving father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cAlso testifying was the Honorable Joseph P. Manck former Administrative Judge of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Judge Manck has been on the bench since 1989, and he personally knew the Respondent as a child, lost contact, but then became reacquainted with him while both practiced law. As a lawyer, Judge Manck referred clients to the Respondent, and opined that the Respondent\u2019s character and integrity were of the highest order. Having read the Stipulation, Judge Manck affirmed the same level of trust in the Respondent and offered the opinion that the Respondent can still be of benefit to the public as an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">2. Stipulation (Exhibit 1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cWhat follows are stipulated facts. For convenience in referencing individual transactions, each is abbreviated by the client or date designation in bold type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\u201cRespondent deposited $30,000.00 in escrow on November 13, 2003, belonging to client, the Bankruptcy Estate of Leonard and Ronnie Cantor. He withdrew the $30,000.00, transferring the funds to his operating account, between November 13 and December 9, 2003 (Cantor I). He paid $28,000.00 to the Cantor bankruptcy estate on December 24, 2003, using funds belonging to an unrelated client, Mount Oak, LLC (Mount Oak I).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cFunds for client Mount Oak, LLC were received by wire on December 18, 2003. Following that deposit of $104,026.07 in his escrow account, the balance fell to $81,131.20 on December 22, 2003 (Mount Oak II). The full amount of the original deposit was wired out on April 19, 2004. \u25a0 Respondent used funds belonging to an unrelated client, Richard Brien (which was deposited in the escrow account on March 3, 2004), to fund the disbursement to Mount Oak, LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cOn January 9, 2004, Respondent deposited $8,000.00 belonging to the Cantor bankruptcy case in escrow. Although he made no disbursement to or on behalf of Cantor, the balance in his escrow account was $2,240.06 on February 5, 2004 (Cantor II). He deposited an additional $6,000.00 on February 9, 2004, for a total of $14,000.00. His escrow account balance subsequently fell below $14,000.00 before he made any disbursements to or on behalf of Cantor. When he distributed funds to the Bankruptcy Trustee which was paid to the Cantor creditors, on June 28, 2004, he drew a check for $14,511.71, which exceeded the amount he was supposed to be holding for the client (Cantor III).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cRespondent received a wire deposit of $342,702.95 on behalf of client Richard T. Brien in his escrow account to Brien on March 3, 2004. That amount was wired out of the escrow account on April 26, 2004. From March 29th until April 21, 2004, Respondent did not maintain the full amount of Brien\u2019s deposit in his escrow account (Brien). A deposit of $135,000.00 on April 22nd on behalf of an unrelated client, James Riggleman, gave the account sufficient funds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>permit Respondent to disburse Brien\u2019s funds on April 26th (Riggleman).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u201cOn April 6, 2004, Respondent deposited $1,500.00 in his escrow account from client Karen Lynn Jenkins. Respondent\u2019s escrow account balance was $510.48 on May 10, 2004 (Jenkins). Respondent returned $1,500.00 to Jenkins on October 19, 2005 by check number 608 drawn on his escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cRespondent deposited in his escrow account $1,086.00 belonging to client Tidewater Elevator on April 9, 2004. By May 10, 2004, the balance in his escrow account was $510.48 (Tidewater 1), even though there were no withdrawals related to this client. Respondent had transferred a total of $9,800.00 from his escrow account to his operating account from May 3 to May 10, 2004 (May 2004). Between April 9 and July 23, 2004, Respondent deposited a total of $1,517.11 in his escrow account for Tidewater Elevator. There are times when the escrow account balance fell below $1,517.11 (Tidewater II) after the last deposit and before Respondent returned the funds to the client on September 2, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201cWhen Respondent transferred $35,000.00 from his escrow account to his operating account, on April 20, 2004, he used funds held on behalf of clients Richard T. Brien and John McKenna (McKenna).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cAs of April 26, 2004, Respondent was supposed to be holding $26,863.83 in his escrow account for client John McKenna. By May 10, 2004, after Respondent had transferred $9,800.00 to his own accounts, the balance in the escrow account was $510.48. In August and October 2005, Respondent paid Mr. McKenna using funds belonging to other clients (August-October 2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">\u201cRespondent was supposed to be holding $2,500.00 belonging to Excell Management from May 20, 2004 until April 7, 2005. Respondent failed to maintain that balance in his escrow account (Excell). Respondent returned the $2,500.00 to Excell Management by a check dated March 31, 2005, using funds received from an unrelated client, Black Hawk Security, on that date (Black Hawk).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201cRespondent deposited $30,000.00 in his escrow account on July 6, 2004, for client Allan Percival (Percival I).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following day, the balance in Respondent\u2019s account was $12,923.28, although he made no disbursements related to Mr. Percival. On September 21 and 22, 2004, he disbursed two checks totaling $30,526.03 to Percival. Respondent had held no other funds on behalf of Percival to account for the additional $526.03 (Percival II).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cOn July 7, 2004, Respondent deposited into the escrow account $25,000.00 belonging to Eastport .Analytics (East-port I).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following day, the balance in the account was $12,923.28, although he had not made disbursements related to this client. On July 7th, he transferred a total of $7,300.00 from his escrow account to his operating accounts. By July 31, 2004, the escrow account had a negative balance (Eastport II). He paid $25,000.00 to Eastport Analytics on January 3, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cOn August 6, 2004, Respondent deposited $13,000.00 in his escrow account belonging to his client, Liberty Metal, Inc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 10th, Respondent transferred a portion of the Liberty Metal funds to his operating account. By August 26, 2004, Respondent had a negative balance in his escrow account. Funds belonging to Liberty Metal were disbursed to Horace Davis (August 11, 2004) (Liberty I) and J. Riggleman (August 25, 2004) (Liberty II) for matters unrelated to Liberty Metal. On December 6, 2004, Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>dent paid $18,000.00 to U.S. Treasury for Liberty Metal from funds in his escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201cWhen Respondent transferred $1,000.00 to his operating account on August 10, 2004, he used funds belonging to Liberty Metal and Tidewater Elevator (Tidewater III).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201cThe transfer of $1,3000.00 from Respondent\u2019s escrow account to his operating account<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> used funds he was to be holding for Olmo Brothers (Olmo), Allan Percival and East-port Analytics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">\u201cRespondent deposited in his escrow account $32,000.00 on June 8, 2005 on behalf of client Inez Brown from Carole Schwartz. Two days later, the balance in the escrow account was $13,946.26 (Brown I). On June 30, 2005, the balance was $18.46 (Brown II). The escrow account had a negative balance on July 14th (Brown III). Respondent had not disbursed the funds on behalf of his clients. On September 8, 2005, the $32,000.00 was disbursed to the United States Treasury on behalf of Brown. Respondent used funds belonging to clients Richard Epstein (Epstein) and Dennis Hayden (Hayden).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">\u201cRespondent transferred $1,000.00 to his operating account on June 30, 2005, leaving a balance of $18.43 in the escrow account when he was supposed to be holding $32,000.00 for Inez Brown (Brown II).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">\u201cOn several occasions, Respondent deposited in his escrow account funds received for rent from other attorneys using space in his office, Douglas Hollmann and Carolyn Krohn (personal rent).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">\u201cRespondent deposited $20,000.00 in his escrow account on August 18, 2005. Those funds belonged to client, Preci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>sion Signs. On August 31, 2005, Respondent\u2019s escrow account balance was $654.69 (Precision). There were no disbursements from Respondent\u2019s escrow account related to Precision Signs between August 18 and August 31, 2005. Respondent disbursed $20,000.00 to Precision Signs on October 6, 2005, using funds belonging to an unrelated client, Terry Ault (Ault I).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201cFunds belonging to client Terry Ault in the amount of $55,469.39 were deposited in Respondent\u2019s escrow account on October 6, 2005.

Terry Ault was paid $55,469.39 on November 15, 2005, partially using funds belonging to Mid-Atlantic Nursing (Mid Atlantic). While Respondent was holding the funds for Terry Ault, he transferred a total of $30,200.00 to his own accounts. The transfer of $1,000.00 (Ault II) on October 17, 2005 and $1,500.00 on November 9, 2005 (Ault III) from Respondent\u2019s escrow account to his operating account was a use of Terry Ault\u2019s funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201cIn response to Bar Counsel in this matter, Respondent submitted documents which he purported to be ledgers contemporaneously maintained by him documenting his handling of client funds in his escrow account.

Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 475, 773 A.2d 516, 522 (2001). In our review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(2);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 700, 919 A.2d 669, 675 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 151, 844 A.2d 367, 380-381 (2004). As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MRPC were violated, \u201cour consideration is essentially <em>de novo.\u201d </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(l);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We have reviewed the record and conclude that except for his conclusion that the record does not support adequately a finding that funds Respondent received from Excell Management were for legal fees or expenses, Judge Hughes\u2019 findings of fact are supported by clear and convincing evidence. We will discuss our sustaining of this exception below.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">A. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Petitioner took exception to Judge Hughes\u2019 conclusion that Respondent did not violate MRPC 1.15(c) because \u201c[tjhis record does not support a finding that any monies received by the Respondent from his escrow account were for legal fees or expenses,\u201d which would include monies paid to Respondent by Karen Lynn Jenkins and Excell Management. Bar Counsel asserts that Respondent\u2019s transactions involving Karen Lynn Jenkins and Excell Management violated MRPC 1.15(c) because these clients paid Respondent retainer fees which he subsequently disbursed to finance unrelated matters. Respondent argues in support of the hearing court\u2019s finding that the evidence does not establish a MRPC 1.15(c) violation under the clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Petitioner\u2019s exception requires us to review both a finding of fact and a conclusion of law. As we have indicated, findings of fact made by a hearing judge are ordinarily entitled to deference unless clearly erroneous. In reference to the transactions involving Excell Management, not only did Respondent testify that he was \u201cretained\u201d to represent Excell, but in his ledgers, Respondent listed Excell\u2019s initial payment as \u201cRetained\u201d and the disbursement of the account funds on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>28, 2005 as \u201cRefund of retainer.\u201d On the basis of Respondent\u2019s own testimony and his ledger entries, we are satisfied that the payment accepted from Excell Management was for legal fees paid to retain the Respondent\u2019s services. We therefore sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s factual exception as to the funds Respondent received from Excell.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The hearing court found that Respondent did withdraw funds from Excell\u2019s retainer without having incurred any fees or expenses. In his findings of fact, the hearing judge found that \u201cRespondent was supposed to be holding $2,500.00 belonging to Excell Management from May 20, 2004 until April 7, 2005. Respondent failed to maintain that balance in his escrow account----\u201d Because there is unambiguous evidence that Excell\u2019s payments to Respondent represented legal fees, Respondent failed to meet his burden by a preponderance of evidence, and because the hearing court found that these funds had been improperly withdrawn, we sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception and conclude that Respondent did violate MRPC 1.15(c) with regard to the transactions related to Excell Management.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">As to Karen Lynn Jenkins, Respondent did testify that he was \u201cretained\u201d to represent her, but the original ledger notations for transactions involving this client do not appear in the record. In the absence of this ledger evidence, we defer to the hearing court\u2019s finding and find by clear and convincing evidence that Jenkins\u2019 payment was not for legal fees. We therefore overrule Bar Counsel\u2019s exception as to the monies Respondent received from Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Petitioner also took exception to Judge Hughes\u2019 conclusion that Respondent did not violate MRPC 8.4(b) because while \u201cthe Respondent did violate the Business Article, ... that is not a criminal statute, and therefore a violation is not necessarily a criminal act.\u201d Petitioner argues that Respondent was found to violate Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article and that pursuant to Section 10-606(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>of that Article,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the willful violation of Section 10-306 is a misdemeanor subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000.00 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both. Respondent does not directly address Section 10-606(b) but rather argues that the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action did not specify the criminal act that would cause him to be found in violation of 8.4(b), a fact of which the hearing court took note. Respondent also stresses that the hearing court found that the misuse of trust money in this case did not constitute theft or embezzlement. Furthermore, Respondent argues that his replenishment of the clients\u2019 funds removes his activities from the realm of criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Petitioner correctly asserts that a willful violation of Section 10-306 is a misdemeanor under Section 10-606(b), which describes the penalties for willful violations of Subtitle 3, Part I of Title 10 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Braskey, </em>378 Md. 425, 452-53, 836 A.2d 605, 621-22 (2003). In <em>Braskey, </em>Judge Raker, writing for this Court, iterated that \u201c[i]n order for a violation of \u00a7 10-3-06 ... to constitute criminal conduct, the conduct must have been \u2018willful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 836 A.2d at 622. Not every violation of Section 10-306 is necessarily willful; willfulness must be found before the misuse of trust money can constitute a criminal act under 8.4(b). <em>Id.; Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher </em>371 Md. 673, 711-12, 810 A.2d 996, 1018-19 (2002). In the present case, the hearing judge never specifically found that Respondent\u2019s violations of Section 10-306 were willful. In concluding that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c), however, the hearing court did find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent \u201cengaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>dishonesty and deceit/misrepresentation by implicitly or explicitly misrepresenting to his clients that their escrow funds would be safeguarded, and that escrow funds disbursed were those being held by the Respondent on their behalf, when in fact they were not.\u201d Judge Hughes then listed a number of transactions which he found violated MRPC 8.4(c), identical to the list of instances which the hearing court found violated Section 10-306. The question before us, then, is whether a finding of \u201cdishonesty and deceit/misrepresentation\u201d is equivalent to a finding of willfulness under Section 10-606(b) and MRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In <em>Deibler v. State, </em>365 Md. 185, 776 A.2d 657 (2001), Judge Wilner, writing for this Court, discussed the numerous meanings which various federal and state courts have attached to the term \u201cwillful.\u201d He noted that the definition accepted in the majority of applications was that the \u201c \u2018act be committed voluntarily and intentionally as opposed to one that is committed through inadvertence, accident, or ordinary negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 776 A.2d at 661, quoting S. Brogan, <em>An Analysis of the Term \u201cWillful\u201d in Federal Criminal Statutes, </em>51 Notre Dame Lawyer 786 (1976). In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tayback, </em>378 Md. 578, 837 A.2d 158 (2003), we reviewed the meaning of \u201cwillful\u201d more specifically in the attorney grievance context, with regard to the willful failure to file tax returns, a criminal act under Maryland and federal law, which formed the basis for the hearing court\u2019s finding that the respondent in that case violated MRPC 8.4(b). In <em>Tayback, </em>Judge Cathell, writing for this Court, after reviewing Judge Wilner\u2019s discussion of \u201cwillful\u201d in <em>Deibler, </em>iterated that \u201c[i]n attorney grievance matters based on the willful failure to file tax returns, this Court has consistently defined willfulness as the \u2018 \u201cvoluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty not requiring a deceitful or fraudulent motive.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 837 A.2d at 165, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 514 n. 6, 830 A.2d 474, 482 n. 6 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>333 Md. 298, 309, 635 A.2d 382, 387 (1994); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Walman, </em>280 Md. 453, 460, 374 A.2d 354, 359 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cdeceit\u201d as \u201c1. The act of intentionally giving a false impression.... 2. A false statement of fact made by a person knowingly or recklessly ... with the intent that someone else will act upon it.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>435 (8th ed.2004). Similarly, the Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction Civil 11:1 (2007), Fraud or Deceit, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">To recover damages for deceit, it must be shown that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">(1) the defendant made a <em>false representation </em>of a material fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">(2) the defendant <em>knew of its falsity </em>or made it with such reckless indifference to the truth that it would be reasonable to charge the defendant with knowledge of its falsity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">(3) the defendant <em>intended </em>that the plaintiff would act in reliance on such statements....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">(emphasis added). <em>See also Martens Chevrolet, Inc. v. Seney, </em>292 Md. 328, 333, 439 A.2d 534, 537 (1982) (elements of deceit include purposeful making of a false statement and knowledge of falsity or misrepresentation made \u201cwith such a reckless indifference to truth as to be equivalent to actual knowledge\u201d). We have also held that \u201c[i]n Maryland, a finding of deceit and misrepresentation in a disciplinary action must be found to be intentional.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 78, 753 A.2d 17, 29 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 298, 572 A.2d 174, 179 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">As a result, in finding that many of Respondent\u2019s escrow transactions violated MRPC 8.4(c), the hearing judge thereby determined that these movements of client funds were intentional. In the facts specific to this case, the hearing judge found \u201cdeceit/misrepresentation\u201d with reference to Respondent\u2019s misrepresentation to his clients that their escrow funds would be safeguarded and disbursed only on their behalf, when they were not, and listed as violating 8.4(c) the same transactions that he found in violation of Section 10-306. We therefore find that Judge Hughes\u2019 finding of \u201cdeceit/misrepresentation\u201d is equivalent to a finding of willfulness to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>violation of Section 10-606(b) and thereby a violation of MRPC 8.4(b), and we, therefore, sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">B. <em>Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The hearing judge determined that Respondent acted in violation of MRPC 1.15(a), Maryland Rule 16-609, and Section 10-806 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code when he commingled personal and clients funds and improperly withdrew client funds from his escrow account for his own personal use, for the use of another client, or for the use of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">MRPC 1.15(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Maryland Rule 16-609 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">An attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by these Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account, obtain any remuneration from the financial institution for depositing any funds in the account, or use any funds for any unauthorized purpose. An instrument drawn on an attorney trust account may not be drawn payable to cash or to bearer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Section 10-306 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">A lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">The hearing court determined that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a), Maryland Rule 16-609, and Section 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>306 in thirty-one transactions beginning on November 13, 2003, and continuing through November 15, 2005. The hearing judge abbreviated these movements of funds as Cantor I, II and III; Mount Oak I and II; Brien; Riggleman; Jenkins; Tidewater I, II and III; May, 2004; McKenna; August-October 2005; Excell; Black Hawk; Percival II; Eastport II; Liberty I and II; Olmo; Brown I, II and III; Epstein; Hayden; Precision; Ault I, II and III; and Mid Atlantic. Through these transactions, Respondent wrote checks from his escrow account and deposited the funds into his operating account in order to cover personal expenses. When it came time for Respondent to disburse funds from the escrow account to proper payees, he would \u201cborrow\u201d funds from other clients, from personal loans improperly deposited into the escrow account, or from rents received for office space in the building housing his law office.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Such activities clearly constitute improper commingling of personal funds and client funds in violation of MRPC 1.15(a). <em>See Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. at 700, 919 A.2d at 675; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 260-61, 793 A.2d 515, 525-526 (2002). Respondent\u2019s intentional misuse of trust money for purposes other than those for which it was entrusted to him also violate Rule 16-609 and Section 10-306. <em>See Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. at 700, 919 A.2d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The hearing judge also concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(b) and Maryland Rule 16-607 by depositing personal loans and rents into his escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Rule 1.15(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">(b) A lawyer may deposit the lawyer\u2019s own funds in a client trust account for the sole purpose of paying bank service charges on that account, but only in an amount necessary for the purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Maryland Rule 16-607 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">(a) General prohibition. An attorney or law firm may deposit in an attorney trust account only those funds required to be deposited in that account by Rule 16-604 or permitted to be so deposited by section b. of this Rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>(b) Exceptions. 1. An attorney or law firm shall either (A) deposit into an attorney trust account funds to pay any fees, service charges, or minimum balance required by the financial institution to open or maintain the account, including those fees that cannot be charged against interest due to the Maryland Legal Services Corporation Fund pursuant to Rule 16-610 b 1(D), or (B) enter into an agreement with the financial institution to have any fees or charges deducted from an operating account maintained by the attorney or law firm. The attorney or law firm may deposit into an attorney trust account any funds expected to be advanced on behalf of a client and expected to be reimbursed to the attorney by the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In his Stipulation, Respondent characterized the $80,000.00 provided by Allan Percival and deposited into Respondent\u2019s escrow account on July 6, 2004, and the July 7, 2004 deposit of $25,000.00 from Eastport Analytics, as client deposits. Respondent, however, later testified that these were actually personal loans from Percival and the owner of Eastport Analytics. There is no finding and nothing in the record that reflects that Respondent\u2019s depositing of these personal loans or the rents obtained from the tenants of his office building, also deposited into the escrow account, was done solely for the purpose of paying bank service charges on the client trust account within the meaning of MRPC 1.15(b). Accordingly, the transactions which the hearing court abbreviated as Percival I and Eastport I, as well as the client rent transactions, violated MRPC 1.15(b). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Obi, </em>393 Md. 643, 656 n. 8, 904 A.2d 422, 430 n. 8 (2006). Likewise, as these personal loans and rents were not required to be deposited into Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account under Rule 16-604,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> nor were they deposited to cover bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>fees as is allowable under Rule 16-607(b), these transactions clearly violated Rule 16-607. <em>See Snyder, </em>368 Md. at 260-61, 793 A.2d at 525-26 (violation of Rule BU7, the precursor to Rule 16-607).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The hearing court also found that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(a) by submitting altered ledgers to Assistant Bar Counsel which purported to have been made contemporaneously with the transactions in the escrow account but which were actually made after the fact and did not accurately reflect Respondent\u2019s handling of client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">MRPC 8.1(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not: (a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Respondent\u2019s knowing misrepresentation of the legitimacy of his ledger entries to Bar Counsel certainly violated MRPC 8.1(a) as the timing of the entries was a fact material to Counsel\u2019s investigation of Respondent\u2019s misconduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In the present case, we agre\u00e9 with the hearing judge that Respondent\u2019s conduct was dishonest and deceitful in violation of Rule 8.4(c) in that he misappropriated client funds and misrepresented to clients that the funds were properly safeguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">This Court has also found misappropriation of client funds to be \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of MRPC 8.4(d). <em>See Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. at 159, 879 A.2d at 80; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The hearing judge found that MRPC 8.4(d) was violated by Respondent\u2019s misuse of client funds in the twenty-nine transactions which it abbreviated as Cantor I, II and III; Mount Oak I and II; Brien; Riggleman; Jenkins; Tidewater I and II; August-October 2005; Excell; Black Hawk; Percival II; Eastport II; Liberty I and II; Tidewater III; Olmo; Brown I, II and III; Epstein; Hayden; Precision; Ault I, II and III; and Mid Atlantic. Respondent\u2019s misconduct was harmful to the legal profession because it undermined the public\u2019s confidence that attorneys will properly maintain entrusted funds as expected and required under the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. at 160, 879 A.2d at 80.

We have repeatedly stated that the misappropriation of entrusted funds \u201cis an act infected with deceit and dishonesty, and, in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>CherryMahoi, </em>388 Md. at 161, 879 A.2d at 81. <em>Accord Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The hearing court found that Calhoun had commingled trust funds and personal funds by failing to deposit two $5,000.00 payments for fees and an $8,000.00 settlement check into a properly designated attorney trust account. The hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>judge found that Calhoun had misled her client concerning legal fees and costs owed by failing to keep him informed of the accrual of those fees and costs in a timely fashion, as was required by her representation agreement. Specifically, the court found that she \u201cmislead by silence and lack of communication,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 548, 894 A.2d at 527, and that she violated 8.4(c) by her \u201cfailure to communicate properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 894 A.2d at 530. In determining Calhoun\u2019s sanction, this Court noted that \u201cwhile the hearing judge did find that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c), he did not find specifically that respondent engaged in dishonest or fraudulent conduct,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 894 A.2d at 541, and focused on the respondent\u2019s treatment of the $8,000.00 in settlement funds. We noted that the hearing court did not find that Calhoun had intentionally misappropriated the settlement funds, but rather that the facts indicated that she may have believed, albeit erroneously, that the settlement funds were owed to her to cover fees and costs associated with representation. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 894 A.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The facts of the present case are different from those of <em>Calhoun </em>in two very important respects. First, in the present case the hearing court found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent \u201cengaged in dishonesty and deceit/misrepresentation.\u201d Second, there are no factual findings in the present case to support the premise that client funds were unintentionally or accidentally misappropriated. In <em>Calhoun, </em>the attorney had properly incurred fees and costs associated with the representation of her client; her violation of MRPC 8.4(c) was a result of her lack of diligence in communicating these expenses to her client and following appropriate procedures in obtaining payment. The violations in the present case do not result from the Respondent improperly utilizing client funds which he believed he had earned for services rendered; rather, he <em>knowingly </em>and <em>intentionally </em>misused client funds over a period of two years in order to cover personal expenses unrelated to his representation of those clients.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>It should also be noted that we have declined to order disbarment in cases where the misappropriation of funds was due to negligence, rather than intentional misconduct. <em>See Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 379, 872 A.2d at 716; <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 36, 741 A.2d at 1162; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In such circumstances, we have concluded that indefinite suspension was the appropriate sanction. For example, in <em>Zuckerman, </em>we imposed an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after ninety days because the misappropriation of client funds was the result of ineffectual accounting procedures and theft by the attorney\u2019s employee, rather than the intentional actions of Zuckerman himself. 386 Md. at 379, 872 A.2d at 716. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, indefinite suspension is not the appropriate sanction as Respondent\u2019s actions were intentional, not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Given the Respondent\u2019s willful and intentional misappropriation of client funds over a period of two years, we are persuaded that the public only would be protected by the imposition of a sanction of disbarment.
