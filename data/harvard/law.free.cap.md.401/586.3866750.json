In his petition for certiorari and in his brief he presented a single issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-14\">\u201cWhether a neighboring property owner has a due process right to actual notice of the issuance of a building permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Thomas Burruss, et al.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> respondents, filed no cross-petition. We shall resolve only the question raised in the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On February 20, 2004, petitioner received a building permit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from Montgomery County to erect four amateur radio (ham radio) towers, each 190 feet in height, on his property in Poolesville, Maryland. On June 23, 2004, he received a revised building permit. Approximately five weeks later, on August 5, 2004, construction commenced. Upon seeing construction trucks (cement trucks pouring concrete), work being done, and holes being drilled on petitioner\u2019s property, respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>dents, the abutting property owners, checked with the county authorities and then became aware, for the first time, of the permits that had been issued for the construction of the towers. On August 13, 2004, respondents requested the Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services (DPS) to issue a stop work order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DPS refused respondents\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On August 30, 2004, respondents noted two appeals to the Board of Appeals of Montgomery County in respect to the issuance of the building permits (and sediment control permit issued),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming that they had been unlawfully issued. Petitioner and Montgomery County (which intervened in the cases before the Board of Appeals), moved to dismiss the appeals. The motions were granted by the Board. It based one dismissal on untimeliness, and the other because there was no basis to appeal the issuance of a sediment control permit, and because it (the Board) had no authority to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Respondents then filed a petition for judicial review with the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Again, the petitioner and Montgomery County moved to dismiss the petition for judicial review. The Circuit Court upheld the Board\u2019s finding that the appeal of the original issuance of the building permit was untimely, but found that the subsequent issuance of the sediment control permit had the effect of renewing the building permit, making the appeal timely. On that basis, the Circuit Court remanded the case to the Board for it to entertain the appeal of the building permit. At that point, petitioner filed a notice of appeal of the Circuit Court judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. That Court, in an unreported opinion, issued October 14, 2006, reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>findings of the Circuit Court that the issuance of the sediment control permit had renewed the issuance of the building permit and that the appeal of the building permit, therefore, had been timely. In other words, the Court reinstated the Board\u2019s decision that the appeal of the building permit had been untimely. The Court of Special Appeals, however, remanded the case to the Board of Appeals for it to determine whether respondents had a general<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> due process right to actual personal notice of the issuance of the building permit and/or a property right that was adversely affected by the issuance of the permit. We granted certiorari. <em>Evans v. Burruss, </em>398 Md. 313, 920 A.2d 1058 (2007).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Our review of the agency\u2019s decision entails only an appraisal and evaluation of the agency\u2019s fact-finding and not an independent decision on the evidence. <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v.

We have stated that, \u201c \u2018[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bucktail, LLC v.

We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>noted that our review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision differs markedly from our review of the decision of a trial court in other types of civil cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cIn the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court.

Are Property Interests Generally Created by Zoning Ordinances?</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The Supreme Court of the United States, when discussing the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property, has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">\u201cCertain attributes of \u2018property\u2019 interests protected by procedural due process emerge from these decisions. To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than an unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\"><em>\u201cProperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution.

The statute plainly supports the conclusion, reached by both lower courts, that respondents possessed property rights in continued employment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.) (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538-39, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1491, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Unlike the Ohio statute referred to by the <em>Loudermill </em>Court, there is no ordinance or other statute that has been brought to our attention, or that we have found, that \u201cplainly\u201d creates any right for the respondents to participate in the purely \u201cministerial\u201d process leading to the issuance of a building permit where the application and the permit are in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Montgomery County Code (\u201cMCC\u201d) (2003),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u00a7 8-25, provides that where the application complies with all the requirements of the building and zoning provisions, the Director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>\u201cmust \u201d </em>issue a permit as soon as practicable.

Referring to <em>Feldman, </em>this Court in <em>Clarke v.

[N]either Art. 66B nor the subdivision regulations require that a public hearing be conducted by the commission before acting on subdivision plans. <em>Nor does this argument rise to a constitutional </em>level----(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">270 Md. 343, 350, 311 A.2d 417, 421 (1973). Neither <em>Feldman </em>nor <em>Clarke </em>has been overruled and they remain the law in this State. Indeed, this point of law in <em>Feldman </em>has been recognized as the \u201ccontrary view\u201d to that of another jurisdiction. In <em>Horn v. County of Ventura, </em>the California Court opined on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the position then extant in that State in respect to notices and hearings of applications for subdivisions of land:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c[The] party urges that plaintiff [adjacent property owner] suffered no significant deprivation of property which would invoke constitutional rights to notice and hearing. However ... land use decisions which \u2018substantially affect\u2019 the property rights of owners of adjacent parcels may constitute \u2018deprivations\u2019 of property within the context of procedural due process---- (For a contrary view, <em>see Feldman v.

The issue involved whether non-abutting, but nearby, property owners<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> were entitled to be heard at the hearings in respect to applications for subdivision approval. The Court identified the issue as: \u201c[Wjhether nonabutters have a right to be heard at a hearing before the Concord Planning Board concerning an application for subdivision under RSA [Revised Statutes Annotated] 36:23. <em>Hancock v.

The New Hampshire Court went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">\u201cWe do not agree that failure to allow plaintiffs an opportunity to speak at a hearing pursuant to RSA 36:23 amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of their property rights under the due process clause.

In a case involving the Public Service Commission, where there was a statutory provision requiring advertisement of a public hearing, but no other notice requirement, neighboring property owners asserted that they were entitled to actual personal notice of the hearing. The question posed, as relevant to the instant case, in <em>Sprenger v. Public Service Commission of Maryland, </em>400 Md. 1, 5, 926 A.2d 238, 240 (2007),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was: \u201cIs an interested person ... entitled to bring an action for declaratory relief if the Public Service Commission fails to provide [actual personal] notice [to the \u2018interested person\u2019] and the time to file an appeal ... has expired?\u201d After noting that the only express requirement for a general notice of the hearing through newspaper publication had been met, we addressed the contention that Sprenger was entitled to actual personal notice of the hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cThere is no requirement in [the statutes] that personal service of notice be given to interested persons. Those sections only require that notice be given to interested persons. If we were to agree with petitioners that these sections required personal service of notice, we would be, at best, forcing an interpretation that limits the manner in which notice may be given....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201c[U]nder petitioner\u2019s theory, all interested persons should receive personal service of notice. Petitioners, without substantive explanation, define interested persons as those owning property contiguous to the Facility and those within half a mile of the project---- [H]ow then would the Commission determine who are interested persons? In the circumstances of this case should individuals whose sight lines are affected by the towers be included? They could be five miles or more away located in the mountainous terrain where the Facility is sited---- And what about those thousands who might claim to be, or to pass, within earshot of the spinning blades? Would all of such persons or groups, and many others, be entitled to \u2018personal\u2019 individualized service of notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201cThe extent of the pool of interested persons could never be determined---- The agency could never be sure it had served notice, by certified mail or otherwise, on all interested parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\"><em>Sprenger, </em>400 Md. at 30-32, 926 A.2d at 255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">This case also involves high towers, albeit less than half as tall as the towers in <em>Sprenger. </em>We have found no evidence in the record we have reviewed that indicates that the fall pattern<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the towers was an issue. As far as can readily be discerned, the issue revolves around the towers being in the line of sight of respondents.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While the area from which the \u201cpool of interested persons\u201d might come may well be less in the present case than the potentially impacted area in <em>Sprenger, </em>depending on demographics, the \u201cpool of interested persons\u201d might well be larger. If individualized personal notice were to be required, how could the agency ever verify that it had given such notice to all \u201cinterested persons?\u201d How could it do so in the over 10,000 instances of ministerial building permit issuances each year in that county and the numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>other types of permits issued in Montgomery County?

Adjoining Owners\u2019 Property Rights in the Permitting Process</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We shall now examine what property rights, if any at all, an abutting or neighboring property owner (or owners) may have in respect to the uses of nearby property when such uses are permitted by zoning or other governmental regulation. In that examination we are especially cognizant of the police power aspect, i.e., its limitations, of the zoning laws. We have not been directed to any of our cases, nor have we discovered any, in which this Court has held that the issuance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>building permit for one property, creates or interferes with property rights of owners of adjoining properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Several of our cases, including <em>England v. Mayor and Council of Rockville, </em>230 Md. 43, 185 A.2d 378 (1962), which involved a zoning reclassification, indirectly indicate exactly the opposite. <em>England </em>briefly discussed, somewhat obliquely, neighboring property rights in the police power context. After the trial court had basically found that England, the property owner applying for a reclassification, was entitled to it, the lower court had, nonetheless, upheld the denial of the reclassification based upon neighboring owners\u2019 concerns. There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cWe think appellants proved their case. The Chancellor stated in his opinion that \u2018from a view of the property it is apparent that eventually all of the land in the vicinity, and including the subject property, should be zoned for industrial and/or commercial purposes.\u2019 ... He stated that the proposed change \u201cwould be of no benefit\u2019 to surrounding property owners. We think the chancellor misapplied the applicable principles of law to the facts of this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cThere was clear evidence of original mistake or change of condition____Under the circumstances, <em>benefit to the neighboring residents is not a proper test. </em>Restrictions imposed under the police power must be related to the general welfare and cannot be supported on the basis of benefit to surrounding property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\"><em>England, </em>230 Md. at 46, 185 A.2d at 380.

Maryland Jockey Club, supra, </em>involved Pimlico Race Track and a change to the original zoning for the particular area. Part of the race track property involved had been grand-fathered as a non-conforming use and had been used mainly for parking. Maryland Jockey Club applied for permits to construct stables on the site. Neighboring residential property owners sought and received an injunction restraining the Jockey Club from constructing the stables near their residential property. Thereafter, the zoning ordinance was amended so as to permit, as of right, the construction of the stables. The Jockey Club then petitioned the trial court to dissolve the injunction based upon the change in zoning classification. The injunction was dissolved and the neighboring residential property owners appealed. This Court, in deciding that the original enactment of the zoning ordinance had created no property rights in the abutting residential property owners, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201cIn order to impose restrictions some valid exercise of the police power must be proven. But such power is invoked for the protection of the property restricted and <em>not to give protection to surrounding property. </em>It is basic to the law of property that a man shall be allowed the widest use of his property consonant with the protection of his neighbors. In order to justify therefore the restriction of that use, it must be shown that such restriction is in some manner related to the police power of the sovereign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cThe imposition of that restriction, however, creates no vested [property] right [in neighboring property owners] in the continuance of that [previous zoning] condition [on the properties of the applicant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cSince, therefore, appellants [neighboring property owners] acquired no vested [property] right under the original Zoning Ordinance, it follows that the amending ordinance placing neighboring properties in a lower classification, and to that extent freeing such properties from the burdens of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the original ordinance, deprives appellants [neighboring property owners] of no legal rights inasmuch as it takes nothing from them that they have a right to insist upon.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><em>Chayt v. Maryland Jockey Club, </em>179 Md. at 395, 18 A.2d at 858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The issue has been indirectly addressed in at least one other state. The issue was presented in <em>Weaver v. Bishop, </em>174 Okla. 492, 52 P.2d 853 (1935), like <em>Chayt, </em>a case for injunctive relief by adjoining property owners, in respect to the uses being made of property for which a building permit had been used. As in the instant case, the matter of the absence of notice of the issuance of the permit also was presented in that the time for appeal had expired before the adjoining property owners discovered the use. There the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cThe plaintiffs further allege that if it be construed that the defendant has a good and valid permit to construct said filling station, and that plaintiffs are barred from appealing the action of the said building inspector ... that plaintiffs will be deprived of their property without due process of law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201c[Defendants allege that said zoning ordinance was duly passed and approved in the manner required by law, after due notice to property owners, and that the plaintiffs had the right at all times to make application to the legislative body ... to amend the said ordinance, and could ... have submitted ... all the questions and objections now sought to be presented ... that plaintiffs under said ordinance have no right to an appeal to the action of the building inspector in granting the permit herein, and that if the plaintiffs had any such right to appeal, that such right was lost in that the appeal was not taken within the time prescribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 response is in substance that the building permit issued to the defendant ... was void for want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>notice to the plaintiffs____ \u201cThe evidence is that no notice ... was given either of the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of same until after the expiration of more than ten days [the appeal period]. The zoning ordinance ... does not provide for such notice....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201cThe record does not disclose that under the ordinance of Tulsa that notice to other parties is required generally in obtaining municipal permits, and the rule is that, where no notice is required, failure to give notice does not affect the validity of the permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201cThe function of municipal building permits is to evidence compliance with the applicable ordinances and regulations and that the proposed construction meets building requirements. \u2018Where the prerequisite conditions have been complied with on the part of the applicant, the Board or official may have no discretion to refuse the permit for some reason other than a noncompliance with the conditions precedent; and such an applicant may invoke the aid of the court to prevent the unreasonable refusal and to compel the granting of the permit.\u2019 <em>The issuance of such a permit is not ordinarily an adjudication of the property rights of third </em>persons.\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\"><em>Weaver v. Bishop, </em>52 P.2d at 856-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">If any such property rights exist when a permitting ordinance does not require notice, they must be discovered in background principles of property law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Actual physical invasions of one\u2019s property may be addressed by suits in eject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ment, perhaps trespass, in respect to title-actions to quiet title and the like. None of these situations appear to exist in the present case. Some actions that might exist relating to uses of adjacent property include, and primarily are related to, actions to abate private nuisances. In <em>Prah v. Maretti, </em>108 Wis.2d 228, 232, 321 N.W.2d 182, 187 (1982), that Court restated the concept that applies in Maryland as well: \u201cThe private nuisance doctrine has traditionally been employed ... to balance the conflicting rights of landowners....\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Private nuisances, moreover, are not a normal element of rights arising out of the issuance of building permits even when notice requirements exist, and private nuisances, if they exist, normally do so independently of the issuance of any public permits. Generally, they cannot be litigated in a petition for judicial review of administrative agency actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The cases before this Court, giving rise to the single question properly before us, are both administrative petitions for review. Neither of them is a request for abatement of nuisances.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">We hold that where, such as in this case, the relevant statute applicable to the issuance of permits as a ministerial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>act does not require the service of actual, personal notice to adjacent or neighboring property owners, the failure to do that which is not required to be done is not a denial of due process. We hold further that, generally, the issuance of building permits and similar permits are ministerial acts. Finally, we hold, as a matter of law, that the issuance of building permits to the owner of one property for construction on that property, creates no additional property rights in adjoining or neighboring property owners. Accordingly, we reverse that part of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment that remanded the case to the Board of Appeals to receive evidence in respect to whether the issuance of the building permit infringed upon the respondents\u2019 \u201cproperty rights.\u201d The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals as to the non-renewal (via the sediment control permit) of the building permit and the timeliness or lack thereof is otherwise affirmed. The result of our holding is that the decision of the Board of Appeals of Montgomery County is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE BOARD OF APPEALS OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\">.

Respondents, although having filed no petition of their own, in their brief advance two additional issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\"1.

Whether the thirty day 'time for appeal\u2019 requirement is applicable to the facts of this case.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">In a footnote in respondents' brief, Burruss acknowledges that his second issue was not addressed in petitioner\u2019s brief, but asserts that it was discussed in the petition for certiorari. In the petition, its mention was conditioned <em>on a </em>finding adverse to petitioner on the question directly presented in the petition. In light of our decision, the thirty-day issue will not be addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">We decline to separately address respondents\u2019 first question above. As indicated, respondents did not file a cross-petition. The issues before this Court, generally, are limited to the questions presented in petitions, not other, or additional, questions that later appear in briefs. Accordingly, except to the extent that respondents' first question might be indirectly discussed in our treatment of the question in the petition, it too will not be addressed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b615-13\">. That general building permit, like most such permits for projects that meet general zoning and building code requirements, is not required to be subject to a public hearing process, although the file and all matters relating to it are public records and available to members of the public, including these respondents, for examination.

General, as used here, means as opposed to a specific provision in the Montgomery County statutes requiring actual personal notice to neighbors of the issuance of building permits for specific properties.

The present case, as it appears before us, does not involve planning and zoning. It is a building permit case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b623-11\">.

There was an issue, before the Board, as to whether the towers complied with the zoning code at the time of original issuance. On judicial review, the trial court agreed that it did. The Court of Special Appeals did not reverse that finding. As we have indicated, respondents filed no cross-petition and petitioner did not raise that issue in his petition. Accordingly the correctness of that ruling is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The issue of whether the project was controlled by the amendment ultimately made to the zoning code resulting from respondents\u2019 complaints to county officials, or by the Code as it existed at the time of the issuance of the building permits, was litigated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">While the issue of \"vested rights\u201d is not properly before us, and accordingly, we do not resolve that issue, we do note, as we indicated above, that the construction of the towers commenced on August 5, 2004. That construction was observed and then verified by respondents no later than August 13, 2004. The amendment to the ordinance, which respondents argued below should have been binding on petitioner, was not enacted until December 26, 2005, over 15 months after the construction had begun and respondents were aware of it. The date on which \u201cvesting\u201d (construction should be so advanced that the nature of the construction could be observed by persons passing by) under Maryland jurisprudence, would be determined, would be the date when the amendment was enacted, in this case December 26, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Judge Moylan, for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Town of Sykesville v.
