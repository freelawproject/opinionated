The Clerks denied those applications pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Article, \u00a7 2-201 (hereinafter \u201cFamily Law \u00a7 2-201\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, where the aggrieved applicants filed suit against the Clerks, granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs-Appellees, declaring that the statute discriminates facially on the basis of sex, in violation of Article 46 of the Declaration of Rights of Maryland, otherwise known as the Equal Rights Amendment (\u201cERA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Circuit Court, in its memorandum opinion, expressly declined to address Appellees\u2019 equal protection and substantive due process arguments that were based on the \u201cLaw of the Land\u201d provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants-Appellants noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari to the intermediate appellate court before it could decide the appeal. 393 Md. 477, 903 A.2d 416 (2006). For the reasons stated here, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The factual background, much like challenges to similar state marriage statutes in other jurisdictions, is undisputed. Maryland law provides that no individuals may marry \u201cin this State without a license issued by the clerk for the county in which the marriage is performed.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Article, \u00a7 2-401(a). In order to apply for such a license, at least one of the parties to the marriage must appear before the clerk of the circuit court for that county and, under oath, provide the following information: (1) the full name of each party; (2) the residence of each party; (3) each party\u2019s age; (4) the degree of consanguinity, if any, between the parties; (5) the marital status of each of the parties; and (6) the social security number of each party. Md.Code (1957, 2006 RepLVoL), Family Law Article, \u00a7 2-402(b). If, while questioning an applicant, \u201cthe clerk finds that there is a legal reason why the applicants should not be married, the clerk shall withhold the license unless ordered by the court to issue the license.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2006 Repl. Vol.), Family Law Article, \u00a7 2-405(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Eighteen of the Appellees here are nine same-sex couples who, at various times in June and July 2004, sought marriage licenses in Baltimore City and several counties in Maryland. The nineteenth Respondent is a homosexual male who expressed a wish to apply in the future for a marriage license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Frank Conaway, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and the other circuit court clerks denied<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> these applications pursuant to Family Law \u00a7 2-201, which provides that \u201c[o]nly a marriage between a man and a woman is valid in this State,\u201d thereby depriving Appellees of the various benefits and privileges that accompany the institution of marriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>undisputed that Appellees were denied marriage licenses by the Clerks solely because they are same-sex couples. Appellees are otherwise qualified to marry: each partner is unrelated by blood or by marriage,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> each partner is over the age of 17,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> each partner is unmarried,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> each of the relationships are consensual, and each of the applicants possess the capacity to marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Appellees filed on 7 July 2004 a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, naming as defendants Frank Conaway; Rosalyn Pugh, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County; Evelyn Arnold, Clerk of the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County; Dennis Weaver, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Washington County; and Michael Baker, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Dorchester County.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The four count complaint alleges that Family Law \u00a7 2\u2014201:(1) unconstitutionally discriminates based on sex, in violation of Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights; (2) unjustifiably discriminates based on sexual orientation, in violation of the equal protection provisions of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights; (3) disparately inhibits, in violation of the equal protection provisions of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the same-sex couples\u2019 fundamental rights to marry, privacy, autonomy, and intimate association, because the statute allows similarly-situated opposite-sex couples to exercise those rights; and (4) unjustifiably burdens the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>same-sex couples\u2019 fundamental rights to marry, privacy, autonomy, and intimate association, in violation of the due process provisions of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Three motions to intervene were filed subsequent to the filing of Appellees\u2019 complaint. Robert P. Duckworth, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, was the first to file a motion to intervene as a defendant. Mr. Duckworth contended that, as a county circuit court clerk, a decision in favor of the Plaintiffs-Appellees would create uncertainty with regard to the discharge of his job duties, and would subject him to potential civil and criminal litigation in the future discharge of those duties. <em>Duckworth v. Deane, </em>393 Md. 524, 530-31, 903 A.2d 883, 887 (2006) (describing the procedural history of the litigation to that point in time). Eight members of the Maryland General Assembly likewise attempted to intervene as defendants, claiming that, as members of the Legislature, their legislative authority included the power to regulate marriage in the State of the Maryland. <em>Duckworth, </em>393 Md. at 532, 903 A.2d at 887. A judicial decision invalidating the marriage statute, according to the legislators, would be a \u201cjudicial encroachment\u201d upon their legislative authority in violation of the separation of powers principles in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Duckworth, </em>393 Md. at 532, 903 A.2d at 887-88. The third motion to intervene was filed in proper person by Toni Marie Davis, a resident of Baltimore City. Ms. Davis asserted that because \u201cthe homosexual lifestyle [was] against [her] religion,\u201d allowing same-sex marriage would, in essence, burden unconstitutionally her First Amendment right to practice her religion. <em>Duckworth, </em>393 Md. at 532-33, 903 A.2d at 888. The motions were denied by the Circuit Court and the interveners each noted appeals to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued, on our initiative, a writ of certiorari on 17 December 2005 before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal. <em>Duckworth v. Deane, </em>384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004). For reasons not pertinent to the merits before us now, this Court, after briefing and oral argument, affirmed on 28 July 2006 the Circuit Court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>sion to deny the requested interventions. <em>Duckworth, </em>393 Md. at 545, 903 A.2d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">After the motions to intervene were denied, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-501. The Appellees supported their motion with a series of exhibits and declarations by the various plaintiffs and others.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial judge held a motions hearing on 30 August 2005 and, on 20 January 2006, issued a memorandum opinion in which she held that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage constitutes a sex-based classification, lacking a constitutionally sufficient justification in violation of Article 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">She granted, therefore, Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, denied Appellants\u2019 cross-motion, and entered summary judgment in favor of the same-sex couples. The Circuit Court, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-632, stayed enforcement of its ruling pending the resolution of the expected appeal and because of the potential consequences of the ruling on circuit court clerks\u2019 offices throughout the State.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We issued a writ of certiorari upon the Clerks\u2019 timely petition. 393 Md. 477, 903 A.2d 416 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Any party to an action may file a motion for summary judgment, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-501(a), if it is claimed that there exists no genuine dispute as to any material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Maryland Rule 2-501(a). The questions for the trial court to determine from the pleadings and papers properly before it on a motion for summary judgment, therefore, are whether there exists a genuine dispute of material fact and, if no such dispute is revealed, whether the movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law on those undisputed facts. <em>See, e.g., Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 441, 298 A.2d 156, 159 (1972). Whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law and is reviewed <em>de novo </em>by the appellate courts. <em>Livesay v. Baltimore, </em>384 Md. 1, 9, 862 A.2d 33, 38 (2004). In such review, an appellate court resolves in favor of the non-moving party all reasonable inferences that may be adduced from the underlying facts as revealed by the pleadings, admissions, and affidavits. <em>Miller v. Bay City Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>393 Md. 620, 631, 903 A.2d 938, 944-45 (2006) (quoting <em>King v. Bankerd, 303 </em>Md. 98, 110-11, 492 A.2d 608, 614 (1985) (citing in turn <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Prod., Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 7-8, 327 A.2d 502, 509 (1974))); <em>Merchants Mtg. Co. v. Lubow, </em>275 Md. 208, 339 A.2d 664 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201c \u2018Maryland appellate courts, as a general rule, will consider only the [legal] grounds upon which the [trial] court relied in granting summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>387 Md. 649, 667, 876 A.2d 692, 702 (2005) (quoting <em>Eid v. Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 10, 816 A.2d 844, 849 (2003)); <em>Miller, </em>393 Md. at 632, 903 A.2d at 945 (\u201c \u2018An appellate court ... examines the same information from the record and determines the same issues of law as the trial court.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>PaineWebber, Inc. v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 413, 768 A.2d 1029, 1032 (2001))); <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726, 729 (2001) (quoting <em>PaineWebber, </em>363 Md. at 422, 768 A.2d at 1036). This premise is only valid, however, when \u201cthere are two or more separate and distinct grounds for the grant of summary judgment, and the trial court relies on one, but not another, in granting summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 667, 876 A.2d at 702-03. Thus, if two or more similar and \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d grounds for summary judgment exist, this Court may consider alternatively any related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ground, if raised properly by the litigant in his, her, or its motion for summary judgment, if we find fault with the ground relied upon facially by the trial court. <em>Id.; see also Eid, </em>373 Md. at 10-11, 816 A.2d at 849 (holding that the issues of ERISA preemption and the existence of a patient-physician relationship giving rise to a state law medical malpractice cause of action are so \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d that both grounds may be considered in the review of a grant of summary judgment, even though the trial court relied solely upon the ERISA preemption issue in granting summary judgment); <em>cf. Geisz v. Greater Balt. Med. Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 314 n. 5, 545 A.2d 658, 664 n. 5 (1988) (\u201cOn appeal from the grant of summary judgment which is reversible because of error in the ground relied upon by the trial court[,] the appellate court will not ordinarily sustain the judgment by ruling on another ground, not ruled upon [by] the trial court, <em>if the alternative ground is one </em>as <em>to which the trial court had ... discretion to deny summary judgment\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Whether Family Law \u00a7 2-201 is violative of Articles 24 or 46 are issues purely of law and are so inextricably intertwined with one another that we shall consider the Article 24 claim, even though we find error in the Circuit Court\u2019s singular reliance on Article 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">I. Claim of Sex-based Discrimination Under Article 46 of the Declaration of Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Appellees assert that, because Family Law \u00a7 2-201 excludes same-sex couples from marriage, the statute draws an impermissible classification on the basis of sex, in violation of Article 46 of the ERA. Specifically, Appellees reason that \u201c[a] man who seeks to marry a woman can marry, but a woman who seeks to marry a woman cannot. Similarly, a woman who seeks to marry a man can many, but a man who seeks to marry a man cannot.\u201d Thus, because Family Law \u00a7 2-201 allows opposite-sex couples to marry but, at the same time, necessarily prohibits same-sex couples from doing so, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>statute \u201cmakes sex a factor in the enjoyment and the determination of one\u2019s right to marry,\u201d and is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Appellees\u2019 argument, at first glance, is beguiling. They point to several Maryland precedents that, if viewed literally, appear to support the proposition that a statute receives strict scrutiny analysis under Article 46 if sex is <em>at all </em>a factor in determining whether certain individuals are entitled to the benefits provided by the particular legislative enactment under review. <em>See Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. 133, 148, 716 A.2d 1029, 1037 (1998) (\u201c[S]ex is not, and can not be, a factor in the enjoyment or the determination of legal rights.\u201d) (citing <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 513, 374 A.2d 900, 902-03 (1977) and Barbara A. Brown et al., <em>The Equal Rights Amendment: A Constitutional Basis for Equal Rights for Women, </em>80 Yale L.J. 871 (1971)); <em>Burning Tree Club, Inc. v. Bainum, </em>305 Md. 53, 63-64, 501 A.2d 817, 822 (1985) <em>(Burning Tree I) </em>(\u201c[S]ex is not a permissible factor in determining the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>rights of women, or men ... [such that] the treatment of any person by the law may not be based upon the circumstance that such person is of one sex or the other.\u201d); <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 274-75, 462 A.2d 506, 522 (1983) (holding that, after \u201clegislative passage and approval by the people of Article 46 of the Declaration of Rights, any ancient deprivation of rights based upon sex would contravene the basic law of this State\u201d). When considering those cases in context,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> however, and because we believe that Article 46 was not intended by the General Assembly and the Maryland voters who enacted and ratified, respectively, the Maryland ERA in 1972 to reach classifications based on <em>sexual orientation, </em>we conclude that Family Law \u00a7 2-201 does not draw an impermissible sex-based distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>A. The Legislative History of the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment indicates that the ERA was intended to combat discrimination between men and women as classes.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The Maryland General Assembly, in 1972, ratified overwhelmingly a proposed Federal Equal Rights Amendment,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and passed during that same legislative session Chapter 366, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1972.

Resources useful in determining the purpose of pre-1975 legislative action are therefore limited to selected committee bill files (which do not exist for the ERA), the Legislative Council Reports to the General Assembly for 1941-1976 (which do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>contain reference to the ERA), task force reports, and archival newspaper accounts published during the period.

We were able to locate, however, extrinsic sources created at or about the time of the pendency of the proposed amendment and its promulgation that suggest that the intended scope of Article 46 was to prevent discrimination between men and women as classes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>In the time surrounding the promulgation of Article 46, for example, Governor Marvin Mandel created a commission designed to study the amendment\u2019s post-implementation affects. One of the Commission\u2019s stated purposes was to examine Maryland laws that, while not facially discriminatory, drew classifications that discriminated in their application on the basis of sex:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">Laws While Not Facially Sexually Discriminatory are Sexually Discriminatory in their Application or Effect: The Commission had as a precedent the considerable body of federal and state law which has declared that laws which are unoffensive facially are nevertheless racially discriminatory in their application. An example is the Supreme Court decision which outlaws literacy tests because they disproportionately exclude racial minorities. <em>The Commission, therefore sought to identify laws, practices and procedures which in application has a disproportionately adverse affect on the sex [ (women) ] which has traditionally been victim of discrimination.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Governor\u2019s Comm\u2019n to Study Implementation of the Equal Rights Amendment, Final Report to the Governor 11 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In addition to documents originating from executive agencies created to study the effects of the newly passed equal rights amendment, various newspaper accounts from the period of time surrounding the 1972 electoral vote on Article 46 shed light on the intended scope of the proposed amendment. On Monday, 23 October 1972, the <em>Washington Post </em>published a staff-written compendium entitled <em>Maryland Voters to Decide on Constitutional Changes, </em>which described the various proposed amendments to the Maryland Constitution. According to the article, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">amendment, sponsored by a majority of the legislators, would be effective immediately with referendum approval and would, at the least, place the state Constitution in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>agreement with the U.S. Constitution in assuring equal rights <em>for men and women.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">This amendment is often referred to as a <em>\u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d </em>measure, but it also would assure men that they could not be discriminated against because of their sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">This amendment and the pending amendment to the U.S. Constitution are likely eventually to have a far-reaching impact on court decisions in the areas of family and domestic relations laws dealing with such matters as child custody, alimony and paternity cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Douglas Watson, <em>Maryland Voters to Decide on Constitutional Changes, </em>Wash.

While these are but a few examples of the newspaper accounts originating around the time the ERA was ratified by the Maryland voters, they represent accurately the bulk of the articles of the time on that subject, and reinforce that the primary purpose of the ERA was to eliminate discrimination as between men and women as a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Because the 1972 General Assembly considered in tandem the proposed federal and Maryland amendments, we find instructive also the objectives revealed by the legislative history of the federal initiative. Introduced originally in 1923 by the National Women\u2019s Party, the proposed federal amendment was introduced at every legislative session during the mid-20th century. Renee Feinberg, the Equal Rights Amendment 16 (1986). It was not until 1972 that the proposed federal amendment, introduced to the 92nd Congress as House Joint Resolution (HJR) No. 208 by Representative Martha W. Griffiths (Michigan) and propelled significantly by the women\u2019s rights movement occurring during that time, passed Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>by an overwhelming majority.

Women &amp; L. 113, 116 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In the House of Representatives, for example, there was much discussion of the intended scope of the proposed federal amendment. During a hearing before the House Committee on Rules, in requesting that HJR 208 be considered by The Committee of the Whole of the House on the State of the Union, Representative Thomas Phillip \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill, Jr. (Dem., Massachusetts), then a member of the Committee on Rules, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">As a group, women have been victims of wide discrimination. In many States they are denied educational opportunities equal to those for men. In some States they are not allowed to manage their own property and a wife has fewer property rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">Our legal system currently contains the vestiges of a variety of ancient common law principles which discriminate unfairly against women. This legislation would clarify the intent of the Congress that all irrational discrimination on the basis of sex be eliminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">117 Congr. Rec. 35289 (daily ed. 6 October 1971) (statement of Rep. O\u2019Neill). During that same hearing, Representative John B. Anderson (Rep., Illinois) commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">Indeed, we are being called upon today to do the chivalrous thing\u2014to redress a wrong out of fairness and respect for women.

Rec. 35290 (daily ed. 6 October 1971) (statement of Rep. Anderson).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">During the floor debate in the House, in opposing the addition of the Wiggins Amendment<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to the proposed ERA, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>was stated by Representative Herman Badillo (Dem., New York):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">It is clear that there is flagrant discrimination against women in this country\u2014in employment opportunities, in the ownership of private property, in education, in a variety of Federal benefits such as social security and retirement and in numerous other areas of American society. This discrimination exists at all levels\u2014Federal, State, and local and in both the public and private sector.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Although some advances have been made in the past, there is still much to be done and meaningful and effective steps must be taken to insure that women enjoy the same rights and privileges which are now generally available to men. Existing constitutional provisions and various court decisions have failed to provide equal rights for women and we cannot depend on piecemeal legislative measures to achieve this goal. In order to avoid any undue delays or possible erroneous interpretations, a comprehensive effort is required and I believe a constitutional amendment is the most appropriate and effective device for securing equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">117 Congr. Rec. 3580 (daily ed. 12 October 1971) (statement of Rep. Badillo). Many comments of similar substance appear throughout the discussion in the House, regardless of whether a particular Representative was speaking in favor of or in opposition to the Wiggins Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The Senate debate concerning the proposed equal rights amendment contains sentiments consistent with that of the House. When discussing the issue on 22 March 1972, for example, Senator Charles H. Percy (Rep., Illinois) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">Even among the [proposed amendment\u2019s] opponents, there seems to be little question but that tradition and law have worked together to relegate women to an inferior status in our society. In many cases this has been inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>tional, based on an archaic precept that women, for physiological or functional reasons, are inferior. This concept has lead to the implementation of laws that prohibit [among other things] women from engaging in certain businesses, managing their own properties and finances, entering into legal contracts, holding jobs which they are deemed incapable of performing, actively competing in public and private educational institutions for a quality education, and serving on a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">118 Congr. Rec. 9595 (daily ed. 22 March 1972) (statements of Sen. Percy). Senator Percy concluded his statements by quoting Susan B. Anthony and articulating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">[n]either does the equal rights amendment lessen or demean the importance of women as wives, mothers, and mainstays of the home. Equality does not imply sameness. While the family structure is at the heart of our society and this legislation does nothing to disrupt that notion, we must recognize that women of today are different, they are aware of and willing to accept their responsibilities as citizens in a modern society and ought to be free to accept those responsibilities much as they are free to remain in the home if that is their choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Today we will truly acknowledge that equality can no longer be legally conditioned upon sex, that women, as they assume new roles in our society, deserve as a matter of law equal treatment under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 9596.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Speaking directly on the point of the proposed amendment and its effects on marriage between members of the same sex, it was contended by Senator Birch Evans Bayh II (Dem., Indiana) during the Senate debate that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">[t]he equal rights amendment would not prohibit a State from saying that the institution of marriage would be prohibited to men partners. It would not prohibit a State from saying the institution of marriage would be prohibited to women partners. All it says is that if a State legislature makes a judgment that it is wrong for a man to marry a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>man, then it must say it is wrong for a woman to marry a woman-or if a State says it is wrong for a woman to marry a woman, then it must say that it is wrong for a man to marry a man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">118 Congr. Ree. 9881 (daily ed. 21 March 1972) (statements of Sen. Bayh).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>B. Maryland precedent interpreting generally Article 46 indicates that the ERA was intended to combat discrimination between men and women as classes.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">This Court has had the opportunity on several occasions to examine the historical underpinnings of the ERA. Since the passage, ratification, and promulgation of Article 46 in 1972, our applications of the ERA indicate that its primary purpose was to remedy the long history of subordination of women in this country, and to place men and women on equal ground as pertains to the enjoyment of basic legal rights under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In virtually every case where this Court had the occasion to consider Article 46, the challenged classification drew clear lines between men and women as classes. In <em>Burning Tree I, </em>for example, the primary question before the Court was whether deferred State real property tax assessments given to a private country club that, according to the club\u2019s bylaws, expressly prohibited women from membership was violative of Article 46. 305 Md. at 58-59, 501 A.2d at 819-20.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In route to concluding that such favorable treatment violated the Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>land Declaration of Rights, we discussed briefly the history and purpose of the ERA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">[t]hat equal rights amendments to state constitutions were prompted by a long history of denial of equal rights for women is well recognized. As the commentators have indicated, the subordinate status of women in our society has for all too many years been firmly entrenched in our legal system, with women being excluded by law from various rights, obligations or responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 63-64, 501 A.2d at 822 (citing Barbara A. Brown et al., <em>The Equal Rights Amendment: Constitutional Basis for Equal Rights for Women, </em>80 Yale L.J. 871 (1971)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We concluded that \u201cthe [ERA] flatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>prohibits gender-based classifications, either under legislative enactments, governmental policies, or by application of common law rules, in the allocation of benefits, burdens, rights and responsibilities <em>as between men and women.\u201d Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 64, 501 A.2d at 823 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Consistent with this underlying purpose of the ERA, we held in <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 515-16, 374 A.2d 900, 905 (1977), that the \u201c \u2018broad, sweeping, mandatory language\u2019 of the [ERA] is cogent evidence that the people of Maryland are fully committed to equal rights for men and women. The adoption of the [ERA] in this state was intended to, and did, drastically alter traditional views of the validity of sex-based classification.\u201d (quoting <em>Darrin v. Gould, 85 </em>Wash.2d 859, 540 P.2d 882, 889 (1975)); <em>see also Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. 133, 151, 716 A.2d 1029, 1038 (1998). In <em>Rand, </em>we considered the validity of a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals allocating child support obligations based, for the most part, on the sex of the parents. Despite the common law rule at the time that a father primarily was responsible for support of children born during the marriage, <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 510-11, 374 A.2d at 902 (internal citations omitted), we concluded that, in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>of Article 46, sex was not a permissible factor in the determination of child support obligations <em>as between the mother and father:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">The common law rule is a vestige of the past; it cannot be reconciled with out commitment to equality of the sexes. Sex of the parent in matters of child support cannot be a factor in allocating this responsibility. Child support awards must be made on a sexless basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"><em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 516, 374 A.2d at 905; <em>cf. Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 245, 273, 462 A.2d 506, 507, 521 (1983) (abrogating the common law doctrine of inter-spousal immunity<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as a \u201cvestige of the past\u201d in \u201cderogation of married women\u201d). We thus determined that, after the promulgation of Article 46, as between men and women, men no longer as a class were the primary source of child support. Rather, both the mother and father fundamentally were responsible equally for the monetary support of their children born during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Appellees turn to <em>Giffin </em>for the proposition that \u201csex is not, and cannot be, a factor in the enjoyment or the determination of legal rights.\u201d 351 Md. at 148, 716 A.2d at 1036. As with the other cases relied on by Appellees, we conclude, upon reflection, that <em>Giffin </em>does not support their argument as mounted. In <em>Giffin, </em>the primary issue was whether the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of Special Appeals was correct in concluding that the sex of each parent, relative to the sex of their children born during the marriage, was a permissible factor to be considered in the grant of child custody at the dissolution of the marriage. In that case, James M. Giffin and Donna L. Crane entered, upon their divorce, an agreement whereby Mr. Giffin was awarded physical custody of the couple\u2019s two daughters. <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 135-36, 716 A.2d at 1030-31. The agreement provided for annual reviews by a disinterested mental health professional, at the request of the non-custodial parent, of the residential status of the children. <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 137, 716 A.2d at 1031. Ms. Crane requested in 1995 an annual review of the residential status of the children and, following an unfavorable recommendation by the health professional, filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a petition for modification of custody. <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 138, 716 A.2d at 1032. The trial court granted the petition, holding that, even though both parents were otherwise qualified to care for the children, the daughters\u2019 particular need for a female influence was a \u201cnecessary factor\u201d in the court\u2019s determination that the mother should be granted custody. <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 13-141, 716 A.2d at 1032-33. In other words, the determination of custody was based entirely on sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Viewing the reasoning of <em>Giffin </em>in its context, it is clear that the Court\u2019s statement that \u201csex is not, and cannot be, a factor\u201d related- to distinctions drawn between men and women as <em>classes. See Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 149, 716 A.2d at 1037 (\u201c[T]he equality <em>between sexes </em>demanded by the Maryland [ERA] focuses on \u2018rights\u2019 of individuals \u2018under the law,\u2019 which encompass all forms of privileges, immunities, benefits and responsibilities of citizens.\u201d) (citing <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 70, 501 A.2d at 825) (emphasis added). In other words, the grant of child custody no longer could be based on pre-conceived notions, based solely on the parents\u2019 sex, concerning the care a certain parent was capable of providing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Virtually every Maryland case applying Article 46 has dealt with situations where the distinction drawn by a particular governmental enaction or action singled-out for disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>treatment men and women as discrete classes. <em>See, e.g., Turner v. State, </em>299 Md. 565, 474 A.2d 1297 (1984) (invalidating a law that made it unlawful for any tavern, concert hall, or other place of variety entertainment to employ female sitters,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but which made no mention of males hired for the same purpose); <em>Condore v.

App. 240, 437 A.2d 247 (1981) (rejecting an ex-husband\u2019s argument that the award of alimony payments to his ex-wife violated Article 46 on the basis that, unlike the payment of necessaries, the statute governing the award of alimony is sex-neutral such that either party to a marriage is entitled to an award of alimony if appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Based on our precedents interpreting Article 46, we conclude that the Legislature\u2019s and electorate\u2019s ultimate goal in putting in place the Maryland ERA was to put men and women on equal ground, and to subject to closer scrutiny any governmental action which singled out for disparate treatment men or women as discrete classes. As we stated in <em>Burning Tree I,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">[t]he cases construing equal rights amendments share a common thread; they generally invalidate governmental action which imposes a burden on one sex but not the other, or grants a benefit to one but not the other....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 70, 501 A.2d at 825; <em>see also Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 65-66, 501 A.2d at 823-24 (\u201cThat the [ERA] is essentially limited in its scope to unequal treatment imposed by the law as between the sexes is clear from our cases.\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Unless the statute under scrutiny grants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>either on its face or in application,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> rights to men or women as a class, to the exclusion of an entire subsection of similarly situated members of the opposite sex, the provisions of the ERA are not implicated and the statutory classification under review is subjected to rational basis scrutiny, unless there exists some other reason to apply heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Turning to the language of Family Law \u00a7 2-201, it becomes clear that, in light of the aforementioned purpose of the ERA, the marriage statute does not discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Article 46. The limitations on marriage effected by Family Law \u00a7 2-201 do not separate men and women into discrete classes for the purpose of granting to one class of persons benefits at the expense of the other class. Nor does the statute, facially or in its application, place men and women on an uneven playing field. Rather, the statute prohibits equally both men and women from the same conduct. A legislative enactment \u201cshould be construed according to the ordinary and natural import of the language used without resorting to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of limiting or extending its operation.\u201d <em>Massage Parlors, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>284 Md. 490, 494, 398 A.2d 52, 55 (1979) (quoting <em>Burch v. State, </em>278 Md. 426, 429, 365 A.2d 577 (1976)). To accept Appellees\u2019 contention that Family Law \u00a7 2-201 discriminates on the basis of sex would be to extend the reach of the ERA beyond the scope intended by the Maryland General Assembly and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>State\u2019s voters who enacted and ratified, respectively, the amendment. In other words, it \u201cstretch[es] the concept of gender discrimination to assert that [the marriage statute] applies to treatment of same-sex couples differently from opposite-sex couples.\u201d <em>Dean v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>653 A.2d 307, 363 n. 2 (D.C.1995) (Steadman, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>C. Interpretations Given Equal Rights Amendments By Other Jurisdictions In Similar Situations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Perhaps most persuasive here is the growing body of case law from foreign jurisdictions flatly rejecting the argument that statutes that limit marriage to unions between a man and woman discriminate impermissibly on the basis of sex. <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 512, 374 A.2d at 903 (\u201cCases from other state jurisdictions interpreting the breadth and meaning of their equal rights amendments are instructive in ascertaining the reach of Maryland\u2019s [ERA].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The Court of Appeals of Washington, in <em>Singer v. Hara, </em>11 Wash.App. 247, 522 P.2d 1187 (1974), was one of the first appellate courts to weigh-in on same-sex marriage in light of the then-newly promulgated ERA. There, the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3A\">[p]rior to adoption of the ERA, the proposition that women were to be accorded a position in the law inferior to that of men had a long history. Thus, in that context, the purpose of the ERA is to provide the legal protection, as between men and women, that apparently is missing from the state and federal Bills of Rights, and it is in light of that purpose that the language of the ERA must be construed. To accept the [same-sex couples\u2019] contention that the ERA must be interpreted to prohibit statutes which refuse to permit same-sex marriages would be to subvert the purpose for which the ERA was enacted by expanding its scope beyond that which was undoubtedly intended by the majority of the citizens of this state who voted for the amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdP\"><em>Singer, </em>522 P.2d at 1194.

Because there is no \u201cdiscrete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>class subject to differential treatment,\u201d according to the court\u2019s analysis, the prohibition on same-sex marriage did not draw a sex-based classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\n<em>D.

Rather, because constitutional rights are individual rights, the same-sex couples posit that this Court should examine how the legislative enactment affects individually each person seeking to marry. Appellees rely principally in support of this argument on <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967), the landmark U.S. Supreme Court equal protection case in which the Court held unconstitutional a Virginia miscegenation statute despite the fact that the statute \u201cpunish[ed] equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial marriage.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 8, 11-12, 87 S.Ct. at 1822, 1823, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>18 L.Ed.2d 1010; <em>see also McLaughlin v.

In support of the statute, the State of Virginia argued that, even though reference was made to race in determining who was entitled to marry, it punished equally both participants in the interracial marriage. <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 8, 87 S.Ct. at 1821, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010. The Supreme Court was able to see beyond the superficial neutrality of the legislative enactment, however, and determined that \u201c[t]he fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.\u201d <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 11, 87 S.Ct. at 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010. Thus, the Court in <em>Loving </em>determined that, although the statute applied on its face equally to all races, the underlying purpose was to sustain White Supremacy and to subordinate African-Americans and other non-Caucasians as a class. The reasoning behind this conclusion was based, at least in part, on the fact that \u201c[w]hile Virginia prohibits whites from marrying any nonwhite ..., Negroes, Orientals, and any other racial class may intermarry without statutory interference.\u201d <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 11 n. 11, 87 S.Ct. at 1823 n. 11, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cThe test to evaluate whether a facially gender-neutral statute discriminates on the basis of sex is whether the law \u2018can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 880 n. 13 (quoting <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. v.

And while \u201c[t]he clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States,\u201d <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 11, 87 S.Ct. at 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010, the primary purpose behind Article 46 is to frustrate state action that separates men and women into discrete classes for disparate treatment as between the sexes. Absent some showing that Family Law \u00a7 2-201 was \u201cdesigned to subordinate either men to women or women to men as a class,\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d at 11 (\u201cThis is not the kind of sham equality that the Supreme Court confronted in <em>Loving; </em>the statute there ... was in substance anti-black legislation.\u201d), we find the analogy to <em>Loving </em>inapposite. <em>See also, e.g., Baker v.

Because there is no evidence in the record before us that the Legislature intended with Family Law \u00a7 2-201 to differentiate between men and women as classes on the basis of some misconception regarding gender roles in our society, we conclude that the ERA does not mandate that the State recognize same-sex marriage based on the analogy to <em>Loving.

Gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons likewise have been subject to unique disabilities not truly indicative of their abilities to contribute meaningfully to society. For a significant period of American history, homosexual persons generally were not the object of regulatory focus because sexual and gender orientations differing from \u201ctraditional\u201d sexual preferences were not well conceptualized by the public until after the Civil War.

Eskridge, Jr., Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet 1 (1999) (recounting in great detail the genesis of the treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons in American society); <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 568-69, 123 S.Ct. at 2478-79, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (describing succinctly the early history of laws directed at homosexual conduct, and explaining that the \u201cconcept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century\u201d) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>omitted). Before 1900, regulation of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons focused on the criminalization of \u201cgender inversion,\u201d which included, but was not limited to, cross-dressing, prostitution, obscenity, public lewdness, and indecent exposure. Eskridge, <em>supra, </em>at 13-14, 27-37.

Some states, namely New Jersey, Florida, California, and New York, prohibited establishments with state-issued liquor licenses from knowingly serving alcohol to homosexual persons. Eskridge, Jr., <em>supra, </em>at 78-80. In the wake of <em>Bowers v. Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986), and until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawrence v.

In their extreme form, these nega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tive attitudes lead to [anti-gay] violence. Averaged over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and lesbians had experienced verbal or physical harassment on the basis of their orientation, 45 percent had been threatened with violence, and 17 percent had experienced a physical attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., <em>The Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior </em>(9 July 2001) (letter from the Surgeon General), <em>at </em>http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/sexualhealth/call. html.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">It is clear that homosexual persons, at least in terms of contemporary history, have been a disfavored group in both public and private spheres of our society. The State, furthermore, has not provided evidence to the contrary in the present case, arguing instead that, because every other jurisdiction, both before and after <em>Lawrence, </em>rejected the notion that homosexuals are a suspect class, so should Maryland. While other jurisdictions\u2019 dispositions of equal protection claims similar to the one advanced in the present case are persuasive and reinforce our own analysis, we do not accept them simply as conclusive. This Court nevertheless finds that, in light of the other indicia used by this Court and the Supreme Court in addressing equal protection claims, a history of unequal treatment does not require that we deem suspect a classification based on sexual orientation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We instead view the circumstances as a whole in order to determine whether sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>orientation constitutes a protected classification meriting a more exacting level of constitutional review.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In spite of the unequal treatment suffered possibly by Appellees and certainly a substantial portion of other citizens similarly situated, we are not persuaded that gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons are so politically powerless that they are entitled to \u201cextraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d To the contrary, it appears that, at least in Maryland, advocacy to eliminate discrimination against gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons based on their sexual orientation has met with growing successes in the legislative and executive branches of government.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Maryland statutes protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation in several areas of the law, including public accommodation,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> employment,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> housing,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and education.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>In addition to the statutory framework in place, several state and local regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (2004), Health Occ. \u00a7 19-311(6) (prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination by social workers); Md.Code (2003), art. 29 \u00a7\u00a7 1-107, 3-102(h)(l) (prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination on the part of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, and prohibiting the use of discriminatory employment practices by any contractor engaged by the Commission); Md.

In terms of Supreme Court jurisprudence, one of the most important cases is <em>Romer v. Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). This case dealt with a Colorado voter-adopted amendment to the State\u2019s Constitution that \u201cpreclude[d] all legislative, executive, or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the status of persons based on their \u2018homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Romer, </em>517 U.S. at 620, 116 S.Ct. at 1621-22, 134 L.Ed.2d 855. In other words, the amendment sought to preclude the Colorado legislature from enacting any statute that provided for protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court struck down the statute as unconstitutional, under rational basis review, as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 565, 560, 123 S.Ct. at 2476, 2475, 156 L.Ed.2d 508, the Court overturned <em>Bowers v. Hardwick </em>and concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tution forbids the criminalization of sexual conduct by two persons of the same sex in the privacy of their own homes. In neither <em>Romer </em>nor <em>Lawrence, </em>however, did the Supreme Court state that homosexual persons constituted a suspect class. The Court instead applied rational basis review to both of the statutes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The body of Maryland appellate opinions addressed to the rights and interests of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons is substantial. <em>Boswell v.

This right to personal privacy was recognized formally by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Griswold </em>where it struck down, as an intrusion upon the constitutionally protected right to marital privacy, a ban on the use of contraceptives by married heterosexual couples. The Court reasoned that there are zones of privacy created by the guarantees of the Bill of Rights that serve \u201cas [a] protection against all government invasions \u2018of the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S. at 484, 85 S.Ct. at 1681, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (quoting <em>Boyd v.

Specifically, Appellees seek a dec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>laration that the right to marry encompasses the right to marry a person of one\u2019s choosing without interference from the government, even if the other person is of the same sex. They argue further that, \u201cin assessing history and tradition, the proper inquiry is <em>what </em>has historically been enjoyed (e.g., the right to marry), not <em>who </em>has historically enjoyed it (e.g., people in heterosexual relationships).\u201d A substantially similar argument has been made to our peers in other jurisdictions in the course of confronting same-sex marriage challenges. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Ake, </em>354 F.Supp.2d 1298, 1305 (M.D.Fla.2005) (\u201cPlaintiffs argue that their right to marry someone of the same sex is a fundamental right that is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d); <em>Standhardt v.

For the reasons stated here, we join those courts and hold that the issue is framed more properly in terms of whether the right to choose same-sex marriage is fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In support of their argument, Appellees rely principally on <em>Loving v. Virginia, 388 </em>U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed\u00fcd 1010 (1967) (holding that the fundamental right to marriage encompasses the right marry the person of one\u2019s choosing, even if that person is of a different race); <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 376, 91 S.Ct. 780, 785, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971); <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978); <em>Turner v.

Williamson, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541-42, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 1113-14, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). We find that, while these cases certainly establish generally the fundamental nature of the right to marry, they do not represent a compelling basis to extend the fundamental right to include same-sex marriage. All of the cases infer that the right to marry enjoys its fundamental status due to the male-female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>nature of the relationship and/or the attendant link to fostering procreation of our species. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Appellees rely on <em>Loving </em>for the proposition that, despite the long history of prohibition against interracial marriages, the Supreme Court declared in that case that the right to marry was constitutionally guaranteed to different-race couples just as it was available to single-race couples, <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 12, 87 S.Ct. at 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010, thereby declaring that the proper inquiry in the case was whether the right itself had been historically enjoyed rather than who had historically enjoyed it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The basis for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as to the interracial couples\u2019 due process challenge was that \u201c[mjarriage is one of the \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 <em>fundamental to our very existence and survival.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>Skinner, </em>316 U.S. at 541, 62 S.Ct. at 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655 <em>(\u201cMarriage and procreation </em>are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\u201d)) (emphasis added). As our peers on other courts have stated, \u201c[wjhether the Court [in <em>Skinner </em>] viewed marriage and procreation as a single indivisible right, the least that can be said is that it was obviously contemplating unions between men and women when it ruled that the right to marry was fundamental. This is hardly surprising inasmuch as none of the United States sanctioned any other marriage configuration at the time.\u201d <em>Baehr, </em>852 P.2d at 56; <em>Standhardt, </em>77 P.3d at 458 (stating that \u201c[ijmplicit in <em>Loving </em>and predecessor opinions is the notion that marriage, often linked to procreation, is a union forged between one man and one woman,\u201d and concluding that, \u201cwhile <em>Loving </em>expanded the traditional scope of the fundamental right to marry by granting interracial couples unrestricted access to the state-sanctioned marriage institution, that decision was anchored to the concept of marriage as a union involving persons of the opposite sex.\u201d); <em>Dean, </em>653 A.2d at 332-33 (holding that the right to marriage is deemed fundamental because of its link to procreation).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Language of similar import appears throughout the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence establishing as fundamental the right to marry.

In <em>Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 376, 381-82, 91 S.Ct. at 785, 788, 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>L.Ed.2d 113, the Supreme Court declared that \u201cmarriage involves interests of basic importance in our society.\u201d 401 U.S. at 376, 91 S.Ct. at 785, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (citing generally <em>Skinner, Loving, </em>and <em>Meyer). </em>In light of that fundamental nature of marriage, the Court invalidated a statute that authorized the State of Connecticut to deny access to the courts to indigent citizens seeking to obtain a divorce, solely because they were unable to pay the requisite court fees. <em>Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 381-82, 91 S.Ct. at 788, 28 L.Ed.2d 113. Thus, virtually every Supreme Court case recognizing as fundamental the right to marry indicates as the basis for the conclusion the institution\u2019s inextricable link to procreation, which necessarily and biologically involves participation (in ways either intimate or remote) by a man and a woman. <em>Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 978 (\u201cNearly all United States Supreme Court decisions declaring marriage to be a fundamental right expressly link marriage to fundamental rights of procreation, childbirth, abortion, and child-rearing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The one exception is <em>Turner v. Safley. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a Missouri Division of Corrections regulation that precluded an inmate from marrying unless he or she received permission from the superintendent, and only upon a finding that there was a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d for the marriage. <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 78, 107 S.Ct. at 2256-57, 96 L.Ed.2d 64. The term \u201ccompelling reason\u201d was not defined by the regulation, but prison officials testified at trial that the only reason deemed compelling was the pregnancy of the woman to be married or the birth of a child out of wedlock. <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 82, 107 S.Ct. at 2258, 96 L.Ed.2d 64. The Court concluded that the fundamental right to marriage recognized in <em>Zablocki </em>applied to prison inmates just as it applied to non-incarcerated individuals. <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 95, 107 S.Ct. at 2265, 96 L.Ed.2d 64. Among several reasons given for application of <em>Zablocki </em>to the issues at bar was that \u201cmost inmates eventually will be released by parole or commutation, and therefore most inmate marriages are formed in the expectation that they ultimately will be fully consummated.\u201d <em>Turner, 482 </em>U.S. at 96, 107 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>at 2265, 96 L.Ed.2d 64. The Court reasoned additionally that marriage often serves as a precondition to certain tangible and intangible benefits, including the legitimization of children born out of wedlock. <em>Id. </em>It is true that the reasons given in support of the fundamental right of inmates to marry were not linked in express terms to procreation and, indeed, some of the reasons given were wholly independent of procreation. Whatever the reasons given for granting to those couples the right to marry, however, it is clear that the Court was contemplating marriage between a man and woman when it declared unconstitutional the Missouri regulation. The case involved challenges by opposite sex couples, and a number, although not all, of the reasons given in support of the right to marry applied only to opposite sex couples, i.e., consummation of the marriage and legitimization of children born outside the marital relationship. <em>Turner </em>does not persuade us to frame the inquiry in the present case as Appellees wish. <em>See Andersen, 138 P.3d </em>at 979.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">It is beyond doubt that the right to marry, in the abstract, is a fundamental right recognized by both the Federal and this State\u2019s Constitutions.

In order for a marriage to be valid within the State, the parties to it must be mentally competent such that \u201cthere [is] an understanding and appreciation of what the ceremony was that was being gone through with, and what were the legal consequences naturally deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. U\u2019Nertle, </em>143 Md. 200, 207, 122 A. 357, 360 (1923); <em>Elfont v.

Bigamous relationships are likewise subject to regulation by the State, and any marriage stemming from such a relationship is considered void. <em>Roth v. Roth, </em>49 Md.App. 433, 436, 433 A.2d 1162, 1164 (1981) (voiding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>marriage when one of the parties has a still-living spouse from a previous marriage where no decree of divorce from the previous marriage has been issued); <em>Donnelly v.

We are not aware of any ease from Maryland, the U.S. Supreme Court, or elsewhere domestically in which the issue has been framed in terms of whether the fundamental right to marry encompasses, for example, \u201cthe fundamental right to marry a person of one\u2019s choosing without government interference, even if that other person is lineally and directly related to the citizen asserting their fundamental right to marry,\u201d such that strict scrutiny was deemed the appropriate standard of constitutional review to analyze the relevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The principle of defining precisely the asserted liberty interest is not limited to the analytical context of marriage. When the scope of an asserted liberty interest becomes relevant to determining the fundamental nature of that right, we have sought to define narrowly that right and identify precisely the group asserting the liberty interest. In <em>Suessmann v. Lamone, </em>383 Md. 697, 862 A.2d 1 (2004), for example, unaffiliated registered voters filed suit in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County \u201cseeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the allegedly unconstitutional exclusion of unaffiliated voters from the Democratic and Republican Parties\u2019 primary elections for circuit court judicial candidates.\u201d 383 Md. at 704, 862 A.2d at 5. Judges were chosen in a general election to which the judges gained access by securing placement on the ballot through victory in either of the primary elections held by the Democratic and Republican parties. <em>Suessmann, </em>383 Md. at 704-05, 862 A.2d at 5. The State argued in that case, and we agreed, that \u201cthe mere fact a law imposes a burden on the right to vote does not mean the law must be subjected to strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>Suessmann, </em>383 Md. at 729-30, 862 A.2d at 20. Rather than framing the constitutional issue in terms of the generally stated fundamental right to vote, we reviewed the election laws narrowly, and in terms of whether \u201cthe State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ha[d] deprived [the plaintiffs] of the right to vote <em>in the primary elections of a party to which they [did] not belong </em>.\u201d <em>Suessmann, </em>383 Md. at 731, 862 A.2d at 21.

In <em>Romer, </em>while the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for Colorado to amend its constitution to preclude state legislative enactments protecting from discrimination based on sexual orientation, the Court did so on the basis of equal protection. The Court determined, furthermore, that a \u201cdisadvantage imposed [that] is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected,\u201d thereby reflecting \u201ca bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>group[,] cannot constitute a <em>legitimate </em>governmental interest.\u201d <em>Romer, </em>517 U.S. at 634-35, 116 S.Ct. at 1629, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (citations omitted).

Beyond the principle that no state may pass laws or state constitutional amendments that prohibit any and all state or local government action designed to protect homosexual persons as a named class, <em>Romer, </em>517 U.S. at 624, 116 S.Ct. at 1623, 134 L.Ed.2d 855, nothing within the language of this landmark case establishes as deeply rooted the concept of same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Nor does <em>Lawrence </em>establish as deeply rooted the right to same-sex marriage. First, while the Court in that case overturned <em>Bowers </em>and declared unconstitutional the Texas statute on the basis that \u201c[the law and traditions in the past half century] show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex,\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 571-72, 123 S.Ct. at 2480, 156 L.Ed.2d 508, it did so on what appears to be rational basis review. 539 U.S. at 579, 123 S.Ct. at 2484, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (\u201cThe Texas statute furthers no <em>legitimate </em>state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\u201d) (emphasis added). Nor did the Court in that case state expressly that the right to sexual intercourse between two individuals of the same-sex was fundamental. <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 586, 123 S.Ct. at 2488, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThough there is discussion of \u2018fundamental proposition^],\u2019 ..., and \u2018fundamental decisions,\u2019 ..., nowhere does the Court\u2019s opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a \u2018fundamental right\u2019 under the Due Process Clause; nor does it subject the Texas law to the standard of review that would be appropriate (strict scrutiny) if homosexual sodomy <em>were </em>a \u2018fundamental right.\u2019 \u201d). If the Court in <em>Lawrence </em>was unwilling to declare that the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>two persons of the same sex to engage in sexual intimacy was deeply rooted in history and tradition, we are not disposed to accept that the <em>Lawrence </em>Court intended to confer such status on the public recognition of an implicitly similar relationship. <em>See Standhardt, </em>77 P.3d at 457 (\u201cIf the Court did not view such an intimate expression of the bond securing a homosexual relationship to be a fundamental right, we must reject any notion that the Court intended to confer such status on the right to secure state-sanctioned recognition of such a union.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Lawrence, </em>after declaring unconstitutional the Texas statute that forbade same-sex intimate conduct, held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">[t]he present case does not involve minors.

Several of the holdings by other courts that have addressed the issue are in accord. <em>See, e.g., Standhardt, </em>77 P.3d at 456-57 (determining that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lawrence </em>cannot be interpreted to provide for same-sex marriage); <em>Wilson, </em>354 F.Supp.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>1307 (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in <em>Lawrence </em>cannot be interpreted as creating a fundamental right to same-sex marriage.\u201d); <em>Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 979 (distinguishing <em>Lawrence </em>on similar grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We are unwilling to hold that a right to same-sex marriage has taken hold to the point that it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or deeply rooted in the history and tradition of Maryland. <em>Glucksberg, 521 </em>U.S. at 721, 117 S.Ct. at 2268, 138 L.Ed.2d 772. Even a quick glance at the laws of Maryland indicate that this State has long regarded marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The consanguinity statute, for example, addresses only those marriages with a certain degree of blood relation as between members of the opposite sex. Family Law \u00a7 2-202. The statutory scheme regulating dealings between spouses refers to the parties in terms of a \u201cmarried woman\u201d and \u201cher husband.\u201d Family Law \u00a7\u00a7 4-201 to 4-205. Family Law \u00a7 4-301, furthermore, involves liabilities for, and protection from, the obligations of a spouse. The statute addresses only those liabilities as between \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife.\u201d These are only a few of the examples of Maryland family law statutes that recognize sex-specific language when referring to the marital relationship. The point is that despite the long-established presence of Family Law \u00a7 2-201, the laws of our State historically, and continue to, employ sex-specific language that reflects Maryland\u2019s adherence to the traditional understanding of marriage as between a man and woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In spite of the changing attitudes about what constitutes a \u201cnuclear family,\u201d Congress, as well as nearly every state in the Nation, has taken legislative action or otherwise enacted constitutional amendments limiting explicitly the institution of marriage to those unions between a man and a woman.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>With the exception of Massachusetts, virtually every court to have considered the issue has held that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected as fundamental in either their state or the Nation as a whole. <em>Standhardt, </em>77 P.3d at 465 (\u201c[A]lthough many traditional views of homosexuality have been recast overtime in our state and Nation, the choice to marry a same-sex partner has not taken sufficient root to receive constitutional protection as a fundamental right.\u201d); <em>Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 211 (\u201cDespite the rich diversity of this State, the tolerance and goodness of its people, and the many recent advances made by gays and lesbians toward achieving social acceptance and equality under the law, we cannot find that a right to same-sex marriage is so deeply rooted in the traditions, history, and conscience of the people ... that it ranks as a fundamental right.\u201d); <em>Dean, </em>653 A.2d at 332-33 (declaring summarily that same-sex marriage is not deeply-rooted in history and tradition); <em>Baehr, </em>852 P.2d at 57 (concluding that there is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage); <em>Baker v.

While the opinions of other courts in the Nation are not conclusive with regard to the present case, even when they constitute an overwhelming majority, their reasoning and analysis are instructive as they provide a sampling of the current socio-political climate in which we make our determination whether the asserted right is fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We are not unmindful of the fact that the relationships gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons seek to enter involve intimate and private decisions that extend to the core of the right to personal autonomy.

That a liberty interest such as the argued-for right to marry a person of the sex of one\u2019s choosing, even if assumed to be important, does not render automatically fundamental that liberty interest. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 727-28, 117 S.Ct. at 2271, 138 L.Ed.2d 772; <em>Hornbeck, </em>295 Md. at 649, 458 A.2d at 786 (\u2018Whether a claimed right is fundamental does not turn alone on the relative desirability or importance of that right.\u201d).

With these principles in mind, and in light of Maryland\u2019s history of limiting marriage to those unions between members of the opposite sex, coupled with the policy choices of nearly every other state in the Nation, we do not find that same-sex marriage is so deeply rooted in this State or the country as a whole that it should be regarded at this time as a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Y.

As one of the fundamental rights recognized by the Supreme Court as a matter of personal autonomy, procreation is considered one of the most important of the fundamental rights. <em>Skinner, </em>316 U.S. at 541, 62 S.Ct. at 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655 <em>(\u201cMarriage and procreation </em>are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 386, 98 S.Ct. at 681, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (\u201cIt is not surprising that the decision to marry has been placed in the same level of importance as decisions relating to procreation, childbirth, child rearing, and family relationships.... [I]t would make little sense to recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation of family in our society.\u201d); <em>Meyer, </em>262 U.S. at 399, 43 S.Ct. at 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (recognizing that the right \u201cto marry, establish a home and bring up children\u201d is a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause). In light of the fundamental nature of procreation, and the importance placed on it by the Supreme Court, safeguarding an environment most conducive to the stable propagation and continuance of the human race is a legitimate government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The question remains whether there exists a sufficient link between an interest in fostering a stable environment for procreation and the means at hand used to further that goal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>i.e., an implicit restriction on those who wish to avail themselves of State-sanctioned marriage. We conclude that there does exist a sufficient link. As stated earlier in this opinion, marriage enjoys its fundamental status due, in large part, to its link to procreation. <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 12, 87 S.Ct. at 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (\u201cMarriage is one of the \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 <em>fundamental to our very existence and survival\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Skinner, </em>316 U.S. at 541, 62 S.Ct. at 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655 <em>(\u201cMarriage and procreation </em>are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\u201d); <em>Maynard, </em>125 U.S. at 211, 8 S.Ct. at 729, 31 L.Ed. 654 (\u201c[Marriage] is an institution, in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.\u201d). This \u201cinextricable link\u201d between marriage and procreation reasonably could support the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman only, because it is that relationship that is capable of producing biological offspring of both members (advances in reproductive technologies notwithstanding). Acceptance of this notion is found in the clear majority of opinions of the courts that have considered the issue. <em>See Standhardt, </em>77 P.3d at 458 (\u201cImplicit in <em>Loving </em>and predecessor opinions is the notion that marriage, often linked to procreation, is a union forged between one man and one woman.\u201d); <em>Dean, </em>653 A.2d at 332-33 (holding that the right to marriage is deemed fundamental because of its link to procreation); <em>Singer, </em>522 P.2d at 1197 (\u201c[M]arriage is so clearly related to the public interest in affording a favorable environment for the growth of children that we are unable to say that there is not a rational basis upon which the state may limit the protection of its marriage laws to the legal union of one man and one woman.\u201d); <em>Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 982-83 (\u201cBut as <em>Skinner, Loving, </em>and <em>Zablocki </em>indicate, marriage is traditionally linked to procreation and survival of the human race. Heterosexual couples are the only couples who can produce biological offspring of the couple.\u201d); <em>Baker v. Nelson, </em>191 N.W.2d at 186 (\u201cThe institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book of Genesis.\u201d) (citing <em>Skinner, </em>316 U.S. at 541, 62 S.Ct. at 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellees urge in response, quite convincingly, that Family Law \u00a7 2-201 is not related rationally to the governmental objective of fostering optimal relationships for procreation because it is at once over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Appellees argue that it is overinclusive because children may be born <em>into </em>same-sex relationships through alternative methods of conception, including surrogacy, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and adoption. The statute is also under-inclusive, according to Appellees, because not all opposite-sex couples choose to bear children, or are able to do so because of infertility or otherwise. Lastly, Appellees posit that the marriage statute is not linked sufficiently to the interests in procreation because allowing same-sex couples to marry will not impact interests in procreation in that \u201c[o]pposite-sex couples will continue to bring children into their families through \u2018traditional\u2019 procreation regardless of whether same-sex couples are permitted to marry.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>There is some merit to these arguments. There appears to be a trend towards the gradual erosion of the \u201ctraditional\u201d nuclear family in today\u2019s society to the extent that the classic family structure, consisting of a mother, father, and children born to them during the marriage, is less and less the norm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In 2000, of the 104.7 million households counted by the U.S. Census Bureau, only 55.3 million of them were composed of married couple households.

Casper, U.S. Census Bureau, <em>America\u2019s Families and Living Arrangements: March 2000, </em>Current Population Reports, P20537, at 1 (2001), <em>available at </em>http://www.census.gov/prod/2001 pubs/p20-537.pdf (hereinafter <em>\u201cAmerica\u2019s Families 2000\u201d). </em>Of those 104.7 million households, only 24.1 percent were represented by the nuclear family (married couples with their own children). <em>Id. </em>at 3. This number represented a drastic decline from 40 percent of all households in 1970. <em>Id </em>The percentage of married opposite-sex households without children, however, remained constant from 1970 to 2000 at approximately 29 percent of all households in the United States. <em>Id. </em>As of 2000, therefore, there were just as many married households in the United States without marital children as those households with marital children. The period of time from 1970 to 1990, furthermore, saw an increase in births among unmarried women, \u201craising the proportion of children living with a single parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 (quoting Amara Bachu, U.S. Census Bureau, <em>Trends in Premarital Childbearing: 1930-1991/., </em>Current Population Reports, P23-197 (1999)). In 2000, there were 10 million single-mother families in the United States (up from 3 million in 1970), and 2 million single-father families (up from 393,000 in 1970). <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The statistics are not limited to households in which children live with one or both biological/genetic parents. Indeed, reports from the U.S. Census Bureau show that of the 72.1 million children in the United States in 2000, only 68 percent live in a married couple family home. Terry Lugalia, Julia Overturf, U.S. Census Bureau, <em>Children and the Households They Live In: 2000, </em>CENSR-14, at 8 (2004), <em>available at </em>http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-14.pdf (hereinafter <em>\u201cChildren and the Households They Live In </em>\u201d). Four million, four hundred thousand children (6.1% of the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>children in the United States) lived with one or both grandparents, whereas 5.9 million children lived with someone other than a biological/genetic parent. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 3. <em>See also </em>Brent Bennett, et al., <em>To Grandmother\u2019s House We Go: Examining Troxel, Harrold, and the Future of Third-Party Visitation, </em>74 U. Cin. L.Rev. 1549, 1553 (2006). In 2000 and closer to home, according the Census Bureau, 67 percent of all children in Baltimore lived outside of a married couple household, while 25.7 percent of all children lived with someone other than a biological/genetic parent. The City ranked in the top five nationwide in both of these categories. <em>Children and the Households They Live In, supra, </em>at 18. Thus, reasonable doubt exists that the traditional model of what constitutes a family does not constitute the majority of households any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A legislative enactment reviewed under a rational basis standard of constitutional review need not be drawn with mathematical exactitude, and may contain imperfections that result in some degree of inequality. <em>Piscatelli v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>378 Md. 623, 644-45, 837 A.2d 931, 944 (2003) (\u201c[A] state does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>304 Md. at 352, 499 A.2d at 185 (\u201c[A] classification [subject to rational basis review] having some reasonable basis need not be made with mathematical nicety and may result in some inequality\u201d). Looking beyond the fact that any inquiry into the ability or willingness of a couple actually to bear a child during marriage would violate the fundamental right to marital privacy recognized in <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S. at 484-86, 493, 85 S.Ct. at 1681, 14 L.Ed.2d 510, the fundamental right to marriage and its ensuing benefits are conferred on opposite-sex couples not because of a distinction between whether various opposite-sex couples actually procreate, but rather because of the <em>possibility </em>of procreation. In such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>situation, so long as the Legislature has not acted wholly unreasonably in granting recognition to the only relationship capable of bearing children traditionally within the marital unit, we may not \u201csubstitute [our] social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies----\u201d <em>Md.

Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970)). In light of the deference owed to the General Assembly under rational basis review, we shall not declare Family Law \u00a7 2-201 unconstitutional, even though it may be under\u2014or over-inclusive, or otherwise create a distinction based on imperfectly drawn criteria.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Because Family Law \u00a7 2-201 does not abridge the fundamental right to marriage (as we understand that right), does not discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Article 46, and does not otherwise implicate a suspect or quasi-suspect class, the marriage statute is subject to rational review. As such, it carries a strong presumption of constitutionality. Under rational review, \u201c[w]here there are \u2018plausible reasons\u2019 for [the General Assembly\u2019s] action, \u2018our inquiry is at an end.\u2019 ... [Rationale basis review] is a paradigm of judicial restraint. \u2018The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that the judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.\u201d <em>F.C.C. v. Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 313-14, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2101, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993) (citations omitted). In declaring that the State\u2019s legitimate interests in fostering procreation and encouraging the traditional family structure in which children are born are related reasonably to the means employed by Family Law \u00a7 2-201, our opinion should by no means be read to imply that the General Assembly may not grant and recognize for homosexual persons civil unions or the right to marry a person of the same sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; STAY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO DECLARE CONSTITUTIONAL THE STATUTE AT ISSUE AND TO DENY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO APPELLEES.

He wrote separately because, in his view, \"the lead opinion ha[d] not identified, and responded directly to, [the plaintiffs\u2019] argument that 'the primary purpose provision by its terms single[d] out for special exception from an otherwise uniformly applicable anti-discrimination measure private discrimination of a certain type-sex-and to a certain degree-total-which neither the State nor a private club receiving a tax exemption could otherwise practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 85, 501 A.2d at 833 (Rodowsky, J., concurring). In stating his view that the primary purpose provision would violate clearly on its face the ERA, Judge Rodowsky explained that, \"in application, the provision will always be applied to a particular sex, the one excluded by a given, participating club. In all of the cases previously decided by this Court in which a rule of common law or a statute was invalidated under the E.R.A. the rule or statute itself isolated one sex and specified either males or females for different burdens or benefits.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 87, 501 A.2d at 834 (Rodowsky, J., concurring). Thus, \"in the context of sex discrimination, only one sex will be the object of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In rejecting the \"separate but equal\u201d approach presented by the Chief Judge, Judge Rodowsky concluded that \"[i]t is not an answer ... to say that at the elevated level of the statewide open space program, the program ... is neutral with respect to sex, in the sense that an all female or an all male country club is eligible to participate. The ostensible prohibition against sex discrimination applies to each individual country club participating in the open space program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Rodowsky agreed that the primary purpose provision was not severable from the anti-discrimination provision. <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 88, 501 A.2d at 835 (Rodowsky, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"ApV\">Judge Eldridge, writing for himself and two other judges, disagreed completely with Chief Judge Murphy, opining that, \"[i]f the views set forth in [the \"majority\u2019s\u201d] opinion were in the future to be adopted by a majority of this Court, the effectiveness of the [E.R.A.] to the Maryland Constitution would be substantially impaired.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 89, 501 A.2d at 835 (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Judge Eldridge took issue specifically with what he deemed to be the majority\u2019s \"separate but equal\u201d approach that the \"primary purpose\u201d provision \" '[did] not apportion or distribute benefits or burdens unequally among the sexes\u2019 and ma[d]e[ ] the statutory 'benefit available to all single sex country clubs agreeing to participate in the State's open space program.' \u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 90-91, 501 A.2d at 836 (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Judge Eldridge criticized additionally Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s opinion that \"the express sanctioning of single sex clubs [did not] imposte] a burden upon the excluded sex, as long as the governmental action in theory equally sanctioned] discrimination by single sex facilities against persons of the other sex.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 95, 501 A.2d at 838 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Instead, Judge Eldridge opined that the ERA should be construed broadly \"in accordance with its language and purpose,\u201d cataloging several cases that, as we have stated in the majority opinion in the present case, dealt expressly with situations where the line was drawn clearly between men and women in terms of the burdens imposed and benefits conferred upon them. <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 89, 501 A.2d at 835 (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (discussing <em>Kuhn, Rand, Condore, Kline, </em>and cases from other jurisdictions of similar import). Judge Eldridge found fault further in Chief Judge Murphy's \u201cseparate but equal\u201d theory, based on the fact that, in his opinion, \"[wjhile it is true that many of our prior cases have involved government action directly imposing a burden or conferring a benefit entirely upon either males or females, we have never held that the [ERA] is narrowly limited to such situations.\u201d Judge Eldridge determined finally that the primary purpose provision was severable from the anti-discrimination provision, <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 102, 501 A.2d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"AQD\">The end result was a four member majority of concurring judges that the primary purpose provision constituted state action violative of the ERA. Because Chief Judge Murphy, joined by two other judges and Judge Rodowsky, were of the opinion that the primary purpose provision was not severable from the remainder of the anti-discrimination provision, the entire provision was invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">Despite the dissent\u2019s attempts here to turn Judge Eldridge's opinion into something it is not, the \u201cnarrow interpretation,\u201d to which Judge Eldridge referred, pertained to Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s proposed construction of the ERA requiring language of the challenged statute to single out, in express gender-specific terms, either \"males\u201d or \"females.\u201d Judge Eldridge's argument, in essence, was that, merely because the \"primary purpose\u201d provision did not refer either to \"males\u201d or \"females\u201d in gender-specific terms, that did not save the statute when it sanctioned total discrimination of one sex by members of the opposite sex. <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 98-99, 501 A.2d at 835 (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (\"The principal classification implicating the E.R.A. arises from the language authorizing clubs, totally segregated on the basis of sex, to maintain their discriminatory practices and, at the same time, to continue receiving significant state benefit. On the other hand, sexually integrated country clubs are generally precluded from discriminating on the basis of sex.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AfS\">In sum, the opinions of Judges Eldridge and Rodowsky, which ultimately represented a plurality opinion of this Court, that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d provision was violative of the ERA, <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 91 n. 5, 501 A.2d at 836 n. 5 (\"In effect, the Court\u2019s entire mandate in this case reflects the conclusions of only one member, Judge Rodowsky.\u201d) (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part), was based on the fact that the statute allowed a club, whether comprised of all males or all females, to exclude all members of the opposite sex while still enjoying deferred assessments for the purposes of real estate taxation.

LeVay, <em>supra, </em>at 1036 (\"The discovery that a nucleus differs in size between heterosexual and homosexual men illustrates that sexual orientation in humans is amenable to study at the biological level, and this discovery opens the door to studies of neurotransmitters or receptors that might be involved in regulating this aspect of personality. Further interpretation of the results of this study must be considered speculative. In particular, the results do not allow one to decide if the size of INAH 3 in an individual is the cause or the consequence of that individual\u2019s sexual orientation, or if the size of INAH 3 and sexual orientation co-vaiy under the influence of some third, unidentified variable.\u201d).

Judge Battaglia\u2019s dissent, in response to the State\u2019s assertion that it has an interest in marriage \u201cas an institution of transcendent importance to social welfare,\u201d posits that, \u201cuntil the recent advances in assisted reproductive technology, there was a close[,] albeit imperfect fit[,] between opposite-sex marriage and the inherent biological fact that reproduction of our species could result only from the sexual union of a man and a woman.... The correspondence between opposite-sex marriage and biological necessity has never been more tenuous than it is today.\u201d Judge Battaglia\u2019s Dissent, op. at 418, 932 A.2d at 691. In that vein, the dissent \u00e1rgues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">[t]he phenomena of assisted reproduction and same sex marriage are so new and radical that there exists no evidence thus far to support or refute the asserted link [between reproduction and the State\u2019s asserted interest in marriage as an \u201cinstitution of transcendent importance to social welfare\u201d] and its concomitant external effects. Thus far, courts that have weighed this argument favorably have done so under rational basis review. The State\u2019s contention that the same-sex marriage ban arises organically from the nature of marriage itself, and that the much later codification accomplished by [Family Law \u00a7 ] 2-201 merely clarifies society\u2019s compelling interest in \"the historic family unit as a mechanism for protecting the progeny of biological unions,\u201d actually asserts the State interest in promoting an orderly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>stable society.

As such, Judge Battaglia and Chief Judge Bell would remand, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-604(d) (\"If the Court concludes that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment, or that justice will be served by permitting further proceedings, the Court may remand the case to a lower court\u201d), in order to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding what it refers to as \"the State\u2019s unrebutted contention regarding the broad societal interest in retaining traditional marriage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"As3\">In ordering a remand for the purposes of additional evidentiary hearings, a Court exercising appellate jurisdiction must explain expressly its reasons for doing so. Md. Rule 8-604(d)(l). The problem with remanding in the present case lies in the fact that neither the record nor the briefs of the litigants reflect a dispute of material fact of the kind imagined by the dissent. Although Appellees argue generally that the distinction made by Family Law \u00a7 2-201 is over-inclusive and, at the same time, under-inclusive, they do not point to an evidentiary conflict necessitating remand for the purpose of an evidentiary hearing and resolution of a factual dispute. Appellees instead assert that they are entitled to summary judgment by virtue of what they deem to be a flaw fatal in the constitutionality of the marriage statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AvV\">If this Court were to accept the reasoning of Judge Battaglia\u2019s dissent and reverse the grant of summary judgment, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-501 (a), (f) (providing that a motion for summary judgment may be granted only when there exists on the record no genuine disputes of material facts and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law), we essentially would be recognizing in the record an illusory dispute of fact fatal to the grant of summary judgment when one does not exist.

Despite the absence of a fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, however, the dissent reasons additionally that Article 24\u2019s equal protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tion guarantee mandates that same-sex couples otherwise be afforded the various rights and benefits currently available under Maryland law only to opposite-sex couples. Dissent op. at 351-52, 932 A.2d at 651; <em>see also Lewis, </em>908 A.2d at 200. In that vein, the dissent concludes essentially that the General Assembly must either amend Family Law \u00a7 2-201 to allow same-sex couples to marry, or create a substitute scheme under which same-sex couples may enjoy the same rights and benefits, as well as bear the same obligations, as married opposite-sex couples.

Ordinarily in Maryland, a court, whether trial or appellate, does not fashion relief where the record reflects that the parties to be benefitted repudiated expressly the proposed relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AkGm\">Appellees, in this record, cited a number of \"intangible protections of marriage for themselves and especially for their children.\u201d One such benefit relates to the sense of dignity that would accompany recognition of same-sex marriage in Maryland. Appellees refer, not only to the dignity that may be felt by the same-sex couples themselves, but also to their children in that the children, if their same-sex parents were able to marry, would \"feel proud of who they are and where they come from.\u201d One Appellee stated, in support of Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that \"[t]he legal sanction of [their] relationship through the institution of civil marriage would greatly diminish the stigma that [their] daughters will otherwise bear, simply because their parents are a same-sex couple.\u201d Another Appellee noted that she \"suffer[s] dignitary harm on account of the fact that the law effectively requires [her] to choose between [her] life in Maryland and [her] relationship with [her partner], simply because [they] are not recognized as spouses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">Several Appellees iterated, in support of their motion for summary judgment, that the grant of benefits of marriage without actually recognizing same-sex marriage only would perpetuate the dignitary harm that they now claim to experience. Charles Blackburn wrote that \u201canything short of civil marriage for same-sex couples would perpetuate second-class citizenship for lesbian and gay families. While we respect the freedom of religious organizations to decline to perform religious wedding ceremonies for same-sex couples, we believe that such religious freedom cannot prevent our state from recognizing our relationship. We believe that, rather than undermining the institution of marriage, a commitment such as our[s] honors it. We believe that we, too, are entitled to the dignity and respect that marriage bestows.\u201d Steven Palmer wrote that he and his partner \"[s]till risk discrimination fostered by the stigmatizing message about the worth of [their] relationship that [their] government sends to [the] community by excluding [them] from marriage.\u201d Finally, Patrick Wojahn wrote that \"[m]ost of all, [he and his partner] wish for [their] relationship to enjoy that same social recognition as well as legal recognition as the relationships of [their] heterosexual peers.

Appellees seek the right to marry, understanding that a civil marriage license entitles married couples to a vast array of economic and social benefits and privileges\u2014the rights of marriage\u2014as well as other intangible benefits. Because in my view entitlement to the rights of marriage and the right to marry are distinct issues, I analyze them separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">I would adopt the same analysis that the Supreme Court of New Jersey embraced in <em>Lewis v. Harris, </em>188 N.J. 415, 908 A.2d 196 (2006), in which same-sex couples sued state officials, seeking both a declaration that New Jersey\u2019s laws banning same-sex marriage violated the equal protection guarantees of the New Jersey Constitution as well as injunctive relief compelling the State to grant them marriage licenses. The New Jersey Court noted that the legal battle in the case had been waged over one overarching issue\u2014the right to marry. The court rejected this \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach. <em>Id. </em>at 206. Instead, the court distinguished between the right to marry, on the one hand, and the <em>rights </em>of marriage on the other hand. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court considered appellees\u2019 equal protection claim to consist of two components: whether committed same-sex couples have a constitutional right to the benefits and privileges afforded to married heterosexual couples, and, if so, whether they have a constitutional right to have their relationship recognized by the name marriage. I view the instant case before this Court in the same way, <em>i.e., </em>the issue presented as having two components.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>denying rights and benefits to committed same-sex couples that are given to married heterosexual couples violates the equal protection guarantee of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As did the State of New Jersey, I would find that \u201cto comply with this constitutional mandate, the Legislature must either amend the marriage statutes to include same-sex couples or create a parallel statutory structure, which will provide for, on equal terms, the rights and benefits enjoyed and burdens and obligations borne by married couples.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>908 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The Vermont Supreme Court reached the same conclusion and adopted a similar approach. <em>Baker v. State, </em>170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864 (1999). Like the New Jersey plaintiffs, (and the Maryland plaintiffs), the Vermont plaintiffs \u201csought injunctive and declaratory relief designed to secure a marriage license, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>their claims and arguments here have focused primarily upon the consequences of official exclusion from the statutory benefits, protections, and security incident to marriage under Vermont law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 886. Although the Vermont decision is based upon the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, the court-ordered remedy for the deprivation of rights protected by the State Constitution makes eminent sense. The court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cWe hold that the State is constitutionally required to extend to same-sex couples the common benefits and protections that flow from marriage under Vermont law. Whether this ultimately takes the form of inclusion within the marriage laws themselves or a parallel \u2018domestic partnership\u2019 system or some equivalent statutory alternative, rests with the Legislature. Whatever system is chosen, however, must conform with the constitutional imperative to afford all Vermonters the common benefit, protection, and security of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 867.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Under Maryland\u2019s traditional equal protection jurisprudence, a legislative classification which does not discriminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>on the basis of sex, burden significantly a fundamental right, or otherwise draw a classification based on suspect or quasi-suspect criteria may be sustained if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>See, e.g., Broadwater v. State, </em>306 Md. 597, 603, 510 A.2d 583, 585-86 (1986) (quoting <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 3254 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985)); <em>Ehrlich v. Perez, </em>394 Md. 691, 716-17, 908 A.2d 1220, 1235 (2006). In consideration of the majority\u2019s analysis, I agree that rational basis is the proper standard for reviewing Family Law \u00a7 2-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">As the majority notes, a statute subject to rational basis review will be upheld generally unless the classification is \u201cwholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective.\u201d <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 707, 426 A.2d 929, 942 (1981) <em>(quoting McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1104, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961) and <em>McDonald v. Bd. of Election, </em>394 U.S. 802, 809, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 1408, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969)). Furthermore, a classification subject to rational basis review may result in some inequality so long as the state can produce any conceivable \u201cstate of facts\u201d to justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>distinction. <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v.

We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u2018We have not hesitated to carefully examine a statute and declare it invalid if we .cannot discern a rational basis for its enactment. \u2018The vitality of this State\u2019s equal protection doctrine is demonstrated by our decisions which, although applying the deferential standard embodied in the rational basis test, have nevertheless invalidated many legislative classifications which impinged on privileges cherished by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>our citizens.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 315, 761 A.2d at 333 (quoting <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 419, 635 A.2d 967, 971 (1994)). In practice, we have reviewed closely a legislative classification when important personal interests of distinct groups of Maryland residents are at stake or when legislation distributes benefits and burdens unequally between residents of the State.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With this equal protection jurisprudence in mind, I turn to whether appellees are entitled to the same benefits, rights and privileges afforded to married heterosexual couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Maryland\u2019s marriage law, Family Law \u00a7 2-201, entitles only opposite-sex couples to the rights of marriage. Md.Code (1984, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 2-201 of the Family Law Article. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>a result of the classification in \u00a7 2-201, two similarly situated classes of people are established: committed same-sex couples and married opposite-sex couples. The State asserts that the classification is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest in encouraging marriage between two members of the opposite sex as a means of fostering a stable environment for procreation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees, on the other hand, assert that the distinction between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples does not rationally further the State\u2019s interest in child welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">A. Current Laws\u2014Rights and Limits</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In order to determine whether Maryland\u2019s marriage law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, it is first necessary to review how the Maryland statutory, regulatory, and case law has evolved to expand rights to gays and lesbians. It is highly significant that throughout this State, based on statutes and ordinances, discrimination against gays and lesbians is not tolerated or acceptable. As I will outline, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is against the law in this State. This context is important for analyzing whether the State\u2019s proffered interest is legitimate, and whether the State\u2019s means fit sufficiently the ends sought by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">1. Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Over the past decade, Maryland has sought to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation and to reduce the disparate treatment of people based on sexual orientation, particularly in the areas of family law, criminal law, and anti-discrimination legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Starting in the mid-1990\u2019s, Maryland appellate courts rejected the notion that homosexual individuals should be treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ed differently than heterosexual individuals when determining parental rights. Specifically, Maryland courts have rejected the notion that a person is unfit for visitation rights because of his or her sexual orientation. <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 237-238, 721 A.2d 662, 678 (1998); <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md. App. 1, 15-17, 648 A.2d 1025, 1032-33 (1994). In <em>North, </em>the Court of Special Appeals, en banc, held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a homosexual father overnight visitation rights by focusing on the <em>perceived harms </em>of exposing his children to his homosexual lifestyle instead of focusing on the proper question of whether visitation was in the best interests of his children. <em>North, </em>102 Md.App. at 15-17, 648 A.2d at 1032-33. This Court has held subsequently that the sexual preference of the non-custodial parent whose visitation is being challenged is not relevant, and that restrictions on visitation should be reviewed under the best interests of the child standard. <em>Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 236-238, 721 A.2d at 678. Indeed, we noted in <em>Boswell </em>that the \u201conly relevance that a parent\u2019s sexual conduct or lifestyle has in the context of a visitation proceeding of this type is where that conduct or lifestyle is clearly shown to be detrimental to the children\u2019s emotional and/or physical well-being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 721 A.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Maryland appellate courts have not considered sexual orientation as a factor when determining third party custody rights. In a custody dispute between two homosexual women, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court was required to exercise jurisdiction over a child visitation lawsuit brought by the biological mother\u2019s former same-sex partner under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, even if Tennessee was the more convenient forum. <em>Gestl v. Frederick, </em>133 Md.App. 216, 244-45, 754 A.2d 1087, 1102-03 (2000). The court noted that the former partner, who was not a biological parent, would lack standing to bring an action in Tennessee absent a finding that parental custody would result in substantial harm to the child, whereas Maryland law entitled the third party an opportunity to show that exceptional circumstances existed that would make it in the child\u2019s best interests to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>her custody.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The sexual orientation of the individuals raising the custody claim was not a relevant factor in the court\u2019s holding\u2014the former same-sex partner was viewed as any other third party who had a role in the child\u2019s life and could show exceptional circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Shurupoff v. Vockroth, </em>372 Md. 639, 814 A.2d 543 (2003) (affirming grant of custody to grandparents); <em>Dietrich v. Anderson, </em>185 Md. 103, 116, 43 A.2d 186 (1945) (denying father\u2019s petition for custody when child had been living with foster parents for five years); <em>Pastore v. Sharp, </em>81 Md.App. 314, 322, 567 A.2d 509, 513 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 304, 572 A.2d 182 (1990) (finding exceptional circumstances when child had been in custody of third party for two of his five years, child had become attached to third party, and his future would lack stability and certainty if placed with the natural mother); <em>Newkirk v. Newkirk, </em>73 Md.App. 588, 595, 535 A.2d 947, 950-51 (1988) (finding exceptional circumstances in awarding custody of teenage children to half-brother, rather than natural father).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Although the issue of same-sex adoption has not been addressed by this Court, Maryland law does not appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>preclude same-sex couple adoptions. The plain language of Family Law \u00a7 5-3A-29 permits any adult to adopt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Md. Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-3A-29 of the Family Law Article. Thus, the statute does not appear to distinguish between the adoption of children by homosexuals or same-sex couples.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Individuals in a same-sex relationship may adopt, even though currently they are not allowed to marry under Maryland law, because there is no requirement that an adult seeking to adopt a child be married. Md.Code (1984, 2006 ReplVol.), \u00a7 5-349(b) (stating that a petition for adoption may not be denied \u201csolely because the petitioner is single or unmarried.\u201d). In traditional adoptions and single-person adoptions, a child is adopted by one or two new parents and all legal relationships with prior parents are terminated. Maryland also recognizes \u201csecond-parent adoptions,\u201d where a child with one parent is adopted by a second parent without severing the prior-existing parental relationship.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>331(b)(2) (adoption without prior termination of parental rights). Maryland\u2019s trial courts have granted same-sex couples \u201csecond-parent adoptions\u201d and have noted that such adoptions are in the best interests of the child. <em>See In re Petition of D.L.G. &amp; M.A.H., </em>No. 95-179001/CAD, 2 MFLM Supp. 21 (1997) (Cir. Ct. Balt. City, June 27, 1996); Letter from Kathryn M. Rowe, Assistant Att\u2019y Gen., Office of the Att\u2019y Gen., Sharon Grosfeld, Delegate, Maryland Gen. Assemb. (June 9, 2000). Thus, sexual orientation is not a factor in adoption proceedings in Maryland, and the children adopted by same-sex couples are treated under Maryland law in the same way as children adopted by a heterosexual or married couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Maryland has acted to protect gays and lesbians in the area of criminal law. The General Assembly has amended Maryland\u2019s hate crime statutes to prohibit committing a crime upon a persons or property because of sexual orientation. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-301 to 10-306 of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Maryland has addressed the decriminalization of sexual acts for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. In <em>Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 580 A.2d 176 (1990), this Court held that Maryland\u2019s statute criminalizing \u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practices\u201d did not encompass private, consensual, noncommercial, heterosexual activity between adults.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 554. In 1998, a Maryland circuit court extended the <em>Schochet </em>ruling to hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practices\u201d statute, \u00a7 554, did not encompass consensual, noncommercial, heterosexual <em>or homosexual </em>activity. <em>See Williams v. Glendening, </em>No. 98036031/CL-1059, 1998 WL 965992 (Md.Cir.Ct. Oct. 15, 1998). It is worth noting that the defendant State of Maryland specifically argued that \u00a7 554 should be construed so as not to apply to private, consensual, non-commercial homosexual activity because any other interpretation \u201cgives rise to an equal protection question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6. The Circuit Court held that \u201c[i]t cannot be doubted ... that there would be an equal protection violation if acts, considered not criminal when committed by a heterosexual couple, could be prosecuted when practiced by a homosexual couple. There is simply no basis for the distinction.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at *7. Thus, four years prior to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), which invalidated Texas\u2019 homosexual sodomy law, Maryland\u2019s courts and executive branch had already determined that private, consensual, non-commercial sex is non-criminal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Maryland public policy prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodation, housing, and employment. <em>See Anti-discrimination Act, </em>2001 Md. Laws Chap. 340. The Anti-discrimination Act of 2001 bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, defined as \u201cthe identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tion of an individual as to male or female homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Act states that it, \u201cmay not be construed to authorize or validate a marriage between two individuals of the same-sex\u201d and it \u201cmay not be construed to require or prohibit an employer to offer health insurance benefits to unmarried domestic partners,\u201d but the Act as a whole firmly establishes that Maryland\u2019s public policy prohibits adverse treatment based on sexual orientation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">There are a multitude of other state-wide laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in a variety of categories. It is unlawful for social workers, judges, and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, for example, to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Md. Code (1981, 2005 Repl. Vol, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 19-311 of the Health and Occupations Article; Md. Rule 16-813 Canon 3A (\u201cA judge shall perform the duties of judicial office ... impartially, and without having or manifesting bias or prejudice, including bias or prejudice based on ... sexual orientation. ...\u201d); Md.Code (1957, 2002 Repl.

Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Despite Maryland\u2019s recent statutory, regulatory, and case law that has evolved to equalize some legal protections of heterosexuals and homosexuals, same-sex couples are denied the protection of hundreds of laws simply because they are not yet entitled to the rights and benefits flowing from marriage. Appellees have directed us to over 425 statutory protections that are afforded to married couples and, as a result, to their children under state law, protections that appellees are denied.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Equality Maryland., Marriage Inequality in the State of Maryland (2006), http://www.equalitymaryland.org marriage/marriage_inequality_in_maryland.pdf.

A spouse is automatically entitled to act as a surrogate regarding health care decisions necessary for an incapacitated spouse absent the existence of an appointed guardian. Md.Code (1982, 2005 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-605 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Health-General Article. A spouse may share a room in health care facility. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19-344(h). A spouse is also permitted to secure health insurance for the other spouse. Md.Code (1997, 2003 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-202 of the Insurance Article. Same-sex couples do not enjoy these automatic protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Married individuals benefit also from certain default provisions associated with the death of a spouse. A surviving spouse automatically has the right to arrange for the final disposition of the body of a decedent spouse in absence of written instructions. Md.Code (1982, 2005 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-509 of the Health-General Article. A spouse is exempt from inheritance tax on benefits plans or real property passed on by the decedent. Md.Code (1988, 2004 ReplVol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 7-203 of the Tax General Article. A spouse is entitled to a family allowance of $5,000, which is exempt from and has priority over all claims against the estate. Md.Code (1974, 2001 ReplVol, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-201 of the Estates and Trusts Article. A spouse may bring a cause of action for the wrongful death of a spouse. Md.Code (1974, 2006 ReplVol.), \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Furthermore, health insurance providers are required to continue coverage for surviving spouses. Md.Code (1997, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 15-407 of the Insurance Article. Same-sex couples must incur the expense of attempting to gain and to protect these rights through wills and other legal instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Beyond the realm of health and death benefits, married couples enjoy the right to freely transfer joint ownership in property to a spouse without having to pay transfer or recordation tax. Md.Code (1986, 2001 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-108, 13-403 of the Tax-Property Article. Married couples may own property as tenants by the entirety, Md.Code (1974, 2003 ReplVol, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 4-204 of the Real Property Article, which can, for example, protect the property from forfeiture in certain circumstances. Md.Code (2001, 2001 ReplVol, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article. In judicial proceedings, married individuals may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>not be compelled to testify against their spouse or to disclose confidential communications. Md.Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-105 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. One spouse cannot be compelled to testify against a defendant spouse as an adverse witness unless the charge involves child abuse or assault in which the spouse is a victim. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-106. In the area of education, dependent children and spouses of armed forces members further benefit under Maryland law because they are exempt from paying non-resident tuition at a public institution of higher education. Md.Code (1978, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 15-106.4 of the Education Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The statutes determining relationships between child and parent are particularly relevant. Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 1-206 of the Trusts and Estates Article states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201c(a) A child born or conceived during a marriage is presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses. Except as provided in \u00a7 1-207,[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] a child born at any time after his parents have participated in a marriage ceremony with each other, even if the marriage is invalid, is presumed to be the legitimate child of both parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201c(b) A child conceived by artificial insemination of a married woman with the consent of her husband is the legitimate child of both of them for all purposes. Consent of the husband is presumed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Although a child conceived by artificial insemination of a married woman can automatically be the legitimate child of both individuals in the marriage, a same-sex couple must go through the process of second-parent adoption, which necessarily involves a period of some delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">It cannot be argued that same-sex couples are not denied significant benefits accorded to heterosexual couples. It is clear that there are significant differences in the benefits provided to married couples and same-sex couples in the areas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of taxation, business regulation, secured commercial transactions, spousal privilege and other procedural matters, education, estates and trusts, family law, decision-making regarding spousal health care, insurance, labor and employment, child care and child rearing, pensions, and the responsibilities attendant to spousal funeral arrangements. Significantly, the inequities directed to individuals in same-sex couples have an impact on their children. Children in same-sex couple households are treated differently\u2014because their care providers are denied certain benefits and rights\u2014despite comparable needs to children of married couples. Thus, under Maryland\u2019s current laws, committed same-sex couples and their children are not afforded the benefits and protections available to heterosexual households.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">2. Analysis of State\u2019s Interests</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">As the majority notes, the State asserts two rationales in support of the statute governing marriage, Family Law \u00a7 2-201. First, the State argues that, \u201cMaryland law preserving the historic definition of marriage to include a man and a woman is eminently reasonable and unquestionably bears a fair and substantial relation to the State\u2019s legitimate interest in maintaining and promoting the traditional institution of marriage.\u201d This rationale addresses solely the definition of marriage, as opposed to the rights and benefits that flow from marriage. Because I write separately to address the rights and benefits, I do not address this proffered State interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The State asserts also that, encouraging \u201cthe definition of marriage to include a man and woman is rationally related to a legitimate government interest in providing for the offspring that may result from heterosexual intimacy.\u201d Again, my focus is on whether the State may rationally deny same-sex couples the full rights and benefits of marriage in order to foster its asserted interest in a stable environment for procreation and child rearing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Under our equal projection jurisprudence, a law will survive rational basis scrutiny, generally, if the distinction it makes rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose. As the majority acknowledges, the classification established in Family Law \u00a7 2-201 is both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. The statute is over-inclusive because children may be born into same-sex relationships through alternative methods of conception, including surrogacy, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and adoption. Conversely, the statute is under-inclusive because not all opposite-sex couples choose to procreate, not all opposite-sex couples are able to have children, and many opposite-sex couples utilize the same alternative methods of conception as same-sex couples.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We have recognized, however, that a classification subject to rational basis review having \u201csome <em>reasonable basis </em>need not be made with mathematical nicety and may result in <em>some </em>inequality.\u201d <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>304 Md. at 352, 499 A.2d at 185 (emphasis added); <em>but see Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 713-14, 426 A.2d at 946 (\u201cA loose fit between the legislative ends and the means chosen to accomplish those goals, which leaves a significant measure of similarly situated persons unaffected by the enactment, or conversely, which includes individuals within the statute\u2019s purview who are not afflicted with the evil the statute seeks to remedy, is intolerable.\u201d). The question, in this case, is whether the State has a reasonable basis for its classification in Family Law \u00a7 2-201, particularly in light of the extensive inequality that results from the classification and its impacts on vital interests. <em>See Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 704, 426 A.2d at 940 (noting that where a legislative enactment \u201cinvades protected rights to life, liberty, property or other interests secured by the fundamental doctrines of our jurisprudence, there is rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>son to be especially vigilant\u201d in the exercise of rational basis review.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Maryland public policy supports procreation that occurs in both opposite-sex and same-sex couple environments. Maryland appears to grant adoptions to both homosexual and heterosexual couples, and adoption agencies \u201cmay not deny an individual\u2019s application to be an adoptive parent because ... [o]f the applicant\u2019s ... sexual orientation.\u201d COMAE 7.05.03.09(A); <em>see also </em>COMAE 7.05.03.15(C)(2). Maryland courts alfio grant second-parent adoptions to same-sex partners and the Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene issues birth certificates recognizing same-sex partners as co-parents. Furthermore, \\ Maryland courts must disregard the sexual orientation of each parent in child custody and visitation disputes. <em>See Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 721 A.2d 662. These laws do not demonstrate that Maryland has an interest in favoring heterosexual parents over homosexual couples with regard to procreation and child rearing. Indeed, the State specifically treats homosexual couples and heterosexual couples similarly in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Despite the fact that Maryland provides some rights and benefits in the area of procreation to same-sex couples, the State asserts it has a rational basis for excluding same-sex couples from the <em>full </em>benefits of marriage. This is not a rational assertion. There is no doubt that the State has a legitimate interest in promoting procreation and child rearing, but it cannot rationally further this interest by only granting the full rights of marriage to opposite-sex couples when it <em>already </em>provides some legal protections regarding procreation and child rearing to same-sex couples.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s equal protection jurisprudence requires that a legislative distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>reasonably </em>relate to the achievement of a legitimate State interest. <em>See Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 355, 601 A.2d 102, 108 (1992) (noting that \u201ca court will not overturn the classification unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that [the court] can only conclude that the [governmental] actions were irrational.\u201d) (quotations omitted; internal citations omitted). Here, where Maryland has granted <em>some </em>rights regarding procreation and child-rearing to same-sex couples, it cannot rationally claim that its interest in providing a stable environment for procreation and child rearing is then actually furthered by the exclusion of same-sex couples from the equal rights and benefits of marriage.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">What is striking, in fact, is that the State\u2019s proffered interest\u2014providing a stable environment for procreation and child rearing\u2014is actually compromised by denying same-sex families the benefits and rights that flow from marriage. That is, there is not a sufficient link between the State\u2019s proffered legitimate interest and the means utilized by the State to further that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The State has determined arbitrarily which benefits may be extended to same-sex couples and the inequality that results is more than merely \u201csome inequality.\u201d For example, there is no rational basis why a surviving spouse of a state employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>killed in the performance of his or her duties should be denied payment of a death benefit if the individual is part of a same-sex couple. Md.Code (1994, 2004 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-404 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. A surviving spouse, regardless of sexual orientation, and his or her child or children would benefit from the additional financial security provided from a death benefit. It is rational to presume that such a financial benefit would contribute to a stable environment for procreation and child rearing, regardless of the couples\u2019 sexual orientation. Similarly, there is no rational basis for requiring a group life insurance policy to cover a spouse and dependent children in a heterosexual family, when children of same-sex couples would benefit just as much from life insurance. Md.Code (1997, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 17-209 of the Insurance Article. This disparate treatment of committed same-sex couples, exhibited in a multitude of Maryland laws discussed <em>supra, </em>directly disadvantages the children of same-sex couples, and there is no rational basis to allow such disadvantages when the State\u2019s proffered interest is to promote a stable environment for procreation and child rearing. Each child raised in a household headed by a same-sex couple in Maryland needs and is entitled to the same legal protections as a child of married parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">I agree with the Supreme Court of Vermont, which recognized both the multitude and significance of the benefits and protections incident to a marriage. The Vermont Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cWhile other statutes could be added to this list, the point is clear. The legal benefits and protections flowing from a marriage license are of such significance that any statutory exclusion must necessarily be grounded on public concerns of sufficient weight, cogency, and authority that the justice of the deprivation cannot seriously be questioned. Considered in light of the extreme logical disjunction between the classification and the stated purposes of the law\u2014protecting children and \u2018furthering the link between procreation and child rearing\u2019\u2014the exclusion falls substantially short of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>standard. The laudable governmental goal of promoting a commitment between married couples to promote the security of their children and the community as a whole provides no reasonable basis for denying the legal benefits and protections of marriage to same-sex couples, who are no differently situated with respect to <em>this goal </em>than their opposite-sex counterparts. Promoting a link between procreation and childrearing similarly fails to support the exclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Baker, </em>744 A.2d at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The classification in Family Law \u00a7 2-201 is significantly over\u2014and under-inclusive, and creates more than merely an imperfect fit between means and ends with regard to the disbursement of the rights and benefits of marriage. Denying same-sex couples the rights and benefits appurtenant to marriage is not a means to legitimately meet the State\u2019s interest in furthering procreation and child-rearing. Moreover, the classification creates more than merely \u201csome inequality\u201d\u2014it creates a grossly unequal distribution of benefits and privileges to two similarly situated classes of people. The State has failed to provide a legitimate State interest in denying the protections and responsibilities of marriage that is rationally furthered by the classification in Family Law \u00a7 2-201. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>this State has demonstrated that it is on a path to providing full equality regardless of sexual orientation, and it is unreasonable and irrational for the State to arbitrarily grant to same-sex couples certain rights and benefits incident to marriage considering the full range of protections and responsibilities that come with marriage. In short, while there may be a legitimate basis for retaining the definition of marriage as one between a man and a woman, there is no legitimate basis for denying committed same-sex couples the benefits and privileges of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The reality of Maryland today is that heterosexual couples are not the only people that participate in procreation and child rearing. Maryland\u2019s laws recognize and promote this reality, and each child raised in a household headed by a committed same-sex couple in Maryland needs and is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>to the same legal protections as a child of heterosexual married parents. Thus, in order for the State to rationally further procreation and child rearing, the benefits and rights incident to marriage must be equally available to both committed same-sex and committed opposite-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">C. Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The State has not demonstrated a rational relationship between denying committed same-sex couples the benefits and privileges given to their married heterosexual counterparts and the legitimate government purpose of promoting procreation and child-rearing. Under the equal protection guarantee of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the State must provide committed same-sex couples, on equal terms, the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities enjoyed by married heterosexual couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">It is up to the General Assembly to meet the equal protection guarantee of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. It is not this Court\u2019s role to craft a constitutional statutory scheme, but the General Assembly could satisfy the constitutional mandate by creating a separate statutory structure similar to the civil union or domestic partnership laws present in our sister jurisdictions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Each state\u2019s statutory scheme differs in the rights and benefits granted to same-sex couples,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but the schemes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>similar in that they afford rights to committed same-sex couples on equal terms with their heterosexual counterparts. The New Jersey experience is important and instructive. On October 25, 2006, the Supreme Court of New Jersey decided <em>Lewis v. Harris, </em>188 N.J. 415, 908 A.2d 196. The Court held that there is not a fundamental right to marriage under the New Jersey Constitution, but that \u201cunder the equal protection guarantee of Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, committed same-sex couples must be afforded on equal terms the same rights and benefits enjoyed by married opposite-sex couples.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220-21. The Supreme Court of New Jersey stated that the legislature had 180 days to either amend the existing marriage statutes to include same-sex couples, or it could create a separate and parallel statutory structure, such as a civil union, affording same-sex couples all of the same rights and responsibilities as heterosexual married couples. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">New Jersey\u2019s legislature acted and chose to establish civil unions by amending the State\u2019s current marriage statute to include same-sex couples. <em>See </em>2006 N.J. Laws 975. In doing so, the legislature stated that it was \u201ccontinuing its longstanding history of insuring equality under the laws for all New Jersey citizens by providing same-sex couples with the same rights and benefits as heterosexual couples who choose to marry.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 37:1-28\u00ae (West 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The New Jersey Legislature set forth three requirements that two persons seeking to establish a civil union must meet: (1) not be a party to another civil union, domestic partnership or marriage in New Jersey; (2) be of the same sex; and (3) be at least 18 years of age, with certain exceptions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Id. \u00a7 37:1-30. Regarding benefits and rights, the New Jersey legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>stated that \u201c[cjivil union couples shall have all of the same benefits, protections and responsibilities under law, whether they derive from statute, administrative or court rule, public policy, common law or any other source of civil law, as are granted to spouses in a marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37:l-31(a). The statute specifically notes, for example, that, \u201c[t]he rights of civil union couples with respect to a child of whom either becomes the parent during the term of the civil union, shall be the same as those of a married couple with respect to a child of whom either spouse or partner in a civil union couple becomes the parent during the marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37:l-31(e). Moreover, the statute enumerates a list of \u201clegal benefits, protections and responsibilities of spouses [that] shall apply in like manner to civil union couples, but shall not be construed to be an exclusive list of such benefits, protections and responsibilities.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37:1-32. Finally, the legislature estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>lished a Civil Union Review Commission, which it charged with, amongst other things, studying the implementation of the law, evaluating the effect on same-sex couples, their children and other family members of being provided civil unions rather than marriage, and reporting its findings to the Legislature and Governor on a semi-annual basis. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37:1-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Under Md. Rule 8-606, the disposition of an appeal is evidenced by the issuance of a mandate by the Clerk of Court in conformance with the opinion, not by the opinion itself. Generally, the mandate\u2014the judgment of the Court\u2014is issued 30 days after the filing of the opinion, but Rule 8\u2014606(b) permits the Court to advance or delay the issuance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>mandate and we have, on occasion, exercised this discretion. <em>See Massey v. Secretary, Dept. of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>389 Md. 496, 886 A.2d 585 (2005) (Clerk of Court directed to withhold mandate for 120 days in order to give the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services time to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Similar to the situation in New Jersey prior to passage of that State\u2019s civil union law, there is an unconstitutional disparity of rights, benefits, and responsibilities between committed same-sex couples and heterosexual couples in Maryland. The constitutional relief to which appellants are entitled would necessarily require the cooperation of the General Assembly. As a result, such relief could not be immediate. The General Assembly should, however, work to create a scheme that safeguards the individual liberties protected by the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In this case, I would retain jurisdiction in this Court and instruct the Clerk to withhold the mandate for 180 days to give the General Assembly time to consider and enact legislation consistent with the views expressed in this dissenting opinion. In my view, the General Assembly should either amend the marriage statutes or enact an appropriate statutory scheme to provide appellees with their full rights under Maryland\u2019s equal protection guarantee in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Chief Judge Bell authorizes me to state that he agrees with, and joins this dissenting opinion to the extent that it endorses and advocates that committed same-sex couples are entitled to the myriad statutory benefits that are associated with and flow from marriage. He does not join the part of this opinion that accepts the majority\u2019s analysis and determination that rational basis review is the appropriate standard to be applied in this case. <em>See </em>Bell, C.J., dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\">. The majority analyzes whether appellees have a constitutional right to have their relationships recognized by the name marriage, but fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>consider whether appellees are entitled to the same benefits, rights and privileges afforded to married heterosexual couples. I write separately to address only this latter issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\">. Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights states \"[t]hat no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.\u201d The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Although Article 24 does not contain an express equal protection clause, this Court has held that the same concept of equal treatment is embodied in the due process requirement of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights. <em>Frankel v. Board of Regents, </em>361 Md. 298, 312-13, 761 A.2d 324, 332 (2000) (quoting <em>Renko v. McLean, </em>346 Md. 464, 482, 697 A.2d 468, 477 (1997)).

In this case, the majority erroneously relies on the opinion of Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy in <em>Burning Tree Club, Inc. v.

The Primary Case</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In <em>Burning Tree I, </em>Stewart Bainum, in his role as taxpayer,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Barbara Renschler, a taxpayer and a woman seeking membership in the Burning Tree Club, a private country club that excluded women, sued the State, the Department of Assessments and Taxation, and the Club, seeking a declaratory judgment that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d exception found in Section 19(e)(4)\u00ae of Article 81, Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> violated the ERA. <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 59-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>60, 501 A.2d at 820. The Plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the State from extending preferential tax treatment to the Club, and sought a mandate that the Club entertain applications for female membership.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 60, 501 A.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Section 19 (e) authorized the Department to make agreements with private country clubs such as Burning Tree whereby, in exchange for an agreement to preserve open spaces from development for a term of years, the club would receive a reduced real property tax rate. <em>Id. </em>at 56-57, 501 A.2d at 818-19. The statute established a dual system of assessments, one calculated under the ordinary assumption of \u201cbest use,\u201d the other, lower assessment, calculated under the assumption that the land remain undeveloped. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 501 A.2d at 818-19. So long as the agreement was in effect, the State collected property tax only on the lower assessed value. In case the country club breached the agreement, the State could collect taxes prospectively on the higher assessed value; moreover, a portion of the tax that would have been due based on the difference between the lower and higher assessed values would have been accelerated and become payable immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In 1974, the General Assembly amended Section 19(e) to add an anti-discrimination provision, which conditioned the tax benefit on an agreement not to discriminate on account of race, color, creed, sex, or national origin, unless the clubs were \u201coperated with the <em>primary purpose, </em>as determined by the Attorney General, to serve or benefit members of a particular sex.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 57, 501 A.2d at 819 (emphasis added); 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 870. The amended statute also contained a so-called periodic discrimination clause, exempting from the anti-discrimination provision those \u201cclubs which exclude certain sexes only on certain days and at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>certain times.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 57, 501 A.2d at 819; 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">There were several issues<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> before the Court in <em>Burning Tree I: </em>whether the roles of the State and the Department under Section 19(e) of Article 81 in conjunction with the Club\u2019s participation in the open space program, amounted to state action,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 85, 501 A.2d at 833; whether the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause violated the ERA; and whether the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause was severable from the statute\u2019s overall prohibition against discrimination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 80, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>501 A.2d at 830-31. The Court issued three separate opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 501 A.2d at 818 (Chief Judge Murphy, joined by Judges Smith and Orth); <em>id. </em>at 85, 501 A.2d at 833 (Judge Rodowsky, concurring); <em>id. </em>at 88, 501 A.2d at 835 (Judge Eldridge, joined by Judges Cole and Bloom).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Chief Judge Murphy, joined by Judges Charles E. Orth, Jr. and Marvin H. Smith, took the position that the involvement of the State and the Department in the open space program did not constitute state action. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 501 A.2d at 822-23. In Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s opinion, Section 19(e)(4)(i) was facially neutral, <em>id. </em>at 71, 501 A.2d at 826, and the State bore no responsibility for the Club\u2019s discrimination, because the State did not initiate the Club\u2019s discriminatory membership policy, the State did not cause the Club to implement those policies through coercion or inducement, and the statutory purpose<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> bore no relationship to sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 75-76, 501 A.2d at 828-29. Judge Lawrence F. Rodowsky agreed only to the extent that the actions of the Attorney General and the Department in certifying compliance with the terms of Section 19(e)(4)(i), did not, in his view, become state action as a result of the Club\u2019s participation in the open space program, <em>id. </em>at 85-86, 501 A.2d at 833-34, although he maintained that the statute <em>itself </em>constituted state action, because the statute drew sex-based distinctions on its face. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86, 501 A.2d at 833-34. Judge John C. Eldridge, joined by Judges Harry A. Cole and Theodore G. Bloom, \u201ctotally dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>agree[d]\u201d with Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s view that the statute and its administration by the State were \u201cgender neutral,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 91, 501 A.2d at 836; furthermore, Judge Eldridge believed there \u201cclearly [was] state action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 91, 501 A.2d at 836, because Section 19(e)(4)(i) drew a distinction between sex-based discrimination and other forms of discrimination, and because the administrative mechanism set up by the statute \u201cclearly involve[d] the State in the discrimination\u201d by the Club. <em>Id. </em>at 91-93, 501 A.2d at 836-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">A majority of the Court, consisting of Judge Rodowsky, <em>id. </em>at 88, 501 A.2d at 834-35, and Judges Eldridge, Cole and Bloom, <em>id. </em>at 91, 501 A.2d at 836, held that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause on its face violated the ERA. Because Judge Rodowsky disagreed with Judge Eldridge about severability, <em>id. </em>at 91 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5, 501 A.2d at 836 &amp; n. 5, a different majority consisting of Chief Judge Murphy, and Judges Orth and Smith, <em>id. </em>at 84, 501 A.2d at 832-33, agreed with Judge Rodowsky, <em>id. </em>at 85, 501 A.2d at 833, holding that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause was not severable from Section 19(e)(4)\u00a9, thereby invalidating the entire anti-discrimination provision (and rendering the periodic discrimination clause moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On the ERA issue, Chief Judge Murphy, writing for himself and two other judges, concluded that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause did not implicate the ERA and therefore, was not subject to strict scrutiny, because the clause benefitted and burdened both sexes equally, <em>id. </em>at 71, 501 A.2d at 826, and because the ERA was \u201cessentially limited in its scope to unequal treatment imposed by law <em>as between </em>the sexes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 501 A.2d at 823 (emphasis added). According to Chief Judge Murphy, enactment and administration of Section 19(e)(4) constituted \u201caction by the State,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 70, 501 A.2d at 826; nevertheless, the statute \u201c[did] not apportion or distribute benefits or burdens unequally among the sexes, but rather [made] the tax benefit equally available to all single sex country clubs agreeing to participate in the State\u2019s open space program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 501 A.2d at 826. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he only burden [was] that imposed on the public treasury as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>result of the preferential tax assessment afforded to qualifying country clubs,\u201d a burden \u201cborn equally by all Maryland citizens, men and women alike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, the public benefits \u201cwhich accrue[d] from the preservation of open spaces [were] shared equally by each sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although acknowledging that separate but equal facilities for men and women may be subject to strict scrutiny \u201cbecause of inherent inequality of treatment for one sex or the other in the separation process itself,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 79, 501 A.2d at 830, Chief Judge Murphy determined that heightened scrutiny was not implicated under the facts of <em>Burning Tree I </em>because the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause was permissive, not mandatory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Judge Eldridge, writing for himself and two other judges, rejected the Chief Judge\u2019s \u201cgender neutral\u201d analysis, warning that \u201cChief Judge Murphy\u2019s opinion seems to embrace a type of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 doctrine for purposes of the E.R.A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 501 A.2d at 836. Judge Eldridge stated that regardless of whether the sexes are benefitted or burdened equally, <em>any </em>statute that implicates gender classifications on its face <em>must </em>be subject to strict scrutiny, <em>id. </em>at 99, 501 A.2d at 840, and explained the scope of the ERA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">While it is true that many of our prior cases have involved government action directly imposing a burden or conferring a benefit entirely upon either males or females, <em>we have never held that the E.R.A. is narrowly limited to such situations. </em>On the contrary, we have viewed the E.R.A. more broadly, in accordance with its language and purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3U\"><em>Id. </em>at 95, 501 A.2d at 838 (emphasis added). He then looked to our jurisprudence in <em>Rand, </em>in which we stated that the language of the ERA was \u201c \u2018unambiguous\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018can only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>mean that <em>sex is not a factor\u2019,\u201d id. </em>at 95, 501 A.2d at 838, quoting <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 512, 374 A.2d at 903 (emphasis added), and also in <em>Maryland State Board of Barber Examiners v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. 496, 312 A.2d 216 (1973), in which the Court took the position that \u201cunder the E.R.A. classifications based on sex were \u2018suspect classifications\u2019 subject to \u2018stricter scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 95, 501 A.2d at 838, quoting <em>Kuhn, </em>270 Md. at 506-07, 312 A.2d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In a concurring opinion, Judge Rodowsky agreed with Judge Eldridge that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause on its face violated the ERA, which represented the holding of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 501 A.2d at 833. Indeed, in Judge Rodowsky\u2019s view, not only was the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause constitutionally infirm, but the periodic discrimination provision failed for exactly the same reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 501 A.2d at 834. Judges Eldridge and Rodowsky differed on the severability issue; Judge Rodowsky agreed with the Chief Judge that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause was nonseverable, and hence, the entire anti-discrimination provision was void. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 501 A.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">A principal point of contention in <em>Burning Tree I </em>was the particular level of application of the disputed anti-discrimination provision. The Chief Judge regarded Section 19(e)(4)(i) as neutral, because in principle an all-female club could operate as a mirror-image of Burning Tree and enjoy the state tax benefit, so that the universe of consideration was the set of <em>all </em>eligible country clubs. <em>Id. at </em>71, 501 A.2d at 826. According to this view, all country clubs were situated equally with respect to the open space program; all-female clubs and all-male clubs were free to discriminate equally, and hence, there was no ERA violation. The fact that a single all-male club just happened to be the only eligible entity under Section 19(e)(4)(i) was, in this view, an irrelevant coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">A majority of the Court, however, held that the universe of consideration was each <em>particular </em>participating club. Judge Rodowsky stated this proposition explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>It is not an answer to the subject argument of the appellees to say that at the elevated level of the statewide open space program established by \u00a7 19(e) the program is neutral with respect to sex, in the sense that an all female or an all male country club is eligible to participate. The ostensible prohibition against sex discrimination <em>applies to each individual country club </em>participating in the open space program. <em>The universe of consideration for the particular problem created by this antidiscrimination law is any participating country club, in and of itself</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 87, 501 A.2d at 834 (emphasis added), and Judge Eldridge agreed, because he directly refuted the position of the Chief Judge. <em>Id. </em>at 95, 501 A.2d at 838 (\u201c[T]he three apparently do not view the express sanctioning of single sex clubs as imposing a burden upon the excluded sex, as long as the governmental action in theory equally sanctions discrimination by single sex facilities against persons of the other sex.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Ironically, the positions set out by Judges Eldridge and Rodowsky find support in an article by Barbara A. Brown, Thomas I. Emerson, Gail Falk &amp; Ann E. Freedman, <em>The Equal Rights Amendment: A Constitutional Basis for Equal Rights for Women, </em>80 Yale L.J. 871, 889-93 (1971), cited at several points as support in the minority opinion of Chief Judge Murphy. <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 64 &amp; n. 3, 70, 79, 501 A.2d at 822 &amp; n. 3, 825, 830. The Brown article defines why the separate but equal theory implicit in the Chief Judge\u2019s opinion ultimately subverts the meaning and purpose of the ERA. Because the \u201cbasic principle\u201d of the ERA is that \u201csex is not a permissible factor\u201d in determining the legal rights of women and men, it follows that \u201cthe treatment of <em>any person </em>\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> under the law may not be based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>circumstance of a particular person\u2019s sex. Brown, <em>supra </em>at 889 (emphasis added). <em>Accord Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 64, 71, 501 A.2d at 822, 825; <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 512, 374 A.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">To summarize, in <em>Burning Tree I </em>a majority of this Court applied strict scrutiny to invalidate an ostensibly neutral statute that drew sex-based classifications. The analysis focused on the individual level to determine whether the State had granted a benefit or imposed a burden on the basis of sex. Four Judges of this Court rejected the separate but equal approach suggested in Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s minority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">2. Maryland ERA Jurisprudence Before <em>Burning Tree I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Because I disagree with the majority about the meaning and purpose of the ERA, and because the legislative history of the ERA is so sparse,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> I set out in some detail the principal eases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>interpreting the ERA decided by this Court before <em>Burning Tree I, </em>in the period between 1972 and 1985, because they afford better guidance regarding the interpretation of the ERA than any other extant source. That case law provides the backdrop for the opinions in <em>Burning Tree I </em>and supports the position that strict scrutiny applies in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In <em>Maryland State Board of Barber Examiners v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. at 498, 312 A.2d at 217-18, a group of cosmetologists mounted a constitutional challenge to a statutory scheme that prohibited them from cutting and shampooing men\u2019s hair on the same basis as women\u2019s. One of the statutes at issue, Section 529(a) of Article 43, Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Supp.), defined the professional services performed by cosmetologists as \u201cwork ... for the embellishment, cleanliness and beautification of women\u2019s hair.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A different statute, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>323 of Article 43, Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Supp.), defined the corresponding services performed by barbers without limitation to the sex of the client.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under this scheme, cosmetologists who applied to men\u2019s hair the same techniques they customarily used on women\u2019s hair, risked the loss of their licenses and even criminal prosecution. <em>Kuhn, </em>270 Md. at 500-01, 312 A.2d at 218-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In holding that Article 46 was inapplicable, <em>id. </em>at 505-06, 312 A.2d at 221-22, this Court said that \u201cthe statute [did] not discriminate against cosmetologists of either sex; nor, for that matter, [was] there discrimination based on sex between barbers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 312 A.2d at 221. The Court conceded that \u201cif a group of males, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, were complaining that because of their sex, they were being denied the services of cosmetologists,\u201d the result would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 312 A.2d at 221. Rather, Article 46 was inapplicable because the statute at issue treated every cosmetologist and barber exactly the same, and because the victims of discrimination were not parties to the case. Therefore, <em>Kuhn </em>stands for the proposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tion that sex-based classifications trigger the ERA if the challenging party is the target of discrimination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. at 510-11, 374 A.2d at 902, this Court considered whether the common law duty of paternal support of minor children survived the enactment of the ERA. In a unanimous opinion, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">The words of the E.R.A. are clear and unambiguous; they say without equivocation that \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d This language mandating equality of rights can only mean that sex is not a factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 511-12, 374 A.2d at 902-03. Therefore, the ERA mandated that the parental duty of child support was shared jointly by both parents, in derogation of the common law rule. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 374 A.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In its interpretation of the Maryland ERA, the Rand Court examined eases from a number of other states construing similar provisions in their own constitutions. <em>Id. </em>at 512-16, 374 A.2d at 903-05. At the conclusion of its analysis, a unanimous Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">It is thus clear that the tests employed under constitutional provisions dealing with equality of rights range from absolute to permissive. Like the Supreme Court of Washington, however, we believe that the \u201cbroad, sweeping, mandatory language\u201d of the amendment is cogent evidence that the people of Maryland are fully committed to equal rights for men and women. The adoption of the E.R.A. in this [Sjtate was intended to, and did, drastically alter traditional views of the validity of sex-based classifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 374 A.2d at 904-05. Because the Supreme Court of Washington \u201cdid not consider whether the sex-based classification at issue ... satisfied the rational relationship or strict scrutiny test,\u201d but instead found an \u201c \u2018overriding compelling state interest\u2019 \u201d <em>intrinsic to </em>the ERA, <em>id. </em>at 512, 374 A.2d at 903,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the clear implication is that this Court endorsed a near-absolute level of scrutiny for sex-based classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Other cases prior to <em>Burning Tree I </em>invalidated sex-based classifications on the basis of Article 46. For example, in <em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 414 A.2d 929 (1980), this Court considered whether the common law cause of action for criminal conversation remained viable in light of the ERA. At common law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">the cause of action for criminal conversation was available only to a man. The gravamen of this action was adultery. Its elements consisted of a valid marriage and an act of sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man other than her husband. The fact that the wife consented, that she was the aggressor, that she represented herself as single, that she was mistreated or neglected by her husband, that she and her husband were separated through no fault of her own, or that her husband was impotent, were not valid defenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 586-87, 414 A.2d at 930 (citations omitted). The Court applied Article 46, as construed in <em>Rand, </em>to abrogate the cause of action for criminal conversation. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 414 A.2d at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In the present case, the majority interprets <em>Kline </em>to buttress its view that the ERA must be applied under a benefits/burdens analysis. <em>See </em>op. at 258-59 &amp; n. 24, 932 A.2d at 594 &amp; n. 24; <em>Kline, </em>287 Md. at 592, 414 A.2d at 932 (\u201cexplicating this Court\u2019s holding that it would be unconstitutional to impose a burden on fathers which was not equally imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>mothers\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 593, 414 A.2d at 933 (\u201cThus, Maryland\u2019s law provides different benefits for and imposes different burdens upon its citizens based solely upon their sex. Such a result violates the ERA.\u201d). That view is simply a consequence of the particular issue posed in <em>Kline, </em>where the common law rule, like most sex-based <em>classification </em>schemes, drew categorical distinctions between males and females <em>as classes. A </em>more accurate interpretation of <em>Kline </em>results from a comparison of the rights and obligations of the husband and wife in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Because the elements of the tort of criminal conversation were a valid marriage and an act of sexual intercourse between the wife and a man other than her husband, it is obvious that the wife lacked a legally cognizable cause of action against the (hypothetical) mistress of her husband, whereas, at common law, the husband had a valid cause of action against the paramour of his wife. <em>Kline, </em>287 Md. at 586-87, 414 A.2d at 930. But for the fact that the husband was male, he would have been unable to sustain the cause of action. It was obvious to the Court that the unequal rights under the law enjoyed by the wife, compared to the husband, could not survive the scrutiny mandated by the ERA. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 414 A.2d at 933 (\u201cA man has a cause of action for criminal conversation, but a woman does not.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The same conclusion results from a comparison of the legal obligations of the paramour and a hypothetical female mistress of the husband. At common law as it existed in this State up to 1980, for the act of engaging in sexual relations with the wife, the paramour was liable for damages to the husband. But for the fact he was male, the paramour would have suffered no liability. The hypothetical female mistress in our example could not have been sued for criminal conversation if she had engaged in sexual relations with the husband, even though she had engaged in the same conduct as the paramour. Clearly, such a sex-based classification scheme could not withstand the scrutiny mandated by the ERA. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe common law cause of action for criminal conversation ... cannot be reconciled with our commitment to equality of the sexes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Therefore, the conclusion drawn from <em>Kline </em>is that analysis of sex-based classifications focuses on the rights and obligations of the particular person affected by the classification. <em>See also Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 70, 501 A.2d at 825 (opinion of Murphy, C.J.) (\u201cThe equality between the sexes mandated by the Maryland E.R.A. is of \u2018rights\u2019 of <em>individuals </em>\u2018under the law.\u2019 \u201d)(emphasis added). Assuming other personal characteristics are held constant, the appropriate analysis under the ERA should compare the person affected by the challenged classification \"with a similarly situated person of the opposite sex, and then determine whether her rights or obligations have been altered. Viewed through this lens, it becomes clear that every sex-based classification that fails the benefits/burdens test must necessarily fail strict scrutiny at the individual level. This Court applied that analysis in the time span from 1972 until <em>Burning Tree I. See Kline, </em>287 Md. at 591, 414 A.2d at 932, where the Court quoted approvingly from <em>Rand\u2019s </em>language that \u201c[t]he adoption of the E.R.A. in this state was intended to, and did, drastically alter traditional views of the validity of sex-based classifications.\u201d <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 515-16, 374 A.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">It is also noteworthy that the <em>Kline </em>Court examined the legislative history surrounding criminal conversation and determined that, standing alone, history would have supported the inference that the General Assembly had intended to leave the common law doctrine in place. 287 Md. at 590-91, 414 A.2d at 931-32. In 1945, the General Assembly had abolished the closely related cause of action for alienation of affections,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but left standing the cause of action for criminal conversation. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 414 A.2d at 931-32. The crucial intervening fact during that time was the adoption of Article 46, which \u201cadditional factor\u201d was \u201cof sufficient significance to persuade us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>that the action for criminal conversation [was] no longer viable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 414 A.2d at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981), this Court considered whether the common law doctrine of necessaries survived the enactment of the ERA. The majority determined that the ERA abrogated the doctrine, under which \u201cthe husband had a legal duty to supply his wife with necessaries suitable to their station in life, but the wife had no corresponding obligation to support her husband, or supply him with necessaries, even if she had the financial means to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 425 A.2d at 1013. The Court agreed unanimously that the ERA mandated sex-neutrality for the doctrine of necessaries. <em>Compare id. </em>at 532, 425 A.2d at 1019 (\u201c[E]xtend[ing] the common law necessaries doctrine to impose liability upon wives,\u201d or \u201celiminating the necessaries doctrine in its entirety,\u201d both would satisfy the \u201cgeneral purpose of the ERA to proscribe sex-based classifications.\u201d), <em>with id. </em>at 533, 425 A.2d at 1019 (Rodowsky, J., dissenting) (\u201cI agree that this Court has the power to decide, based on the ERA ... that the necessaries doctrine applies alike to both sexes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The majority relied on <em>Rand </em>in its determination \u201cthat the words of the ERA clearly and unambiguously mandated equality of rights between men and women and \u2018canonly mean that sex is not a factor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 425 A.2d at 1015, quoting <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 512, 374 A.2d at 903.

This Court repeatedly affirmed its commitment to uphold the will of the People of Maryland to eradicate state sanctioned unequal treatment based on the happenstance of a particular person\u2019s sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>3. Cases from Other States Analyzed by Judge Eldridge in <em>Burning Tree I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In <em>Burning Tree I, </em>Judge Eldridge also examined cases from other jurisdictions interpreting state constitutional amendments similar to Maryland\u2019s ERA, <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 96-98, 501 A.2d at 839-40, and recognized that courts in Massachusetts, Washington and Illinois interpreted ERA provisions in their own constitutions to require strict scrutiny of sex classifications.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>That body of case law helped shape our own interpretation of the ERA, and supports the idea that strict scrutiny should apply here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Rand, </em>280 Md. at 512, 374 A.2d at 903 (\u201cCases from other state jurisdictions interpreting the breadth and meaning of their equal rights amendments are instructive in ascertaining the reach of Maryland\u2019s E.R.A.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">For example, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts interpreted the Massachusetts ERA<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to require application of the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u2014compelling State interest test\u201d to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>\u201cany governmental </em>classification based <em>solely </em>on sex.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices to the House of Representatives, </em>374 Mass. 836, 371 N.E.2d 426, 428 (1977) (emphasis added). The court considered whether a proposed statute, House No. 6723, barring girls from participation with boys in football and wrestling, was permitted by the ERA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court compared decisions from a number of states that had adopted equal rights amendments, and held that the purpose of the ERA was to require, when evaluating sex-based equal protection claims, strict scrutiny rather than intermediate scrutiny,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the standard applied by federal and state courts to sex-based equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>371 N.E.2d at 428 (\u201cTo use a standard in applying the Commonwealth\u2019s equal rights amendment which requires any less than the strict scrutiny test would negate the purpose of the equal rights amendment and the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the people in adopting it.\u201d). Application of strict scrutiny led the court to conclude that the proposed legislation would be unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">The enactment of House No. 6723 would violate [the Massachusetts ERA]. The absolute prohibition in the proposed legislation cannot survive the close scrutiny to which a statutory classification based solely on sex must be subjected. A prohibition of all females from voluntary participation in a particular sport under every possible circumstance serves no compelling State interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 429-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Judge Eldridge also relied upon <em>Darrin v. Gould, </em>85 Wash.2d 859, 540 P.2d 882, 893 (1975), in which the Supreme Court of Washington invalidated a ban on girls\u2019 participation on high school football teams. A school district in Washington had prohibited two sisters from playing on a football team because their participation was barred by a rule of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (\u201cWIAA\u201d), a statewide association of high schools. <em>Id. </em>at 883-84. As a preliminary matter, the court addressed the applicable standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and its State counterpart, Article I, Section 12 of the Washington Constitution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Having held less than two years previously, in a case where the ERA<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was inapplicable,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that under Washington law, sex would be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>garded as an \u201cinherently suspect\u201d classification triggering strict scrutiny, <em>Hanson v. Hutt, </em>83 Wash.2d 195, 517 P.2d 599, 603 (1973),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the court held that adoption of the ERA required an even more stringent standard than strict scrutiny. <em>Darrin v. Gould, </em>85 Wash.2d 859, 540 P.2d 882, 889 (1975) (\u201cPresumably the people in adopting Const, art. 31 intended to do more than repeat what was already contained in the otherwise governing constitutional provisions, federal and state, by which discrimination based on sex was permissible under the rational relationship and strict scrutiny tests.\u201d). Henceforth, in Washington,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">[t]he overriding compelling state interest as adopted by the people of this state in 1972 is that: \u201cEquality of rights and responsibility under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 893. Because the involvement of public high schools in the WIAA implicated the state action doctrine, <em>id. </em>at 891, the court applied the \u201coverriding compelling state interest\u201d embodied in the ERA to invalidate the statewide ban on girls\u2019 participation in high school interscholastic football. <em>Id. </em>at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">A third case relied upon by Judge Eldridge in <em>Burning Tree I </em>was <em>People v. Ellis, </em>57 Ill.2d 127, 311 N.E.2d 98, 101 (1974), in which the Supreme Court of Illinois interpreted the ERA<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> to require that classifications based on sex be regarded as \u201csuspect,\u201d and therefore, require \u201c \u2018strict judicial scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d From the plain language of the ERA and its legislative history, the court found \u201cinescapable\u201d the conclusion that the purpose of the ERA was \u201cto supplement and expand the guaranties of the equal protection provision of the Bill of Rights\u201d of the Federal Constitution. <em>Id. </em>Under a strict scrutiny analysis, the court held that a statute permitting 17-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>year-old boys to be charged as adults for certain crimes, but requiring 17-year-old girls to be tried as juveniles, violated the Illinois ERA.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 99, 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">4. Strict Scrutiny for Sex-Based Classifications Even Where Facially Neutral</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On the basis of <em>Rand </em>and its progeny, and eases in sister states interpreting similar constitutional provisions, Judge Eldridge in <em>Burning Tree I </em>concluded that \u201cthe E.R.A. renders sex-based <em>classifications </em>suspect and subject to at least strict scrutiny, with the burden of persuasion being upon those attempting to justify the classifications.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 98, 501 A.2d at 840 (emphasis in original). Therefore, \u201c[i]n this respect, the E.R.A. makes sex classifications subject to <em>at least the same scrutiny </em>as racial classifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Even a facially neutral statute can implicate strict scrutiny if the purpose and effect of the classification are discriminatory, Judge Eldridge concluded. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 501 A.2d at 841. Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">[i]f the purpose and effect of the primary purpose provision had related to <em>single race </em>rather than <em>single sex </em>clubs, the provision, <em>regardless of any alleged neutrality in the language, </em>would clearly fall under the principles of <em>Hunter v. Underwood[</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em>]; Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Corp.[</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em>] Gomillion v.

In Judge Eldridge\u2019s view, Section 19(e)(4)(l), which prohibited discrimination on the grounds of race, color, creed, sex, or national origin, but permitted sexual discrimination when the country club\u2019s primary purpose was \u201cto serve or benefit members of a particular sex,\u201d was unconstitutional <em>both </em>on its face and in its effect. <em>Id. </em>at 99-102, 501 A.2d at 840-42. Because at all times from the enactment of the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d anti-discrimination provision, until the time the case was litigated, Burning Tree was the <em>only </em>entity to which the provision applied, <em>id. </em>at 100, 501 A.2d at 841, it was undisputed that the purpose and effect of Section 19(e)(4)(l) were \u201cto permit one country club to maintain its discriminatory policy while continuing to receive a substantial state benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 501 A.2d at 841. In that respect, <em>Burning Tree I </em>was indistinguishable from a line of Supreme Court eases that invalidated ostensibly neutral laws the effects of which were patently discriminatory on grounds of race. <em>See, e.g., Hunter v. Underwood, </em>471 U.S. 222, 227, 233, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 1919-20, 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 222, 227-28, 231 (1985) (facially neutral state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>constitutional provision disenfranchising disproportionate numbers of African-Americans held in violation of Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause); <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 11-12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1823-24, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010, 1017-18 (1967) (facially neutral anti-miscegenation statutes held in violation of Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses); <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot, </em>364 U.S. 339, 341-42, 81 S.Ct. 125, 127, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, 113 (1960) (local law altering municipal boundary to exclude nearly all African-American voters constitutionally suspect).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">To summarize, in <em>Burning Tree I, </em>a majority of this Court interpreted our prior cases to mandate a robust interpretation of the ERA. Henceforth, government action resulting in sex-based classifications would be subject to strict scrutiny, with the burden placed on the proponents of the classifications to demonstrate they were narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest. This Court took special care to look beneath ostensibly neutral classifications to their underlying purpose and effect, in order to ferret out state sanctioned discrimination masquerading as facially neutral law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">B. Burning Tree II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In <em>Burning Tree II, </em>this Court adopted Judge Eldridge\u2019s rationale in <em>Burning Tree I </em>and rejected the benefits/burdens analysis of Chief Judge Murphy, invalidating what was termed a \u201csex neutral\u201d law. In response to the decision of this Court in <em>Burning Tree I, </em>the effect of which was to remove the anti-discrimination provision in its entirety from Section 19(e), the General Assembly enacted 1986 Maryland Laws, Chapter 334, which attempted to reenact the periodic discrimination provision.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Burning Tree II, </em>315 Md. at 260-61, 554 A.2d at 370. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>We held that any \u201cenactment of legislation which on its face draws classifications based on sex is <em>state action sufficient to invoke the E.R.A.\u201d Id. </em>at 293, 554 A.2d at 386 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">For the precise reasons the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d clause failed under Article 46, Chapter 334 failed as well. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 554 A.2d at 386-87. Exactly like Section 19(e), Chapter 334 drew s\u00e9x-based classifications: first, Chapter 334 distinguished sex-based discrimination from other types of discrimination; second, Chapter 334 permitted some types of sex discrimination (periodic), but proscribed others (total). <em>Id. </em>In addressing the State\u2019s contention that physical differences between the sexes justified the contested provision, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">In order to justify a racially or sexually discriminatory statute, it is not enough for the State to claim legitimate interests which it seeks to further. Under strict scrutiny, legislation must be narrowly tailored and precisely limited to achieving those legitimate ends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 296, 554 A.2d at 387. We held<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> that the State had failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that Chapter 334 was narrowly tailored to achieving its purposes, <em>id. </em>(\u201cNothing in the statute narrowly confines the permitted sex discrimination to [single-sex golf tournaments].\u201d), regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>those purposes were \u201csubstantial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 295, 554 A.2d at 387, or \u201clegitimate.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 296, 554 A.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The majority in the present case fails to recognize that <em>Burning Tree II </em>clearly adopted strict scrutiny as the standard in ERA cases. Regardless of whether ostensibly the sexes are benefitted or burdened equally by a statutory classification, that statute must withstand strict scrutiny under the ERA or else be invalidated. <em>Id. </em>at 293-96, 554 A.2d at 386-87. \u201cIn order to justify a racially or sexually discriminatory statute, it is not enough for the State to claim legitimate interests which it seeks to further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 554 A.2d at 387. Rather, the State must shoulder the heavy burden of demonstrating that the means chosen are the most restrictive possible consistent with achieving a <em>compelling </em>state interest. Furthermore, the holding of <em>Burning Tree II </em>on the ERA issue relied on the \u201canalytically indistinguishable <em>[Burning Tree I </em>] case,\u201d <em>Burning Tree II, </em>315 Md. at 294, 554 A.2d at 386, which, as I have demonstrated, traces its reasoning back to <em>Rand </em>and ultimately, to the enactment of Article 46 itself. Therefore, the majority in the present case errs fundamentally in its assertion that \u201c[virtually every Maryland case applying Article 46 has dealt with situations where the distinction drawn by a particular governmental enaction or action singled-out for disparate treatment men and women as discrete classes.\u201d <em>See </em>op. at 258-59, 932 A.2d at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>C. Maryland Cases After <em>Burning Tree II </em>Apply Strict Scrutiny to Sex-Based Classifications</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Contrary to the assertion of the majority in the present case, our cases subsequent to <em>Burning Tree II </em>have held that state action effecting classifications solely on the basis of sex is subject to strict scrutiny under the ERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993), was an appeal of a murder conviction in which the defendants contested the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to strike women from the jury pool. This Court extended <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, 82-83 (1986) (race-based peremptory strikes presumptively invalid under equal protection analysis), in light of Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, to hold that sex-based peremptory strikes are prohibited. In the words of Judge Orth, speaking for the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">The equality of rights under law, without regard to gender, bestowed by Art. 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, flowing through the equal protection guarantees of Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), prohibits the State in a criminal prosecution from using peremptory challenges <em>so as to exclude a person from service as a juror because of that person\u2019s sex.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Tyler, </em>330 Md. at 270, 623 A.2d at 653 (emphasis added). Because the Supreme Court had not yet<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> addressed the applicability of <em>Batson </em>to sex-based peremptory strikes, and because this Court had specifically reserved the question, <em>Tolbert v. State, </em>315 Md. 13, 23 n. 7, 553 A.2d 228, 232 n. 7 (1989), it was necessary that we construe the ERA to require \u201c \u2018substantial justification\u2019 \u201d for \u201c \u2018state action providing for segregation based upon sex\u2019,\u201d just as the Fourteenth Amendment applies to segregation based upon race. <em>Tyler, </em>330 Md. at 265, 623 A.2d at 651. Indeed, the ERA was outcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>determinative; we reversed the Court of Special Appeals, which had declined to extend <em>Batson </em>on the grounds that under Maryland common law, the peremptory challenge historically was regarded as \u201cconclusive\u201d and hence, unchallengeable, <em>Eiland v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 94, 607 A.2d 42, 61 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom Tyler, </em>330 Md. at 261, 623 A.2d at 648, and because the Supreme Court had not yet evinced a clear intent effectively \u201cto destroy the peremptory challenge\u201d through consistent application of \u201cthe heavy artillery of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Eiland, </em>92 Md.App. at 88, 90, 607 A.2d at 58, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">It is noteworthy that in extending <em>Batson </em>to sex-based peremptory strikes, we applied strict scrutiny to vindicate the right of an individual stricken juror not to suffer state sanctioned discrimination, rejecting a separate but equal approach. <em>See Tyler, </em>330 Md. at 263, 623 A.2d at 649 (\u201c \u2018[T]he State\u2019s privilege to strike individual jurors through peremptory challenges, is subject to the commands of the Equal Protection Clause.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d at 82. <em>Compare Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 222, 85 S.Ct. 824, 837, 13 L.Ed.2d 759, 773 (1965) (\u201c[W]e cannot hold that the Constitution requires an examination of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for the exercise of his challenges in any given case.\u201d), <em>with Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 92 n. 17, 106 S.Ct. at 1721 n. 17, 90 L.Ed.2d at 85 n. 17 (In overruling <em>Swain, </em>the Court noted the \u201cpractical difficulties\u201d faced by the defendant who must demonstrate a systematic use of peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans \u201cover a number of cases.\u201d). Whereas <em>Swain </em>burdened the defendant with the virtually impossible task of demonstrating a pervasive discriminatory pattern over the course of many trials, <em>Batson </em>reduced the defendant\u2019s evidentiary burden by focusing on a single trial, and then shifting the burden of persuasion to the State upon satisfaction of a greatly diminished burden of production by the defendant. 476 U.S. at 96-97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 87-88. Moreover, the <em>Batson </em>Court noted the application of equal protection principles to the excluded <em>ju</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>rors, </em>not merely to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 106 S.Ct. at 1723-24, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Ultimately, the Supreme Court recognized explicitly the equal protection right of an <em>individual </em>juror \u201cnot to be excluded from [a petit jury] on account of race\u201d in <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 409, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1370, 113 L.Ed.2d 411, 424 (1991), where the Court extended <em>Batson </em>to cover instances of peremptory strikes exercised against potential jurors of a different race than that of a criminal defendant and repudiated the doctrine of separate but equal in the context of peremptory challenges. The Court consciously \u201creject[ed] ... the view that race-based peremptory challenges survive equal protection scrutiny because members of all races are subject to like treatment, which is to say that white jurors are subject to the same risk of peremptory challenges based on race as are all other jurors.\u201d <em>Powers, </em>499 U.S. at 410, 111 S.Ct. at 1370, 113 L.Ed.2d at 424-25. <em>See also J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 159, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 1437, 128 L.Ed.2d 89, 116 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing the majority for \u201cfocusing unrealistically upon individual exercises of the peremptory challenge,\u201d and arguing unsuccessfully in favor of a group-based equal protection analysis of sex-based peremptory strikes). Thus, in adopting the Supreme Court\u2019s equal protection analysis under <em>Batson </em>and its progeny and applying that reasoning in light of the ERA, our holding in <em>Tyler </em>flatly contradicts the equal application approach espoused by the majority in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. at 133, 716 A.2d at 1029, likewise was entirely consistent with the interpretation of the ERA as applicable to individuals. In <em>Giffin, </em>this Court faced the question whether Article 46 permitted a judge to weigh, as a relevant factor in a child custody proceeding, the sex of either parent in awarding physical custody. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 716 A.2d at 1034. We noted that, under the best interest of the child standard, the trial judge exercises broad discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 716 A.2d at 1035. That discretion is not unlimited, however; the judge cannot, consistent with the \u201cclear, unambiguous and unequivocal\u201d language of Article 46, <em>id. </em>at 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>716 A.2d at 1037, assume that a parent will be a better custodian of her child solely because she is of the same sex. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 716 A.2d at 1040. We said that \u201cthis Court has interpreted the Amendment\u2019s \u2018broad, sweeping mandatory language,\u2019 as the expression of Maryland\u2019s commitment to equal rights for men and women and the statement of its intention to alter traditional attitudes with respect to such rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 716 A.2d at 1038, quoting <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 515, 374 A.2d at 905 (citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201cthe equality between the sexes demanded by the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment focuses on \u2018rights\u2019 of <em>individuals </em>\u2018under the law,\u2019 which encompasses all forms of privileges, immunities, benefits and responsibilities of citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 716 A.2d at 1037, quoting <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 70, 501 A.2d at 825 (emphasis added). We applied this understanding of the ERA to invalidate a custody award based on whether a parent and the child were of the same or opposite sex, despite the fact that a sex-matched custody determination would satisfy the equal application approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In <em>Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 718 A.2d 1111 (1998), a candidate running for Maryland State Senate filed suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to strike the name of his opponent from the ballot on the basis of an alleged failure to satisfy the residency requirements. At issue was whether the incumbent, Senator Clarence W. Blount, could run for reelection in a district entirely in Baltimore City despite the fact that he spent some \u201c90 percent\u201d of his nights at a condominium maintained by his wife in Pikesville, Baltimore County. <em>Id. </em>at 375, 718 A.2d at 1119. This Court conducted a thorough analysis of the law of domicile in light of Article III, Section 9 of the Maryland Constitution,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> because our case law has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>construed \u201cresided\u201d to mean \u201cdomiciled.\u201d Blount, 351 Md. at 365, 718 A.2d at 1113. Although the domicile of Mrs. Blount was not directly at issue, this Court noted that \u201c[i]t is obvious that the general rule [that a married woman\u2019s domicile was determined by that of her husband regardless of her domiciliary intent] ... was overruled by Article 46.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385 n. 5, 718 A.2d at 1124 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Other cases have affirmed that strict scrutiny is the rule applied to state action that draws classifications on the basis of sex. <em>See Ehrlich v. Perez, </em>394 Md. 691, 717 n. 10, 908 A.2d 1220, 1236 n. 10 (2006) (\u201c \u2018[B]ecause of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Maryland Constitution ..., classifications based on gender are suspect and subject to strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 357 n. 7, 601 A.2d 102, 109 n. 7 (1992) (same); <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 366, 597 A.2d 432, 443 (1991) (sex-based discharge of State employee \u201cclearly not permitted\u201d by Article 46); <em>Briscoe v. Prince George\u2019s County Health Dept., </em>323 Md. 439, 452 n. 7, 593 A.2d 1109, 1115 n. 7 (1991) (\u201c[B]ecause of Article 46 ..., gender-based classifications are suspect and are subject to strict scrutiny. Consequently, a classification based on gender is in no way comparable to an employment classification based on different occupations.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">D. Other States Have Interpreted Similar Constitutional Provisions to Require Strict Scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Because it is settled law in Maryland that sex-based classifications implicate strict scrutiny under the ERA, <em>Burning Tree II, </em>315 Md. at 293-96, 554 A.2d at 386-87, the majority must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>look, as it does, to cases from our sister states that refuse to acknowledge the sex-based classifications inherent in their same-sex marriage prohibitions, thereby avoiding ERA scrutiny altogether. <em>See </em>op. at 265-67, 932 A.2d at 598-99. Several cases cited by the majority, however, were decided on grounds other than the ERA, and thus, are completely irrelevant to the question of the applicable standard of review under our ERA. Among these are <em>In re Kandu, </em>315 B.R. 123 (Bankr. W.D.Wash.2004) (decided under federal law); <em>Hernandez v. Robles, </em>7 N.Y.3d 338, 821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d 1 (2006) (no state ERA); <em>Baker v. Vermont, </em>170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864 (1999) (same); and <em>Baker v. Nelson, </em>291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In cases that actually applied some version of the ERA to sex-based classifications, courts have consistently adopted strict scrutiny as the proper analytical framework. For example, the Supreme Court of New Mexico considered whether the Secretary of the New Mexico Human Services Department could implement a regulation, Rule 766,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> restricting state reimbursement to abortion providers under the Medicaid program. <em>N.M. Right to Choose/NARAL v. Johnson, </em>126 N.M. 788, 975 P.2d 841 (1998). In 1995, the Department amended Rule 766 to restrict state funding of abortions to cases certified by a physician as necessary to save the life of the mother, to terminate an ectopic pregnancy,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> or in cases of rape or incest, <em>id. </em>at 846, whereas the previous version of the rule permitted state funding under a much broader definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of medical necessity that included any pregnancy having \u201ca profound negative impact upon the physical or mental health of an individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845. Because federal law prohibits reimbursement except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother, but permits states, at their own expense, to reimburse all \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortions, <em>id., </em>the plaintiffs argued that the New Mexico Constitution afforded greater protection than the federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The court interpreted the New Mexico ERA<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> as providing that enhanced protection, and that Rule 766 did not escape heightened scrutiny merely because it was based on a physical characteristic, the ability to become pregnant and bear children, unique to females. <em>Id. </em>at 851, 854-55. Because Rule 766 did not apply the same standard of medical necessity to both males and females, the rule was presumptively unconstitutional under the ERA, and the court found no compelling justification for the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 857. The court based its reasoning on the intent behind the enactment of the ERA; it cited <em>Ellis, </em>311 N.E.2d at 101, and <em>Darrin, </em>540 P.2d at 889, and adopted the same analysis, that the intent of the ERA was to \u201cprovid[e] something beyond that already afforded by the general language of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>N.M. Right to Choose, </em>975 P.2d at 851-52. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Based on our review of the text and history of our state constitution, we conclude that New Mexico\u2019s Equal Rights Amendment is a specific prohibition that provides a legal remedy for the invidious consequences of the gender-based discrimination that prevailed under the common law and civil law traditions that preceded it. As such, the Equal Rights Amendment requires a searching judicial inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>concerning state laws that employ gender-based classifications. This inquiry must begin from the premise that such classifications are presumptively unconstitutional, and it is the State\u2019s burden to rebut this presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Department argued that Rule 766 should not have been subjected to strict scrutiny because the classification at issue was based on a physical condition unique to one sex, and thus, males and females could not possibly be situated similarly with respect to that condition. <em>Id. </em>at 854. The court conceded that \u201cnot all classifications based on physical characteristics unique to one sex are instances of invidious discrimination,\u201d and thus, the presumptive unconstitutionality of such classifications is rebuttable. <em>Id. See </em>Brown, <em>supra </em>at 893. The court emphasized, however, that \u201csimilarly situated\u201d cannot mean simply that every member of the class possesses the classifying trait, because under that test, every classification would be reasonable. <em>N.M. Right to Choose, </em>975 P.2d at 854. <em>See </em>Joseph Tussman <em>&amp; </em>Jacobus tenBrock, <em>The Equal Protection of the Laws, </em>37 Cal. L.Rev. 341, 345 (1949). Instead, the court looked \u201c \u2018beyond the classification to the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.M. Right to Choose, </em>975 P.2d at 854, quoting Tussman <em>&amp; </em>tenBrock, <em>supra, </em>at 346. <em>Accord Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 100, 501 A.2d at 841 (\u201c[A]n inquiry into the actual facts, to determine the existence of a discriminatory purpose and impact, is appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Because the statutory purpose was to provide qualified persons with necessary medical care, the court found that men and women who met a general need-based test for Medicaid eligibility were similarly situated, <em>N.M. Right to Choose, </em>975 P.2d at 855, but that Rule 766 applied a different standard of medical necessity to women than to men. <em>Id. </em>at 856. The Department alleged two compelling interests, cost reduction and the protection of potential life, but the court found them self-contradictory and inadequate, <em>id. </em>at 856-57, and that Rule 766 was not narrowly tailored to achieving those interests. <em>Id. </em>at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In <em>Guard v. Jackson, </em>132 Wash.2d 660, 940 P.2d 642 (1997), the Supreme Court of Washington addressed the constitutionality of a wrongful death statute<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> that required a father to have provided regular contributions to the support of a deceased, illegitimate child as a prerequisite to have standing, but imposed no such requirement on the mother. The court applied the ERA to invalidate the statute, and to sever the support provision, affirming the decision of the intermediate appellate court. <em>Id. </em>at 645, <em>aff'g Guard v. Jackson, </em>83 Wash. App. 325, 921 P.2d 544 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The court contrasted its standard of review of sex-based classifications with the more lenient federal equal protection standard,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 643, and noted that under <em>Darrin </em>and the ERA, \u201c \u2018the equal protection/suspect classification test is replaced by the single criterion: Is the classification by sex discriminatory?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. Noting there had been few exceptions to the ERA-mandated prohibition of sex-based classifications, <em>id., </em>the court held that the sex-based classification in the wrongful death statute did not bear even a rational relationship to the statutory purpose of excluding as plaintiffs those parents who fail to support their children. <em>Id. </em>at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Supreme Court of Colorado applied \u201cthe closest judicial scrutiny\u201d under that state\u2019s ERA<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> to a sex-based classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>tion in <em>Colorado Civil Rights Commission v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>759 P.2d 1358, 1363 (Colo.1988). The case involved statutory and administrative prohibitions against sex discrimination, allegedly violated by an employer whose group health insurance excluded coverage for expenses incurred for normal pregnancy and childbirth. <em>Id. </em>at 1359. The insurer argued that the exclusion did not discriminate against women, because there was no risk from which men were protected but women were not; however, the court disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 1363. Instead, the court found discrimination because the insurance plan provided full coverage for men, including conditions for which men were uniquely susceptible, but did not cover pregnancy, a condition unique to women. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the argument that the health plan treated all pregnant people alike, and held that the definition of the recipient class was \u201cinherently discriminatory,\u201d because the classification excluded all women from reimbursement for the expenses associated with a physiological condition that affects only women. <em>Id. </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">E. <em>Singer v. Hora </em>and <em>Andersen v. King County </em>not Persuasive</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The majority in the present case considers a number of cases from our sister states as persuasive authority. <em>See </em>op. at 265-67, 932 A.2d at 598-99. As I have pointed out, many of these cases did not address the application of equal rights amendments. Of those that did, two are most significant: <em>Andersen v. King County, </em>158 Wash.2d 1, 138 P.3d 963 (2006), and <em>Singer v. Hara, </em>11 Wash.App. 247, 522 P.2d 1187 (1974). Because there have been close parallels between ERA jurisprudence in Maryland and Washington State, <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 95-96, 501 A.2d at 838-39; <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 512-15, 374 A.2d at 903-04, and because that State has interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>its ERA to be inapplicable to same-sex marriage, it is important to examine Washington case law in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Unlike in Maryland, there was a legal challenge to the statutory ban on same-sex marriages in Washington shortly after that State adopted its ERA. <em>Singer, 522 </em>P.2d at 1187. Two men who had been denied a marriage license sought a court order to compel a county official to issue the license, and when the trial court denied their motion to show cause why the license should not be issued, the men appealed on several grounds: first, they alleged the trial court erred in construing the statute to prohibit same-sex marriage; second, the appellants claimed that the marriage statute as applied violated the ERA; and third, the appellants claimed violations of the Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 1188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">During the relevant time period, the marriage statute stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Marriage is a civil contract which may be entered into by persons of the age of eighteen years, who are otherwise capable: <em>Provided, </em>That every marriage entered into in which either party shall not have attained the age of seventeen years shall be void except where this section has been waived by a superior court judge of the county in which the female resides on a showing of necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1189 n. 2; Wash. Rev.Code Section 26.04.010 (1970). The Court of Appeals of Washington interpreted the statute to prohibit same-sex marriage, relying in part on the plain language of the statute, which used the word \u201cfemale\u201d in singular form, thereby \u201cimplying that a male was contemplated as the other marriage partner,\u201d and relying also on the context provided by closely related statutes,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> which at several points referred explicitly to \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale.\u201d <em>Singer, </em>522 P.2d at 1189 &amp; n. 3. The appellate court then rejected the contention that the statute as applied violated the ERA. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>1190-95. The appellants argued that \u201cto construe state law to permit a man to marry a woman but at the same time to deny him the right to marry another man is to construct an unconstitutional classification \u2018on account of sex,\u2019 \u201d but the court agreed with the State\u2019s contention that \u201cso long as marriage licenses are denied equally to both male and female pairs,\u201d there was no ERA violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1190-91. The court determined that the definition of marriage was \u201cthe legal union of one man and one woman,\u201d and that, in previous cases, this definition \u201cwas deemed by the court in each case to be so obvious as not to require recitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191-92. The court then concluded that the appellants had been denied a marriage license \u201cbecause of the recognized definition of that relationship as one which may be entered into only by two persons who are members of the opposite sex,\u201d not \u201cbecause of their sex;\u201d thus, there <em>was no </em>sex-based classification. <em>Id. </em>at 1192. Therefore, in the court\u2019s view, <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. at 1, 87 S.Ct. at 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1010, and <em>Perez v. Lippold, </em>32 Cal.2d 711, 198 P.2d 17 (1948), the seminal cases invalidating anti-miscegenation statutes, were inapplicable. <em>Singer, </em>522 P.2d at 1192 n. 8 (maintaining that <em>Loving </em>and <em>Perez </em>\u201cdid not change the basic definition of marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman\u201d). Finally, the court applied rational basis review to affirm the trial court ruling on the federal constitutional issues. <em>Id. </em>at 1195-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">More recently, the Supreme Court of Washington was faced with the same question addressed in <em>Singer. </em>In <em>Andersen v. King County, </em>138 P.3d at 963, a challenge to the Washington Defense of Marriage Act (\u201cDOMA\u201d),<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the court considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>constitutionality of the same-sex marriage prohibition. The court followed the ERA analysis of the <em>Singer </em>court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4YN\">Men and women are treated identically under DOMA; neither may marry a person of the same sex. DOMA therefore does not make any \u201cclassification by sex,\u201d and it does not discriminate on account of sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 988, citing <em>Singer, </em>522 P.2d at 1195. In this respect, the <em>Andersen </em>court echoes the opinion of the majority in the instant case. <em>See </em>op. at 265-66, 932 A.2d at 599. The difficulty lies in the inability of the Andersen court to recognize the true nature of the classification at issue; by failing to distinguish between sex-based classifications and those grounded in sexual orientation, the court avoids application of the ERA at the outset. <em>Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 988 (denial of marriage license \u201cnot based on their sex but upon the fact they were both of the same sex\u201d), citing <em>Singer, </em>522 P.2d at 1195. Cf. op. at 277, 932 A.2d 605, (\u201cWhile Family Law \u00a7 2-201 does not draw a distinction based on sex, the legislation does differentiate implicitly on the basis of sexual preference.\u201d). In all significant respects, the Andersen court adopted the ERA analysis of Singer, and thus, makes the same errors. Furthermore, the majority in the present case adopts the analysis of Singer and Andersen, and therefore, adopts those errors as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In my view, the <em>Singer </em>court erred in two significant respects: first, the court misconstrued the nature of the classification established by the same-sex marriage prohibition; second, the court analyzed the impact of the classification scheme as it applied to <em>couples, </em>rather than to individuals, and cited no authority for so doing. The Washington same-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sex marriage prohibition <em>did </em>classify on grounds of sex, because a homosexual was <em>permitted </em>to marry a partner of the <em>opposite sex, </em>but was prohibited from marrying a partner of the <em>same </em>sex. Indeed, Wash. Rev.Code Section 26.04.010 (1970) as construed by the <em>Singer </em>court effected a classification scheme identical to that contained in Family Law Section 2-201 in the instant case. Therefore, the <em>Singer </em>court avoided the ERA question though an analytical error whereby the court failed to recognize that the definition of marriage <em>itself </em>was part of a sex-based classification scheme, and thus, the court analyzed the issue under an incorrect standard of review under its own state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">An interesting distinction may be drawn between <em>Singer </em>and the present case. Whereas the <em>Singer </em>court defined marriage as \u201cthe legal union of one man and one woman\u201d on the basis of case law and the overall context of the statutory scheme, 522 P.2d at 1191, the present case differs because the plain language of Section 2-201 draws a distinction between a marriage between a man and a woman, and marriages between two men or two women. Furthermore, Section 2-201 clearly contemplates the possibility of marriages between two men or two women, because it singles out for special treatment \u201conly\u201d those marriages between a man and a woman. Therefore, the language of Section 2-201 itself refutes the notion that the definition <em>of </em>marriage necessarily does not include same-sex marriages.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In its analysis of the impact of the same-sex marriage prohibition on the appellants, the <em>Singer </em>court implicitly adopted the separate but equal theory relied upon by the majority in the instant case. <em>Compare id. </em>(\u201c[T]he state suggests that appellants are not entitled to relief under the ERA because they have failed to make a showing that they are somehow being treated differently by the state than they would be if they were females. Appellants suggest, however, that the holdings in <em>[Loving, Perez </em>] and <em>J.S.K. Enterprises, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Inc. v. City of Lacey,[</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>are contrary to the position taken by the state. We disagree.\u201d), <em>with </em>op. at 264, 932 A.2d at 598 (\u201c[Family Law Section 2-201] prohibits equally both men and women from the same conduct.\u201d). Thus, the majority in the present case commits the same error as the <em>Singer </em>court: in order to find no sex-based classification in the same-sex marriage prohibition, both analyses compare the rights of a male <em>couple </em>to those of a female <em>couple.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The majority offers no principled basis for applying equal protection analysis to couples rather than to individuals, for the simple reason that there is no principled basis for the distinction. In order to get around this obstacle, the majority posits the notion that Family Law Section 2-201 is facially neutral, and hence, the proper test for evaluating whether sex discrimination has occurred is to search for a discriminatory purpose. <em>See </em>op. at 270-71, 932 A.2d at 601-02. Having determined, mistakenly in my view, that Section 2-201 does not classify on the basis of sex, the majority then reaches the conclusion that the purpose of the same-sex marriage prohibition cannot be linked to a \u201c \u2018designf ] to subordinate either men to women or women to men as a class.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>op. at 270, 932 A.2d at 601, quoting<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> <em>Hernandez v. Robles, </em>7 N.Y.3d 338, 821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d 1, 11 (2006). Having avoided the sex-based classification at issue, and having found no invidious purpose, the majority in the present case retreats to rational basis review. <em>See </em>op. at 260-65, 932 A.2d 595-98. In reaching this result, the majority breathes life into the corpse of separate but equal that this Court laid to rest in <em>Burning Tree II. </em>It saddens me to say that Judge Eldridge\u2019s worst fears have now come to fruition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">The principal purpose of this opinion is to respond to the positions taken in Parts YI-IX of Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>opinion announcing the judgment of the Court, even though that opinion is not an opinion of the Court.

On its face, Title 5, Subtitle 10 of the Family Law Article contemplated only the right of a man, found not genetically linked to a child, to petition a court to set aside a declaration of paternity.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We applied the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to infer a judicial gloss to a statutory scheme that was silent to the possibility that a gestational mother could challenge maternity. <em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 283-84, 923 A.2d at 121-22, 124-25. Our analysis focused on the unequal application of Subtitle 10 to a particular woman, and was not predicated on a group-by-group comparison. We held that the ERA mandated a focus on the unequal treatment of an individual under the law; just as the Supreme Court applied strict scrutiny to state-sanctioned discrimination against persons of all races on a purportedly equal basis, <em>Powers, </em>499 U.S. at 410, 111 S.Ct. at 1370, 113 L.Ed.2d at 425; <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 8, 87 S.Ct. at 1822, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1016,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> so too have we held that the equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>application of discriminatory laws does not preclude strict scrutiny under Article 46. <em>In re Roberto d.B., </em>399 Md. at 282-84, 923 A.2d at 124-25; <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 148-49, 716 A.2d at 1037; <em>Burning Tree II, </em>315 Md. at 293-95, 554 A.2d at 386-87; <em>Rand, 280 </em>Md. at 515-16, 374 A.2d at 904-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In the instant case, the State argues on the basis of the equal application theory of the ERA that Section 2-201 does not implicate Article 46. In its brief, the State points to the dissenting opinion of Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 64, 501 A.2d at 822, to support its view that Section 2-201 passes muster because its prohibitions burden both sexes equally. To bolster its argument, the State quotes from <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 149, 716 A.2d at 1037, which in turn cites the opinion of Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Burning Tree I. </em>The State omits the following key portion from Giffin: \u201c[T]he equality between the sexes demanded by the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment focuses on \u2018rights\u2019 of individuals \u2018under the law,\u2019 which encompasses all forms of privileges, immunities, benefits and responsibilities of citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the passage from <em>Giffin </em>does not support the State\u2019s argument; neither does the Court\u2019s holding in the case, as I explained previously. Furthermore, as I have explained in great detail, the opinion of Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Burning Tree I </em>was a minority view insofar as its theory of the scope and effect of the ERA was concerned. Therefore, the State\u2019s argument is fundamentally misplaced. Likewise, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Cannon v. Cannon, </em>384 Md. 537, 572 n. 19, 865 A.2d 563, 583 n. 19 (2005), is unpersuasive. Although <em>Cannon </em>was correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>about the inapplicability of the ERA to the confidential relationship and concomitant duty to disclose inhering in antenuptial agreements, the reason for the legally imposed duty arises out of fundamental principles of contract law. <em>Id. </em>at 556 n. 8, 570-71, 865 A.2d at 573 n. 8, 582-83 (contrasting antenuptial and post-marital agreements, and noting that the ERA invalidated gender-based classification only in the latter case).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">To summarize, in a long line of cases extending back to <em>G\u00e1ffin, Burning Tree I </em>and <em>II, Condore, Kline </em>and <em>Rand, </em>we have consistently interpreted the ERA to require that the rights of <em>any person </em>cannot depend on sex-based classifications, unless the State demonstrates a compelling governmental interest, and then only if the classification is narrowly tailored and precisely limited to achieving that compelling interest. Today this Court denies the commitment to equal rights made by the General Assembly and ratified by the People of this State in 1972. As we said in <em>Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 148-49, 716 A.2d at 1037, and iterated in <em>In re Roberto d.B., </em>399 Md. at 281, 923 A.2d at 123-24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201cThe basic principle of the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment, thus, is that sex is not a permissible factor in determining the legal rights of women, or men, so that <em>the treatment of any person by the law may not be based upon the circumstance that such person is of one sex or the other!;] </em>that amendment generally invalidates governmental action which imposes a burden on, or grants a benefit to, one sex but not the other one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">(emphasis added). Clearly, this language means that the analysis must focus on the <em>individual </em>whose rights are infringed by the sex-based classification, because rights accrue to the <em>individual, </em>not to couples, or to some abstract group entity. We emphasized that equal rights between the sexes are personal, not group, rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201c[T]he equality between the sexes demanded by the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment focuses on \u2018rights\u2019 of individuals \u2018under the law,\u2019 which encompasses all forms of privileges, immunities, benefits and responsibilities of citizens. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>As to these, the Maryland E.RA. absolutely forbids the determination of such \u2018rights,\u2019 as may be accorded by law, solely on the basis of one\u2019s sex, i.e., sex is an impermissible factor in making any such determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 923 A.2d at 124, quoting <em>Griffin, </em>351 Md. at 149, 716 A.2d at 1037 (alteration in original). The majority in the present case deliberately misconstrues the passage quoted above through selective quotation, conveniently omitting the second sentence, to support its narrowly constrained view of the ERA as somehow permitting separate but \u201cequal\u201d in matters of sex discrimination. <em>See </em>op. at 258-59, 932 A.2d at 594-95. Its strained interpretation ignores what until today had been well-settled in Maryland: the ERA is intended to address the rights of individuals, not the rights of \u201cmen and women <em>as classes.\u201d See op. </em>at 259, 932 A.2d at 595 (emphasis in original). Our predecessors stated a similar idea in <em>Rand, 280 </em>Md. at 511-12, 374 A.2d at 902-03:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">The words of the E.R.A. are clear and unambiguous; they say without equivocation that \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">I repeat: the words of the ERA are clear and unambiguous and can only mean that the rights of any person under the law cannot be abridged because of sex. The majority today pursues a results-based jurisprudence that distorts our case law construing the ERA, and in so doing, dilutes its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">II. The State\u2019s Arguments Against Applicability of Article 46</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The State focuses most of its argument against application of strict scrutiny to the same-sex marriage ban, and I address those arguments now. First, the State argues that the legislative history of Article 46 and Family Law Section 2-201 compels the conclusion that the same-sex marriage ban is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The State points to the voting records surrounding Article 46 of the Declaration of Rights and Section 1 of Article 62, Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), the predecessor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Family Law Section 2-201,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> to conclude that the framers of the ERA understood and intended that the same-sex marriage ban was compatible with the ERA. Thus, in 1972, House Bill 687, a measure to add the ERA to the Maryland Declaration of Rights, passed the House of Delegates by the overwhelming margin 120-1, <em>see </em>1972 Maryland House Journal 1281-82 (Mar. 22, 1972); the Senate voted 39-0 in favor. <em>See </em>1972 Maryland Senate Journal 1899 (Apr. 1, 1972). In 1973, the same legislature passed Senate Bill 122, a measure adopting the same-sex marriage ban. The measure passed the House by 112-1, <em>see </em>1973 Maryland House Journal 2743 (Apr. 1, 1973); the Senate voted 37-1 in favor. <em>See </em>1973 Maryland Senate Journal 273 (Jan. 24, 1973). Detailed comparison of the roll call votes indicates that 94 Delegates voted in favor of both measures; if Delegates who co-sponsored but did not vote for the ERA are included, then the total number of Delegates in favor of both the ERA and the same-sex marriage ban was 100 out of a total of 142.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Out of 43 Senators, 33 voted both for the ERA and the same-sex marriage ban. From these facts the State concludes that \u201cthose legislators who approved [the ERA] in 1972 did not see anything inconsistent about their decision in 1973 to vote for legislation clarifying that the State recognizes only a marriage between a man and a woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The difficulty with this argument is two-fold. First, the State offers no basis for distinguishing the situation involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the unconstitutional statute<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> enacted by the General Assembly in 1974 and invalidated in <em>Burning Tree I </em>from that which is presented here. Clearly Chapter 870, the discriminatory anti-discrimination provision in <em>Burning Tree I, </em>was nearly contemporaneous with Section 1 of Article 62 and Article 46; nevertheless, no one seriously contended that mere temporal nearness could save Chapter 870 from invalidation. The State is forced to combine the nearly contemporaneous enactment of the same-sex marriage ban and the ERA with the additional rule of constitutional interpretation elaborated in <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset County Board of Education, </em>295 Md. 597, 620, 458 A.2d 758, 770 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">In this regard, it has been held that a contemporaneous construction placed upon a particular provision of the Maryland Constitution by the legislature, acquiesced in and acted upon without ever having been questioned, followed continuously and uniformly from a very early period, furnishes a strong presumption that the intention is rightly interpreted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">I find this argument unpersuasive in the present context. The relevant time frame in the instant case extends only to 1972, not to \u201ca very early period,\u201d because \u201c[t]he adoption of the E.R.A. in this state was intended to, and did, drastically alter traditional views of the validity of sex-based classifications.\u201d <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 515-16, 374 A.2d at 905. Therefore, the undeniable fact that marriage has always been recognized only between a man and a woman, although undoubtedly \u201cacquiesced in and acted upon without ever having been questioned, followed continuously and uniformly from a very early period,\u201d carries no greater legal weight in light of the ERA than the multitude of sex-based common law rules and presumptions that have been invalidated since 1972. <em>See, e.g., Giffin, </em>351 Md. at 133, 716 A.2d at 1029; <em>Condore, </em>289 Md. at 516, 425 A.2d at 1011; <em>Kline, </em>287 Md. at 585, 414 A.2d at 929; <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 508, 374 A.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In a related vein, the State argues that the plain meaning of Article 46 and the case law interpreting it foreclose the interpretation given by the Appellees and adopted by the Circuit Court, that Family Law Section 2-201 classifies on the basis of sex. In the State\u2019s view, Section 2-201 is facially neutral and simply does not constitute sex discrimination. The State\u2019s argument focuses on discrimination based on sexual orientation, a classification indisputably within the scope of Section 2-201. Relying on the statutory scheme established by the Commission on Human Relations, Article 49B, Maryland Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), as amended, 2001 Maryland Laws, Chapter 340,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> the State maintains that the General Assembly has demonstrated repeatedly its ability to distinguish \u201csex\u201d from \u201csexual orientation,\u201d and because Article 46 is silent on \u201csexual orientation,\u201d the logical conclusion is that Family Law Section 2-201 was never intended to fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>inside the scope of Article 46. The majority adopts this interpretation, stating that \u201c[t]o accept [Appellees\u2019] contention that Family Law \u00a7 2-201 discriminates on the basis of sex would be to extend the reach of the ERA beyond the scope intended by the Maryland General Assembly and the State\u2019s voters who enacted and ratified, respectively, the amendment.\u201d <em>See </em>op. at 264-65, 932 A.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">This argument is entirely irrelevant to the question of constitutionality of sex-based classifications under Article 46 and hence, is a classic red herring. Although the majority asserts that Family Law Section 2-201 draws classifications based on sexual orientation, on its face the statute actually classifies on the basis of sex, not sexual orientation. Section 2-201 does not prohibit homosexuals from marrying; in fact, a homosexual male may marry either a heterosexual or homosexual female, and a homosexual female may marry either a heterosexual or homosexual male. Only by virtue of a person\u2019s sex is he or she prohibited from marrying a person of the same sex. Clearly, Section 2-201 draws distinctions based on sex and thus, the issue of sexual orientation simply does not enter into an ERA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The Appellees in the present ease allege that Section 2-201 has a discriminatory effect, regardless of its alleged facial neutrality, and that the landmark Supreme Court decision in <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 1, 87 S.Ct. at 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1010, should control the outcome here. <em>Loving </em>involved the State assertion of an analogous allegedly neutral, generally applicable statute prohibiting miscegenation. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 87 S.Ct. at 1818, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1012. The Court applied strict scrutiny to the Virginia statute despite its ostensibly equal application to both races. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 87 S.Ct. at 1822, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1016 (\u201cIn the case at bar, ... we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.\u201d). Not only did the Court weigh the long history of white supremacy and racial segregation heavily against the State, but the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>found the anti-miscegenation statute applied only to interracial marriages involving whites, and thus, was not facially neutral as asserted by Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 87 S.Ct. at 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1017-18. The Court reached its holding independently of the issue of discriminatory intent, however, \u201cfind[ing] the racial classifications in these statutes repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, even assuming an even-handed state purpose to protect the \u2018integrity\u2019 of all races.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 n. 11, 87 S.Ct. at 1823 n. 11, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1018 n. 11. Clearly, the Court found no legitimate purpose in the racial classifications themselves, regardless of the proffered justification. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 87 S.Ct. at 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1017 (\u201cThere is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The State attempts to distinguish <em>Loving </em>from the instant case on the basis that the same-sex marriage ban does not evince the intent to impose segregation based on sex. The State\u2019s position is reinforced by <em>amici, </em>The Maryland Catholic Conference, who argue that \u201canti-miscegenation statutes were intended to keep persons of <em>different </em>races <em>separate; </em>marriage statutes, on the other hand, are intended to bring persons of the <em>opposite </em>sex <em>together.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). This argument begs the question whether Family Law Section 2-201 is facially neutral; it is well-settled that the question of discriminatory intent does not arise unless the threshold question of facial neutrality is answered in the affirmative. <em>See, e.g., Hunt v. Cromartie, </em>526 U.S. 541, 546, 119 S.Ct. 1545, 1549, 143 L.Ed.2d 731, 738 (1999) (\u201cWhen racial classifications are explicit, no inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary.\u201d); <em>Shaw v. Reno, </em>509 U.S. 630, 642, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2824, 125 L.Ed.2d 511, 525 (1993) (\u201cNo inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary when the racial classification appears on the face of the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Here, there is no plausible assertion that Section 2-201 accrues only to the benefit of either men or women as a class. Just as in <em>Rand, Kline, Condore, Burning Tree I </em>and <em>Giffm, </em>however, there is sex discrimination at the level of the <em>individual </em>who wishes to marry but is precluded from doing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>because of the statute. Thus, a man who wishes to marry another man is prevented from choosing his marriage partner purely on the basis of sex; likewise, a woman who wishes to marry another woman is prevented from choosing her marriage partner purely on the basis of sex. Manifestly, Section 2-201 classifies on the basis of sex; because it would be necessary to consider the underlying legislative intent only if the same-sex marriage ban did not draw sex-based distinctions, the question of legislative intent is irrelevant. Just as in <em>Loving, </em>it is the <em>nature of the classifications themselves </em>that implicates strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">III. Application of the Correct Standard to the Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I turn now to consider whether Family Law Section 2-201 (\u201cOnly a marriage between a man and a woman is valid in this State.\u201d), survives strict scrutiny. A statutory classification will be upheld under strict scrutiny only if it \u201cfurther[s] a compelling state interest,\u201d and \u201cif it is deemed to be suitably, or narrowly, tailored\u201d to achieving that goal. <em>Koshko v. Earning, </em>398 Md. 404, 438, 921 A.2d 171, 191 (2007); <em>Burning Tree E, </em>315 Md. at 296, 554 A.2d at 387; <em>Hornbeck, </em>295 Md. at 641, 458 A.2d at 781. Regardless of the strength of the governmental interest at stake, statutory classifications subject to strict scrutiny must \u201c \u2018 \u201cfit\u201d this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate ... prejudice or stereotype.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

One point of attack by opponents of equal rights for women has been to emphasize the limitations of the analogy between race and sex classifications; equal rights opponents have distinguished racial discrimination from sex-based discrimination on the basis of the inherent differences between the sexes. <em>See Brown, supra </em>at 893-96. <em>See also United States v.

Evolution of the law in this area has been, in no small measure, a process of sifting truly substantial gender differences from distinctions that masquerade as such but in reality merely embody \u201ctraditional, often inaccurate, assumptions about the proper roles of men and women.\u201d <em>Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, </em>458 U.S. 718, 726, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 3337, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090, 1099 (1982). The movement among the several states to enact equal rights amendments was motivated, in part, to counteract the tendency of courts to extend deference to sexual stereotypes cloaked as truly substantial differences. Brown, <em>supra </em>at 879-82. There can be no doubt that Marylanders overwhelmingly adopted this approach through enactment of the ERA. <em>See Rand, </em>280 Md. at 515-16, 374 A.2d at 904-05 (\u201c[W]e believe ... the people of Maryland are fully committed to equal rights for men and women.

For example, the ERA has been interpreted to permit separate bathrooms for each sex in public accommodations, <em>id. </em>at 98 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8, 501 A.2d at 840 &amp; n. 8, and rape statutes that punish only men. <em>Brooks v.

Barger, </em>191 Colo. 152, 550 P.2d 1281 (1976); <em>Green, </em>514 P.2d at 770. Chief Judge Murphy suggested, if anything, an even narrower construction of the \u201cinherent differences\u201d exception to strict scrutiny. <em>See Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 64 n. 3, 501 A.2d at 822 n. 3 (\u201cDisparate treatment on account of physical characteristics unique to one sex is generally regarded as beyond the reach of equal rights amendments.\u201d). <em>Accord </em>Brown, <em>supra </em>at 893 (\u201cThe fundamental legal principle underlying the Equal Rights Amendment, then, is that the law must deal with particular attributes of individuals, not with a classification based on the broad and impermissible attribute of sex. This principle, however, does not preclude legislation (or other official action) which regulates, takes into account, or otherwise deals with a physical characteristic unique to one sex.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The implications of the \u201cinherent differences\u201d between males and females for the present case are unclear. There would appear to be a colorable argument that traditional marriage arose out of an inchoate recognition that reproduction of our species and thus, the very future existence of society, is inextricably linked to the state interest in promoting the formation of stable, nurturing families beginning with the intimate sexual union of a man and a woman. <em>Fomshill v. Murray, </em>1 Bland 479, 481 (1828) (\u201cMarriage has been considered among all nations as the most important contract into which individuals can enter, <em>as the parent not the child of civil society.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">With regard to narrow tailoring, the <em>Burning Tree </em>cases themselves illustrate the concept through its exact opposite. The anti-discrimination provision invalidated in <em>Burning Tree II, </em>for instance, \u201cpermitted] a club to engage in periodic sex discrimination in any of its facilities for any reason at all\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>consequently, the statute failed the narrow tailoring requirement. 315 Md. at 296, 554 A.2d at 387. The touchstone of narrow tailoring is whether, when faced with \u201cother, reasonable ways to achieve [its] goals with a lesser burden on constitutionally protected activity,\u201d the State has rejected \u201cthe way of greater interference\u201d and chosen instead the least burdensome means to further its interest. <em>Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 343, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1003, 31 L.Ed.2d 274, 285 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">It is critical to bear in mind the allocation of burdens under the various equal protection review standards. Regardless of the applicable standard, the plaintiff always bears the initial burden of production, just as in any other civil cause. Under rational basis review, the plaintiff also shoulders the burden of persuasion, because rational basis review presumes the validity of the challenged classification. <em>See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320-21, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 2643, 125 L.Ed.2d 257, 271 (1993) (\u201cA State, moreover, has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification____A statute is presumed constitutional, and \u2018[t]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,\u2019 whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\u201d) (citations omitted) (alteration in original). Under both intermediate and strict scrutiny, on the other hand, the <em>government </em>has the burden of justifying the challenged classifications. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. California, </em>543 U.S. 499, 505, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 1146, 160 L.Ed.2d 949, 958 (2005) (\u201cUnder strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that racial classifications \u2018are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc., </em>515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2113, 132 L.Ed.2d at 182; <em>United States v.

The policy of promoting uniformity is not confined to our statutory law; our cases are replete with instances where we look to our sister states for guidance in interpreting our own common law. <em>See, e.g., Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 66-70, 95-98, 501 A.2d at 823-25, 838-40. The examples illustrating the point are literally too numerous to mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The fundamental difficulty with the State\u2019s argument, however, is that it has pointed to no case, nor am I aware of a single case, where this Court has held that the desire to conform our laws to those of other jurisdictions rises to the level of a <em>compelling </em>interest. Indeed, the State\u2019s position inverts the fundamental legal hierarchy, because the values embodied in the Maryland Constitution take precedence over every Act of the General Assembly. The only recognized exception, inapplicable to the present case, is where our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>organic law conflicts with the U.S. Constitution itself. <em>Romer v. Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (state constitutional amendment prohibiting any governmental action to afford protection to homosexuals held violation of Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause); <em>Hunter, </em>471 U.S. at 227, 233, 105 S.Ct. at 1919-20, 85 L.Ed.2d at 227-28, 231 (facially neutral state constitutional provision disenfranchising disproportionate numbers of African-Americans held in violation of Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The State\u2019s argument that there is \u201ca compelling interest in ensuring that social and economic change of this type is accomplished through a robust public debate, through the legislative process\u201d is wholly without merit. If we were to accept this argument, we would be ignoring the fact that \u201crobust public debate\u201d resulted in the adoption of the ERA. Moreover, the lone Maryland case cited by the State pertaining to legislative deference, <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Gudis, </em>319 Md. 558, 573 A.2d 1325 (1990), is easily distinguished from the instant case, because that case dealt with a county ethics law purporting to confer authority on a court to void legislation whenever it thought the public interest so required, which we determined violated the constitutional separation of powers mandated by Article 8 <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> of the Declaration of Rights. Here we deal with a constitutional challenge to legislative action; our authority to construe the Maryland Constitution is mandated by Article IV, Section 1<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> of our Constitution. <em>See Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 611, 781 A.2d 851, 858 (2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>(\u201cIf, however, a statute violates a \u2018mandatory provision\u2019 of the Constitution, \u2018we are required to declare such an act unconstitutional and void.\u2019 \u201d). This proposition has been well-settled since the earliest days of our statehood; one year before <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), Chief Judge Jeremiah Townley Chase of the Maryland General Court stated the doctrine of judicial review in terms that still ring true today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">The power of determining finally on the validity of the acts of the Legislature cannot reside with the Legislature, because such power would defeat and render nugatory, all the limitations and restrictions on the authority of the Legislature, contained in the Bill of Rights and form of government, and they would become judges of the validity of their own acts, which would establish a despotism, and subvert that great principle of the Constitution, which declares that the powers of making, judging, and executing the law, shall be separate and distinct from each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">It is the office and province of the Court to decide all questions of law which are judicially brought before them, according to the established mode of proceeding, and to determine whether an Act of the Legislature, which assumes the appearance of a law, and is clothed with the garb of authority, is made pursuant to the power vested by the Constitution in the Legislature; for if it is not the result of emanation of authority derived from the Constitution, it is not law, and cannot influence the judgment of the Court in the decision of the question before them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Whittington v. Polk, </em>1 H. &amp; J. 236, <em>243-44 (1802).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The final argument posed by the State is the public\u2019s \u201cdirect interest\u201d in marriage \u201cas an institution of transcendent importance to social welfare.\u201d <em>Picarella v. Picarella, 20 </em>Md.App. 499, 504, 316 A.2d 826, 830 (1974), citing to, inter alia, <em>Fomshill, 1 </em>Bland at 479. Indeed, in <em>Fomshill </em>our predecessors expressed the view that \u201c[mjarriage has been considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>among all nations as the most important contract into which individuals can enter, as the parent not the child of civil society.\u201d 1 Bland at 481. Thus, it has been recognized from time immemorial that marriage preceded its legal recognition; i.e., marriage originated as an organic constituent of society that predated the development of the legal system. Undoubtedly, until the recent advances in assisted reproductive technology, there was a close albeit imperfect fit between opposite-sex marriage and the inherent biological fact that reproduction of our species could result only from the sexual union of a man and a woman. \u201cWhat had not been fathomed exists today,\u201d however. <em>In re Roberto d.B., </em>399 Md. at 279, 923 A.2d at 122. The correspondence between opposite-sex marriage and biological necessity has never been more tenuous than it is today. What had always been an imperfect fit between marriage and procreation<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> is now called into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Although infertility is not a bar to marriage, it is nonetheless true that traditional marriage remains the <em>only </em>way to create families in which children are biologically related to <em>both </em>parents. Certainly it is true that opposite-sex couples can and do cohabit and produce offspring and thus create nontraditional families, but that very fact points to the substantiality of the state interest: the State asserts a strong interest in encouraging opposite-sex couples to formally recognize their child-bearing unions. The difficulty faced by the State is that this interest has been posed and defended successfully only under the deferential rational basis standard. <em>See, e.g., Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 982-83; <em>Hernandez, </em>821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d at 7. Likewise, the argument that the State has an interest in promoting marriage between opposite-sex couples because their <em>careless </em>sexual unions pose a significant possibility of creating offspring and all the attendant burdens and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>duties, whereas same-sex couples cannot reproduce without extensive, expensive outside intervention that evinces a far greater level of responsibility and commitment, has been upheld only under rational basis scrutiny. <em>Morrison v. Sadler, </em>821 N.E.2d 15, 24-25 (Ind.Ct.App.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Appellees assert a number of reasons why Section <em>2-</em>201 does not even <em>rationally </em>further a legitimate governmental interest, and thus purport to refute any compelling interest presented by the State on the theory that failure to survive the most deferential test obviously implies failure under strict scrutiny. Logically that theory is unassailable as far as it goes, but the Appellees do not address a crucial underlying assumption: in order to dispose of the opponent\u2019s arguments, it is necessary in the first instance actually to address each opposing argument. Many of the arguments disposed of in the Appellees\u2019 brief almost certainly would fail under the strict scrutiny mandated under Article 46. Thus, arguments that the same-sex marriage ban promotes cost savings or that the ban is justified on grounds of \u201clegislative hegemony\u201d obviously fail strict scrutiny. Indeed, such assertions approach the level of straw man arguments, a status undoubtedly applicable to the supposed state interest in \u201cdiscrimination for its own sake.\u201d The Appellees also dispute the notion that the same-sex marriage ban rationally furthers a legitimate state interest in child welfare; here the Appellees stand on shakier ground, and quite possibly would fail to sustain their burden <em>if the standard were rational basis review. </em>However, the correct standard is strict scrutiny, a much greater burden for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Let us assume arguendo that the State has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that there exist no \u201cother, reasonable ways\u201d posing \u201ca lesser burden on constitutionally protected activity,\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>405 U.S. at 343, 92 S.Ct. at 1003, 31 L.Ed.2d at 285, to further the undoubtedly substantial state interest in promoting child welfare. At this stage there still remains the possibility that the Appellees are wrong in their assertion that there is no causal link between judicial recognition of same-sex marriage and the behavior of opposite-sex couples, an argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ment asserted with particular force by <em>amici, </em>The American Center for Law &amp; Justice. The phenomena of assisted reproduction and same-sex marriage are so new and radical that there exists no evidence thus far to support or refute the asserted link and its concomitant external effects. Thus far, courts that have weighed this argument favorably have done so under rational basis review. <em>See, e.g., Hernandez, </em>821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d at 7-8; <em>Andersen, </em>138 P.3d at 983, 984. The State\u2019s contention that the same-sex marriage ban arises organically from the nature of marriage itself, and that the much later codification accomplished by Section 2-201 merely clarifies society\u2019s compelling interest in \u201cthe historic family unit as a mechanism for protecting the progeny of biological unions,\u201d actually asserts the state interest in promoting an orderly, stable society. <em>See Goodridge v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941, 997 <em>&amp; </em>n. 20 (2003) (Cordy, J., dissenting) (\u201cTt is important to distinguish the individual interests in domestic relations from the social interest in the family and marriage as social institutions.\u2019 \u201d).

It, therefore, is clear that an equal application approach cannot render constitutional a discriminatory sex-based classification any more than it could do so for a discriminatory race-based classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">To justify its rejection of the enhanced standard of review, strict scrutiny, that this Court has applied to the review of gender-based classifications, the majority dismisses, an undisputed but extensive history of pervasive prejudice and discrimination targeted at homosexuals. <em>Conaway v.

The fact is that Maryland has not adopted, and it may safely be said, is not on the verge of adopting, a comprehensive statewide domestic partnership scheme for same-sex couples that approximates the institution of civil marriage, and thereby confers upon such couples the approximate rights and responsibilities of married heterosexual couples. Moreover, the laudable, though piecemeal, civil advances that the majority references and on which it relies, <em>id. </em>at 291-92, 932 A.2d at 614-15, occurred because marriage has remained an exclusive benefit of heterosexuality. <em>See In Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 512, 801 A.2d 148, 158 (2002) (upholding local law granting benefits to the domestic partners of its employees by virtue of holding that such law does not implicate Maryland\u2019s marriage laws). Thus, the conditioning of advances that benefit same-sex couples on the limitation that homosexuals shall not acquire the right to marry belies any argument that the right to marry, or its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>functional equivalent, is imminent, or likely to be, not to mention, inevitable, for same-sex couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In any event, a due process analysis requires that we reach a different result than the majority does. The majority determines that same-sex marriage is not deeply rooted in this State or in the United States, and, therefore, does not implicate a fundamental liberty interest. 401 Md. at 296-310, 932 A.2d at 617-26. That determination, however, only recognizes and gives voice and substance to an undisputed prejudice and objection\u2014against and to homosexuality\u2014that is not legally cognizable; it does not address, never mind resolve, the real issue. Chief Judge Kaye made this point, in addition to identifying the real issue, in <em>Hernandez v. Robles, </em>7 N.Y.3d 338, 821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d 1, 27 (2006) (Kaye, C.J., dissenting). There, the New York Court of Appeals framed the issue, as the majority in this case has done, as whether \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d is deeply rooted in tradition, and concluded, again as the majority does here, that such marriages are not. Noting that\u201c[f]undamental rights are those \u2018which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition ... and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 770, 855 N.E.2d at 23, quoting <em>Washington v.

Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986), which had upheld a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy. In doing so, the <em>Lawrence </em>court criticized <em>Bowers </em>for framing the issue presented too narrowly. Declaring that <em>\u2018Bowers </em>was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today\u2019 (539 U.S. at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472), <em>Lawrence </em>explained that <em>Bowers </em>purported to analyze erroneously-whether the Constitution conferred a \u2018fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy\u2019 (539 U.S. at 566, 123 S.Ct. 2472 [citation omitted]). This was, however, the wrong question. The fundamental right at issue, properly framed, was the right to engage in private consensual sexual conduct-a right that applied to both homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. In narrowing the claimed liberty interest to embody the very exclusion being challenged, <em>Bowers </em>\u2018disclose[d] the Court\u2019s own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake\u2019 <em>(Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 567, 123 S.Ct. 2472).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\"><em>Hernandez, </em>821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d at 23. (Kaye, C.J., dissenting). What Chief Judge Kaye next said applies with equal force to the case <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201cThe same failure is evident here. An asserted liberty interest is not to be characterized so narrowly as to make inevitable the conclusion that the claimed right could not be fundamental because historically it has been denied to those who now seek to exercise it <em>{see Planned Parenthood of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Southeastern Pa. v.

But such a view would be inconsistent with our law\u2019]).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 770, 855 N.E.2d at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">It is clear to me that the majority misapprehends the nature of the liberty at issue in this case. It is not whether a same-sex marriage, with all the pejorative emotions that evokes, is a fundamental right; the real issue in this case, when properly framed, is whether <em>marriage </em>is a fundamental right. The issue has already been resolved; indeed, we all agree that it has been answered in the affirmative and the right is firmly established. <em>See Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967) (holding unconstitutional statutes that prohibit interracial marriage); <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) (concluding that state requirement that indigent individuals pay court fees to obtain divorce unconstitutionally burdened the fundamental right to marry); <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978) (determining that states cannot require individuals with child support obligations to obtain court approval in order to marry); <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (holding that inmates could not be denied the right to marry).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The right to marry, encompassing as it does the related and critically important element of choice\u2014the freedom to choose whom to marry, to select the \u201clucky\u201d person\u2014is not inherently party-centric. Neither is it either hetero\u2014or homo\u2014sexual. I agree with Chief Judge Kaye, to construe the right to marry as narrowly as does the majority, <em>i.e., </em>based on sexual orientation, makes inevitable the conclusion that this fundamental right, by virtue of historical prejudice, does not exist for same-sex couples. <em>See Hernandez, </em>821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d at 24. (Kaye, C.J., dissenting) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">As Chief Judge Kaye observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u201cthe result in <em>Lawrence </em>was not affected by the fact, acknowledged by the Court, that there had been no long history of tolerance for homosexuality. Rather, in holding that \u2018[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for the [] purpose [of making intimate and personal choices], just as heterosexual persons do.\u2019 <em>Lawrence </em>rejected the notion that fundamental rights it had already identified could be restricted based on traditional assumptions about who should be permitted their protection. As the Court noted, \u2018times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper only served to oppress.\u2019 As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom\u201d <em>(Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 579, 123 S.Ct. 2472; see also <em>id. </em>at 572, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472 [\u2018(h)istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry....\u2019]; <em>Cleburne v.

Consequently, the reasoning of <em>Loving </em>requires rejection of the petitioners\u2019 argument. <em>Hernandez, </em>821 N.Y.S.2d 770, 855 N.E.2d at 24-25, 26, (Kaye, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>C.J., dissenting) (citing and quoting Brief of NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., as amicus curiae in support of plaintiffs).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">Finally,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201c[i]t is no answer that same-sex couples can be excluded from marriage because \u2018marriage,\u2019 by definition, does not include them.
