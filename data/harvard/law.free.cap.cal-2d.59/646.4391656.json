The committee recommended that the conduct proscribed by section 647 be labeled \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d instead of \u201cvagrancy,\u201d and that the individual misdemeanors be redefined in terms of acts instead of status (e.g., \u201cengages in any act of prostitution\u201d instead of \u2018\u2018common prostitute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">With regard to subdivision (f), the committee quoted Professor Sherry, the draftsman of the bill, to the effect that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cThis provision . . . would fill the gap left by the decision in <em>Newbern </em>by providing a uniform, definite standard for police control of the public drunk who is a nuisance to others and a danger to himself. \u2019 \u2019 (Assembly Interim Committee Reports 1959-61, Vol. 22, No. 1, p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In view of the language of section 647, subdivision (f), of the Penal Code and the circumstances surrounding its enactment, it is clear that the Legislature intended to preempt the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Defendant was found lying in an intoxicated condition, partially behind some rubbish cans, on a private driveway exposed to public view. Respondent argues that such a place is not a \u201cpublic place,\u201d within the meaning of section 647, subdivision (f) of the Penal Code, and that it was therefore proper to prosecute him under the city ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">It is immaterial for us to decide here whether such a driveway is a \u201cpublic place,\u201d within the meaning of section 647, subdivision (f), of the Penal Code, because, in any event, it is a \u201cplace . . . exposed to public view\u201d; and the Legislature has by implication provided that intoxication in a place which is not a public place but is exposed to public view should not be criminal. This follows from the fact that in subdivision (a) of section 647 of the Penal Code, enacted at the same time as subdivision (f) of that section, the Legislature specifically prohibited \u201clewd or dissolute conduct in any public place or in any place open to the public or exposed to public, view, \u2019 \u2019 and in subdivision (e) prohibited begging in \u201cany public place or in any place open to the public, \u2019 \u2019 and then in subdivision (f) prohibited intoxication only in a \u201cpublic place.\u201d (Cf. <em>In re Lane, </em>58 Cal.2d 99, 104 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 373 P.2d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Accordingly, a city ordinance attempting to make certain acts pertaining to intoxication in a public place criminal is in conflict with- the state law and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">\u25a0 Defendant is discharged from custody in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Gibson, C.J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., and Peek, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
