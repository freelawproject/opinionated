De La 0, hereinafter called petitioner, attacks the constitutionality of the mentioned section and, generally, of chapters 11 and 12, title 7, of part III of the Penal Code. (\u00a7\u00a7 6400-6555, added by Stats. 1961, eh. 850, pp. 2223 et seq.) After analysis of the subject statute we have concluded that petitioner\u2019s contentions in this respect are not well taken, that he has not established a right to be released from custody, and that the order to show cause should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Incidentally, we resolve in favor of petitioner his secondary contention that he is entitled to appellate review of the order of the superior court committing him to the California Rehabilitation Center. This determination, however, does not require that the writ of habeas corpus issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Petitioner was charged by criminal complaint in the municipal court with a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11721 <em>(post, </em>fn. 3), a misdemeanor, in that on a particular date \u201cin the City of Pasadena, County of Los Angeles, State of California\u201d he \u201cdid wilfully and unlawfully use and be addicted to the unlawful use of narcotics. . . .\u201d Petitioner waived jury trial; he was found guilty as charged, and a motion for new trial was denied. Thereafter that court on its own motion suspended proceedings in the criminal action over which it had jurisdiction, and certified petitioner to the superior court for proceedings therein pursuant to Penal Code section 6450.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ment imposing imprisonment, fine, or other penal sanction has been entered in the criminal ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The superior court conducted a hearing and examination in accordance with the terms of Penal Code section 6450 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 1). Petitioner was represented by counsel and evidence was received. Two physicians who had examined petitioner gave as their opinion that he was a narcotic addict, and recommended that he be committed to the California Rehabilitation Center. Their recommendation was based (1) on physical examination of petitioner which indicated in their opinion that \u201che was using a drug of the opium series at the time of the examination or shortly used prior to that time\u201d and (2) on the history petitioner gave them that \u201cHeroin started 1943. His maximum use of Heroin has been one and a half grams [a day]. Average use is one gram. He has also used Cocaine and opium.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing the superior court made appropriate findings and entered an order adjudging petitioner to be \u201ca narcotic addict within the meaning of Section 6450 of the Penal Code\u201d and committing him to the custody of the Director of Corrections \u201cfor placement as provided for by law, for a period of five years, except as earlier discharge is provided for by law.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s demand for a jury trial in the superior court on the issue of addiction was denied. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality of chapters 11 and 12, title 7, of part III of the Penal Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">Petitioner contends that the subject statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6450, and related sections) is unconstitutional because (1) it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>provides criminal penalties for an illness\u2014narcotics addiction\u2014thus imposing cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758] ; (2) it denies him a jury trial in the superior court on the issue of addiction while granting the opportunity to demand such a trial to other misdemeanants, thus depriving him of equal protection of the laws; and (3) its operative terms are vague and indefinite. We shall consider these contentions severally in the order stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em>Asserted Imposition of Cruel and Unusual Punishment. </em>In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758], the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional as there applied the provision of Health and Safety Code section 11721 making it a criminal offense to \u201cbe addicted to the use of narcotics.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The precise language of the subject holding is as follows (at pp. 1420-1421 [2] of 82 S. Ct.) : \u201cWe hold that a state law which <em>imprisons </em>a person thus afflicted <em>as a criminal, </em>even though he has never touched any narcotic drug <em>within the State </em>or been guilty of any irregular behavior <em>there, </em>inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d (Italics added.) Yet in that decision (at p. 1419 of 82 S. Ct.) the high court recognized \u201cThe broad power of a State to regulate the narcotic drugs traffic <em>within its borders\u201d </em>(italics added), and observed that \u201cSuch regulation, it can be assumed, could take a variety of valid forms. A State might impose criminal sanctions, for example, against the unauthorized manufacture, prescription, sale, purchase, or possession of narcotics within its borders. In the interest of discouraging the violation of such laws, or in the interest of the general health or welfare of its inhabitants, a State might establish <em>a program of compul</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>sory treatment </em>for those addicted to narcotics!<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such a program of treatment might require <em>periods of involuntary confinement. </em>And <em>penal sanctions </em>might be imposed for failure to comply with established <em>compulsory treatment </em>procedures.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We recognize at once that an essential part of the procedural foundation for petitioner\u2019s current restraint is Ms conviction of violating Health and Safety Code section 11721. We note also that petitioner\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d or \u201cchronic condition\u201d of being (in California) unlawfully \u201caddicted to the use of narcotics\u201d (see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 1420, 8 L.Ed.2d 758]) is considered to constitute a sufficient ground for conviction of violating section 11721 and therefore to prima facie establish the status of eligibility for initiation of the procedures contemplated by Penal Code section 6450. The case at bench, however, differs from <em>Robinson </em>in these, among other, vital respects: (1) no judgment of conviction of violating Health and Safety Code section 11721 has here been entered; (2) petitioner is not being held under any penal sanction\u2014 rather, the criminal action is suspended; and (3) he is being held under involuntary restraint for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation procedures as provided by Penal Code section 6450.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The issue is whether the statutory scheme here challenged (a)' \u201cimprisons\u201d petitioner \u201cas a criminal,\u201d or (b) constitutes \u201ccompulsory treatment\u201d of petitioner as a sick person requiring \u201cperiods of involuntary confinement.\u201d If the former, it would be unconstitutional under <em>Robinson </em>as cruel and unusual punishment (U.S. Const., 8th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art I, \u00a7 6); if the latter, it would be valid under the same decision as a constitutionally permissible exercise of the state\u2019s power to regulate the narcotic drug traffic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The criteria by which this issue is to be determined, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ever, are not so easily defined. In <em>Robinson </em>little difficulty was experienced by the majority in holding on the issues then before them that Health and Safety Code section 11721 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 3) imposed criminal penalties, in view of that statute\u2019s provision that any person \u201cconvicted\u201d of a violation thereof \u201cis guilty of a misdemeanor\u201d and shall be \u201csentenced to serve\u201d a term of \u201cnot less than 90 days nor more than one year in the county jail.\u201d No such provision appears in the measure (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6450) under which petitioner is currently restrained. Rather, analysis of the present statute\u2014its origin, purpose, terms, operation, and effect\u2014discloses not just one but a number of factors to be considered in this connection, of varying relevance and weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">1. To begin with, we observe that the Legislature placed the subject statute in title 7 (\u201cAdministration of the State Correctional System\u201d) of part III (\u201cOf Imprisonment and the Death Penalty\u201d) of the Penal Code. It is contended that this choice of code setting evidences a legislative intent to treat as a penal sanction the confinement under which petitioner is held. But while there may be some significance in the Legislature\u2019s choice of codification in the Penal Code rather than, for example, the Welfare and Institutions Code, the particular divisional headings used carry little weight in view of the express declaration (Pen. Code, \u00a7 10004) that \u201cDivision, chapter, article, and section headings contained herein shall not be deemed to govern, limit, modify or in any manner affect the scope, meaning or intent of the provisions of any division, chapter, article or section hereof.\u201d (See <em>In re Halcomb </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 126, 130 [3] [130 P.2d 384].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">2. Nor is much guidance to be found in the general statutory definitions. Penal Code section 17 declares in part that \u201cA felony is a crime which is punishable ... by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d Section 1202a provides in part that \u2018 If the judgment is for imprisonment in the State prison the judgment shall direct that the defendant be delivered into the custody of the Director of Corrections at the State prison. ...\u201d On this basis it is argued that a person committed under Penal Code section 6450 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 1) is actually undergoing imprisonment in a state prison for a felony because he has been delivered \u201cinto the custody of the Director of Corrections.\u201d The fault in such inverse logic is apparent: it does not follow from section 1202a that <em>all </em>persons who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>delivered \u201cinto the custody of the Director of Corrections\u201d are necessarily defendants under a judgment of imprisonment in a state prison, or that the confinement is a penal restraint.  Similarly, there appears to be no compelling force in the argument that petitioner should be deemed confined in a penal institution because of the language of Penal Code section 6082, which provides: \u201cReferences in this title [i.e., title 7, which now includes the statute under attack] ... to prisons refer to all facilities, camps, hospitals and institutions for the confinement, treatment, employment, training and discipline of persons in the legal custody of the Department of Corrections.\u201d There is no reference to \u201cprison\u201d in the subject statute; and it would distort the general definitional purpose of section 6082, which was enacted in 1944, to squeeze from it a legislative intent to treat and operate as a penal institution the special facility (California Rehabilitation Center) set up 17 years later for the rehabilitation of narcotics addicts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The latter facility, moreover, is not among those listed as a prison by the Legislature in chapter 1 (\u201cEstablishment of State Prisons\u201d), title 1, of part III of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">3. Petitioner next stresses the fact that he is committed under the subject statute \u201cto the custody of the Director of Corrections\u201d (\u00a7 6450) and is confined in the California Rehabilitation Center, \u201can institution . . . under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections\u201d (\u00a7 6550). We note also that the statute creating the California Rehabilitation Center vests considerable authority for its management in the Director of Corrections.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is contended that such authority is incompatible with the concept of nonpenal confinement. An examination of that portion of the statute creating the California Rehabilitation Center (ch. 12, tit. 7, pt. III, comprising \u00a7\u00a7 6550-6555) reveals, however, that it is closely modelled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the statute which set up the California Medical Facility at Vacaville (ch. 8, tit. 7, pt. III, comprising \u00a7\u00a7 6100-6106).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have recently observed <em>(In re Cathey </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 679, 690 [9] [12 Cal.Rptr. 762, 361 P.2d 426]) that \u201cThe California Medical Facility at Vacaville indubitably is \u2018a state hospital for the care and treatment of [persons specified in \u00a7 6102, including those who are \u201c4. Addicted to the use of narcotics\u201d) ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Nor should we deem controlling the fact that the California Rehabilitation Center is not placed under the jurisdiction of, for example, the Director of Mental Hygiene. Other instances of civil commitment to institutions under the jurisdiction of the Director of Corrections are easily found in the codes. Thus, in the Sexual Psychopathy Law it is expressly provided that \u201cThe Director of Mental Hygiene, <em>with the approval of the Director of Corrections </em>and the Director of Finance, may provide on the grounds of <em>a state institution or institutions under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections </em>or the Department of Mental Hygiene one or more institutional units to be used for the custodial care and treatment of sexual psychopaths. <em>Each such unit shall be administered in the manner provided by law for the government of the institution in which such unit is established.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5518.) Under that provision a person committed as a sexual psychopath\u2014originally in the custody of the Director of Mental Hygiene\u2014is not being punished but nevertheless may find himself \u201cin San Quentin, possibly for life\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Levy </em>(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 460, 468 [5] [311 P.2d 897]). Yet such confinement is constitutionally permissible (see <em>Minnesota </em>ex rel. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Probate Court </em>(1940) 309 U.S. 270, 274-276 [60 S.Ct. 523, 84 L.Ed. 744, 126 A.L.R. 530]), and we have repeatedly held that \u201cSexual psychopathy proceedings are not criminal actions but special proceedings of a civil nature.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gross </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 859, 860 [1] [285 P.2d 630] ; accord, <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 816, 820 [2] [270 P.2d 1025] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howerton </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 217, 219 [3] [253 P.2d 8]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCracken </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 336, 344 [4a]-346 [4b] [246 P.2d 913].) Similarly, even under the admittedly civil proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ings of the Habit-Forming Drug Addicts Law in the Welfare and Institutions Code (div. 6, pt. 1. eh. 3, art. 2), a person \u201cso far addicted to the intemperate use of habit forming drugs ... as to have lost the power of self-control\u201d may legally be \u2018 \u2018 confined in a regional jail camp maintained by the Department of Corrections\u201d <em>(id., </em>5404) ; yet such jail camps are established and operated by, and subject to the rules and regulations of, the Director of Corrections (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a76300-6302).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"> 4. Petitioner stresses the fact that his commitment is for a minimum of six months (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6403) and a maximum of five years (\u00a7 6450, <em>ante, </em>fn. 1; see also \u00a7 6506, which provides the same maximum in cases of persons not charged with crime, including (as provided in \u00a7 6500) \u201cany person who believes himself to be addicted or about to become addicted [to the unlawful use of narcotics] \u2019 \u2019 and who therefore reports his belief to the designated officer). It is argued that neither the minimum nor the maximum is in any way related to the treatment or rehabilitation of the addict as a sick person, and hence that these requirements show a legislative intent to imprison the addict as a criminal. While superficially appealing, the argument does not withstand analysis in the light of the facts of narcotics addiction and rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">First, there is medical evidence that the addict will benefit from a minimum period of confinement and control during which he is deprived of narcotics, thus permitting the withdrawal symptoms to run their course and alleviate at least his physiological dependence on drugs. In recognition of this fact, the Legislature has long provided for just such a minimum term of confinement under the Narcotic Drug Addicts Law of the Welfare and Institutions Code (div. 6, pt. 1, ch. 3, art. 1, esp. \u00a7\u00a7 5355, 5355.7, and 5360)\u2014the provisions of which were characterized as \u201ccivil procedures\u201d by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 1419, 8 L.Ed.2d 758], footnote 7 (see also <em>id. </em>at p. 1426 of 82 S.Ct. [concurring opinion of Douglas, J.]). Once it is conceded that <em>some </em>minimum period of confinement of the narcotics addict is constitutionally permissible, the precise length of that period is largely a matter for the reasonable judgment of the Legislature. Here that period is fixed at six months. It is true that the above cited provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code (\u00a7\u00a7 5355 et geq.) fix the period at three months, but the Legislature is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>allowed some leeway in translating into exact figures such medically imprecise concepts as the minimum beneficial term of confinement. Indeed, these same Welfare and Institutions Code provisions originally fixed the minimum at eight months (see former \u00a7 5355, based on Stats. 1927, eh. 89, \u00a7 3, p. 150); and at the federal narcotics hospitals at Lexington and Fort Worth the recommended minimum period of confinement believed necessary for rehabilitation is four to six months (see Drug Addiction: Crime or Disease? (Interim and Final Reports of the Joint Committee of the American Bar Association and the American Medical Association on Narcotic Drugs) (1961), Appendix A, p. 87; Winick, <em>Narcotics Addiction and Its Treatment </em>(1957), 22 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 9, 23-24, quoted in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 1424, 8 L.Ed.2d 758] [concurring opinion]). In the circumstances, the Legislature\u2019s choice of the figure of six months does not appear to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Second, the fact that a maximum of five years is placed on the term of confinement does not make it any the less a confinement that is essentially for an indeterminate period. Bach of the relevant sections of the subject statute provides that the addict shall be committed for the fixed period \u201cexcept as this chapter permits earlier discharge.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6450, 6451, 6506.) The proviso refers, of course, to the procedures set up for parole (\u00a7 6403) and subsequent discharge from the program (\u00a7 6520). Similarly indeterminate commitments are authorized for narcotic drug addicts confined under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5355 (\u201cfor an indeterminate period of not less than three months nor more than two years\u201d) ;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and indeterminate commitments without fixed maximum terms are provided for mentally ill persons <em>(id. </em>\u00a75100), sexual psychopaths <em>(id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5512, 5518), and defective or psychopathic delinquents <em>(id. </em>\u00a77058). Thus the use of the device of indeterminate commitment in the subject statute appears neither novel nor invalid per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">For our purposes the crucial question on this phase of the case is whether there may be judicial review of the</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>administrative decision as to when an \u201cearlier discharge\u201d shall be permitted. The subject statute makes no express provision for judicial review\u2014but neither is there such a provision in the Welfare and Institutions Code procedure for the commitment of narcotic drug addicts (see, e.g., Welf. <em>&amp; </em>Inst. Code, \u00a7 5355.7). It is true that a person committed under the latter procedure may assert the general right to a writ of habeas corpus granted to all patients in state mental hospitals by Welfare and Institutions Code section 6620.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet that right flows not from the enactment of section 6620 but from the basic constitutional guarantee that \u201cThe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended. . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. <em>2; </em>Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 5.) <em>A </em>person committed under the subject statute as a narcotics addict is equally entitled to assert his constitutional right to a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the fact of his addiction or imminent danger of addiction. Thus, in <em>In re Goldie </em>(1917) 35 Cal.App. 341 [169 P. 925], a woman committed to a state hospital as a narcotics addict under the Habit-Forming Drug Addicts Law (former Pol. Code, \u00a7 2185c, now Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, div. 6, pt. 1, ch. 3, art. 2) sought discharge on habeas corpus on the ground that she had entirely recovered from the use of narcotics. The appellate court reviewed the provisions of former Political Code section 2189 (now Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6725 et seq.) and concluded that \u201cThe Legislature has either intentionally or inadvertently failed to provide that a person committed for excessive use of narcotics, when claiming to be recovered and is refused a discharge by the superintendent of the hospital, may have this question of fact determined by the method prescribed for the insane in [Pol. Code] section 2189. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u201cIt follows that as the statute has given the petitioner no specific remedy for having the question of her recovery determined, the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is open to her.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 343.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>When the indeterminate commitment aspect of the subject statute is thus viewed in its proper light, there is obviously no merit in petitioner\u2019s further contention that he has been \u201csentenced to serve five years\u201d for a misdemeanor in violation of Penal Code section 19a (one-year maximum for misdemeanors) .</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">5. It will be observed, however, that whereas the maximum period of confinement of a person committed under Penal Code section 6450 (such as petitioner here) is five years, that maximum is fixed at ten years in the case of one committed under section 6451 (applicable to a defendant convicted of \u201cany crime in any superior court\u201d). It is contended that this longer maximum term for felons can be justified only as a penal sanction. But \u201cIt is generally accepted that addiction is largely the result of personal inadequacy, emotional instability, and social maladjustment.\u201d (Eldridge, Narcotics and The Law (1962), p. 123.) As the author points out <em>(ibid., </em>fn. 3), \u201cSuch causal factors actually play a large part in most criminal activity.\u201d If a principal cause of narcotics addiction is the psycho-social maladjustment of the user, and if a person convicted of a felony tends to suffer from greater psycho-social maladjustment than one convicted of a misdemeanor, then it would not seem unreasonable to expect that a longer period of readjustment and rehabilitation may be necessary for the felon-addict than for the misdemeanant-addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">6. Petitioner also emphasizes the language of Penal Code section 6401, which declares that \u201cEvery person confined pursuant to this chapter [i.e., ch. 11, comprising \u00a7\u00a7 6400-6521] shall be deemed a prisoner committed to a state prison for the purposes of the laws punishing escape.\u201d Yet while the choice of words may be significant, it is the stated purpose of this purely definitional provision that should control. If the success of the addict\u2019s rehabilitation depends, at least in the early stages, on isolating him from access to illegal narcotics, it would not seem unreasonable to provide a strong deterrent against his attempting to escape during that period. The use of criminal penalties for this purpose may be found in other, admittedly civil, procedures such as the Sexual Psychopath Law (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5522) and the Defective or Psychopathic Delinquents Law <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 7069), and is constitutionally permissible under <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>1417, 1419, 8 L.Ed.2d 758] [\u201cpenal sanctions might be imposed for failure to comply with established compulsory treatment procedures\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">7. We stated hereinabove that confinement under the subject statute is essentially for an indeterminate period in view of the procedures set up for parole (\u00a76403) and discharge (\u00a7 6520).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is contended that a legislative intent to treat petitioner\u2019s confinement as a penal sanction is demonstrated by the fact that the subject statute vests primary discretion for the granting of paroles and the recommending of discharges in the Adult Authority, the agency empowered to grant paroles and fix sentences for persons \u201ccommitted to a state prison\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 5077). As to parole, however, a careful reading of the statute shows that while it provides (and reasonably so) that persons paroled thereunder are \u201csubject to being retaken and reconfined in the same manner as other parolees are retaken,\u201d it does <em>not; </em>require that the rules and regulations under which parole is administered be the same as those enforced in cases of parole from state prison (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3052, 3053).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, section 6404 of the subject statute provides for such specific parole rules as \u201cperiodic and surprise testing for narcotic use,\u201d \u201ccounseling,\u201d \u201creturn- to <em>inpatient </em>status\u201d at the California Rehabilitation Center if relapse occurs, and the establishment \"of \u201ca halfway house in a large metropolitan area as a pilot project in order to determine the effectiveness of such control upon the addict\u2019s rehabilitation, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>upon his release from the narcotic detention and treatment facility.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These rules appear to be designed to meet the particular needs of an addict in the later stages of the process of rehabilitation rather than to evidence a legislative intent that the prior confinement constitute a penal sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">As to discharge from the program, the principal complaint appears to be that the statute (\u00a76520) provides that \u201cIn any case where the criminal charges are not dismissed [after discharge] and the defendant is sentenced thereon, time served while under commitment pursuant to Article 2 of this chapter [i.e., \u00a7\u00a7 6450-6454] shall be credited on such sentence.\u201d It is argued that this provision is significant, since similar credit for time served is not allowed to the rehabilitated sexual psychopath who is required to serve a penal term after discharge from the custody of the Director of Mental Hygiene. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5517, 5518, 5519.) The argument lacks persuasive force; if anything, the provision in question discloses a humane concern for the realities of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Some of the foregoing provisions of the subject statute, as has been shown, have arguably \u201ccriminal\u201d overtones\u2014 although in virtually each instance similar provisions may be found in the civil commitment procedures of the Welfare and Institutions Code. We turn now to provisions of the subject statute which can only be viewed as civil in nature, purpose, and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">1. At the outset of the statute, section 6400 declares its legislative purpose: \u201cThe narcotic detention, treatment and rehabilitation facility referred to herein shall be one within the Department of Corrections <em>whose principal purpose shall be the receiving, segregation, confinement, employment, education, treatment and rehabilitation of persons </em>under custody of the Department of Corrections or any agency thereof <em>who are or have been addicted to narcotics or who by reason of repeated use of narcotics are in imminent danger of becoming </em>addicted.\u201d (Italics added.) An identical declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion of purpose is made in chapter 12 (\u00a7 6551), which sets up the California Rehabilitation Center.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">2. The commitment procedures do not involve trial by jury as in criminal cases, but rather incorporate the special civil procedures of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 6450 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 1) provides that \u201cProceedings shall be conducted in substantial compliance with Sections 5353, 5053, 5054, and 5055 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d Section 5353 of the latter code is part of the Narcotic Drug Addicts Law characterized by the United States Supreme Court <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 1419, fn. 7, 8 L.Ed.2d 758]) as civil in nature. Sections 5053, 5054, and 5055 of the Welfare and Institutions Code are part of the general commitment provisions for mentally ill persons (div. 6, pt. 1, ch. 1), and are also incorporated by reference in the Narcotic Drug Addicts Law (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5354). Taken together, these sections ensure that the constitutional rights of the person to be committed are protected. They provide, for example, that he (1) shall be taken before a judge and informed of his rights, (2) shall be given, ample opportunity to produce witnesses in his behalf and compel their attendance by subpoena, including at least two medical examiners, (3) shall be personally present at the hearing in open court, and (4) shall have court-appointed counsel if he is financially unable to employ counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">3. Similar commitment steps are spelled out in article 3 of the subject statute (\u00a7 6500-6505), dealing with persons not charged with a crime. Of particular interest here is the provision whereby <em>voluntary self-commitment </em>proceedings may be instituted by \u201cany person who believes himself to be addicted or about to become addicted\u201d (\u00a7 6500).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">4. The certificate of medical examiners here filed pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5055, as well as the subsequent order of commitment of the superior court, is entitled \u201cThe People of the State of California <em>For the Best Interest and Protection of Society and [the person to be </em>committed] . . ., An Alleged Narcotic Drug Addict.\u201d (Italics added.) (Compare Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5050.1, 5100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">5. Also significant in this connection is the provision of the subject statute (\u00a7 6452) declaring ineligible for the program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>all persons who have previously been convicted of specified crimes of violence or serious narcotics offenses. Similar legislative concern to avoid custodial problems in a state hospital is reflected in Welfare and Institutions Code section 5355, which provides that a narcotic drug addict shall not be committed if, <em>inter alia, </em>he is shown to be \u201cof bad repute or bad character\u201d (see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5404) ; and compare section 6451 of the subject statute, which provides in part that proceedings for the commitment of a person convicted of crime in a superior court shall not be instituted if \u201cin the opinion of the judge the defendant\u2019s record and probation report indicate such a pattern of criminality that he does not constitute a fit subject for commitment under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">6. Implementing the latter provisions is section 6453 of the statute, which requires the person committed to be returned to court if at any time it is determined that he \u201cis not a fit subject for confinement or treatment in such narcotic detention, treatment and rehabilitation facility\u201d (see also \u00a7 6509).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">7. It is also to be observed that section 6405 of the subject statute declares that \u201cThe Director of the Department of Corrections shall engage in a program of research in the detention, treatment and rehabilitation of narcotic addicts.\u201d (Compare Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5650-5653, providing for \u201cresearch into the causes and cures of sexual deviation.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Finally, petitioner makes various allegations concerning the actual conditions of his confinement, e.g., (1) that he was processed through the Reception Guidance Center at Chino; (2) that his fingerprints and photographs were taken and he was ordered to shave off his moustache; and (3) that his mail is censored and he is restricted in the number of letters he may send and the visitors he may have. In their return to the order to show cause the People admit most of these allegations but explain (1) that petitioner was processed \u201cin a special unit\u201d of the Reception Guidance Center set aside for persons committed under the subject statute to the California Rehabilitation Center; (2) that the fingerprinting, photographing, and shaving were done \u201cfor purposes of identification and to prevent the concealment of his identification\u201d; and (3) that petitioner\u2019s mail is censored and his visitors restricted \u201cfor the purpose of preventing the introduction or arrangements for the introduction of narcotics into the Rehabilitation Center.\u201d (Compare Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 7502, which empowers the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Mental Hygiene to \u201cmake such regulations in regard to the correspondence of the inmates in custody in [state hospitals] as in its judgment will promote their interests.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The conclusional allegation is also made that \u201cTo petitioner\u2019s knowledge, DB LA 0 is being incarcerated and treated in the same manner as if he were a felon.\u201d It appears, however, that the branch of the California Rehabilitation Center where petitioner is confined<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is physically and administratively distinct from the other facilities at Chino and consists of 16 buildings including dormitories, gymnasium, mess hall, academic and vocational buildings, and others; that the California Rehabilitation Center employs a full-time psychiatrist and professionally trained counselors and therapists;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that petitioner is given daily group therapy and twice weekly intensive therapy in small units of not more than 15 men, all under the direction of trained counselors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, the California Rehabilitation Center provides a specially selected vocational and academic program.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">It is appropriate here to draw some conclusions.  From the declarations of purpose and other provisions discussed hereinabove it appears that in enacting the subject statute the Legislature intended to create a new program for the confinement (which in truth is a quarantine rather than penal sanction), treatment, and rehabilitation of narcotics addicts. Why was a new statutory scheme necessary, in view of the existing civil procedures of the Narcotic Drug Addicts Law (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5350-5361) ? An answer is provided by the Special Study Commission on Nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>cot\u00edes, which reported to the Legislature in 1961 that \u201cAlthough the law [i.e., Well. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5351, 5355] clearly provides that <em>any addict </em>may be committed to a state hospital for treatment after a hearing, the Department of Mental Hygiene is presently accepting only persons who voluntarily request such a commitment. All requests for civil commitments from law enforcement officers, relatives, or other persons interested in trying to help an addict receive treatment are refused.\u201d (Italics in original.) (Final Report of the Special Study Commission on Narcotics (1961), p. 21.) The reason for this disuse of existing procedures was stated to be a lack of sufficient facilities in which to carry out a proper program of rehabilitation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To remedy this lack the commission recommended the establishment of separate hospital facilities in the Department of Mental Hygiene with an adequate number of trained personnel to give proper care and treatment to persons civilly committed as narcotics addicts. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 22-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The Legislature, as has been shown, created in response a program and an institution designed to achieve these goals, but then placed them under the direction and control of the Director of Corrections and codified the new statutory scheme in the Penal Code. The introduction of these external indicia of criminality was, in our view, both unnecessary and unfortunate, as they may well constitute those aspects of the program which are most resented by the persons committed (who should be explicitly designated as patients, without indicia of criminality) and most noticed by others on their return to society, thus producing a possibly negative effect on the chances of success. Mindful, however, of our duty to uphold every legislative enactment unless it is in any event palpably obnoxious to the Constitution, we are of the opinion that the demonstrably civil purpose, mechanism, and operation of the program outweigh its external \u201ccriminal\u201d indicia, and hence that petitioner\u2019s commitment and confinement thereunder do not constitute cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>unusual punishment within the meaning of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758],</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions require only brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Asserted Denial of Equal Protection of the Laws. </em>Penal Code section 6450 provides further that \u201cIf a person committed pursuant to this section, after conviction of a misdemeanor <em>other than a violation of Section 11721 of the Health and Safety Code, </em>is dissatisfied with the order of the court, he may demand a hearing by a judge or jury in substantial compliance with the provisions of Section 5125 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (It will be remembered that the basis for the certification in this case was conviction in the municipal court of a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11721.) Petitioner first contends that the above quoted provision of Penal Code section 6450 deprives him of his constitutional right to jury trial (U.S. Const., 6th amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a77). But certification to the superior court requires that the judge in the municipal court \u201cshall adjourn the [criminal] proceedings [in this case, under Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11721] or suspend the imposition of the sentence\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6450). Thus, after certification, no criminal action is being prosecuted against the defendant, and he has already had the right to a jury trial in the criminal action. The commitment procedures set up by the subject statute are in the nature of special civil proceedings unknown to the common law, and hence there is no right to jury trial unless it is given by the statute. This court has held, for example, that the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury does not extend to a person committed under the special civil procedures of the Habit-Forming Drug Addicts Law in (now) the Welfare and Institutions Code. <em>(In re Liggett </em>(1921) 187 Cal. 428, 430 [2] [202 P. 660].)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Petitioner also contends that in denying him (and all persons convicted under Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11721) a jury trial in the superior court on the issue of addiction while granting the opportunity to demand such a trial to other misdemeanants, the statute deprives him of equal protection of the laws (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 11; art. IV, \u00a7 25, el. 2). The People seek to justify this classification by arguing that as Health and Safety Code section 11721 prohibits unlawfully using or being under the influence of or being \u201caddicted to the use of narcotics\u2019' <em>(ante, </em>fn. 3), the Legislature could reasonably deny a second trial to those who have already had an opportunity to litigate the issue of addiction before a jury in the municipal court. Petitioner was charged with unlawful use of <em>and </em>addiction to narcotics; he waived jury trial and was found guilty as charged. He points out that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d Supp. 858, 862 [5] [331 P.2d 251], it was held that a conviction under a charge of unlawful use <em>and </em>addiction is sustained \u201cif the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of guilty of <em>any one </em>of the acts denounced by the statute\u201d (italics added) ; he urges, therefore, that his conviction of violating Health and Safety Code section 11721 cannot be given res judicata effect on the issue of addiction for the purposes of the subject statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The contention in the circumstances here is immaterial. There is no occasion to emphasize <em>Williams, </em>as that ease does no more than recognize the plain language of the statute (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11721) that \u201cAny person convicted of violating <em>any provision </em>of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, the evidence is sufficient to support conviction if it shows that the person charged did within the territorial limits of the court\u2019s jurisdiction (see generally, as relevant to the subject prosecution, Pen. Code, \u00a7 777) commit any of the forbidden acts. The forbidden acts are to \u201cuse, or be under the influence of, or be addicted to the use of narcotics, excepting when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State to prescribe and administer narcotics. \u2019 \u2019 These acts or conditions are important (for the procedures contemplated by Penal Code section 6450) simply as being preliminarily or tentatively indicative of a condition of the defendant; i.e., a condition which appears to be primarily one of illness rather than criminality. The existence of at least one of the conditions defined by section 11721 is necessarily established by the verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u201cguilty,\u201d whether rendered by the municipal or justice court jury or by the judge when trial by jury is wavied.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">But it is not the verdict of guilty which establishes the defendant\u2019s <em>right </em>or <em>liability </em>to the remedial procedures of Penal Code section 6450. The verdict of guilty (if not set aside, or if the action is not suspended) renders the defendant liable to penal sentence for the misdemeanor. It does not give him a right to have the criminal proceeding suspended without imposition of sentence. But it does give both him and the State a right to have the municipal or justice court judge, in the exercise of discretion, determine whether \u201cit appears to [such judge] . . . that the defendant may be addicted or by reason of repeated use of narcotics may be in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics\u201d; and if the <em>judge </em>concludes that such condition does so appear to him then the duty which devolves upon him is mandatory: \u201csuch judge <em>shall </em>adjourn the proceedings or suspend the imposition of the sentence and certify the defendant to the superior court. \u2019 \u2019 (Italics added.) (Pen. Code, \u00a76450). That action saves the defendant (at least potentially) from any penal sanction for the act or condition with which he was penally charged, and thereafter the proceedings are held in the superior court and are civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Obviously, one who has been convicted of violating (in California) Health and Safety Code section 11721, on any tenable interpretation of its language, has at least demonstrated some history of illegal narcotics use. As a basis for consideration for the civil and remedial procedures delineated by section 6450, conviction of any violation of section 11721 is sufficient. These benefits are potentially open to all persons on the same tests, and there is no denial here of equal protection of the law. Any conviction of violating section 11721 necessarily determines that the defendant charged did in California at the relevant time \u201cwilfully and unlawfully use\u201d or \u201cbe under the influence of, or be addicted to the [unlawful] use\u201d of narcotics. The procedures defined by section 6450 are not intended as a punishment for unlawful use or condition; by contrast, they are provided as a remedy or curative treatment for one who \u201cis a narcotic drug addict, or by reason of repeated use of narcotics is in imminent danger of becoming addicted thereto, and is not ineligible for the program. . . .\u201d (As mentioned, <em>ante, </em>section 6452 declares ineligible all persons who have theretofore been convicted of certain crimes of violence or serious narcotics offenses.) In the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>stances petitioner fails to show that the line drawn by the Legislature is \u201cpalpably arbitrary and beyond rational doubt erroneous\u201d <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 365, 371 [1] [310 P.2d 7]).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Asserted Vagueness of Statute. </em>Petitioner also complains that the subject statute is \u201cvague and indefinite,\u201d presumably with reference to the operative terms, \u201caddict\u201d and \u201cimminent danger of becoming addicted.\u201d Section 6407 declares that \u201c \u2018Narcotic addict\u2019 as used in this chapter refers to any person, whether adult or minor, who is addicted to the unlawful use of any narcotic as defined in Division 10 of the Health and Safety Code, except marijuana. \u2019 \u2019 No more refined definition is constitutionally required. Neither \u201caddicted to\u201d nor \u201cimminent danger of becoming addicted\u201d are technical terms of art.  Words used in a statute are ordinarily to be construed according to the context and \u201cthe approved usage of the language\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a713), and \u201ca statute is sufficiently certain if it employs words of long usage or with a common law meaning, \u2018 notwithstanding an element of degree in the definition as to which estimates might differ\u2019 \u201d (Loren<em>son </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 49, 60 [8] [216 P.2d 859]).  Under these rules similar language of section 23105 of the Vehicle Code (\u201cIt is unlawful for any person who is <em>addicted to </em>the use ... of narcotic drugs ... to drive a vehicle upon any highway\u201d) has recently been held to have a commonly understood meaning<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and hence to be sufficiently certain to comply with due process requirements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kimbley </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 300, 303 [l]-307 [10] [11 Cal.Rptr. 519].) The same reasoning applies to the equally nontechnical phrase, \u201cimminent danger of becoming addicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Denial of Appellate Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Petitioner contends that he was wrongfully denied appellate review of (1) his conviction in the municipal court and (2) the superior court\u2019s order committing him to the California Rehabilitation Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\"><em>The Municipal Court Conviction. </em>On April 5, 1962, petitioner was found guilty in the municipal court of the charged violation of Health and Safety Code section 11721. The matter was continued from time to time until May 15, when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>motion for new trial was made and denied. The matter was again continued until May 22, when the municipal court on its own motion suspended the criminal proceedings and certified petitioner to the superior court pursuant to Penal Code section 6450 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 1). On the same day (May 22) petitioner, by his attorney, filed in the municipal court a notice of appeal from the \u201cdenial of motion for new trial\u201d and from the \u201corder certifying [petitioner] to superior court.\u201d On May 29 the hearing and examination provided under section 6450 was held in the superior court and petitioner was ordered committed to the custody of the Director of Corrections pursuant to that statute. On June 6 a certified copy of such superior court proceedings and order of commitment was filed in the municipal court, and on June 21 \u201cAll papers on appeal\u201d on file in the municipal court were transmitted to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On June 25 the appellate department of the superior court, on its own motion, issued an order directing petitioner to show cause \u201cwhy his appeal should not be dismissed\u201d on the grounds \u201c (1) that the appeal from the order denying a new trial was premature, it having been filed before the defendant was committed to the Director of Corrections (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Baul, </em>202 Cal.App.2d Supp. 877 [20 Cal.Rptr. 925]; and (2) that no appeal lies from the order certifying the defendant to the Superior Court. (Penal Code \u00a7 1466.) \u201d A copy of this order to show cause was mailed on the same day (June 25) to petitioner\u2019s attorney of record. The order was returnable on July 12. On July 16 the appellate department made and entered an order reciting that its order to show cause \u201chaving been submitted without argument, written or oral,\u201d petitioner\u2019s appeal was dismissed for the reasons set forth in the text of the order to show cause (quoted herein-above).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The order of the municipal court certifying petitioner to the superior court for further proceedings pursuant to section 6450 was a nonappealable interlocutory order, and hence petitioner\u2019s purported appeal therefrom was properly dismissed.  The municipal court\u2019s order denying his motion for new trial <em>was </em>appealable under Penal Code section 1466, subdivision 2 (e) ;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but, as held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Baul</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>(1962), <em>supra, </em>202 Cal.App.2d Supp. 877, 878 [1], under the latter statute it appears that an appeal may be taken from an order denying a motion for new trial in the present type of ease <em>only when </em>the defendant has in fact been \u2018 committed before final judgment\u201d as a narcotics addict. This construction of Penal Code section 1466 is supported by the relevant rules of court. Rule 182 prescribes generally that an appeal to the appellate department is taken by filing written notice of appeal \u201cwithin 10 days after the rendition of\u201d the judgment or order appealed from; but to preserve the right of appeal in eases where the superior court\u2019s order of commitment is entered more than 10 days after the municipal court\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial, rule 182 further provides by way of exception that \u201can appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial in cases where the defendant is committed before final judgment for sexual psychopathy, insanity, or narcotics addiction <em>may he taken within 10 days after </em>the making of such order <em>or </em>the defendant\u2019s commitment, <em>whichever is later.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The purpose of the requirement that the defendant actually be committed before filing his notice of appeal is, manifestly, to avoid the preparation of unnecessary records, as the superior court judge might well find that \u201cthe defendant is not a narcotic drug addict and is not in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics,\u201d in which event the judge must \u201cso certify and return the defendant to the muneipal or justice court\u201d for further proceedings in the original criminal action. (Pen. Code \u00a7 6450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s purported notice of appeal filed in the municipal court on May 22, 1962, was premature; that notice should have been filed in the 10-day period following entry of the superior court\u2019s order of commitment on May 29. Rule 186 (b) declares that \u201cThe superior court may for good cause relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules [i.e., rules 181-191], <em>except failure to give timely notice of appeal\u201d </em>(italics added). And whereas rule 31 (a), applicable to appeals from the superior court, specifically provides that a premature notice of appeal \u201cmay, in the discretion of the reviewing court for good cause, be treated as filed immediately after the rendition of the judgment or the making of the order,\u201d no such provision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to be found in the subject Rules on Appeal from Municipal Courts and Justice Courts in Criminal Cases. Indeed, rules 182 and 31 (a) were simultaneously amended effective September 15, 1961, to include in both the above quoted language relative to filing notice of appeal within 10 days after the defendant\u2019s commitment for sexual psychopathy, insanity, or narcotics addiction; yet no authorization to validate premature notices of appeal for good cause, such as is contained in rule 31 (a), was added at that time to rule 182. It follows that the appellate department properly dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>The Superior Court\u2019s Order of Commitment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Petitioner also sought to appeal from the superior court\u2019s order committing him to the California Rehabilitation Center pursuant to the subject statute. Acting in propria persona, petitioner transmitted to the clerk of the superior court an apparently valid notice of appeal from that order. The clerk did not file the notice but sent petitioner a letter stating in part, \u201cReceipt is acknowledged of your purported notice of appeal from the commitment made in the above numbered case pursuant to Section 6450 of the Penal Code.\u201d The clerk then correctly pointed out that \u201cThere are no provisions in this law for an appeal,\u201d and went on to suggest that \u201cit is possible that it is an appealable order as an order [i.e., a final order] made in a special proceeding.\u201d The suggestion embodies the proper disposition of petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal: the commitment procedures set up by the subject statute are analogous to the civil commitment procedures of the Sexual Psychopathy Law, and by the same analogy and for the same reasons an original order of commitment under Penal Code section 6450 is \u201cappealable as a final judgment in a special proceeding under section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gross </em>(1955), <em>supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 859, 860 [2], and cases there cited.) While uncertainty as to the appealability of such an order may justify extraordinary use of the remedy of habeas corpus (see <em>In re Bine </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 814, 818 [8] [306 P.2d 405]), it does not excuse the clerk\u2019s failure to file petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal. Accordingly, upon compliance with the pertinent rules of court, petitioner is entitled to have the superior court file his notice of appeal from that court\u2019s order of commitment. In favor of petitioner\u2019s right to press his appeal the filing shall be deemed timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">It does not follow, however, that petitioner is now entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to be released from custody. The order to show cause is discharged and the petition for habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Gibson, C.

If, upon the hearing, the judge shall find that the defendant is not a narcotic drug addict and is not in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics, he shall so certify and return the defendant to the municipal or justice court which certified such defendant to the superior court for such further proceedings as the judge of such municipal or justice court deems warranted.' \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\">As hereinafter explained in more detail, petitioner unsuccessfully attempted to appeal from (1) the denial of his motion for new trial in the municipal court and that court\u2019s order certifying him to the superior court, and (2) the order of commitment entered by the superior court pursuant to Penal Code section 6450.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Health and Safety Code section 11721 provides in full: \u201cNo person shall use, or be under the influence of, or be addicted to the use of narcotics, excepting when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State to prescribe and administer narcotics. It shall be the burden of the defense to show that it comes within the exception. Any person convicted of violating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced to serve a term of not less than 90 days nor more than one year in the county jail. The court may place a person convicted hereunder on probation for a period not to exceed five years and shall in all cases in which probation is granted require as a condition thereof that such person be confined in the county jail for at least 90 days.
