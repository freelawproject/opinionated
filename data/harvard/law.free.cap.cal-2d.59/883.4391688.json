As will appear, we have concluded that plaintiff has failed to show an abuse of discretion by the trial court in its denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion. Accordingly, the writ sought should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">In March 1962 plaintiff commenced an action against defendant for breach of contract, reasonable value of services and materials, conversion, breach of confidential relationship and copyright infringement. The complaint sets forth four alleged causes of action. The first count alleges, in substance, that in August 1960 the parties agreed in writing that plaintiff was to manufacture nine power supply units for defendant according to defendant\u2019s \u201cB\u201d specifications and at a stated price; that under such written agreement defendant reserved \u201cthe right at any time to make changes in the drawings and specifications\u201d in which event \u201cthere will be made an equitable adjustment in price and time of performance mutually satisfactory\u201d to plaintiff and defendant; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>on- October 28, 1960, defendant <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 orally authorized plaintiff to incorporate the [defendant\u2019s] \u2018C\u2019 specifications into its plans, and on or about November 1, 1960 . . . confirmed the said authority in writing\u201d; that defendant on November 22, 1960, reduced the order from nine to three units and finally, on July 5, 1961, cancelled the agreement, whereupon plaintiff tendered delivery of one complete unit and stopped work on the other two in order to mitigate its damages; and that plaintiff is now entitled to recover its costs and profits in accordance with the terms of the contract. The second cause of action incorporates the first, and is in the nature of a common count. The fourth cause incorporates the first and is based on plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation for its services with respect to the six units terminated by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\">Plaintiff\u2019s third cause of action incorporates the first, and alleges that under a provision of the written agreement so permitting, defendant North American on December 1, 1960, requested copies of all of plaintiff\u2019s drawings, representing that it wished to review them; that plaintiff submitted 29 drawings prepared by it for use in performing its contract; that defendant\u2019s representation was false \u201cin that North American\u2019s purpose in requesting the said drawings was to transfer and deliver them to one Varo, Inc., in order to enable Varo, Inc. to manufacture power supply units for North American by use of the same\u201d; that plaintiff owns the drawings, which are \u201cnovel, unique and original\u201d; that it is informed and believes and therefore alleges, \u201cthat North American thereafter fraudulently, maliciously, and in breach of its confidential relationship with plaintiff, transferred and delivered the said 29 drawings to Varo, Inc. in order to enable Varo, Inc. to manufacture power supply units for North American by the use of the same, all without the permission of plaintiff . . . and . . . Varo, Inc. thereafter accepted and retained dominion over the same, and used the same in manufacturing power supply units for North American, all without the permission of plaintiff\u201d; and that the reasonable value of the drawings is $134,720. The prayer based on this cause of action is for that amount plus $100,000 exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Defendant\u2019s answer admits its agreement with plaintiff; alleges that the unit tendered by plaintiff was \u201cmechanically\u201d and \u201cfunctionally\u201d tested and found to be defective; and denies it is indebted to plaintiff as alleged. With respect to the third cause of action defendant admits that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>requested and received the drawings for review, but denies the other allegations. Varo, Inc., is not a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">After issue was joined, as related, plaintiff (on August 1, 1962) served and filed a notice of motion, with supporting affidavits <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and memorandum of points and authorities, for an order requiring defendant to produce various documents for inspection and copying relating to <em>defendant\u2019s contract with Varo. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s itemization of these documents is set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant filed opposition to the motion, with supporting affidavit and points and authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Thereafter various affidavits were filed by the parties, and on October 5, 1962, the trial court entered its memorandum and order finding that defendant had established that certain documents in the files of defendant\u2019s legal department (sought as item 7 of plaintiff's motion for inspection) were privileged, and that as to them plaintiff\u2019s motion \u201cmust be denied,\u201d but ordering the filing by the parties of further affidavits with respect to the other items listed in plaintiff\u2019s notice of motion. The parties submitted further affidavits accordingly, and thereafter, on December 7, 1962, the court entered its order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion. Plaintiff thereupon instituted this mandamus proceeding, claiming that as a matter of law it is entitled to inspect and copy the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>ments as sought by it, and that denial of its motion constitutes abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\">Section 2031 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201cUpon motion of any party showing good cause therefor . . . the court . . . may order any [other] party to produce and permit the inspection and copying ... of any designated documents . . . not privileged, which constitute or contain evidence relating to any of the matters within the scope of the examination permitted by subdivision (b) of section 2016 of this code. . . .\u201d  As recently declared in <em>Suezaki </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 166, 171-172 [4, 5] [23 Cal.Rptr. 368, 373 P.2d 432], \u201cThe statute confines all vehicles of discovery to those matters which are \u2018relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, \u2019 and authorizes discovery of facts or matters which will not be admissible at the trial if the same are not privileged, but appear \u2018reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence . . .\u2019 regardless of whether such relates to a claim or a defense. The same subdivision [see subdivision (b) of section 2031, and subdivision (b) of section 2016] also incorporates those provisions of section 2019 which authorize the trial court to exercise its discretion in protecting parties from abuse or from any unjust or inequitable situation which might otherwise arise.  [5] It follows that in each ease involving a motion for an order authorizing inspection there must be a showing that the thing sought to be inspected comes within the general classification of matters subject to discovery, and that inspection may be had without violence to equity, justice, or the inherent rights of the adversary. \u2019 \u2019  Further, \u2018 \u2018 Good cause for the inspection must, of course, be shown by the moving party [citations].  The nature and extent of the showing necessary to satisfy that requirement must, of necessity, vary with the circumstances presented in each individual case.\u201d <em>(Suezaki </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 166, 171 [1, 2].)  The discretion involved is that of the trial court, rather than of this court, and encompasses within its scope both the showing of good cause by the moving party and the protection of the adversary from abuse, injustice, inequity and violation of his inherent rights. <em>(Suezaki </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962), <em>supra, </em>p. 171 [4], p. 179 [18] ; <em>Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 379 [20] [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The affidavits first submitted by plaintiff in support of its application to inspect and copy were two in number. That of Allen Kaufman, one of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, alleges among other things that \u201cPlaintiff has just learned, for the first time, that on or about October 21, 1960 defendant requested a quotation from Varo, Inc. . . . for the same units which were in the course of production by plaintiff; that thereafter on October 28,1960 defendant received a quotation from Varo, Inc.; and that on November 21, 1960 defendant entered into a letter contract with Varo, Inc. These facts strongly suggest that defendant's conduct during the course of performance by plaintiff was designed to hinder and impair performance by plaintiff; and that defendant was motivated by a desire to induce an ostensible breach on the part of plaintiff in order to avoid double liability for the units. This implication becomes even stronger if the quotation by Varo, Inc. was at a substantially lower price than that by plaintiff' \u2019; that plaintiff claims defendant\u2019s inspection procedures with reference to the unit produced by plaintiff \u201cwere unduly severe and designed in order to create a rejection,\u201d and comparison with defendant\u2019s inspection procedures on units produced by Varo would be relevant to this issue; that one of the issues in the action \u201cis whether or not the performance of the unit produced by plaintiff was acceptable. The standard of acceptable performance in a highly technical area, such as that involved in the present action, is a matter of judgment, and comparison with an identical or very similar technical task is highly probative of this issue. The Varo procurement involved either an identical or very similar item to that called for under the contract in litigation. \u2019 \u2019 With respect to plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendant converted plaintiff\u2019s drawings and delivered them to Varo, attorney Kaufman avers that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s design included at least one unique circuit that advanced the state of the art, without which Varo could not meet the efficiency requirements of the specification. If this identical circuitry were employed by Varo, Inc. it would raise a strong inference that the Varo engineers were exposed to plaintiff\u2019s design.\u201d It must be noted, however, that attorney Kaufman sets forth no expert technical qualifications to make such an averment. With respect to item (7) of the documents sought by plaintiff (those in the files of defendant\u2019s legal department), the sole showing is Mr. Kaufman\u2019s unelaborated assertion that defendant \u201chas material\u201d in such files \u201cwhich deal with the issues between the parties. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b920-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Mr. Gottlieb, assistant general manager of plaintiff corporation, in Ms affidavit states among other things that plaintiff can obtain the facts with respect to its claim of wrongful delivery of its drawings to Yaro only by examining the documents in defendant\u2019s files having to do with the dealings between defendant and Yaro concerning the subject units, as the offices of Yaro are located in Texas; that such documents will show that Yaro \u201cwas required to manufacture items which had already been designed by plaintiff. The said design was highly unique and original and <em>could he used only on a contract calling for the same item </em>[italics added], . . . If the correspondence and engineering drawings of Yaro, Inc. should disclose that the design of Yaro, Inc. was identical to that of plaintiff, this in itself would be strongly evidentiary as to Yaro, Inc.\u2019s use of plaintiff\u2019s design. Plaintiff would then be able to introduce expert testimony . . . that it was virtually impossible that two sets of engineers working independently should arrive at exactly the same solution to such a highly complex problem.\u201d Further, the affidavit asserts, the documents concerning dealings between defendant and Yaro \u201care relevant to the subject matter and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence on the issue of damages\u201d alleged in plaintiff\u2019s first, second and fourth causes of action, in that Yaro\u2019s experience and costs in producing the power supply units would assist in establishing the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s claims for payment for its own work and product, as well as reasonableness of defendant\u2019s inspection procedures as applied to plaintiff\u2019s product. Such documents would also, according to Gottlieb, assist in determining the truth or falsity of plaintiff\u2019s claims, and defendant\u2019s denials, that defendant authorized plaintiff to incorporate the \u201cC\u201d specifications into its plans on October 28, 1960, and encouraged plaintiff to work to \u201cC\u201d specifications \u2014since, if it is shown that defendant was requesting a quotation from Yaro with respect to \u201cG\u201d specifications plaintiff\u2019s claim that it was likewise urged to perform to \u201c C \u201d specifications rather than to \u201cB\u201d specifications would be supported, as both plaintiff\u2019s and Yaro\u2019s \u201cunits were to be utilized for the same purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\">Defendant filed opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion to inspect and copy, asserting the \u201carrangements\u201d made by defendant with Yaro \u201cfor the procurement of power supplies could not possibly shed any light whatever on the matter of plaintiff\u2019s performance or excuse for nonperformance or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>issues of breach or damages\u201d; that plaintiff\u2019s performance or lack thereof and any valid excuse for nonperformance, as well as any breach of contract by defendant, are to be determined by the contractual agreements between the parties, with which defendant\u2019s contracts with Varo have nothing to do; that neither are the Varo contracts and documents relevant to plaintiff\u2019s third cause of action alleging that defendant requested plaintiff\u2019s drawings and thereafter delivered them to Varo, since, if the drawings are of any value and defendant is obliged to pay plaintiff for them, it is immaterial what use defendant made of the drawings; that, further, defendant\u2019s dealings with Varo will not establish whether or not defendant authorized plaintiff to \u201cincorporate\u201d the \u201cC\u201d specification, as plaintiff claims; that plaintiff has not established good cause to inspect and copy the Varo documents; and that the documents in defendant\u2019s legal files with respect thereto are confidential and privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">In support of its opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion defendant also submitted the affidavit of its assistant general counsel that he was the attorney on defendant\u2019s \u201cpermanent legal staff primarily responsible for the handling of legal problems arising out of\u201d the contract between plaintiff and defendant and \u201cfor securing reports from various\u201d of defendant\u2019s departments involved with such contract and performance thereunder and with the \u201cduty to give legal advice to\u201d defendant\u2019s personnel directly involved in the dealings with plaintiff; that a certain 37 itemized and described documents in defendant\u2019s legal files are privileged; that they are confidential reports, letters, summaries and memoranda prepared by defendant\u2019s employes at his request or by himself as defendant\u2019s corporate counsel and also for the attorneys handling this litigation for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Thereafter the trial court, on October 5,1962, filed its memorandum and order wherein it holds, first, that the bare assertion in the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that \u201cdefendant has material in the files of its Legal Department which deal with the issues between the parties, \u2019 \u2019 when coupled with plaintiff\u2019s failure to challenge defendant\u2019s showing that such material is privileged, requires a finding that the documents in the legal file are privileged and that as to them plaintiff\u2019s motion must be denied. The court then notes that \u2018 The main thrust of Chaleo\u2019s [plaintiff\u2019s] argument is that the documents it seeks to inspect may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,\u201d points out that defendant does not deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>the existence of the documents listed by plaintiff or that they relate to the production by Varo for defendant of certain power supply units, and that defendant claims only that plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing that any of such documents are relevant to the subject matter of this action or that inspection would lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\">Further, specifies the court: The weakness in plaintiff\u2019s showing in support of its motion lies in its assumption that in November 1960 defendant entered into a contract with Varo for the production of \u201cthe same units which were in course of production by plaintiff\u201d under its contract with defendant. \u201cThis assumption, unsupported by any showing that it is based on any known facts, is implicit in the allegations of\u201d plaintiff\u2019s third cause of action (conversion of its drawings), the affidavits filed on its behalf, and the arguments of its counsel. \u201cA finding that all the documents described in Chaleo\u2019s motion are relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, and that Chaleo has shown good cause for an order permitting it to inspect all of those documents, cannot be based on any such unfounded assumption of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">\u201cCounsel for Chaleo alleges . . . that \u2018the Varo procurement involved either an identical or very similar item to that called for under the contract in litigation. \u2019 If this is a fact, it may be that Chaleo <em>may have the right to inspect some of the records </em>of North American [defendant] relating to its dealings with Varo, Inc. At the same time, Chaleo <em>is not entitled to inspection of all the records </em>described in its notice of motion in order to determine whether that is the fact. [Italics added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">\u201cChaleo alleges in its complaint that \u2018on or about August 22, 1960 plaintiff and North American entered into a written agreement which provided . . . that plaintiff was to manufacture to North American\u2019s \u201cB\u201d specifications . . . nine (9) power supply units . . .\u2019 and that \u2018on October 28, 1960 North American orally authorized plaintiff to incorporate the \u201cC\u201d specifications into its plans, and on or about November 1, 1960 North American confirmed the said authority in writing.\u2019 ... It is this contract which is the \u2018subject matter of the pending action. \u2019 In order to determine whether the Varo contract involved either the same or a very similar item as that called for by the Chaleo contract, <em>inspection of the portions of those two contracts which are material to that issue is necessary.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>The court thereupon (October 5, 1962) ordered plaintiff to file an affidavit \u201cby a responsible officer setting forth those portions of its written agreement of August 22, 1960, with defendant describing the power supply units which are the subject matter of that agreement, and a copy of so much of the writing dated on or about November 1, 1960, which authorizes plaintiff to incorporate the \u2018C\u2019 specifications\u201d; and ordered defendant to file an affidavit \u201cof a responsible officer setting forth those portions of its letter contract with Varo, Inc., dated on or about November 21, 1960, describing the power supply units which are the subject matter of that contract, including the provision thereof referring to the specifications to be used by Varo, Inc., in its plans for said power units. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">In response to the court\u2019s order the further affidavit of Gottlieb, plaintiff\u2019s assistant general manager, was filed. It incorporates as exhibits \u201ca copy of that portion of the written agreement of August 22, 1960 [between plaintiff and defendant] which designates\u201d the \u201cB\u201d specifications \u201cas the applicable description of the power units ordered by defendant in the said written agreement, \u2019 \u2019 as well as a copy of the \u201cB\u201d specification and of the \u201cC\u201d specification (neither of which is included in the record before us). Also attached was a copy of a telegram from defendant to plaintiff dated November 1, 1960, which Gottlieb averred \u201cauthorized plaintiff to incorporate [the \u2018C\u2019 specification].\u201d This telegram reads: \u201cImperative we receive your prompt acceptance of specification change NA5-15343-1C [the \u2018C\u2019 specification] delivered to you 30 Sept 1960. . . . Request you confirm immediately in writing that provisions of \u2018C\u2019 change have been incorporated <em>in your plans. </em>\u2019 \u2019 (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Likewise filed with Gottlieb\u2019s affidavit were copies of three interoffice letters of defendant which defendant had supplied to plaintiff by stipulation. Gottlieb avers that each of these letters refers to \u201cthe same Specification contained in Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 annexed hereto\u201d (i.e., to the \u201cB\u201d specification). A reading of the first and second of such letters (Exhibits E, P) demonstrates that actually each of these two letters makes particular reference to the \u201cC\u201d specification, and both plaintiff\u2019s counsel and Gottlieb in a supplementary affidavit dated October 29, 1962, concede that the third such letter (Exhibit G) likewise refers to the \u201cC\u201d specification and that Gottlieb was in error in averring to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>The first of these interoffice letters of defendant, dated November 9, 1960, indicates defendant's doubt that plaintiff will be able to perform to <em>\u201cG\u201d </em>specification and its view that plaintiff\u2019s proposed charges therefor \u201cappear to be exorbitant for the amount of work involved ... it is very doubtful if the charges quoted could be justified,\u201d and its decision to investigate and verify by personal visit to Varo in Texas whether and when that company could perform and at what cost. The second letter, dated November 16, 1960, directs that the order to plaintiff be reduced to three units, with \u2018 The C \u2019 revision, presently under negotiation . . . <em>not </em>to be incorporated\u201d; and that orders for the remaining six \u201csupplies are to be placed with VARO.\u201d The third letter, dated November 21, 1960, states among other things that Varo \u201cproposes to supply\u201d six units to the \u201cG\u201d specification, and notes further that the \u201c0\u201d change, \u201cconsidered by our Engineering Dept, to be minor in nature [with certain exceptions] resulted in a quotation from Chaleo which, if incorporated into the existing Purchase Order, would increase it\u2019s cost by . . . approximately 105%. Furthermore, Chaleo would still not guarantee to meet . . . requirements. . . . [T]here now also exists a doubt as to the technical capability of Chaleo to fulfill this contract. . . . Failure to receive an acceptable power supply will seriously jeopardize our Prime Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\">Defendant on its part in response to the court\u2019s above described order of October 5, 1962, filed the affidavit of Mr. Perkins, its buyer who dealt with plaintiff during the fall of 1960, setting forth provisions from the contract between defendant and Varo which state that Varo was to \u201cDesign and produce seven (7) ... power supplies in accordance with Basic Equipment Specification NA5-51343B [which plaintiff and defendant agree is the <em>\u2018C\u2019 </em>specification] per your Technical Proposal. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Attached as exhibits to Perkins\u2019 affidavit were copies of communications between plaintiff and defendant. The first such is a letter dated September 30, 1960, from Perkins, as buyer for defendant, to plaintiff enclosing copies of the \u201cC\u201d specification, requesting that plaintiff \u201ccomplete a review and evaluation of the changes specified and present to the writer your . . . proposal for the accomplishment of the requirements no later than 4 November 1960,\u201d and stating that \u201cIt will probably be desired to incorporate the required changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>on all units under this purchase order, following agreement by Buyer and Seller to the effect on price and delivery of this change; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The next evidential communication is a telegram from plaintiff to defendant, dated November 2,1960, which states: \u201cPresent planning for . . . delivery of Unit No. 1 has been revised to include incorporation of the \u2018O\u2019 change. . . . Work on this element, however, is being withheld pending your approval of our forthcoming proposal. We will submit our cost proposal this week and are withholding actual incorporation until notified to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Thereafter, according to Perkins\u2019 affidavit, plaintiff submitted to defendant \u201cabout November 7 and November 11, 1960 cost proposals in respect of incorporating the \u2018C\u2019 change. In its letter dated 7 November 1960 [plaintiff] stated, among other things, . . . \u2018Early receipt of your authorization to accomplish these efforts and your change order incorporating the revised target price will be greatly appreciated. \u2019 \u201d On November 30, 1960, Perkins sent to plaintiff a telegram stating that \u201cYou are working to \u2018B\u2019 change and are again reminded that your proposal for incorporation of \u2018C\u2019 change is unacceptable.\u201d Plaintiff does not deny receiving this telegram of November 30, although alleging in its complaint that defendant failed to reply to plaintiff\u2019s communications of November 7 and 11, 1960, which plaintiff terms a \u201cclaim in writing . . on account of the said changes\u201d to \u201cC\u201d specifications, but which Perkins in his affidavit describes as \u201ccost proposals,\u201d and further alleging that thereafter defendant \u201crepeatedly requested and encouraged plaintiff to continue to perform research, design, development and manufacturing work in connection with the \u2018 C \u2019 specifications. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Perkins\u2019 affidavit quotes, in addition, from the \u201cB\u201d and from the \u201cC\u201d specification and points out various technical differences between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Following the filing of Perkins\u2019 affidavit Gottlieb on behalf of plaintiff submitted the supplementary affidavit mentioned hereinabove, in which he conceded the error in his earlier affidavit with respect to differentiating between the \u201cB\u201d and the \u201cC\u201d specifications, but further averred\u2014for the first time in this litigation\u2014-that the drawings of plaintiff which both plaintiff and defendant agree were requested by defendant on December 1, 1960, and which plaintiff asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>defendant then turned over to Varo, \u201cwere made in accordance with . . . \u2018C\u2019 specification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\">Neither plaintiff nor defendant denies that the copies of various documents submitted to the court as described above were true copies of existing and authentic originals.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Thereafter on December 7, 1962, the court issued its memorandum and order finding that \u201cby its contract with defendant, plaintiff was called on to manufacture ... to \u2018B\u2019 specifications\u201d; that prior to the obtaining by defendant of plaintiff\u2019s drawings on December 1, 1960, \u201cthere had been some discussion about permitting plaintiff to incorporate\u201d the \u201cC\u201d specification, but that as of November 2, 1960, plaintiff was \u201cwithholding actual incorporation until notified [by defendant] to do so\u201d; that on November 30, 1960, plaintiff was reminded that it was working \u201cto \u2018B\u2019 change,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018that your proposal for incorporation of \u2018C\u2019 change is unacceptable\u201d; that there \u201cis no evidence that the drawings which were furnished by plaintiff to defendant <em>the following day </em>[italics added] incorporated the C\u2019 specifications, or that plaintiff was ever authorized to incorporate those specifications\u201d; that plaintiff has not furnished any evidence to show that (as alleged in the complaint) \u201con or about November 1, 1960, [defendant] confirmed ... in writing\u201d its alleged oral authorization to plaintiff to incorporate the \u201cC\u201d specifications into its plans; that the evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The court further points out (1) that plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his memorandum filed October 30, 1962, states that there is \u201cno doubt that the proposed contract with Varo . . . contemplated the \u2018O\u2019 specifications [which defendant itself asserts],\u201d and (2) that in Gottlieb\u2019s affidavit filed the same day he says that the drawings which plaintiff delivered to defendant \u201cwere made in accordance with\u201d the \u201cC\u201d specification. \u2018Assuming,\u201d stated the court, \u201cthat Mr. Gottlieb is qualified to express an opinion on this point, his conclusion is not supported by, and is in fact contrary to the documentary evidence now before the court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The court concluded its written order by finding that defendant\u2019s contract with Varo did not call for the production of \u201cthe same units which were in course of production by plaintiff\u201d under its contract with defendant, and that \u201cdefendant\u2019s contract with Varo . . . [and] the documents [sought by plaintiff] are not relevant to the subject matter of this action, and are not reasonably calculated to lead to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the discovery of admissible evidence in this action\u201d; by noting that the court had already found that the documents in defendant\u2019s legal files (item 7 of plaintiff\u2019s motion) are privileged from discovery; and by denying plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">Plaintiff now contends that the court below erred, as a matter of law, in denying <em>in toto </em>the inspection sought, and argues that the requested documents have been shown by it to be relevant to several \u201cfactual issues\u201d including (1) whether defendant transferred plaintiff\u2019s drawings to Varo, (2) whether defendant requested plaintiff to \u201cmake changes to \u2018C\u2019 specifications,\u201d (3) whether defendant\u2019s conduct was designed to hinder and impair plaintiff\u2019s performance, (4) whether defendant\u2019s inspection procedures were fair and proper, and (5) damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">And although recognizing that the court\u2019s interim order of October 5, 1962, instructed the parties to \u201cmake a further showing to enable the Court to determine whether the units called for in the Varo contract were <em>the same as those called for in the contract between the parties,\u201d </em>(italics added) and asserting that whether defendant did or did not \u201cauthorize plaintiff to <em>perform </em>to \u2018C\u2019 specifications\u201d (italics added) as \u201cplaintiff has alleged\u201d is \u201cthe main issue in the pending action,\u201d plaintiff nevertheless complains (1) that the court confused the issue of whether plaintiff incorporated \u201cC\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>its \u201cplans\u201d as distinguished from incorporation in the manufactured product; (2) that plaintiff was not given an opportunity to show that it was authorized to perform to \u201c C \u201d and that defendant erroneously and \u201cgratuitously\u201d offered \u201cthree self-sei*ving exhibits\u201d on the point; (3) that the court\u2019s decision is \u201cbased on a resolution on the merits of the two principal issues in the action,\u201d <em>viz., </em>\u201cincorporation\u201d of \u201cC\u201d and whether the drawings were to \u201cC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\">Plaintiff argues further that the court\u2019s finding that there was no evidence that the drawings were to \u201cC\u201d specification is contrary to the only evidence on the subject: the supplementary affidavit of <em>Gottlieb; </em>and points out that defendant did not in the trial court deny that the drawings were to \u201cC.\u201d It should first be noted, however, that on the record presented to us it does not appear that plaintiff itself made any claim that the drawings were to \u201cC\u201d until <em>after </em>the trial court made its intermediate order of October 5, 1962, and until <em>after </em>both plaintiff and defendant had submitted their affidavits in response to such order. Then, and then only, Gottlieb, in his supplementary affidavit, asserted that the drawings were to \u201cC. \u201d Thus, it would appear that defendant had no timely occasion to deny that assertion in the trial court, and that plaintiff is in no position to complain at this point. It may further be noted that in the same supplementary affidavit Gottlieb acknowledged his error in his earlier affidavit in differentiating between the \u201cB\u201d and the \u201c0\u201d specification, that he asserted no expert qualifications to distinguish whether the drawings were to \u201cB\u201d or to \u201cC,\u201d and that for both reasons the court was entitled to view with doubt his statements concerning the drawings. Further, plaintiff\u2014upon whom rests the burden of providing support for its motion\u2014neither produced the drawings themselves nor requested defendant to do so, and offers no explanation for such failure; neither did plaintiff produce evidence by any expert shown to be technically qualified to express an opinion as to whether the drawings were to \u201cB\u201d or to \u201cC\u201d specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">With respect to the drawings, defendant has now filed with this (Supreme) court (with its demurrer and answer to the petition for the writ) the affidavit of its \u201cSenior Engineer, Research, primarily in the field of electronics, and as such the responsible engineer . . . for the power supplies specified in the \u2018B\u2019 and C\u2019 specifications,\u201d who avers that plaintiff\u2019s drawings furnished to defendant \u201creveal that they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>prepared for and they do not comply with the \u2018O\u2019 specification,\u201d states the respects in which they do not comply, and asserts that neither the drawings nor any copies thereof have at any time been discussed with, examined by or delivered to Varo. Defendant\u2019s verified answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint also denies flatly that the drawings were delivered to or used by Varo. The affidavits of two other employes of defendant (its buyer Perkins who dealt with plaintiff, as well as Perkins\u2019 supervisor) have also been filed with this court, asserting that plaintiff\u2019s drawings were not disclosed to Varo.  Even if plaintiff were in a position to raise the point, failure to present these affidavits to the trial court does not preclude their consideration on this petition for mandamus. (See <em>Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961), <em>supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 355, 387 fn. 13, 389 [42], 390 [46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">In summary, although plaintiff\u2019s attempted elaboration of its own position seems somewhat confused and contradictory, the following would appear to constitute a fair statement of the situation as presented by the record: Defendant in November 1960 authorized plaintiff to incorporate \u201cC\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s plans, but did not then authorize plaintiff to manufacture to \u201cC\u201d and plaintiff has presented no evidence of a later contract or authorization to so manufacture; in the same month of November defendant contracted with Varo to manufacture to \u201c0\u201d and on December 1, 1960, requested and received plaintiff\u2019s drawings; plaintiff, although not alleging in its complaint that the drawings were to \u201cC,\u201d now asserts that they were, although the trial court did not so find and defendant denies it and also denies plaintiff\u2019s information and belief or conelusional allegation that they were disclosed to Varo.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the documents sought by plaintiff\u2014all of which concern the dealings between defendant and Varo\u2014are not relevant to the subject matter of this action, i.e., the contract between plaintiff and defendant, appears to be based in turn upon its determination that the contract with Varo contemplated production to \u201d0\u201d specification whereas that of plaintiff authorized production to \u201cB,\u201d and that plaintiff has not shown that its drawings were to \u201c0.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s first, second and fourth causes of action are based upon the claim that it is entitled to payment for its costs and profits in production of the single unit which it tendered to defendant and of the six units which defendant ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>minated, and its third cause of action seeks to recover the alleged value of its drawings plus exemplary damages. It has not established that it was authorized by defendant to produce the same units, i.e., to \u201cC\u201d specifications, as those called for in defendant\u2019s contract with Varo, or that its drawings were to &lt;\u00a3C.\u201d We are not persuaded that under such circumstances the documents which it seeks to inspect and copy\u2014all of which have to do with the dealings between defendant and Varo\u2014can be held as a matter of law to be relevant to the subject matter of plaintiff\u2019s action; i.e., to the contracts and dealings between plaintiff and defendant. As already noted hereinabove, the discretion to be exercised in discovery matters is that of the trial court, rather than of this court\u2014and the trial court has concluded that in the present posture of the case the documents are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\">Finally, plaintiff\u2019s complaint that the court has decided its whole case in this discovery proceeding is without merit. (See <em>Mall Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Sterling Varnish Co. </em>(1951) 11 F.R.D. 576, 578 [2] ; <em>Love </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1948) 8 F.R.D. 583, 584 [1].) As pointed out by defendant, plaintiff\u2019s case is not basically grounded upon defendant\u2019s dealings with Varo, but rather upon the dealings and contracts between defendant and plaintiff. A determination that the Varo documents are not relevant to this litigation would not preclude plaintiff from proving any bona fide claims under its own contracts with defendant, including the value, if any, of the drawings contractually furnished. Adequate procedural remedies in this respect remain open to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The alternative writ heretofore issued is discharged and the peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Gibson, C.J., Trayor, J., McGomb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., and Peek, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied July 24, 1963.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Although the superior court is, of course, the respondent or \u201cdefendant\u201d in this proceeding (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1063) it makes for clarity and consistency in identification of the respective parties at both levels to refer to North American (which is defendant below) as the defendant here.

Thereafter, while ostensibly dealing in good faith with plaintiff, defendant was in fact planning to scuttle its contract with plaintiff and substitute Varo, Ine. as the supplier. Defendant requested plaintiff to make changes to \u2018O\u2019 specifications and to submit its \u2018O\u2019 drawings to defendant. The change . . . involved extremely difficult technical problems. Plaintiff nevertheless completed new drawings to \u2018O\u2019 specifications, and submitted them to defendant. Defendant in turn delivered the \u20180* drawings to Varo, Inc., and then advised plaintiff that it had never officially authorized the change to \u2018O\u2019 specifications, and to return to the \u2018B\u2019 specifications. This was a practical impossibility at that stage. Plaintiff therefore completed a prototype unit to \u2018O\u2019 specifications, despite the technical difficulties involved, and submitted it to defendant. After inspection defendant rejected the unit, claiming that it failed to meet specifications. Plaintiff contends that defendant\u2019s inspection procedures and standards were unfair and improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Plaintiff has no present information as to Varo, Inc. \u2019s subsequent experience with a contract for the same units, and seeks, <em>inter alia, </em>to obtain that information by the present motion, as well as information with respect to the delivery of drawings to Varo, Inc., the price paid to Varo, Inc., the technical difficulties encountered by Varo, Inc., changes in specifications in the Varo, Ine. contract, inspection procedures applied to Varo, Inc. units, etc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
