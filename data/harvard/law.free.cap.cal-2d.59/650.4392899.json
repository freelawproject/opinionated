Clearly, therefore, under the foregoing definitions a barber shop is a public place.  Accordingly, a city ordinance attempting to make certain acts pertaining to intoxication in a public place criminal is in conflict with state law and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Defendant is discharged from custody in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Gibson, C.J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., and Peek, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Section 41.27(a) reads: \u201cNo person shall be or appear in a state of drunkenness or intoxication upon any public street, sidewalk, highway or alley or in any public park, or in any railroad depot or bus station, or in any public place, or in any place open to the patronage of the public, or in any place open to public view, or in or upon any building or premises or portion thereof which is owned or occupied by any municipality or by any department office thereof, or by any other government or governmental agency or instrumentality, and devoted to any public or governmental use or to the performance of any official business or function, including any premises occupied by the Federal Government but not under the exclusive jurisdiction thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
