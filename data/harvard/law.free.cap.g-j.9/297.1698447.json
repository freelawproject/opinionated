We now leave ten thousand dollars in United States notes, which we would remit you per mail, did your letter authorise us to do so, but we are not willing to take the risk. We had hoped that you would authorize us to pay over the funds to your agent here, or in New Orleans. All the Maryland notes which we have used here, were in bills on New Orleans, except three thousand dollars, which we paid out in our business \u2014 the bills do not mature until May, and one or two in June; hence our wish to hand over the exchange in New Orleans; however, we will endeavour to meet your views, and forward you funds as speedily as possible. The writer goes over in eight or ten days to New Orleans, and will, if possible, procure checks. If money matters are not too much derangod, we may be able to get the drafts running to maturity cashed; of this we can only conjecture. The specie that we brought over for Commercial Bank, was raised in New Orleans from our own friends, but predicated upon the remittances which we were to make on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>bills with Maryland notes. When the rupture took place we then bought bills with specie, which we remitted to New Orleans. We have probably fifteen thousand dollars of your notes yet on hand, which we will use as occasion may offer for so doing safely \u2014 if we do not use it, will bring it on with us in May or June, as one of us expects to go north about that time. Any amounts we may send on to you, please receipt to <em>Wm.

It appears by a conversation with the trustees of <em>Evan Poultney, </em>that they <em>propose </em>to hold us responsible for all entries and transactions in which he is concerned since the 23d March \u2014 such being the case, although we feel confident that they cannot succeed in it, do you not think it would be better for you to make provision for those drafts of <em>Amelung,s </em>out of the materials you have in hand, either by transferring notes or bills for the purpose, or even by holding the claim on <em>Amelung </em>for the benefit of <em>S. L. Fowler 8f Co. </em>This you can do, not having been officially advised of any deed or conveyance which ought to prevent you; whereas, if we were to make any payments on account of the concern, it is possible we might have to pay the same over again to the trustees, and have a suit to contend against in addition. <em>Fowler </em>can suffer no inconvenience in laying out of the money for a while, inasmuch as the money employed in that <em>concern (S. L. Fowler </em>\u00bff <em>Co.) </em>was all furnished by <em>Evan </em>\u2014 at all events it would be better to wait a while, and see what is likely to turn up. You may rest assured, that we shall suffer nothing to go out of our hands that we can keep, and will do every thing we can. to protect you in the matter in every way. The course pursued by the trustees, <em>Morris fy Gill, </em>in relation to the. stock, seems very extraordinary, and deserving of such notice as we shall endeavour to take of it when the proper time comes. It is certainly calculated to injure you as well as ourselves, but it is only another instance of the utter recklessness with which they have thought.proper to act towards all those whom they choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>now to consider themselves authorized to attack. We do not know whether the stock is sold or not,- having sent it to New York to be sold at certain limits, which we are not advised whether they have been obtained or not. If it is sold and is sent to Cincinnati to be transferred, we presume the cashier will not hesitate to transfer it; we should think he would be very unjustifiable in doing so upon the faith of any such letter as the one you refer to, and would perhaps render himself liable for damages both to you and us. There is a scheme a-foot, by which the creditors of the Bank of Maryland intend to endeavour to put their affairs in a way to get rather more for them than they seem likely to do under the administration of Messrs. <em>Morris </em>and <em>Gill. </em>We send you the <em>\u2018 </em>Republican\u2019 of this morning, containing the proceedings of the first meeting, also a copy of a circular addressed to the principal creditors.

E. fy Co. Maclay Sf Asher\u2019s </em>draft on <em>H. W. fy S. Hill, </em>of <em>JYew York, </em>for $5,000, the draft /was forwarded in the usual way, became due on the 11th of June, and was duly paid. In the meantime, viz: on the 2d June,-the <em>Union Bank </em>were informed by Messrs. <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Glenn, </em>that they claimed this draft as part of the property of <em>Evan-Poultney, </em>who had transferred all his estate to them as trustees, by two deeds, one dated 23d March last, and the other on the 8th of May last. Upon examination it appeared, that no deed of the 23d March could be found on record; the deed of the 8th of May was executed and recorded on the day of its date. The deed of the 23d March, has since, viz: on the 30th June, been put on record.\u201d The question upon this statement is, has the bank a right to hold the money thus collected,-and' refuse to pay it over to <em>Poultney, Ellicott 8f Co. </em>on their order ? I think not, and that in justice it cannot be properly withheld from them. As a general principle, which is essential to the regulation of banking and commercial operations, the <em>Union Bank </em>could know no one in this transaction but <em>Poultney, Ellicott fy Co. </em>from whom the draft was received, and to whom alone the bank was accountable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Such is the universal practice, and this, like all other cases, must be governed by it Or, a contrary principle, if adopted, must be equally general in its operation, and thus establish an inquisition into the private concerns of all persons who had dealings with the bank. The bank cannot recognize any other person as having an interest in a bill or note, but he who appears as the holder of it; any other course would involve them in interminable litigation. Courts of justice are the proper tribunals for the decision of all such questions. But even if the bank were at liberty to exercise a discretion in the matter (which I do not think they are) it -would not alter the case. It appears that the bill was deposited for collection by P. <em>E. Co. </em>on the 7th of April, 1834, and that the deed of trust (which was duly executed and recorded) was made on the 8th May following, a month after. Now the title of P. <em>E. Co. </em>under the legal operation of this deed, could not be affected to the bill itself, in their hands as endorsers, or will the bank undertake to step over these facts, and institute an inquiry, as to how and when, and from whom, and upon what consideration, P. <em>E. Co. </em>received this bill, and to determine to retain the funds to meet what, in their view, may be the proper mode of distribution. According to the deed, the trustees have clearly no right to the bill, as it was passed away before the deed was made in the ordinary course of commercial operations. Whatever the claim of the trustees may be, is a matter between them and <em>Poultney, Ellicott Sf Co. </em>to be decided in the ordinary way, and before the proper tribunals, and no where else. The production of the private deed of the 23d March, and putting it in record long after the bill was paid, and the funds in the hands of the <em>Union Bank, </em>as agents of <em>Poultney, Ellicott fy Co. </em>does not alter the case; why this deed has been kept back, and why it is now produced, will, no doubt, be a subject of investigation elsewhere; certainly the bank have nothing to do with it. Can the bank undertake to say how far it is valid; whether it was not revoked by the subsequent deed, and so understood by all the parties, or in one word, how can they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>undertake to decide any question about it ? The state of the case is simply this \u2014 the bank finds itself in the possession of the proceeds of a bill collected for one of its- customers, in the ordinary course of business, who requires it to be paid over to him; another person interposes a claim and says, I am entitled to it under a deed made to me at such a time, and here it is \u2014 it turns out to be a month after this bill was transferred to the present holder \u2014 but, says the claimant, here is another deed of an earlier date, which it did not suit me to make use of, but which I bring forward now, as showing me to be entitled to it, and I pray you to hold this money until the validity and effect of this deed shall be established by law. Under such circumstances there would seem to be no difficulty as to the course of the bank. There is another view of this subject, which shows that the bank ought not to interpose to arrest these funds, to the injury of their acknowl\u00e9dged principal in the business. It appears by <em>Mr. Johnson\u2019s </em>letter, dated 2d June, that he had corresponded with the acceptors of the bill in <em>New York, </em>and knew at what bank the bill was placed for collection, it was in the power of the trustees then (if they had a legal or equitable right) to have instituted legal proceedings in <em>New </em>York,-and have arrested the funds from passing into the hands of Poultney, <em>Ellicott 8f Co. </em>and thus have placed the controversy where it ought to stand, between the trustees of <em>E. Poultney, </em>and <em>Poultney, Ellicott </em>\u00bf\u00a1' Co.\u2014 having failed to avail of this remedy, the natural, and proper, and legal one, is it to be expected that the bank will consent to interpose itself between the litigants, after the money has been collected and is virtually in the hands of <em>P. E. fy Co. </em>I would again remark, that the clear remedy of the trustees is against <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp;f Co. </em>who are responsible for whatever claim may exist against them, in the courts of law or equity. \u25a0 George Winchester, <em>4th July, </em>1834.\u201d When, on motion, it was resolved, that the cashier be directed to pay to <em>Poultney, Ellicott Co. </em>the sum of $5,000, mentioned in the said minute of the 3d inst.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">\u25a0 And the plaintiffs, on their part, offered in evidence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>jury, that in reply to the letter herein before set forth and described, as addressed to them by the defendants, dated 30th June, as aforesaid, they sent to the defendants a copy of the deeds of the 23d March, and 8th May, 1834. And the plaintiffs further offered in evidence, from a book of Poultney, <em>Ellicott Co. </em>entitled <em>\u201c </em>Personal Account Ledger,\u201d as herein before inserted. (It is understood that the defendants reserve to themselves all legal objections to the testimony herein above set forth in this statement of facts, so far as the same is offered to prove that <em>Poultney, Ellicott fy Co. </em>or <em>Thomas </em>Ellicott, had knowledge of the deed of the 23d March, 1834.) It is admitted by the plaintiffs, that up to the 7th of April, 1834, and for some time afterwards, they were not obliged to pay, nor had they paid any moneys, or suffered any loss, on account of the said <em>Evan </em>Poultney, against \"which the said deed was intended to indemnify them; but that the said plaintiffs have, from time to time, since the 7th of April, collected and paid over various sums of money, received from divers persons, under and by virtue of said deeds of 23d of March, and 8th May, 1834, all of which was paid to the defendants, under and in pursuance of the said deed, and was known by defendants to have been received by plaintiffs under said deeds of 23d of March, and 8th May, 1834. It is also admitted, that no measures \"were taken at law or otherwise, except such as is herein before set forth by the plaintiffs, to arrest or suspend the negotiation of the draft for $5,000, nor that the same was ever delivered to them, nor its delivery demanded by them from any of the parties into whose hands it had passed. It is further admitted that they were under liabilities for the said <em>Evan Poultney </em>to the defendants, as security for him, at the date of the said deed of 23d March, to the amount of $80,000, and these are the only liabilities of said plaintiffs for said <em>Poultney. </em>Whereupon, the defendants, by their counsel, prayed the court, upon all the evidence above set forth, to instruct the jury, that if they believe the evidence in the cause as above set forth, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>1. Because the deed of 23d March, 1834, from <em>Evan Poultney </em>to the plaintiffs, not having been recorded until the 30th June following, did not pass a title in the bill in question to the said plaintiffs, which was valid and operative in law against the title acquired by <em>Poultney, Ellicott Co. </em>under the endorsement and delivery to them from <em>Evan Poultney.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-5\"><em>2. </em>Because no tide to the bill passed by the said deed to the said plaintiffs, the said bill' never having been delivered to the said plaintiffs, either at the date of the deed or after-wards, and the said plaintiffs never having forbidden the negotiation of the said bill, by notice or otherwise, and the said bill being, in fact, negotiated by the said <em>Evan Poultney, </em>by endorsement to <em>Pouliney, Ellicott Co. </em>and by <em>Poultney, Ellicott Co. </em>deposited with the defendants for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">3.

Because the deed of 23d March, being intended to save harmless and indemnify the grantees against liability, and to secure them for any payments they might be obliged to make on account of <em>E. P. </em>and the said <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Glenn </em>having neither taken possession of the draft in question, nor forbid its negotiation, nor resorted to any measures at law or otherwise, to obtain possession of the draft, or to arrest or suspend its negotiation, and the said <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Glenn </em>not having been obliged, up to the 7th of April, to pay any money for the said <em>Evan Poultney, </em>nor in other way having incurred loss against which the deed was intended to secure them, by reason of all which, the said plaintiffs acquired no title under the deed sufficient to invalidate the right of the defendants, to pay over the proceeds of the draft to the said <em>Poultney, Ellicott Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">5. Because, although the said deed may have conveyed the interest of the said <em>Evan Poultney, </em>in the said draft, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the said plaintiffs, yet the said draft having been assigned, by endorsement and delivery, to the said Poultney, <em>Ellicott &amp;{\u25a0 Co. </em>and by them deposited with the defendants for collection, and by them collected and paid over to the said Poultney, <em>Ellicott Co. </em>the defendants were bound to account for the proceeds of the said draft, and justified in paying over the same to the persons from whom they had received it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">6. Because that the said deed of the 23d March, although it may have conveyed the interest of <em>Evan Poultney </em>in said draft to the said plaintiffs, yet the same not having been placed on record, or notice thereof given to the said defendants, when the said draft was deposited for collection in the <em>Union </em>Bank, and when the liabilities of said defendants, as agents in the collection of said draft, commenced to the said Poultney, <em>Ellicott Co. </em>the subsequent notice given by the said plaintiffs to said defendants on the 2d June, could not alter or modify the obligation already existing on the part of said defendants, to account for and pay over to the said Poultney, <em>Ellicott &amp;f Co. </em>the proceeds of said draft when collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">Which instructions the court refused to give \u2014 the defendanfs <em>excepted.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for $5,000, and the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b321-9\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Is to ascertain the relations which subsisted between Poultney, <em>Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>and the <em>Union </em>Bank, on the 7th April, 1834. What the obligation of the bank resulting from them? And 2. Was that relation modified or released by the notice of the plaintiffs below ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-12\">The relation in the first case, was that of principal and agent. The obligations on the bank arose from its character as agent. What then is the effect of notice by a third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>to an agent ? How far are third parties empowered to release the bank from the obligation to pay <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>? The agent cannot be liable to two principals; therefore if the notice made the bank liable to the plaintiffs, it must also release the bank from liability to <em>Poultney, Ellicott </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>Nor can there be a better test than whether the defendants are still liable to that firm. If responsible to them, they are not responsible to the plaintiffs. It is unnecessary to review the law of principal and agent. <em>Paley on Agen. </em>289, lays down the rule, that where an agent names his principal, the principal and not the agent is the responsible person to <em>third </em>parties. <em>Paley on Evid. </em>304 An agent receives money from his principal, and which may be recovered from the principal. As long as the agent has the money, the creditor has an election. But this is when the party paying the money seeks to recover it back. It does not apply to a <em>third </em>party, <em>Butler and Harrison, Cowper. </em>3 <em>Maul, and Sel. </em>344.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">Again: An agent is liable to a <em>third </em>party where he receives money specifically appropriated to a <em>third </em>party. There if he is expressly bound, he becomes liable to pay such third party. 14 <em>East. </em>582. 3 <em>Price, </em>58. 3 <em>B. and Ald. </em>664.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">An agent is only liable when there is privity either between the third party and the agent, or his principal. It is not pretended here, that the <em>Union Bank </em>received the money from the plaintiffs, nor any specific appropriation of the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the draft in question was their property, and that a liability results from paying their money to <em>Poultney, Ellicott </em>&amp; <em>Co.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-8\">This involves two questions : 1, Can the plaintiff try title in an action against-the agent,- the bank? 2.

The notice relies on the deeds only ; the first deed was not recorded, and was not evidence <em>to the bank. It </em>was not known to <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>so as to make their conduct fraudulent; nor is there any proof of fraud on this record. The second deed was a substitute for the first. That deed did not convey the draft; it only conveyed $23,000 of <em>Maclay Asher\u2019s debt, </em>while they <em>on the </em>24th March still owed him $28,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-7\">If competent to make the bank an implied trustee, the plaintiffs exhibit no such title as will make the bank liable. What sort of notice is sufficient to effect this object ? From whom may it come ? Its effect upon the character and means of merchants and bankers would be ruinous. The rule is liable to great abuse. The stoppage of funds in the hands of a bank by mere notice, would be highly prejudicial, and the general rule, which requires privity of contract, is salutary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-8\">Notice of all facts in possession <em>of the claimant </em>should <em>be </em>given, and it should state the facts necessary to make out the title on which reliance is placed. Here the facts of the title are displayed. It depends on the deeds alone, but no more. 7 <em>Bing. </em>20 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>426. <em>Butter </em>N. <em>P. </em>133.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-9\">The action of a third party against <em>an agent or collector, </em>cannot be sustained if he can show the least colour of right in his principal; and here the bill of exchange was transferred at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-10\">R. Johnson, for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-11\">The responsibilities of the appellees for the debts of the Bank of Maryland, were all in the hands of the <em>Union Bank of Maryland. </em>The record does not state the time of the failure of the Bank of Maryland, nor when the former dynasty of the <em>Union Bank of Maryland </em>terminated, nor show the prompter of the payment to <em>Poultney, Ellicott </em>&amp; <em>Co.; </em>but the deed of March, 1834, was executed in the presence of <em>William M. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Ellicott, </em>one of the firm of <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>That deed was one of indemnity. The deed of May was not a substitute for the deed of March; it contains other stipulations ; it gave security to the creditors of the Bank of Maryland generally. The ground of the second deed is greater than the first; the objects of the two were not the same. The latter called for more property, but did not abandon any thing which the first conveyed. It was no extinguishment of the deed of March.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">. The evidence shows that on the 23d March, 1834, besides $80,000 in hand, due <em>Evan Poultney, </em>they, <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>owed <em>E. Poultney </em>$170,000. This appears by their books, in all $250,000 due him, <em>Evan Poultney, </em>individually. And also, upon special deposite, in trust for some undisclosed principal, $138,000 \u2014 making in all, nearly $400,000. The effect then, of the deed of March, known to <em>P. E. &amp; Co. </em>was to convey all the funds in their hands, belonging to <em>Evan Poultney. </em>It was not confined to <em>Maclay </em>and <em>Asher's </em>debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">The open account shows payments to <em>Evan Poultney, </em>or on his account, the whole sum of $80,000. And there is a piece of evidence, the\u2019letter of the 7th June, 1834, addressed to <em>B. W. Hewson, </em>pregnant with fraud. This letter was read at the trial without objection \u2014 readTo show <em>P. E. Sf Co's </em>knowledge of the deeds of March and May, 1834, and that under the deed of March, the appellees, as trustees of <em>Evan Poultney, </em>claimed this property, and honestly suggested to <em>Hewson, </em>that as he was not officially advised of the deed, he might hold on to the property, though <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>could not. Their notions of fraud being notified of the deed forbidding it. <em>Maclay </em>and <em>Asher, </em>from Apalachicola, 1,000 miles off, mailed the draft for <em>Evan Poultney </em>on the 29th March. It reached him on the 7th April, 1834. On that day he endorsed it, delivered it to <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp;f Co. </em>and they deposited it in the <em>Union Bank </em>for collection. On that day <em>Poultney </em>was a large creditor of that concern, and no evidence to show that <em>P. E. &amp; Co. </em>had paid one dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>lar of consideration for this draft of $5,000. The draft was remitted by the <em>Union Bank </em>to <em>New York </em>for collection. The appellees hearing of this draft, inform Messrs. <em>Hills, </em>the acceptors of their property in it, and they notify the <em>Union Bank </em>not to pay \u2014 the draft <em>not </em>then being collected. The <em>Union Bank, </em>then not creditors of <em>P. E. Co. </em>and the notice informed them that the claim was made under their deeds. The money was received on the 14th June, 1834, and the bill paid some twelve days after notice. From the 14lh June until the 30th, 16 days, the bank rested on the notice, and then the deeds of trust are asked for. Being produced on the 3d July, the opinion <em>o\u00ed Mr. Winchester </em>is asked for, and a special board of directors was called at 8 o\u2019clock on the 5th July, which sanctioned the payment of the money we now claim \u2014 and we are told we have no right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">As a general rule between principal and agent, the <em>jus tertii </em>cannot be tried. The counsel is in error in supposing the <em>jus tertii </em>cannot be tried for want of privity of contract. The case in 23 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>312, if the want of privity is the ground of the doctrine, cannot be sustained. In that case there W'as neither contract nor privity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">The case of 20 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>153, certainly decides that the character of principal and agent, as a universal proposition, does not exclude from the agent the right of setting up the true owner, or prevent the true owner from recovering from the agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">There is no rule of policy which throws the true owner on the principal, and forbids his proceeding against the agent himself. If he recovers against the agent, it is the judgment which is the protection of the agent against the principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">As respects the agent, he is just as much protected in deciding the title between him and the true owner, as between him and his principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">The case then, in effect, decides that the agent can only protect himself against the true owner, by setting up a better title in his principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-10\">The action of ejectment furnishes an analogy. Why should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>circuity of action be sustained ? The true owner must have his remedy against somebody. The argument on the other side concedes we could recover from <em>Poultney, Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>upon the deeds. The objection is not a want of title in the plaintiffs, but a want of title as against the agents of <em>P. E. &amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">If the rule applies at all, it applies to an agent who does not pay over. The plaintiffs then would be bound to wait until the principal recovered from his agent. This is delayed and increased litigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-7\">All the cases relied on, are cited in <em>Hademan vs. </em>Wilcox, 23 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>312. That case is a decisive authority here. It proceeds on the ground that the plaintiff and an insolvent by collusion, put goods into the hands of the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and yet the agent set up the title of the insolvent\u2019s assignees as a defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-8\">In this case there is abundant evidence of collusion, and the proof is left without explanation, which authorized the rejection of the defendants\u2019 prayers below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-9\">Upon their doctrine the fraudulent collusion might be found, and this court is asked, despite of that, to say the plaintiff cannot recover here, because of no privity between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-10\">The counsel attempts to distinguish this case, on the ground that in the decision in 23 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>the agent was informed of the fraud, and here the agent was only notified by implication. He thinks that notice of fraud is essential to maintain the action against the agent, and that on such a notice, and proof of fraud, the recovery may be had. They say we can recover from the <em>New York Bank, </em>or from the acceptor. The one being agent, and the other having only contracted with the legal owner of the draft. This in truth, is a surrender of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-11\">The notice is no part of the cause ; it is a caution to the agent, who, if he pays without notice, is justified; but if he pays after notice, he is liable if the fund belongs not to his principal. A suit against the agent operates as notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Independent of all notice, so long as the fund remains with the agent, the true owner may sue at once. The suit is no allegation of fraud, nor notice of fraud. Fraud, in fact, sustains the action. The whole object of notice is to protect the agent from an innocent payment to his principal. The want of privity is not sufficient to defeat the true owner. Either the proceeds of the draft, or the draft, may be recovered. If fraudulent collusion does not divest the plaintiff below, who can doubt but that <em>trover </em>would have lain for the draft.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">Then the nature of the notice given to the bank, and the deeds of <em>Poultney </em>laid before it. The bank knew of his endorsement ; the dates of the transaction. They knew the draft not endorsed prior to 23d March, and when he endorsed it, that he parted with funds <em>not </em>his own. They knew the transfer was a fraud on the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">The opinion in 23 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>places the right on the fraud in fact, and not on the notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">If <em>Poultney </em>had himself given the draft to the defendants, there could be no doubt about the action ; and the intervention of <em>Poultney, Etticott </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>can make no difference. They claim by a fraudulent collusion with <em>Evan Poultney, </em>which cannot fortify their right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-8\">The prayers here were erroneous, because they took the case from the jury \u2014 fraud or no fraud. They were intended to take from the jury the very ground on which the right to recover existed, and on which the jury found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">Then as to the operation of the deeds, the recitals of the deed of 24th March gave notice to three parties. It was valid as respects <em>Poultney. </em>When he received the draft in April, he knew he was receiving what he had no title to. The deed passed all he had. On the 11th June, when the fund was received by the bank, it was known the plaintiffs were entitled to it; they were the equitable owners of the sum \u2014 the proceeds of the draft. The moment the <em>Union Bank </em>received this fund it belonged to the plaintiffs, was for their use, and they can recover in this action. The act of 1829, ch. 151, would enable them to sue in their own names.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>J. P. Kennedy, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">It is difficult to imagine a more perplexing position than that of our banking institutions generally, if the counsel for the appellees is correct. An institution daily concerned with the collection of paper belonging to numerous parties; a business requiring despatch and promptitude in its administration; that such a body should be liable to be placed in an attitude of litigation, called on to exercise her judgment between conSicting parties, and incur penal responsibilities for errors of decision, is an evil greatly calculated to diminish its utility. If a bank charged with the collection of negotiable paper is in the predicament supposed, it equally concerns both its customers and the community. If the credit, standing, and fortune of a trader is to be questioned upon a mere notice, he would often be forced to suspend .payment, and await the determination of the question of right, shadowed forth by any claimant, and at the same time the bank refusing to pay, would be liable to damages to one party or the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">What rule of conduct shall the .courts establish for the government of agents ? Can notice from any person suspend the payment of your notes ? Must the notice establish title ? Who is to be the judge of the title'? Is the opinion of the astute to prevail? But this rule is not admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">It is said the notice is compulsory on the bank, to hold the fund at the high peril of all the consequences before stated. The amount is immaterial. If an agent submits to such a demand, he' is responsible in damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">In all cases, the agent ought to turn the party over to his principal, and be discharged. This ought to be his course of business. The other party may proceed by attachment or by injunction. To intercept the fund, he should be forced to resort to his legal or equitable remedies; adopt compulsory remedies as to the agent. This should be the general rule as to commercial agencies, that he may acquit himself by paying over, and so transfer the controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">The exceptions to the general rule are founded on fraud; the knowledge of that fraud should be carried home to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>agent, that he may determine how far his case is within the exception. Being satisfied of fraud, he ought to hold up the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">Then, do the facts show' any fraud between these parties, known to the agent?</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\">At the time of the execution of the deeds, there was no design of fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">The court must determine on some grounds, that the agent is authorized to hold up the fund, or pay it over. No subject is more difficult to handle, and none more delicate, than the establishment of rules applicable to such subjects.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-8\">As to the facts; information of the failure of the bank was received on the 23d March. Various parties were bound by heavy liabilities for her. The deed was drawn up rapidly by the grantor, to secure them from responsibility. The 23d was Sunday; the character of the transaction is legible on the face of it; there is no reference to payments, nor any enumeration of the property conveyed \u2014 a broad conveyance of all the grantee had to cover all his debts. That done, the parties were secured and free from attachments. On the 8th May a deed w'as prepared more at leisure; a new deed was executed. The first deed was not recorded ; the second deed was prepared and executed. No reason now existed for recording the first deed, which could give no vitality to the subsequent deed. In the letter of the 29th March, a draft arrives at <em>Baltimore </em>on the 7th April. The <em>Union Bank </em>finds it lodged for collection. No knowledge of the deed nor any fraud. Their duty was to send it forward. The trustees of <em>Poultney </em>come to the knowledge of this draft, and they give the notice in the record. No information of fraud is communicated to the bank. The notice is only a hypothetical statement. The <em>Union Bank </em>called for the deeds, and they had no reference to the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-9\">The misconduct of Poultney, <em>Ellicott &amp; Co. </em>is not to be imputed to the <em>Union Bank; </em>the bank did not know that <em>Evan Poultney </em>was a creditor of that house, nor was the monstrous letter of Poultney, <em>Ellicott </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>known, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>showed <em>a priori </em>that they intended to fill their pockets. The <em>Union Bank </em>knew not of these things, but was left to act and decide upon its naked rights.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
