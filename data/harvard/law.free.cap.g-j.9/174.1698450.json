The petition then suggested that the said <em>Ridgely </em>intended to remove the said negro <em>Harriett </em>from the state of <em>Maryland </em>\u2014 prayer for a subpcena, and that he give security not to remove said girl, now about 17 years of age, entitled to freedom at the age of 21 years; and that he shew cause why he should not give security not to remove the said <em>Harriett </em>out of the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AC6\">The answer of <em>Edward Ridgely </em>alleged that the said negro <em>Harriett, </em>never was the property or in the possession of <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>the testatrix ; but at the time of her death, was the property of <em>J. C. Gittings; </em>that the said <em>Harriett </em>was born the slave of <em>James Sterrett, </em>and was never out of his possession during the life of <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>but that he had conveyed her to <em>J. C. Gittings, </em>in trust, for the wife of the said <em>J. Sterrett; </em>that it is true that after the date of the said conveyance, <em>J. Sterrett </em>mortgaged the said negro <em>Harriett </em>to <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>but this respondent submits that that mortgage conveyed no title to <em>Mrs. Dali; </em>all of which is respectfully submitted, and that the said negro <em>Harriett </em>is not a free woman, as in the said petition above is alleged, and of this he puts himself upon the country, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">At the trial of this cause the petitioner gave in evidence the certificate of the register of wills of <em>Baltimore </em>county, dated 1st March, 1834, under the seal of the Orphans\u2019 court of <em>Baltimore </em>county, that it had been proved by such testimony as was satisfactory to him, that the bearer, <em>JYegro Maria, </em>was the identical person mentioned in <em>Mrs. DalPs </em>will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>And also proved a mortgage from <em>James Sterett, </em>dated 24th April, 1823, to <em>Eleanor Dali, </em>for the said negro with others, conditioned to pay a sum of money on or before the 1st January, 1826, which mortgage was duly acknowledged arid recorded. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">The defendant then proved, that on the 29.th February, 1820, the said <em>James Sterett, </em>-in consideration of a relinquishment of dower by his wife; <em>Maria, </em>conveyed the said negro with others to a certain <em>James C. Gittings, </em>for the sole and separate use of his wife, <em>Maria, </em>which was also duly acknow-ledged and recorded; and that oh the 24th February, 1822, the said <em>James Sterett </em>conveyed all his , personal property to <em>Charles Sterett Ridgely </em>for the separate use of his wife, <em>Maria Sterett, </em>which was also duly acknowledged and recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">. The defendant then produced <em>Eleanor Ridgely, </em>who being duly sworn, gave the following testimony: \u201cI am the niece of <em>Mrs: Dali, </em>was frequently with her at her house -in town; never knew <em>Harriett, </em>the petitioner,' until the year 1830, after my aunt\u2019s death; she was never, to my knowledge, in my aunt\u2019s possession.- I have always heard that <em>Harriett lived </em>with her grandmother in the country, who was <em>Mr. SteretPs </em>slave, but permitted by him to, live with her son who was a free man. Shortly after my aunt\u2019s death, <em>Mrs. Sterett </em>came to town to my brother\u2019s -house, and said to me that she wanted to see about <em>Harriett, </em>as she was her property. I communicated this claim to my brother very recently. <em>Maria, </em>the mother of this girl, the petitioner, lived in <em>Mrs. DalPs </em>family as her slave, and survived her mistress'. <em>Maria, </em>the mother, after <em>Mrs. Sterett </em>made her claim, said' she did not .want her to have her child, as her mother had brought her up and found her in'every'thing. <em>Mr. Sterett </em>had never done any thing for them. The petitioner was brought from the country to town to be appraised in <em>Mrs. DalPs </em>estate in July, 1830.\u201d It was also agreed that <em>Edward Ridgely </em>was the executor of <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>that he had the petitioner appraised as part of her estate. That the petitioner was never in the possession of <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>but lived until <em>Mr. Ridgely </em>took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>possession of her at the time of the appraisement with her grandmother, who was a slave of <em>Mr. </em>Sterett\u2019s, but lived with her son, a free man. It was also proved on the trial of this cause, that the said <em>Edward Ridgely </em>on 23d June, 1836, committed the said negro, <em>Harriet, </em>to the jail of <em>Baltimore </em>county as his slave; and that whatever interest, if any, <em>Mrs. Dali </em>had in said negro, vests in the said <em>Edward, </em>as residuary legatee under her last will and testament. It was further proved at the trial, that at the time of filing of the petition in this cause, the said <em>Edward Ridgely </em>intended to sell the said negro girl as a slave for life, out of the state of <em>Maryland, </em>and it is admitted that this intention on his part still exists.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">The city court <em>(Brice, Ch. J. Nesbit and Worthington, J\u2019s) </em>thereupon adjudged the petitioner to be a slave, when she appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b183-6\">This cause was argued before Archer, Dorsey, and Spence, Judges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-7\">Walsh, for the appellant, contended, for the reversal of the judgment on the following grounds:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-8\">1. That <em>Mrs. Dali </em>was at the time of the execution of her will, competent to confer freedom upon <em>JYegro Harriet, </em>she having at the time a title to her: because there is no proof in the cause of the acceptance of the trusts by the parties in the two deeds relied upon by the defendant, and even if said trusts were accepted, the devise by <em>Mrs. Dali </em>to the defendant, connected with the <em>fact of Harriet </em>being appraised as the property of <em>Mrs. Doll, </em>and taken in possession by the defendant, operated as a foreclosure of her mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-9\"><em>2. </em>That the defendant having accepted the devises contained in the will is not competent to set up any title in opposition to the will; and he would have been bound in the event of the trustees making any demand, to plead limitations to protect the freedom of the negro. The proof shows that such a plea could have been maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>3. That the defendant by procuring the supposed title of <em>Mrs. Sterett </em>or her trustees, violated his duty as executor of said will, and omitted entirely the requisites of the act of 1817, ch. 112.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-5\">4. That tbe proof in the cause shews that he claims the girl as a slave for life belonging to himself, and had at the time of the filing of this petition the intention to, sell her out of the state, and there is no proof of any bill of sale in compliance with the provisions of the act of 1817.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">5. That the sale to <em>Ridgely </em>was so far as he is concerned, fraudulent and void, being in fact the sale of a negro for a term of years without the requisite demanded by said act of 1817. Another deed of all his personal property to <em>Charles Sterett Ridgely, </em>which is also for a valuable consideration in trust for the separate use of the said <em>Maria Sterett. </em>After the execution of both these deeds, <em>James Sterett </em>on the 20th April, 1823, by deed of mortgage, mortgaged <em>Negro Harriet </em>to <em>Eleanor Dali, </em>to secure payment of a certain sum of money on or before the 1st of January, 1826, with a clause in the mortgage deed under which the mortgagor was to retain possession of the property until default should be made, in the payment of the sum of money on the 1st January, 1826.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\"><em>Eleanor Dali </em>never at any time took possession of <em>Harriet, </em>who continued to live with her grandmother, who was a slave to <em>Mr. Sterett, </em>but lived with her son, a free man, until after the death of <em>Mrs. Dali. </em>The court therefore' erred in their judgment in directing the negro to be restored to the defendant, because the judgment should have been either in favour of the claim of the petitioner to freedom, or that the said negro should be sold for the benefit of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">6. The deed to <em>James Gittings </em>vested no title in him, not being acknowledged before an officer having authority to take the acknowledgment, at least the acknowledgment on its face does not state the official character of the officer before whom it was made. He was not described as judge or justice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>He cited: <em>Allender vs. </em>Riston, 2 <em>Gill and John. </em>98. <em>Seimer vs. Seimer and </em>wife, <em>Ib. </em>105. 1817, <em>ch. </em>112, <em>sec. </em>4 <em>and 5.

Evans, contended on behalf of the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-8\">1. That <em>Harriet </em>did not belong to <em>Mrs. Dall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-9\"><em>2. </em>That <em>Mrs. Dali </em>had no right to manumit <em>Harriet.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-10\">3. That <em>Harriet </em>is not now free. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-11\">4. That under the act of assembly under which the appel-</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-12\">lant filed her petition, 1817, ch. 112, sec. 5, no appeal lies to this court; that is, that this court has no jurisdiction of this case in any shape, but all objections as to the mode of bringing the matter before them, if in any mode it can be brought up are expressly waived. He cited: 1715, <em>ch. </em>44, <em>sec. </em>2. 1796, <em>ch. </em>67, <em>sec. </em>13. <em>Ford vs. Philpot, </em>5 <em>Har. and John. </em>315. 1812, <em>ch. </em>117.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b185-15\">Dorsey, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIk\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">The proceedings in this case have been most irregularly conducted, and under any modification which has been given to them, it is difficult to conceive upon what grounds a successful result to the petitioner\u2019s application could have been anticipated. The petition upon its face presents no such case as would have justified the interference of a court of justice, and either upon demurrer or suggestion to the court, it ought to have been dismissed. None of the provisions of the act of 1817, ch. 112, which have been relied on, can be invoked to the support of such a petition. Assuming the truth of all its statements, and the absence of all the other proof to be found in the record, and there is no law in this state which in such a case would warrant an interference with the rights of the slaveholder in executing the designs imputed to him by the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">As if foreseeing the utter inability of sustaining this petition under the act of 1817, on which it was predicated, the petitioner\u2019s counsel promptly availed themselves of an opportunity afforded by the appellee, and join issue upon the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tioner\u2019s right to freedom \u2014 thus abandoning all the grounds assumed by the petition, and asserting a right wholly inconsistent with its allegations. The judgment of the court could not have been otherwise than against her, as conceding her to have been the absolute property of <em>Mrs. -Dali, </em>by the instrument of her emancipation, she was a slave for three years yet to come. But-supposing that obstacle to be removed, the decision of the court must have been the same. By the proof in the cause the'petitioner was not the slave of <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>and therefore derived no title to freedom under her will. But it is insisted that the appellee being the executor of <em>Mrs. Dali, </em>and having returned the petitioner as her slave in the inventory of her effects, is estopped from shewing that the appellant was the slave.of another. \u2019 There is no such estoppel ' in the case. The executor is' not concluded by the inventory, nor is it conclusive upon any body else \u2014 he may at any time upon proof of the error obtain a credit in his settlements with the Orphans\u2019 court for the appraisement of the petitioner, or he may obtain the same allowance when called on to account either by the creditors or distributees of <em>his </em>testatrix. The privilege of establishing the same fact cannot be denied him in the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">.It might be inferred from the argument. in behalf of the appellant, that the court below were called on to decide upon the rights of the appellee to hold the petitioner in slavery, and not the title of the petitioner to freedom. Such is not the issue. The question is, is the petitioner free ? No matter how destitute of right may be the claim of him who now seeks to detain her in bondage, if found to be the slave of any body, the judgment of the court must be against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
