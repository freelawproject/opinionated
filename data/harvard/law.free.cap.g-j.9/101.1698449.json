The defendant then gave in evidence, certain proceedings on the equity side of <em>Charles </em>county court, by <em>Sarah Maddox, </em>against the plaintiff <em>Morris, </em>in which the said <em>Sarah Maddox </em>recognized her conveyance to the said <em>William Morris, </em>in trust, and her consent to a sale of said negroes, on condition that $1,000 of the money should be reserved for her especial use and benefit, and vested accordingly, that said <em>Morris </em>had neglected to pay said $1,000. On the 9th June, 1824, it appeared in said cause that, the said <em>Morris </em>was decreed to pay said <em>Sarah, $654 20, </em>with interest from 31st January, 1818.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">The plaintiff then gave in evidence, the bill of interpleader of <em>Samuel Chapman, </em>and the answer thereto, in which <em>Chapman </em>claimed to receive from <em>Morris </em>$600, of the fund in controversy \u2014 and also gave in evidence that the money decreed to be paid by <em>W. Morris </em>to <em>Sarah Maddox, </em>was paid to her, and his answer to her bill showing payments to the amount of $892 90, and that the said sum was allowed to him in the settlement with <em>Sarah Maddox.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">The plaintiff further gave in evidence, that at or about the time of the sale of the said negroes, there was an agreement between all the persons concerned, that $1,000, of the proceeds of said sale of negroes, -was to be reserved by said <em>Morris, </em>and to be applied to the purchase of a house and lot in <em>Port Tobacco. </em>That although <em>Morris </em>frequently saw articles delivered by the defendant, at the tavern kept by said <em>John Maddox, </em>yet it was not known to said <em>Morris, </em>so far as said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>witness can speak, how or out of what fund the same were to be paid for; he further prov\u00e9d that said Chapman, at the times when said articles were delivered, and during the time said <em>Maddox </em>was keeping tavern, dealt largely in said tavern, and had a large account in said tavern, to furnish which said articles were delivered. \u2014 And the defendant gave in evidence that, the contract for the reservation of '$&gt;1,000, was agreed to be rescinded by <em>Mrs. Maddox, </em>and said <em>Chapman, </em>though he does not know whether <em>Morris </em>knew that fact, and further gave in evidence by the same witness, that <em>Mr. Maddox </em>was largely indebted in .house rent- to the said <em>Chapman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, if they shall find from the evidence, that the proceeds of said negroes- came into the hands of the said defendant\u2019s intestate, by and with the permission of said <em>Sarah Maddox ; </em>that then the plaintiff,cannot support the action on the count for money had and received, the said <em>Sarah Maddox </em>having the uncontrolled agency of the fund, and consenting that the said <em>Chapman </em>should receive the same. He, the said <em>Chapman, </em>is only responsible to the said <em>Sarah Maddox ; </em>and that the plaintiff cannot recover, unless the jury further believe from the evidence, that the trustee had made advances on the faith of the trust fund, to the amount thereof, which have not been allowed to him; which prayer and direction the court refused to give, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The jury found a verdict, fipon which the court gave judgment, for the plaintiff, f1,879 75, on which this appeal was taken,-</summary>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b110-7\">The cause was argued before Archer, Dorsey, and Chambers, Judges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-8\">T. S. Alexander, for the appellants, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">1. That the trust reposed in the appellee by <em>Mrs. Ware, </em>now <em>Maddox, </em>being by. parol only, and the . negroes having been delivered by the appellee to the- appellant\u2019s intestate, <em>to he sold </em>with, <em>the consent of Mrs. Ware, </em>the , said intestate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>thereby substituted as trustee for <em>Mrs. Ware, </em>and became responsible to her only for the discharge of his trust, and at all events was not liable to be sued by the appellee as for <em>money had and received </em>to his use. 9 <em>East. </em>378. 9 <em>Con. Ch. R. </em>1. <em>Price and Nesbit vs. Bigham, </em>7 <em>Har. and John. </em>319. 1 <em>Mad. Ch. Pr. </em>474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">2. Because if said intestate was liable to the appellee at all, such liability was limited in extent to the liability of the appellee over to the said <em>Mrs. Ware, </em>and therefore upon the ease attempted to be made, the appellee ought to have been permitted to recover of the appellant no more than he had paid or was bound to pay to <em>Mrs. Ware.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">3. Because the payments made by the appellant\u2019s intestate to <em>Mrs. Ware, </em>with the consent of the appellee, were good payments in law and ought to have been allowed as such in the present action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-8\">J. Johnson, for the appellee, maintained:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">1. That it appearing from the evidence, that the intestate of the appellant sold the negroes in question, and received the money for them as the agent of the appellee, he was liable to the latter in an action for money had and received; the more especially, as the record discloses the fact, that the appellee has actually been compelled to pay the same to <em>Mrs. Maddox </em>by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">2. That though the record shows the amount of the principal sum, decreed by the <em>Charles </em>county court in the case of <em>Maddox </em>against the appellee, there is nothing by which it can be ascertained how much was actually paid by the latter, including interest, costs, and other expenses attending the defence of said suit, all of which were proper subjects for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-11\">3. That no question affecting the extent of the defendant\u2019s liability is presented by the exception taken by him in the court below, and consequently none such can be raised here. He cited: 2 <em>Com. on Cont. </em>1. <em>Murphy vs. Baron, </em>1 <em>Har. and Gill, </em>258. <em>Com. Dig. Assumpsit, letter A. P. </em>1. <em>Long-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>champ vs. Kenny, </em>1 <em>Doug. </em>138. <em>Moses vs. McFerlan, </em>2 <em>Burr, </em>1009. <em>Grahame </em>&amp; <em>Parris vs. Harris, et al, </em>5 <em>Gill and John, </em>489.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-4\">Archer, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Alc\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The prayer of the plaintiff is somewhat ambiguously-worded, but as we understand, it, it embraces two propositions. <em>First </em>\u2014 the general proposition that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover if the proceeds came into the hands of the intestate by the consent of <em>Mrs. Maddox, </em>the <em>cestui que trust; </em>and <em>secondly, </em>that the plaintiff could only recover in case the jury believed that , the plaintiff had made advances on the faith of the trust fund, to the amount thereof, which have not been allowed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We think the court were right in rejecting these prayers. The defendant\u2019s intestate was appointed to sell these negroes by the plaintiff, with the consent of <em>Mrs. Maddox, </em>but that fact alone would not release <em>Morris </em>from his responsibility as a trustee. To accomplish this purpose the prayer should have gone further, and have put it to the jury to find the fact that she had consented to look to -the defendant\u2019s intestate for the proceeds. She might have consented to his agency in the sale, knowing his responsibility to her trustee, without meaning in any degree to have looked to him for the proceeds, otherwise than through her trustee; and there is evidence to go to the jury from which this fact might have been inferred. It would therefore have been erroneous to have dir'ected the jury that the reception of the proceeds by consent of <em>Mrs. Maddox, </em>would prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The second proposition is not sustained, because, if <em>Chapman </em>was appointed the'plaintiff\u2019s agent to sell these negroes, and there is evidence to go to the jury to prove this, still notwithstanding her consent that <em>Chapman </em>should sell the negroes, she may- have looked to the responsibility of her trustee, as <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>principal, and may have given her consent, to such agency, with no view to the substitution of a new trustee. In this point of view the right of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tiff\u2019s recovery could not be made to depend upon his advances to <em>Mrs. Maddox </em>upon the faith of the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
