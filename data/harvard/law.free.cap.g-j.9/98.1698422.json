That <em>Jacob Sellers, </em>a brother of the deceased, hath obtained letters of administration on the estate of the said deceased without the knowledge of petitioner. That since the grant of letters said will has been left for probat, and is prayed to be taken as a part of this petition. Prayer that the will may be admitted to probatf \u2014 that letters of administration may be granted to petitioner, the sole legatee in the will \u2014 and that the letters of the appellee may be revoked, for whom process was also prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">The said appellee appeared, and the subscribing witness to said paper was offered as a witness by the appellant to prove the execution of the same. The appellee objected to the witness being sworn and examined, upon the ground that the paper in question did not upon its face purport to be a will, and that therefore the court could not hear testimony to establish it as such. The appellant also offered to prove by the same witness, conversations of the deceased, made at the time of executing the said paper, and from other circumstances, that the said <em>Philip Sellers </em>made and executed the said paper as and for his last will and testament, and intended it as such. The same objections being made, the Orphans\u2019 court held, that the paper was not upon its face a testamentary paper, but an assignment and gift, intended to be consummated in the life-time of <em>Philip Sellers, </em>as contended for by the appellee\u2019s counsel,, and that no parol testimony could be received for the purpose of proving that the said paper was intended by the said <em>Philip Sellers, </em>as testamentary, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>that the paper be rejected and not admitted to probat. The said <em>George Wareham </em>appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b106-5\">The cause was argued before Stephen, Archer, Dorsey, Chambers, and Spence, Judges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-6\">James Raymond, for the appellant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">That the paper had all the formalities of a will in its execution, disposing of personal property. <em>Wagner vs. McDonald, 2 Har. and John. </em>346. <em>Brown's ex'r vs. Tilden, et ux, </em>5 <em>Har. and John. </em>371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">The <em>animus testandi </em>may be established by parol proof, and need not appear on the face of the paper. It is better proved by witnesses than by the .contents of the paper. Publication is proved by parol. <em>Williams on </em>Ex'rs, 53, 54. 1 <em>Phillips, 32, </em>53. The disposing words must be reduced to writing, and proof may be given of who made them, and whether made as a last will. <em>Sanford vs. Vaughan, et al, </em>1 <em>Ecc. Rep. </em>28. The paper contains intrinsic evidence that it was made as a will. The words, this will certify \u2014 to whom? \u2014to futurity \u2014 to a court of justice. It is of all his personal property. The cases which relate to intrinsic evidence on this head are <em>White vs. Helmes, </em>1 <em>McCord, </em>430. 8 <em>Viner. Tit. Dev. Lyles et al vs. Lyles et al, 2 Nott. and McCord, </em>531.

A reference to another will has been held sufficient \u2014 but here there was nothing to lead the mind to that event. <em>Glynn vs. Oglander, 2 Hagg. Ecc. Rep. </em>428. In 4 <em>Ecc.
