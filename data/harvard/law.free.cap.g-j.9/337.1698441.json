The defendants, by their counsel, prayed the court further to instruct the jury, that if they believe from the evidence, that the amount of particular average loss sustained by the plaintiff on the six cases of merchandise which were damaged in the course of being landed at <em>Tampico, </em>was not to the amount of five per centum on $57,740 93, being the whole amount at risk when the policy attached, and that the voyage was in fact from <em>Baltimore </em>to <em>Tampico, </em>and back again to <em>Baltimore, </em>then the plaintiff is not entitled to <em>recover; </em>notwithstanding the jury may also believe, from the evidence, that at the time of the happening of the loss, a large part of the outward cargo had been safely landed, and that there was at that time on board goods to the amount of only $18,576.
