The petition alleged generally that the appellant was a free woman according to the laws of the state \u2014 that she ought to be free, and was now held in service by the appellee \u2014 prayer for a judgment according to the law and evidence. The appellee denied her right to freedom, on which issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-11\">At the trial of the cause the petitioner proved by <em>P.

The defendant also proved his bill of sale for said petitioner, dated -26th April, 1824.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\">The defendant then offered to read from the records of <em>Allegany </em>county,-the following list, to-wit: ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">\u201cA list of slaves brought into this <em>State </em>from the <em>State of Virginia, </em>to work' on his farm in <em>Allegany county, Maryland, </em>to wit: One negro woman, <em>Peggy </em>\u2014 16 years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\"><em>15th June, </em>1824.

The county court (A. <em>Shriver and T.

'That the list, a copy, of which was read to the jury from the records of <em>Allegany </em>county court, was not in conformity with the acts of 1796, ch. 67; 1818, ch. 201; 1823, ch; 87j and consequently was inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-11\">2. That under the last mentioned act, it was necessary that it should appear upon the face of the list, that the negro woman (the appellant) before her introduction into this state had -been a resident of some one. of the <em>United States, </em>and that the list should also state the manner in which the appellee acquired title to the appellant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-12\">R. Johnson and W. Price, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-13\">It is perfectly clear by the very words of the act of 1823, ch. 87, that independent of any particular mode of acquisition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>any citizen of <em>Maryland </em>has a right to import into the state a slave acquired by him in any lawful manner whatever, subject only to the obligation of recording within the period prescribed by the act of 1796, ch. 67, a list of the slave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-5\">The only question in the case is whether, where the acquisition is neither by will nor in right of marriage, the list alluded,to is to contain a statement of the importer\u2019s title? If it is, it is not because the act of 1823 in terms require it, but because it provides that the list is to be rendered <em>in the manner </em>directed by the act of 1796, for although the acts of 1804 and 1818, are also referred to, they can have no bearing upon the question, they themselves depending entirely upon the act of 1796.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">The object of the provision of the act of 1796, that the list should contain a statement of the importer\u2019s title, was because the authority to import by that act was not a general one, but confined only to two cases of acquisition, arid the list was therefore required to contain evidence that the party was within the act. This necessity was of course at an end, when the privilege was extended to every species of ownership, and no <em>object </em>was <em>to be </em>obtained <em>except </em>what the mere list would accomplish. <em>That </em>was still derrianded as evidence that the provisions in the act of 1823, as to disposition here by sale, or by manumission, should not be violated. If a statement of the title is to be made, it is of course to give the true nature of the title, and when, as in this case, it is not by devise or marriage, it is not to contain a statement of either title, and if not, and the real title is to be set forth; how is it to be set forth ? what is it to embrace ? how much of the title is to be designated ? The act of 1823 is silent upon the subject; and the very silence proves that nothing more was intended than a <em>mere list, </em>it not being to be presumed, that the legislature were ignorant, that in such a case the act of 1796, and the other acts referred to gave no rule.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-7\">Stephen, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2L\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">After a careful examination of the several acts of assembly referred to in the argument, and which have a bearing upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the merits of this case, we have come to the conclusion, that there is no error in the judgme'ht of the court below, and that the same ought to be affirmed. The' act of 1796, ch. 67, sec. 1, contains a general' prohibition against importing or bringing into this'state of any negro, mulatto, or other slaves, for sale or to reside, and provides, that if such inhibition should be violated, the slave or slaves so brought in or imported should be free. The subsequent sections of this law contain certain relaxations of the rigour of this rule, and grant permission to the. owners of slaves to bring them into this state, where their titles have be\u00e9n acquired in a certain specified manner. The 8th section provides that if slaves are brought into this state, under the privilege thereby granted,, that isj by a person owning land in an adjoining state, and the owner acquired title to such slave or slaves, by marriage, or by will; the testator\u2019s name; the date of the will; and the place where recorded, shall be inserted in the list to be delivered to the clerk of the county ; and in case he derive title-from marriage, the name of the person married is likewise required to be inserted in such list. The <em>list is </em>required to be in writing, and to contain the names, sexes and ages of the slaves, and is to be signed by the owner, his overseer, or . agent, and to be delivered to the clerk of the county to be recorded within three months after the bringing in or importation of such slave or slaves into this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The 11th section authorizes any citizen of this state who has acquired title to a slave or slaves by marriage, bequest, in course of distribution or as guardian,-to bring such slave or slaves into this state, for the purpose of working or employing such slave or slaves on his land in this state, and not for sale, provided that a list of the slaves so brought in be rendered in the manner directed in the <em>eighth </em>section. The right of sale is given to the owner after the slaves have been residents of this state for the period of three years after the importation. This section requires that a list shall be rendered in the manner directed in' the'' <em>eighth </em>section, and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the privilege is a limited one, a statement of the title in the list would seem to be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The privilege granted by the act of 1818, ch. 201, is nearly similar to the 11th section of the act of 1796 ; and varies only in that provision of it, which restricts or confines the employment of the slave when brought into this state, to the owner\u2019s own immediate service.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">By the provision of the act of 1823, ch. 87, the policy of the state upon this subject seems to have undergone a very material change; for by its enactments, the door is thrown entirely open, and all restrictions as to the manner of acquiring title are removed. It provides .that if any citizen of this state, hath acquired or shall acquire, property in any slave or slaves being residents of any of the <em>United States, </em>by marriage, bequest, course of distribution, or as guardian, or by gift, or any other lawful manner, such citizen may at any time remove and bring such slave or slaves, for the purpose only of working or employing such slave or slaves within this state for his own immediate service, and not for any other purpose; provided that, a list of such slave or slaves be rendered in the manner directed by the act of 1796, ch. 67, and the act of 1804, ch. 90, and the act of 1818, ch. 201, to which this act is a supplement. By the provisions of this act, it is manifest, that no regard is had to the manner in which the title originated, or how it was acquired; if it was a lawful title, the requirements of the law are satisfied. The right of removal exists, provided a list be rendered in the manner therein directed. That list we think would be complete and perfect, and if conformed to all the requisitions of the pre-existing laws in every particular, except the statement of the manner of acquiring the title. That statement we think is clearly dispensed with, by the act of 1823, upon every principle of sound and rational construction. While the title which authorized the removal of negroes into this state was special and defined, the reason for specifying the title in the list is apparent, and founded upon good and substantial reasons; but when the right became unlimited, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>difficult to conceive a reason which would influence the legislature to require its introduction into' that document. So long as the privilege was special and restricted, it might be intended not only to prevent frauds upon the law, but to furnish evidence of its violation in case.its provisions should be infringed. But after the limitation was removed, and the right became a general one, the \u25a0 reason ceased to operate; and the requirement of the pre-existing law ceased with it. We therefore thinlr that the opinion of the court below in that respect was correct, and the admissibility of the list as evidence not being objected to upon any other ground, we affirm their judgment. \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">JUDGMENT affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
