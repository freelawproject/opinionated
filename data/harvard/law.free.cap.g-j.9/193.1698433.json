That no decree having passed for the sale of the real estate of <em>John Benson, </em>in the lifetime of his daughter <em>Elizabeth, </em>her interest therein descended to her heirs at law, subject to any debts which she may have contracted <em>clum sola. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Rogers vs. Krebs, </em>5 <em>Har. and John. </em>31. <em>Leadenham vs. Nicholson, </em>1 <em>Har. and Gill, </em>267.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-5\">2. That her personal estate and choses in action, if she had any, passed to her surviving husband, <em>John </em>Jarboe, and that he is not, in respect of them, answerable to the creditors who became such before her intermarriage with him. <em>Act of </em>1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub. ch. </em>5, <em>sec. </em>8. <em>Forbes vs. </em>Phipps, 1 <em>Eden, </em>502.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">3. That for the purpose of entertaining the petition, it sufficiently appears, that her said husband had no assets, even if, in respect of them, he would be liable to her creditors^ \u2014 and</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">4th. That as the case stood, the chancellor had jurisdiction to give the appellant the relief asked for, and consequently erred in dismissing his petition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-8\">No counsel argued for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b203-9\">Archer, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aho\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The petitioner alleging himself to be a creditor of <em>Elizabeth Jarboe, </em>one of the heirs at law of <em>John Benson, </em>whose estate was sought to be sold by the complainants, appears to us to have presented a <em>prima facie </em>case, for the interposition of a court of equity, and to have presented it in a competent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Upon the establishment of his claim, we could see no possible objection to the chancellor\u2019s assuming jurisdiction, unless he ought to have sought relief by an original bill instead of a petition. The appellant has prayed a <em>subpoena </em>against <em>John Jarboe, </em>who was not a party to the proceedings in which the petition was filed, nor does it appear that he was a necessary party, either to the bill or petition; for it is not apparent that he was entitled to be considered as a tenant by the courtesy, and if he was not, he had no interest in either controversy, and the petitioner might have dismissed the petition as to him, and proceeded against the other persons interested, for whom he sought an answer. But if he ought to have been a party to the original bill, it could not be objected, that he had made him a party to the petition, as in that case he might have had an interest in resisting the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>A petition .may not in all cases be the proper course to reach a fund in chancery: as where new parties are to be made, not necessary to have been .made to the original bill, and where the investigation may involve inquiries calculated, by protracting the cause, to delay other parties, not having an interest in such controversy. But w\u00e9 think it may be safely stated as a general rule, that a petition is the proper mode of affecting \u00e1 fund in equity where no other parties are to be brought in to litigate the application, than such as are, or ought to have been parties to the original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A decree will be signed, reversing the\u2019decree of the chancellor, dismissing the petition of the appellant, and the cause will be remanded- to the chancellor for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
