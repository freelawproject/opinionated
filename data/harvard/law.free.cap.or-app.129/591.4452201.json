ORS 163.375; ORS 163.365. We review <em>de novo, </em>ORS 419A.200(5); ORS 19.125(3), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The court\u2019s findings were based on acts that occurred on two separate occasions with different victims. We first address child\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he committed rape in the first degree. ORS 163.375.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, child argues that the court erred in finding that the sexual intercourse was not consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">On March 26, 1992, child had sexual intercourse with Kelly, a 15-year-old girl, while she was bound to a bed post. Kelly testified that she did not consent to being tied up or to having sexual intercourse. The court found that there was not a consensual sexual relationship and that there was forcible compulsion. After reviewing the record, we agree that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that child committed the equivalent of rape in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Child next argues that he could not be adjudicated to have committed rape in the second degree, ORS 163.365, because he was less than three years older than Amanda, the 13-year-old victim. The success of this argument turns on the interplay of ORS 163.365, ORS 163.315, and ORS 163.345(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">ORS 163.365(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">\u201cA person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the second degree if the other person is under 14 years of age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ORS 163.315 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201cA person is considered incapable of consenting to a sexual act if the person is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201c(1) Under 18 years of age[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">ORS 163.345(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\u201cIn any prosecution under * * * ORS 163.365 * * * in which the victim\u2019s lack of consent was due <em>solely to incapacity to consent by reason of being less than a specified age, </em>it is a defense that the actor was less than three years older than the victim at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Child engaged in intercourse with Amanda, a person under 14 years of age. He argues, however, that under ORS 163.345(1), the fact that he was less than three years older than Amanda vitiates any lack of consent and, thus, affords a complete defense to adjudication under ORS 163.365.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Child\u2019s reading of ORS 163.345(1) is overbroad. That statute provides a defense when the alleged lack of consent is based solely on incapacity due to the victim\u2019s age. Nothing more. It is inapposite when there is an <em>actual </em>lack of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Thus, a person less than three years older than the victim can be convicted, or adjudicated, of rape in the second degree if there was an actual lack of consent. After carefully reviewing the record <em>de novo, </em>and giving appropriate weight to the trial court\u2019s express determinations of witness credibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we find that the evidence proves Amanda\u2019s actual lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. The court did not err in finding child within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> ORS 163.375(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">\u201cA person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">\u201c(a) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the person[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">ORS 163.305(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">\u201c \u2018Forcible compulsion\u2019 means physical force that overcomes earnest resistance; or a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of immediate or future death or physical injury to self or another person, or in fear that the person or another person will immediately or in the future be kidnapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-12\"> <em>See State ex rel Juv.
