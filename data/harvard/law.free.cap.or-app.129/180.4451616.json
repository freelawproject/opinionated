The two cases have been consolidated for purposes of appeal. Defendant assigns error to the court\u2019s admission of hearsay statements made by one of the victims and to the court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of sex abuse by people other than defendant. We reverse one count and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Defendant was convicted of sexually abusing his two daughters, L., age 4, and N., age 2. The trial court allowed four witnesses to testify to statements that L. made about the alleged abuse of herself and of N. Both girls were removed from their mother\u2019s home and placed in foster care in March 1990. Several months later, they began overnight visits with defendant. The girls\u2019 foster mother, Carolyn Thompson, testified that, following the second overnight visit with defendant, she saw L. acting out sexual intercourse with a two-year-old boy. Thompson testified that L. said she learned the behavior from \u201c[m]y Daddy and Richard [defendant\u2019s seventeen-year-old son]\u201d and \u201c[t]hey take their clothes off and they get on top of me and they go ah, ah, ah.\u201d Thompson also testified that, two days later, she saw L. rubbing her vaginal area and that L. said the area hurt \u201cbecause my Daddy done something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Dr. Rabin, the girls\u2019 pediatrician, testified that L.\u2019s hymenal opening was larger than the upper limits of what is considered \u201cnormal\u201d for a child her age and that N.\u2019s hymen was scarred, indicating a tear. Rabin also testified that L. told her she had been touched in her vaginal area by defendant, that defendant \u201churt\u201d her \u201cthere\u201d and that she had seen the \u201cprivates\u201d of defendant and Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Carol Rodriguez of Children\u2019s Services Division (CSD) testified that L. told her \u201cmy Dad and Richard\u201d were trying to touch her \u201cprivate parts.\u201d Rodriguez also testified that, when asked to show with dolls how defendant touched her, L. took the clothes off of the man doll and girl doll, put them in a position indicating sexual intercourse and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>spread the legs of the male doll and rubbed it against her own vaginal area. Rodriguez testified that L. said Richard touched her in the same way and that she said \u201cshe was going to be in big trouble because her daddy had told her so.\u201d L. also told Rodriguez that defendant and Richard had touched N.\u2019s vaginal area with their hands. Deputy Haferkamp testified that L. repeated her statements and the doll demonstration for him when Rodriguez asked her to.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The state moved before trial to admit L.\u2019s statements pursuant to OEC 803(18a)(b) (since amended Or Laws 1991, ch. 391, \u00a7 1), which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cA statement made by a child victim who is under 10 years of age, which statement describes an act of sexual conduct performed with or on the child by another, is not excluded * * * if the proponent of admissibility establishes to the satisfaction of the court outside the presence of the jury, if any, that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide substantial indicia of reliability. However, when the child is unavailable as a witness, the statement may be admitted in evidence only if there is corroborative evidence of the act of sexual conduct and of the defendant\u2019s participation in the conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The court found L. unavailable to testify.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the state was required to establish both that \u201cthe time, content and circumstances of the statement^] provide indicia of reliability\u201d and that \u201cthere is corroborative evidence of the act of sexual conduct and of the defendant\u2019s participation in the conduct.\u201d OEC 803(18a)(b). Whether hearsay statements meet the requirements for admission under 803(18a)(b) is a preliminary question of fact for the trial court. <em>State v. Booth, </em>124 Or App 282, 289, 862 P2d 518 (1993), <em>rev den </em>319 Or 81 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Defendant argues that L.\u2019s statements describing the abuse of both girls are not rehable and, thus, violate his right to confront witnesses guaranteed by Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Statements that meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>reliability standard of OEC 803(18a)(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are inherently trustworthy and can be admitted without violating a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. <em>State v. Renly, </em>111 Or App 453, 461, 827 P2d 1345 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The trial court discussed, on the record, the factors that supported reliability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cThe child\u2019s personal knowledge of the event: ** * * she clearly had personal knowledge about the event. She described what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201cThe age and maturity of the child: She\u2019s four. She has a little speech impediment, but I don\u2019t know she acted a lot \u2014 much different than many a four-year-old. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">\u201cThe credibility of the person testifying about the statement: * * * all the witnesses were credible. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\u2018 \u2018There\u2019s no motive on the part of the child that I see. This was a child that was very happy to see her dad, was smiling at him and wanted to go sit by him * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cThe timing of the child\u2019s statement: There was a weekend visitation with the father and two days later * * * she\u2019s doing things that make it appear that something has happened to her. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">\u201cSeveral people heard the statement. Four people have testified to a statement being made. * * * She clearly had discomfort * * * talking about the events * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">CC$ <em>% </em>$ ijc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cHer young age makes it unlikely that she would fabricate this statement. * * * There was [sic] no internal inconsistencies, <footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> The statement was coherent and her use of terminology was age appropriate according to the doctor * * * who interviews many children that age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Defendant argues that many of these findings are undermined by the court\u2019s determination that L. was unavailable to testify in part because she did not fully understand the oath. However, the credibility of the declarant and the reliability of specific statements of the declarant are distinct issues. <em>See State v. Alvarez, </em>308 Or 143, 147, 776 P2d 1283 (1989) (the reliability of hearsay statements from an informant may be established by showing either that the informant is credible or that the statements are rehable). The record supports the court\u2019s finding that L.\u2019s statements were reliable. <em>See State v. Booth, supra, </em>124 Or App at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Defendant also argues that there was insufficient corroboration of L.\u2019s statements. \u201cCorroboration is an additional prerequisite that the legislature included * * * to ensure that an accused not be convicted solely on the basis of hearsay.\u201d <em>State v. Renly, supra, </em>111 Or App at 463. Corroborating evidence can include \u201ca confession, an eye witness account, physical evidence and evidence showing that the accused had access to the purported victim.\u201d Ill Or App at 463. Rabin\u2019s testimony that L. had an enlarged hymenal opening, consistent with a history of sex abuse, and L.\u2019s sexual \u201cacting out\u201d corroborate the act of sexual conduct. Further corroboration flows from the timing of L.\u2019s statements, defendant\u2019s opportunity to commit the abuse, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>fact that the girls were not alone for extended periods of time with anyone except defendant and the foster mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Because L. \u2019s statements were reliable and were sufficiently corroborated, the trial court properly admitted L.\u2019s statements describing defendant\u2019s abuse of L. However, that does not conclude our inquiry concerning the admission of L.\u2019s hearsay statements describing abuse of <em>N. </em>In particular, defendant argues that those statements were not admissible because they did not \u201cdescribe an act of sexual conduct performed with or on the child [declarant] by another * * OEC 803(18a)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The state contends that we should not reach this argument because it was not raised in the trial court. Defendant argued to the trial court that L.\u2019s statements, including those pertaining to abuse of N., could not be admitted under OEC 803(18a)(b) because they were unreliable and not corroborated, but did not make the particular argument he now raises. In <em>State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183, 188, 766 P2d 373 (1988), the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201cWe have previously drawn attention to the distinctions between raising an <em>issue </em>at trial, identifying a <em>source </em>for a claimed position, and making a particular <em>argument. </em>* * * The first ordinarily is essential, the second less so, the third least. * * * Efficient procedures are instruments for, not obstacles to, deciding the merits, particularly when the alternative is a criminal conviction that lacks a basis in law or in fact.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Here, defendant raised the <em>issue </em>and the <em>source </em>of his position by arguing that the hearsay statements the state sought to admit did not satisfy the requirements of OEC 803(18a)(b) and were not otherwise admissible. Although defendant made different arguments for why this exception to the hearsay rule should not apply, he adequately preserved the issue for appeal, and we consider its merits. <em>See State v. Cooper, </em>120 Or App 490, 493, 852 P2d 948 (1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>319 Or 162, 165 n 1, 874 P2d 822 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Carol Rodriguez of CSD testified that L. told her that defendant had touched N.\u2019s vagina. The trial court, over a defense objection, admitted that testimony under OEC 803(18a)(b) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u201cA statement made by a child victim * * * which statement describes an act of sexual conduct performed with or on the child by another * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The rule\u2019s language is not ambiguous. Its \u201cplain, natural and ordinary meaning,\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and </em>Industries, 317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), limits its hearsay exception to statements about \u201cfirst-party\u201d sexual conduct \u2014 i.e., conduct in which the child victim declarant was a direct (\u201cwith or on\u201d) participant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The state would have us read the rule as encompassing statements about \u2018\u2018third-party\u2019\u2019 sexual conduct \u2014 i.e., conduct the child may have observed. Indeed, the state would rewrite the rule to admit hearsay statements describing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cSexual conduct performed with or on the child by [the defendant], <em>or with or on another by the defendant in the child\u2019s presence </em>* * *.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">This stretches the language to the breaking point, and beyond. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (in construing statutes, judges are \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted\u201d). By admitting L.\u2019s hearsay statement about abuse of N., the trial court, in effect, permitted an incompetent four-year-old to testify about something that happened to her two-year-old sister. OEC 803(18a)(b) does not countenance that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">This error was not harmless. Rodriguez\u2019s testimony recounting L.\u2019s statement was the only direct evidence that defendant had abused N. and was, consequently, critical to the jury\u2019s consideration of that charge. Defendant\u2019s conviction for abuse of N. must be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Defendant next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow testimony that L. acted out sexual behavior before she began visiting defendant and that she told her foster mother and Rodriguez that her mother stuck a knife in her vagina. The state objected that admission of those statements would violate OEC 412. Following defendant\u2019s offer of proof, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201cThe statute [OEC 412], you know, clearly says that evidence of other sexual incidents are not admissible. But maybe in the overall context of \u2014 of this particular case the Court of Appeals will take a different view of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">OEC 412 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c(1) [I]n a prosecution for [certain sexual offenses, including first degree sexual abuse,] * * * reputation or opinion evidence of the past sexual behavior of an alleged victim of such crime is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201c(2) [E]vidence of a victim\u2019s past sexual behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is also not admissible, unless such evidence other than reputation or opinion evidence is [evidence that]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u2021 \u2021 ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201c(b)(B) Is necessary to rebut or explain scientific or medical evidence offered by the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Defendant moved to admit the statements as \u201crelevant to say that there could have been another perpetrator or, in the alternative for impeachment purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant further argued that evidence pertaining to another possible perpetrator was \u201cnecessary to rebut or explain\u201d Rabin\u2019s testimony that L. had an enlarged hymenal opening. OEC 412(2)(b)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">We need not consider the propriety of the trial court\u2019s application of OEC 412(2)(b)(B) because any alleged error was harmless. <em>See </em>OEC 103(1) (\u201c[e]videntiary error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>not presumed to be prejudicial\u201d). There is substantial and convincing evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt and little likelihood that the error affected the result. <em>See State v. Abercrombie, </em>108 Or App 447, 450, 816 P2d 656 (1991). L. consistently reported that defendant sexually abused her. Moreover, although the jury was aware of L.\u2019s repeated statements that defendant\u2019s son Richard had also sexually abused her, the jury still found defendant guilty. There is little, if any, likelihood that evidence of an additional perpetrator would have affected the jury\u2019s finding that defendant abused L.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In light of our disposition of the conviction for sexual abuse of L., the court properly revoked defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Reversed and remanded as to the conviction on Count 4; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> Sexual abuse in the first degree is now codified at ORS 163.427.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> The trial court found that L. was unavailable to testify because she was \u201cunable to communicate because of her fear\u201d and because the judge did not think that \u201cshe fully understands or comprehends the idea of what the concept of telling the truth is.\u201d Defendant does not challenge the finding of unavailability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> The version of OEC 803(18a)(b) relevant to this appeal instructs that, in determining whether the statement possessed indicia of reliability,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">\u201cthe court may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u201c(A) The child\u2019s personal knowledge of the event;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">\u201c(B) The age and maturity of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">\u201c(C) Certainty that the statement was made, including the credibility of the person testifying about the statement and any motive the person may have to falsify or distort the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">\u201c(D) Any apparent motive the child may have to falsify or distort the event</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">* * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-16\">\u201c(E) The timing of the child\u2019s statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-17\">\u201c(F) Whether more than one person heard the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-18\">\u201c(G) Whether the child was suffering pain or distress when making the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-19\">\u201c (H) The nature and duration of any alleged abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-20\">\u201c(I) Whether the child\u2019s young age makes it unlikely that the child fabricated a statement that represents a graphic, detailed account beyond the child\u2019s knowledge and experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-21\">\u201c(J) Whether the statement has internal consistency or coherence and uses terminology appropriate to the child\u2019s age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-22\">\u201c(K) Whether the statement is spontaneous or directly responsive to questions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-23\">\u201c(L) Whether the statement was elicited by leading questions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-24\">\u201c(M) Whether extrinsic evidence exists to show the accused\u2019s opportunity to commit the act to which the child\u2019s statement refers.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">4 Defendant argues that L.\u2019s statements about sexual contact were inconsistent with her acting out of sexual intercourse. L.\u2019s statements suggested both sexual intercourse and sexual contact. The court correctly determined that the statements contained no \u201cinternal inconsistencies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> We note that Washington law provides a similar exception for hearsay statements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cmade by a child when under the age of ten describing any act of sexual contact performed <em>with or on </em>the child by another, * * * not otherwise admissible by statute or court rule * * *.\u201d Wash Rev Code \u00a7 9A.44.120. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">That state has held that its statute \u201cdoes not by its terms apply to a statement by a child describing an act of sexual contact performed on a <em>different </em>child.\u201d <em>State v.

(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> It is by no means clear that the disputed testimony would be properly admitted even under the state\u2019s attenuated construction. Rodriguez did not testify that L. said that N. was abused in her presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b222-12\"> We note also that OEC 412(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">\u201c[T]he accused shall make a written motion to offer such evidence not later than 15 days before the date on which the trial in which such evidence is to be offered is scheduled to begin, except that the court may allow the motion to be made at a later date, including during trial, if the court determines either that the evidence is newly discovered and could not have been obtained earlier through the exercise of due diligence or that the issue to which such evidence relates has newly arisen in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">The state does not address whether defendant complied with this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b223-6\">RIGGS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATI\">concurring in part; dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">I agree with the majority that hearsay testimony about L.\u2019s recounting of defendant\u2019s conduct towards her was properly admitted under OEC 803(18a)(b). Consequently, I agree that defendant\u2019s conviction for sexual abuse of L. should be affirmed. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of OEC 803(18a)(b) and conclude that L.\u2019s statements describing abuse of N. were admissible. Therefore, I would also affirm defendant\u2019s conviction for sexual abuse of N.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In this case, we must interpret the language of OEC 803(18a)(b), \u201cstatement concerning] conduct <em>with </em>or on the child\u201d (emphasis supplied), to determine if it is broad enough to cover L.\u2019s statements about sexual conduct that occurred in her presence. Our goal in statutory interpretation is to discern the intent of the legislature, and the text of a statute is the best evidence of that intent. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). At this first level of analysis, we also examine the context of the statute and consider those rules of statutory construction that bear directly on how to read the text. 317 Or at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The majority concludes that OEC 803(18a)(b)\u2019s \u201c \u2018plain, natural and ordinary meaning\u2019 * * * limits its hearsay exception to statements about \u2018first-party\u2019 sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>conduct.\u201d 129 Or App at 187 (quoting PGE <em>v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, supra, </em>317 Or at 611). I disagree with that conclusion. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>lists at least 13 different senses of the word \u201cwith.\u201d The majority appears to read \u201cwith\u201d in OEC 803(18a)(b) to be \u201cused as a function word to indicate the object of attention, behavior, or feeling.\u201d I would read \u201cwith\u201d in a different sense of the word, one meaning \u201cin the company of: as companion of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2626 (3rd ed 1971). The \u201cplain, natural and ordinary meaning\u201d supports either reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">My reading, however, is supported by the context of the statute. The context of a statute includes other provisions of the same statute. <em>Sanders v. Oregon Pacific States Ins. Co., </em>314 Or 521, 527, 840 P2d 87 (1992). OEC 803(18a)(a) allows into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cA complaint of sexual misconduct made by the witness after the commission of the alleged offense. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, such evidence must be confined to the fact that the complaint was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Because defendant was charged with abusing both girls, L.\u2019s statements about N. are complaints of sexual misconduct made by a witness, and therefore admissible under OEC 803(18a)(a). L. is also a \u201cchild victim.\u201d L.\u2019s statements concerned conduct \u201cwith\u201d L., because they described abuse of both girls that occurred in L.\u2019s presence during the same period of time. The text and context of OEC 803(18a)(b) reflect an intent to allow this type of hearsay statement if the requirements of reliability and corroboration are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The rules of construction that bear directly on how to read statutory text also support my reading of the statute. The majority, fearing to \u201cinsert what has been omitted,\u201d ends up omitting what has been inserted and runs afoul of the statutory command in ORS 174.010. By refusing to accept a different sense of the word \u201cwith,\u201d the majority contends that a whole new clause would have to be inserted to deal with the situation in this case. Because ORS 174.010 prohibits the courts from inserting what has been omitted, the majority then concludes that the statute cannot be read to cover this situation. In so doing, the majority rewrites the statute to read, in effect, \u201cstatements concerning conduct * * * on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>child,\u201d omitting the disputed word \u201cwith.\u201d However, if one accepts that the \u201cplain, natural and ordinary meaning\u201d of \u201cwith\u201d encompasses \u201cin the company of,\u201d then nothing need be inserted or omitted. In addition, this reading would also comply with the rule of construction that, in construing a statute, every word should be given effect. <em>Sanders v. Oregon Pacific States Ins.
