In his petition Cuero argued that, at the time of his arrest, the government denied him the opportunity to speak with the Colombian Consulate, in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (\u201cVCCR\u201d), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261, and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The district court dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>his petition after finding that Cuero had failed to establish the requirements for applying \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">On appeal, Cuero argues that the district court (1) should have considered the merits of his VCCR claim because it asserted a violation of his \u201cbasic due process rights under the rules of the Vienna Convention\u201d; and (2) erred by concluding \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause was not satisfied. After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Typically, defendants must collaterally attack the validity of a federal conviction or sentence under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 944-45. Under limited circumstances, however, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">An application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">We have held that the savings clause applies only when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; <em>and </em>(3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365-66 (11th Cir.2003) (applying the three-part <em>Wojford </em>test). Moreover, a prisoner may not utilize \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause \u201cto escape the restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. Thus, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the AEDPA\u2019s successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">In <em>Darby, </em>we recently addressed the denial of a Jamaican citizen\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition which alleged a VCCR violation <em>identical </em>to the one Cuero asserts here. <em>See Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945-46 (addressing whether a \u00a7 2241 is the proper vehicle for a violation of Article 36 of the VCCR). We held that the prisoner was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255\u2019s saving clause for such a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 945. We even went on to observe that even if \u00a7 2241 was the proper vehicle to test individual rights under the VCCR, Darby could not get relief by filing a \u00a7 2241 petition because he failed to show that the violation \u201chad a prejudicial effect on his trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Cuero is not entitled to relief for several reasons. As a preliminary matter, given the denial of his \u00a7 2255 petition in a separate proceeding, it appears that Cuero has filed the present \u00a7 2241 petition in an effort to circumvent the rules limiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>scope of successive \u00a7 2255 motions, which he cannot do.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. Second, Cuero cannot meet the initial <em>Wofford </em>prong because he has not demonstrated that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, as for Cuero\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2241 is the exclusive or proper vehicle to assert a VCCR claim, <em>Darby </em>is dispositive. As was the case in <em>Darby, </em>Cuero has not shown that any alleged VCCR violation \u201chad a prejudicial effect on his trial.\u201d 405 F.3d at 946. For all of these reasons, the district court did not err by denying federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-15\">. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket sheets in the present matter and Case No. 04-CV-01779 reveals that, although Cuero had not yet filed a \u00a7 2255 petition when he filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, the \u00a7 2255 was decided and final on August 4, 2004, which was before the district court denied the \u00a7 2241 on December 14, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-24\">. As a result, we need not, and do not, address the remaining prongs. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
