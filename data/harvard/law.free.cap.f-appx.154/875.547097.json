Removal proceedings commenced after 1 April 1997; the permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), govern this petition. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Rico argues that he established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of (1) his political opinion, due to his affiliation with \u201cMovement Leaders in Action\u201d (LEA), a group belonging to the Colombian Liberal Party, and (2) his membership in a social group: Oasis, a gay/lesbian organization that helped bisexuals, transsexuals, and people infected with HIV. Rico contends that, because of his membership in LEA and his participation in political campaigns, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 1995 threatened him with death and tried to demand a \u201cwar tax\u201d on his farm; in 1996 FARC eventually assassinated his nephew, who was in charge of the farm. Further, because of his active involvement with LEA and with Oasis, and because he is gay and HIV positive, Rico asserts that he was targeted by the Colombian United Auto Defenses (AUC), a paramilitary group that (1) in May 1998 committed a \u201cmassacre\u201d that Rico protested against, (2) beginning in June 1998 threatened his and his family\u2019s lives with over one hundred phone calls, (3) in August 2000 killed one of Rico\u2019s friends, Jarro Ospina, who also was an Oasis and LEA activist, (4) told Rico that he was next on the list, and (5) in February 2001, sent three members to Rico\u2019s parents\u2019 house to kill him. Rico also claims that his companion, Juan Carlos Rodriguez, was granted asylum based on his participation in LEA and his gay status.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">We review the IJ\u2019s findings of fact under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test: we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We also review the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). And on credibility determinations, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of,\u201d among other things, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284, 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Here, the IJ determined that, because Rico was not credible, he failed to show that he qualified for asylum relief. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. First, we share the IJ\u2019s concerns that Rico failed to mention in his initial asylum application his claims of AUC persecution on account of his membership in Oasis and his status as gay and HIV-positive. These claims are significant; and Rico relies on them as much as his claims of persecution based on his LEA membership, which was the foundation of his initial application. But Rico only raised these claims in a second asylum application filed ten months after his initial asylum application. Rico\u2019s counsel stated that Rico was seeking asylum on \u201cdifferent grounds\u201d and was submitting a \u201cwhole new application.\u201d And Rico did not include in his second application the facts he included in the first application. We could affirm the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination on this basis alone: the two applications contained completely separate grounds for relief. We also express doubt about Rico\u2019s explanation on why he did not include this information in the initial application: despite his life being threatened, he asserts that, at the time, he did not know that he could seek asylum on these grounds and he did not want the IJ to be prejudiced toward him because of his sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Even if we believe Rico\u2019s explanation for why he did not raise these claims initially \u2014 and construe his second application as a supplement to the first application \u2014 we still conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. We initially note that Rico\u2019s asylum applications, as a whole, generally were consistent with his testimony at the asylum hearing. But several major, unexplained facts and inconsistencies support the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">At the hearing, Rico testified in detail about his involvement as an LEA member in protesting the AUC\u2019s 1998 massacre and its subsequent many phone threats. Rico, however, did not mention the harassing telephone calls in either application, did not mention that the AUC in particular was responsible, and did not provide evidence corroborating the threatening phone calls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also, Rico\u2019s testimony about the asylum status of his companion, Rodriguez, is dubious. Rico suggested that Rodriguez was granted asylum at least in part be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>cause he is gay. But Rico later stated that Rodriguez did not disclose that he was gay on his asylum application; and Rico did not submit evidence corroborating Rodriguez\u2019s asylum status. Further, Rodriguez was present at Rico\u2019s hearing but did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Important, Rico repeatedly traveled to Colombia from the United States during the time when he allegedly was being persecuted. And he failed to explain his statement that, despite his alleged persecution, he has custody of his daughter because she is \u201csafer\u201d with him than his mother. Both of these facts diminish the believability of Rico\u2019s fear of persecution. The inconsistencies in Rico\u2019s testimony are not minor: they call into question the grounds of Rico\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (stating that adverse credibility finding must go to the \u201cheart\u201d of the asylum claim and should not be based on minor inconsistencies). And as the IJ concluded, the documentary evidence that Rico presented does not compel a different conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Rico contends that, if the IJ had unanswered questions after Rico testified, the IJ should have asked Rico. But Rico \u2014 not the IJ \u2014 bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In sum, the IJ provided cogent reasons for his credibility determination: these reasons are supported by substantial record evidence. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819 (citations omitted). We uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\">. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion: we review the IJ's decision as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>final agency determination. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1285 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-10\">. Rico only mentioned that he was threatened and that his partner, Rodriguez, received threatening phone calls. And Rico did not mention the frequency of the threats to him or whether these threats were made by telephone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. At most, the evidence that Rico submitted shows the problems in general that homosexuals and HIV-positive persons experience in Colombia, that Rico is HIV-positive, that Rico\u2019s nephew was shot to death while riding a motorcycle, that Rico complained in writing to Credhos, a Colombian human rights group, of the threats he received from FARC and the AUC because of his membership in the LEA, and that he was a member of Oasis. But this evidence did not address the concerns that the IJ had about Rico's credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b902-23\">. Because Rico has failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily has failed to satisfy the higher burden for an applicant seeking withholding of removal, <em>see Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4, and CAT relief, <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
