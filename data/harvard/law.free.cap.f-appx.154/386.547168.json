The district court sentenced Dunlap under the federal sentencing guidelines to 108 months incarceration. Dunlap\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. Califo</em>rnia 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but challenging the validity of the plea and the propriety of the sentence. Dunlap filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that his conviction and sentence are invalid because his sentence was enhanced by facts found by the district court judge. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we affirm Dunlap\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">We find that Dunlap\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Dunlap was properly advised of his rights, the offense charged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and the maximum sentence for the offense. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Dunlap contends that his plea was not knowingly entered because he was not advised that prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense were elements of the offense to which he pled guilty. Dunlap notes that these factors were not charged in the indictment, nor did he admit them. Therefore, he asserts that his plea is invalid because it was not knowingly entered. However, Dunlap\u2019s prior convictions for drug or violent crimes are not elements of the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. These relate to sentencing and are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Relying on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the predecessor to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>Dunlap contends that the district court made factual findings about his prior convictions, which resulted in his base offense level being increased to level 24. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that armed career criminal designation based on defendant\u2019s prior convictions did not violate Sixth Amendment), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005) (No. 05-6904); <em>United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cCareer offender status is not \u2018a sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a fact other than a prior conviction.\u2019 ... <em>Booker </em>explicitly excepts from Sixth Amendment analysis the third component of the crime of violence determination, the fact of two prior convictions.\u201d). Thus, we find no error by the district court in determining Dunlap\u2019s base offense level by reference to his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Dunlap next argues that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was enhanced by four levels based on the district court\u2019s finding that he possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2003). In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57. Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), this court held that a sentence that was imposed under the pre<em>Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not by a jury or admitted by the defendant, constitutes plain error that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">In this case, Dunlap contends that he did not admit that he possessed the drags that the court found he possessed, nor did he admit that the firearm was possessed in connection with another felony offense. Therefore, he argues that the four-level enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Because Dunlap nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ther contested the calculation of his base offense level nor raised a Blakely-type challenge at sentencing, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Under the plain error standard, Dunlap must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even when these conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Because the court made factual findings that increased Dunlap\u2019s sentence, we find that there was plain error. Also, this error resulted in Dunlap being exposed to a longer prison term, and therefore affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 548. Because the district court \u201cimpose[d] a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone,\u201d we find that the district court committed plain error that warrants correction. <em>Id. </em>at 546. Accordingly, we vacate Dunlap\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The final issue presented in this appeal is a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that Dunlap had not accepted responsibility. This finding was made after Dunlap twice tested positive for marijuana use while he was on bond pending sentencing. We find no clear error in this ruling. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)); <em>United States v. Kise, </em>369 F.3d 766, 771 (4th Cir.2004) (providing standard); <em>United States v. Ceccarani, </em>98 F.3d 126, 130-31 (3d Cir.1996) (upholding the denial of acceptance of responsibility based on new unrelated criminal conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case for any other meritorious issue and have found none. Accordingly, although we affirm Dunlap\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">. As we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Dunlap\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
