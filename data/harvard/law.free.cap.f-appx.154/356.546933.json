Hackett appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment following repeated violations of his supervised release. On appeal, Hackett claims the sentence imposed on revocation is unreasonable and that the standard for sentences on revocation has been modified by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finding no support for these claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">The provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that governs supervised release was not affected by <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-68. The change effected by <em>Booker </em>\u2014 making the Sentencing Guidelines advisory as to sentencing \u2014 was not a change in the manner in which the Guidelines were applied to revocations of supervised release <em>pre-Booker. See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cChapter 7\u2019s policy statements are now and have always been non-binding, advisory guides to district courts in supervised release revocation proceedings.\u201d). Accordingly, we reject Hackett\u2019s contention that sentences imposed on revocation are subject to an altered scrutiny on appeal in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">Hackett also claims that the district court\u2019s imposition of a twenty-four month term of imprisonment was unwarranted. We disagree. We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release and resultant sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642-43. Hackett had a lengthy criminal history and had engaged in a rapid succession of similar criminal infractions in blatant disregard of the law. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in revoking Hackett\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-23\">We affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
