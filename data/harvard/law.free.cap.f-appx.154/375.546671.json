Jones appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release on the basis that he committed attempted murder and was a felon in possession of a firearm during his term of supervised release. This court reviews a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-24\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. A violation of a condition of supervised release must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). A state conviction for the underlying conduct is not required, and the district court\u2019s finding of witness credibility in the revocation hearing is not reviewable. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.1, comment, (n.1) (2002); <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Jones\u2019s supervised release. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
