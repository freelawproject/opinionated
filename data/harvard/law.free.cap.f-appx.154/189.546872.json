The instant case is closely related to a previous suit brought by Cavicchi against the same defendants. The district court granted summary judgment in the previous case, and this Court affirmed in an extensive unpublished opinion, 123 Fed.Appx. 386 (11th Cir. 2004). We conclude that many, and possibly all, of the claims brought in the instant suit are barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-24\">With respect to the few claims that may not be barred by <em>res judicata^ </em>the district court in the instant case addressed the merits thereof and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that regard and for substantially the same reasons set out by the district court, we agree that summary judgment was due to be granted in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-25\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b213-26\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-19\">. The parties consented in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), and thus the order entered by the magistrate judge (Docket 134) constitutes the judgment of the district court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-28\">. Appellant\u2019s motion to incorporate the briefs from the prior appeal is denied as moot, the same already being available to the panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
