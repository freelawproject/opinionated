In his plea agreement, Diclemente waived \u201cthe right to contest either the conviction or the sentence in any direct appeal or other post-conviction action, including any proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d The agreement provides that the waiver does not apply to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-29\">Finding that Diclemente\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>judge accepted his guilty plea on June 16, 1995. At sentencing on April 15, 1996, the district court reviewed Diclemente\u2019s answers at the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, and confirmed that he had entered his plea freely and voluntarily, that he understood the consequences of his plea, and that he was adequately represented by counsel. The district court sentenced Diclemente to 262 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On appeal, Diclemente sought to raise the following claims: (1) the court erred in sentencing him for crack cocaine rather than powder cocaine; (2) the court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under the guidelines; (3) counsel was ineffective at sentencing with respect to the above-mentioned grounds and for failing to move for a downward departure; and (4) the court erred in denying his Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 motion. The Government moved to dismiss the appeal based on Diclemente\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights in his plea agreement. On July 7, 2004, we granted the Government\u2019s motion and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On December 27, 2004, Diclemente filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted on February 28, 2005. The Supreme Court remanded the matter to this court in light of its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750. However, we have held in two recent cases that a plea agreement waiver of the right to appeal that was accepted prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>was not invalidated by the change in law effected by that decision. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137 (4th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Sept. 7, 2005) (No. 05-6215); <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005). Thus, the issuance of <em>Booker </em>does not render Diclemente\u2019s plea unknowing or involuntary, nor does Diclemente\u2019s <em>Booker </em>challenge fall beyond the scope of his pre<em>Booker </em>appeal waiver. <em>See Johnson, </em>410 F.3d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Accordingly, we reinstate our July 7, 2004 judgment dismissing Diclemente\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
