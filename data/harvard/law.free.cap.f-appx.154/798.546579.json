On appeal, Knight argues that the district court erred by considering his prior drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>conviction under the Georgia First Offender Act (\u201cGFOA\u201d) in determining his criminal history category. According to Knight, the GFOA expunged his conviction, and, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, it should not have been counted. In support of his argument, Knight cites <em>United States v. Hidalgo, </em>932 F.2d 805 (9th Cir.1991), in which the Ninth Circuit held that a defendant\u2019s criminal conviction, which had been \u201c \u2018set aside\u2019 pursuant to the California Welfare and Institutions Code which provided for the release of a sentenced juvenile from \u2018all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime for which he or she was committed,\u2019 \u201d was \u201c \u2018expunged\u2019 and therefore not properly considered in the court\u2019s criminal history calculation.\u201d Knight acknowledges, however, that we, in <em>United States v. Shazier, </em>179 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.1999), held that a defendant\u2019s conviction for cocaine possession in Louisiana, for which he later received a First Offender pardon, should not be considered expunged, and, consequently, should be counted in the calculation of his criminal history category. Knight argues that <em>Shazier </em>should not be \u201cdeemed controlling authority,\u201d as the GFOA broadly states that a \u201cdefendant shall not be considered to have a criminal conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">\u201cWe review questions of law arising under the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Section 4A1.2, governing the computation of criminal history, specifies that \u201c[sjentences for expunged convictions are not counted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(j). The commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">A number of jurisdictions have various procedures pursuant to which previous convictions may be set aside or the defendant may be pardoned for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law, <em>e.g., </em>in order to restore civil rights or to remove the stigma associated with a criminal conviction. Sentences resulting from such convictions are to be counted. However, expunged convictions are not counted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.10).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The GFOA permits a defendant, who previously has not been convicted of a felony, to enter a guilty plea, after which the court may, without entering an adjudication of guilt, defer further proceedings and place the defendant on probation. Ga. Stat. \u00a7 42-8-60(a)(l). If the defendant successfully completes probation, he \u201cshall be discharged without court adjudication of guilt,\u201d and that discharge \u201ccompletely exonerate[s] the defendant of any criminal purpose ... and the defendant shall not be considered to have a criminal conviction.\u201d Ga. Stat. \u00a7 42-8-62(a). Although applicable records must indicate that the defendant has been exonerated, the contents of those records shall not \u201cbe expunged or destroyed as a result of that discharge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">In <em>State v.C.S.B., </em>250 Ga. 261, 297 S.E.2d 260, 261-62 (1982), the Supreme Court of Georgia considered the state\u2019s appeal from a Superior Court order granting a \u201cPetition to Expunge Record,\u201d following the petitioner\u2019s successful completion of probation under the GFOA. The court held that a person, who has successfully completed probation and is discharged without adjudication of guilt under the first offender statute, is not entitled to expungement of records, noting that \u201cexpungement of the records of first offender treatment of criminal defendants runs contrary to the intent and the practical operation of the [GFOA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262-63. The Supreme Court of Georgia also has noted that, in enacting the GFOA, the Georgia Legislature clearly intended to protect defendants \u201cagainst the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>stigma of a criminal record.\u201d <em>Matthews v. State, </em>268 Ga. 798, 493 S.E.2d 136, 140 (1997) (holding that \u201cunless there is an adjudication of guilt, a witness may not be impeached on general credibility grounds by evidence of a first offender record\u201d); <em>see also Witcher v. Pender, </em>260 Ga. 248, 392 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find no reversible error. Because Knight\u2019s conviction under the GFOA was not expunged, the district court properly included it in the calculation of his criminal history category. Consequently, we affirm Knight\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
