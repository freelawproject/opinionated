Incorvaia asserted that the dissolution order violated his due process rights, the Sixth Amendment, and the Contracts Clause of the Constitution. The district court held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred the instant action and dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, Incorvaia argues that the state trial court abused its discretion by ordering him to pay his former wife $153,000 despite evidence that she had presented fraudulent financial evidence during the divorce proceedings and a domestic violence injunction hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Williams v. Best Buy, </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2001). After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine limits the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal district courts and courts of appeal over certain matters related to previous state court litigation. <em>See Rooker, </em>263 U.S. at 415-16, 44 S.Ct. at 150; <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 476-82, 103 S.Ct. at 1311-15. Under this doctrine, federal courts, other than the U.S. Supreme Court, \u201chave no authority to review the final judgments of state courts\u201d which involve the same parties as the parties in the federal action, and this jurisdictional bar \u201cextends not only to constitutional claims presented or adjudicated by a state court, but also to claims that are \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with a state court judgment.\u201d <em>Goodman ex. rel Goodman v. Sipos, </em>259 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1266 n. 11 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a state court judgment if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.\u201d <em>Goodman, </em>259 F.3d at 1332. Nevertheless, \u201ceven if a claim is \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the state court\u2019s judgment, the doctrine does not apply if the plaintiff had no \u2018reasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">The district court did not err by finding that it lacked jurisdiction to review Incorvaia\u2019s action based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>doctrine. The parties involved in the federal and <em>state actions are the same, and </em>the state court entered a final judgment before Ineorvaia filed his federal action. Moreover, Incorvaia\u2019s federal claims were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s final judgment of dissolution of his marriage, and he had a reasonable opportunity to raise his claims in state court. If we were now to hold that the Florida trial court\u2019s alimony order was unconstitutional, we would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 467 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>barred \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to state court decision to distribute a portion of husband\u2019s naval retirement pay to wife upon divorce). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">. <em>See Rooker v.
