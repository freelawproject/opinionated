We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 17, 2001. The notice of appeal was filed on March 3, 2005. Because Rule failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. We deny Rule\u2019s motions for summary judgment, for remand, to expedite the appeal, and to transfer the case. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
