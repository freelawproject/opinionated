Lin contends that the Immigration Judge and BIA erred because she demonstrated past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution by presenting evidence of her refusal to undergo sterilization. She also argues that she is entitled to relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. We deny in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">In August 2000, Lin\u2019s sister, who had already had two children, was pregnant with a third child in violation of the family planning policy in China. Family planning officers came to the home of Lin\u2019s parents to arrest and sterilize Lin\u2019s sister, but Lin helped her sister escape through a back door while family planning officers searched other parts of the home. The family planning officers threatened to arrest and sterilize Lin the next time they came if they could not find her sister. Two weeks later, the family planning officers returned to the home and attempted to arrest Lin because she looked like her sister. Lin escaped to her aunt\u2019s home and then to her uncle\u2019s home. Family planning officials looked for her at both locations, but did not enter the homes to search for her. In January 2001, Lin escaped to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">At the removal hearing, Lin conceded removability, but argued that she was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ did not make an adverse credibility finding because the IJ found \u201cthe facts could have happened.\u201d The IJ, however, deemed Lin to be \u201csomewhat implausible\u201d because Lin\u2019s sister and her brother-in-law have not been found or sterilized. The IJ also emphasized that the lack of formal accusations or other documents supporting Lin\u2019s allegations diminished Lin\u2019s credibility. Thus, the IJ denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal because Lin had not met her burden to establish eligibility. Lin appealed the IJ\u2019s ruling to the BIA, but the BIA affirmed the IJ without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s analysis as if it were the analysis of the BIA. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal determinations of the IJ and BIA. <em>Id. </em>We review findings of fact by the IJ and BIA for substantial evidence because \u201c[administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">Lin argues that she is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>coercive population control provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. She also argues that she is entitled to relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\n<em>A. Lin Is Not Eligible for Asylum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The IJ and BIA concluded that Lin failed to establish eligibility for asylum. An applicant has the burden to prove eligibility for asylum. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). To apply for asylum, an alien must be a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unable to return to his home country \u201cbecause of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of [future] persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). To be eligible for asylum, Lin had the burden to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and on each issue, Lin\u2019s application failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\n<em>1. Lin Has Not Suffered Past Persecution.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Line had to establish past persecution in one of three ways. Under the coercive population provision of the INA, an applicant may establish \u201cpast persecution\u201d on account of political opinion if the applicant (1) has been forced to undergo sterilization, (2) has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo forced sterilization, or (3) has been persecuted for \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B); <em>see Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1202-05 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPersecution\u201d is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d that requires more than a \u201cfew isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Lin established past persecution. Lin was not forcibly sterilized. She also was not \u201cpersecuted for failure or refusal to undergo\u201d forced sterilization because the actions of the family planning officers do not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution.\u201d Lin\u2019s allegations that officers threatened to sterilize her forcibly, if true, amount to no more than isolated instances of \u201cverbal harassment.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Lin was never subject to a pattern of arrests, fines, or beatings. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1203 (stating that a single fine does not constitute \u201cpersecution\u201d); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (concluding that death threats over the telephone and a restaurant bombing do not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s findings that no persecution occurred). Lin also was not persecuted for \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive program of population control. <em>Cf. Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1205 (stating that the removal of an intrauterine device against family planning policy may constitute \u201cother resistance\u201d because it is \u201cpunishable as a crime in China\u201d). Thus, substantial evidence supports the finding of the IJ that Lin failed to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">\n<em>2. Lin Has Not Demonstrated a Well-Founded Fear of Persecution.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Lin has also failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. A well-founded fear of future persecution requires a showing of a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). The fear of persecution must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>AI Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. To determine whether the applicant\u2019s fear is subjectively genuine and objectively reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>able, \u201cthis [C]ourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ and the] BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>DMuhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s findings of facts and credibility are conclusive unless the record \u201ccompels\u201d reversal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The IJ did not make an adverse credibility finding, but concluded that Lin\u2019s testimony about threats of future involuntary sterilization were implausible because no officials had threatened her family or taken affirmative steps to pursue Lin since she left China. Family planning officers have also not found, arrested, or sterilized Lin\u2019s sister and brother-in-law. No arrest warrant or other documentation supports Lin\u2019s contention that she is likely to be subject to involuntary sterilization. Lin\u2019s arguments, while \u201csubjectively genuine,\u201d are not \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d because she failed to provide \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [ ] she will be singled out for persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (stating that the \u201csubjectively genuine\u201d prong assesses the credibility of the applicant, but the \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d prong assesses the probability of future persecution). Because substantial evidence supports the conclusion of the IJ and BIA and the record does not compel reversal, we deny Lin\u2019s petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">\n<em>B. Lin Has Not Established Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We also deny Lin\u2019s petition for withholding of removal. An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if \u201chis life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The standard to establish withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. Because Lin has failed to meet the standard for asylum, her petition for withholding of removal also fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">\n<em>C. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Review Arguments Under the Convention Against Torture</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review Lin\u2019s argument under the Convention Against Torture because she failed to raise this argument before the BIA. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). Lin has not \u201cexhausted all administrative remedies available.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(2). We dismiss Lin\u2019s argument that she is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">We deny Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding or removal because the threats of forcible sterilization by the family planning officers did not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution,\u201d Lin has failed to establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution, and Lin has failed to meet her burden for withholding of removal. Because we lack jurisdiction to review Lin\u2019s arguments under the United Nations Convention Against, we dismiss that aspect of her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
