Zheng argues that the BIA (1) abused its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen, and (2) violated Zheng\u2019s due process rights by failing to articulate fully its reasons for denying this motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>more fully below, we denying Zheng\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">On December 15, 2003, Zheng, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d), entered the United States without possessing a valid entry document. On December 24, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appeal, charging Zheng with being an immigrant not in possession of a valid entry document or documents of identity and nationality, in violation of INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During a hearing before the IJ, Zheng conceded removability as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">On April 7, 2004, Zheng filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA, and for relief under the CAT. Zheng alleged in this application that she had suffered past persecution and had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of the fact that officials of the PRC had forced her to have two abortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">On this same date, Zheng also appeared before the IJ for an evidentiary hearing on her application for relief. At this hearing, Zheng asked the IJ for a continuance to give her time to retain counsel. The IJ, however, denied this request, explaining that (1) Zheng had two previous attorneys who had withdrawn; (2) the IJ had granted Zheng a continuance in March 2004; and (3) the IJ had informed Zheng in March 2004, that he would proceed in April 2004, even if Zheng did not have an attorney present.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Zheng then testified as to the following facts. In September 2002, Zheng entered into a \u201cChinese traditional marriage\u201d with her husband, Wu Bao Chen, but she did not legally marry him because he was under the age required for marriage. During this same time period, Zheng became pregnant, after which she did not attend her required \u201cfemale examination\u201d and hid at her mother\u2019s house. However, after a neighbor observed Zheng vomiting and reported Zheng\u2019s suspected pregnancy, family-planning officials came to Zheng\u2019s mother\u2019s house and asked Zheng to have an abortion. When Zheng refused to consent to this procedure, these officials arrested Zheng\u2019s husband, detained him for two weeks, and tortured him. To end this torture, Zheng consented to the abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Zheng further testified that, after she again became pregnant in May 2003, she failed to attend a required \u201cfemale examination.\u201d In August 2003, a village official arrived at her house, arrested her, took her to the hospital for the examination, and forced her to have an abortion. Zheng, however, escaped from the hospital before the doctors could insert an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d). In October 2003, after learning that family-planning officials were searching for Zheng, her uncle arranged for her to go to the United States and she left the PRC. Other than this testimony, Zheng stated that she had no other evidence to present at this asylum hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">The IJ denied Zheng\u2019s application for relief from removal, based on his determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>nations that Zheng\u2019s testimony was not credible, and that she had failed to offer any other credible and corroborating evidence. Zheng filed a timely appeal with the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred by (1) failing to grant her additional time to obtain counsel, and (2) relying on minor inconsistencies in finding that her testimony was not credible. On July 28, 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion and adopted it as the \u201cfinal agency determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">On October 25, 2004, Zheng filed the instant motion to reopen her removal proceedings. In support of this motion, Zheng claimed that she wished to present the following \u201cnew evidence\u201d: (1) her Chinese Resident ID card; (2) her Chinese notorial birth certificate; (3) her own affidavit;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) affidavits signed by her mother and husband; and (5) her husband\u2019s Chinese Resident ID card. Zheng argued that this \u201cnew evidence\u201d was \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d because (1) she was detained during the removal proceedings; (2) her prior counsel failed to advise her on the need for corroborative evidence; (3) she lacked counsel during her asylum hearing; and (4) she was not aware of her burden of proof in estabhshing her eligibility for asylum relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In November 2004, the BIA denied Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. In support, the BIA explained that (1) Zheng had not met her burden of showing that the additional evidence was previously unavailable and could not have been presented at his first hearing, and (2) she had not followed the required procedures for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">On appeal, Zheng first argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen based on its finding that she failed to show that the \u201cnew evidence\u201d that she had sought to introduce was previously unavailable. Zheng specifically contends that, although this evidence was \u201ctechnically in existence at the time of the hearing,\u201d it was not \u201cavailable or able to be presented.\u201d Zheng asserts that the BIA\u2019s determination that she also was attempting to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel showed that it \u201cmight not have even understood the meaning and purpose\u201d of her motion to reopen. Zheng also argues that the BIA abused its discretion by giving only a \u201cconelusory\u201d or \u201csummary\u201d reason for denying her motion. Finally, Zheng contends that the BIA did not give any alternative reasons for denying her motion to reopen, and that remand is necessary because (1) her testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>credible and consistent, (2) she established <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum, and (3) the IJ\u2019s decision denying her relief from removal was based primarily on the lack of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 2. \u201cIn this particular area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">At a minimum, three independent grounds exist upon which the BIA may rely in denying a motion to reopen: \u201c(1) failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and (3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001). Rephrasing this second ground, the regulations provide that a motion to reopen proceedings \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, in explaining \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), we have stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">[t]he provision is framed negatively, by directing the Board not to reopen unless certain showings are made. It does not affirmatively require the [BIA] to reopen the proceedings under any particular condition. Thus, the regulations may be construed to provide the [BIA] with discretion in determining under what circumstances proceedings should be reopened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\"><em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1301 (internal quotations and marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Here, the BIA determined that the \u201cnew evidence\u201d on which Zheng was relying in her motion to reopen, that is (1) her Chinese Resident ID card; (2) her Chinese notorial birth certificate; (3) her own affidavit; (4) affidavits signed by her mother and husband; and (5) her husband\u2019s Chinese Resident ID card, could have been presented at her asylum hearing in April 2004. Indeed, Zheng\u2019s Chinese Resident ID card was issued in 2002, and her notorial birth certificate was issued in January 2004. Although Zheng\u2019s husband\u2019s Chinese Resident ID card was not issued until May 2004, Zheng failed to explain why her husband could not have applied for its issuance before that hearing date. Similarly, although the affidavits signed by Zheng, Zheng\u2019s mother, and her husband were not in existence before April 2004, they involved attestations that either were unrelated to Zheng\u2019s application for relief from removal, or were known by the affiants before the date of the asylum hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">To the extent Zheng argued in her motion to reopen that this evidence, nevertheless, was \u201cunavailable\u201d because of (1) her detention, (2) her prior counsel\u2019s failure to advise her on her burden of proof, and (3) her own lack of knowledge on this burden, she has failed to cite to authority to support any of these arguments. Regardless, although Zheng was detained pending her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>April 2004 asylum hearing, and although the IJ denied her motion to continue this hearing, the IJ had continued the hearing in March 2004, at which time he also had informed Zheng that she would not be granted any additional continuances. Zheng only argued in support of her April continuance motion that she was seeking to obtain counsel. Moreover, Zheng failed to explain why her sponsor \u2014 the person who had helped Zheng obtain counsel initially \u2014 could not also have helped her obtain the supporting documentation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">To the extent Zheng also is arguing that this evidence was \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d because her prior counsel misadvised her, Zheng has conceded that she failed to properly preserve a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by not following the procedures outlined in <em>Lozada. See Lazada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 639, Finally, although Zheng is contending that she was not aware of her burden of proof, this assertion neither explains why this information was \u201cpreviously unavailable,\u201d nor does it change the fact that the applicant carries the burden of proving eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (asylum); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16 (withholding of removal and relief under the CAT). Thus, Zheng failed to show that this evidence was \u201cnot available and could not have been discovered or presented\u201d at the time of her asylum hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing that motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in removal proceedings, because, as a general matter, \u201cevery delay works to the advantage of the [removable] alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States\u201d). We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Zheng also argues in her petition that, whether or not the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen, it violated her due process rights by failing to articulate fully its reasons for denying this motion. Zheng asserts in support of this argument that the BIA\u2019s summary finding that she had not shown that the \u201cnew evidence\u201d was previously unavailable (1) does not reflect why it reached this determination, and (2) \u201cforces [us] to guess as to the theory underlying the [BIA\u2019s] decision in violation of Zheng\u2019s procedural due process rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">In reviewing a due process challenge in an analogous appeal where a single member of the BIA affirmed an IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(i),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we determined in <em>Lo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>nyern </em>that an alien is not entitled <em>per se </em>to a full opinion by the BIA. M<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We explained that, \u201c[t]he fact that a single BIA member issued an affirmance without opinion [did] not demonstrate that he did not review the facts of [the petitioner\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further determined that the petitioner failed to present evidence showing that: (1) the BIA member who reviewed the case deviated from the regulation\u2019s requirements when he determined that the case warranted a summary affirmance, or (2) the petitioner was substantially prejudiced by the BIA\u2019s issuance of an affirmance without opinion. <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, concluded that the petitioner\u2019s due process claims were without merit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Similar to the facts in <em>Lonyem, </em>Zheng has not cited to evidence in the record showing that the BIA, in denying her motion to reopen, failed to follow its regulations. Moreover, as discussed above, the BIA reasonably could have concluded that it was clear from the face of the \u201cnew evidence\u201d on which Zheng was relying that this evidence was not \u201cpreviously unavailable.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Zheng also has failed to explain how she was substantially prejudiced by the BIA\u2019s failure to more fully articulate why it was denying her motion to reopen. <em>See Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Moreover, we have concluded that the failure to receive discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest. <em>See Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146-48 (11th Cir.1999) (eligibility for suspension of deportation); <em>see also Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1300 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that \u201cexpectation does not equate with liberty or property, and a constitutionally protected interest cannot arise from relief that the executive exercises unfettered discretion to award\u201d). As discussed above, the BIA\u2019s discretion in granting a motion to reopen is \u201cquite broad.\u201d <em>See Gbaya, </em>342 F.3d at 1220. We also have determined that the decision whether to grant asylum \u2014 relief Zheng was seeking as part of her removal proceedings \u2014 is a matter of discretion. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, at least to the extent Zheng\u2019s due process claim was based on her desire to reopen her proceedings and to seek asylum relief, this claim also is without merit because she failed to establish a deprivation of a liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the BIA, in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen, neither abused its discretion, nor violated Zheng\u2019s due process rights. We, therefore, deny Zheng\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">. To the extent Zheng\u2019s arguments can be construed as challenging the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision denying Zheng\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA, and for relief under the CAT, she failed to file a timely petition for review from that order; thus, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal); <em>see also Dakane v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that the statutory deadline for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \"mandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d and that a filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by the fact that a petitioner files a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings (quotations and citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">. On November 25, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135. This legislation created a new Department of Homeland Security, abolished the INS, and transferred its functions to the new department. Because this case was initiated while the INS still was in existence, this opinion refers to the agency as the INS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-14\">. When the IJ asked Zheng what evidence, if any, she had to introduce at the hearing, Zheng specifically responded \"[t]he evidence there in, in China.\u201d The IJ then found that Zheng had been given \"plenty of time to try to get [the evidence],\u201d and he informed Zheng that the hearing still would proceed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\">. In Zheng\u2019s affidavit, she asserted, among other things, that (1) she was forced to undergo two abortions in the PRC; (2) she left the PRC to avoid being forced to wear an IUD and being subjected to further harm; (3) she arrived in the United States in December 2003; (4) on her arrival, her sponsor helped her to retain an attorney to file an asylum claim; (5) her former two attorneys withdrew as counsel due to unknown reasons; (6) her former attorneys did not inform her that she needed to obtain corroborating evidence; (7) she found it '\u2018very difficult\u201d to contact persons while in detention; (8) she could not obtain another attorney before her asylum hearing; and (9) she believed she was prejudiced by her lack of counsel at this hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\">. The BIA in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988), set forth certain procedures a petitioner must follow before filing a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Zheng, however, has abandoned by not raising in her petition for review any challenges to the BIA\u2019s rejection of her motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Indeed, Zheng explicitly states on appeal that she (1) had not attempted to raise such a claim in her motion to reopen, and (2) had not followed the procedures outlined in <em>Lozada. </em>Thus, we will not include additional facts relating to this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">.
