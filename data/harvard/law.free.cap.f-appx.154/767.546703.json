On appeal, Santos-Plata argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the district court\u2019s erroneous denial of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>minor-role reduction and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. The Court decided that the appropriate remedy was to excise two specific statutory provisions which made the Guidelines mandatory, thereby rendering the Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at 764. The Court explained that, \u201c[wjithout the \u2018mandatory' provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Section 3553(a) provides that district courts imposing a sentence must first consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, and the kinds of sentences and sentencing range established by the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We are required to \u201creview for unreasonableness\u201d a sentence imposed post-<em>Booker. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765 (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that <em>\u201cBooker </em>established a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard for the sentence finally imposed on a defendant\u201d). We have noted that, in conducting a review for reasonableness, we \u201cwould not expect the district court in every case to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor ... and expound upon how each factor played a role in its sentencing decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). We have stated, however, that the district court is obligated \u201cto calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">In <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>we recently conducted a review of an appellant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness and explained that the sentence must be reasonable in the context of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). No. 05-11198, manuscript op. at 9-10 (11th Cir. Aug. 30, 2005). In addition to discussing the nature and circumstances of the offense and the appellant\u2019s criminal history, we specifically noted that the sentence imposed was \u201cone-tenth the length of the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence,\u201d and held that the sentence was reasonable based on the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">We must determine whether the district court calculated the Guidelines sentence correctly in order to determine whether Santos-Plata\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. These two steps will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">In this case, Santos-Plata challenges the computation of the Guidelines range in light of the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>\u201cPost-Booker, </em>we continue to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines just as we did <em>pre-Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, (11th Cir.2005). We have \u201clong and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cIn making the ultimate determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>tion of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In determining whether a mitigating role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">A. <em>Whether the District Court Correctly Calculated Santos-Plata\u2019s Guideline Range</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">As for the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, the district court properly found that Santos-Plata played a greater role than merely transporting heroin into the United States. Turning to the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, the evidence in the record does not show that SantosPlata was less culpable than most other participants in the offense. Accordingly, the district court correctly calculated Santos-Plata\u2019s Guideline range and did not err by refusing to apply a two-level minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">B. <em>Whether Santos-Plata\u2019s Sentence was Reasonable Under Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">In this case, we hold that SantosPlata\u2019s sentence as reasonable for several reasons. First, the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence was procedurally proper in that it (1) calculated the Guidelines range correctly, as discussed above; (2) treated that Guidelines range as advisory only; and (3) apparently considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. Second, SantosPlata received a relatively minimal 72-month sentence given the fact that he was subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(i) and 960(b)(1)(A); <em>Winingear, </em>No. 05-11198, manuscript op. at 10-11. Third, the district court correctly determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 did not apply, as discussed above, so the court acted reasonably in not imposing a sentence within a range that would have controlled if \u00a7 3B1.2 did apply. Fourth, the court sentenced Santos-Plata 15 months below the applicable Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Santos-Plata\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
