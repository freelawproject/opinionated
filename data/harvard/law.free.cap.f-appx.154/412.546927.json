That same contention was raised in the prior appeal. He lost that appeal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and now he offers no support for his contention that an appeal to an arbitrator is not required or that anything has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The jurisdiction of the court over the exhaustion issue was resolved in the prior cases. Linthecome is estopped to raise it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
