The sole issue on appeal is whether \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional as applied to Miller, under the Commerce Clause, where the only evidence connecting the firearm to interstate commerce was its manufacture out of state. Miller admits that, under our caselaw, the fact that the firearm previously had traveled in interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element of \u00a7 922(g)(1). However, Miller relies upon <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), to support his proposition that, because the Constitution does not provide Congress with a general police power, there must be more than a minimal connection between criminal activity and interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Because Miller did not raise this constitutional challenge in the district court, our review is only for plain error. On appeal, Miller must show that there is (1) \u201cerror,\u201d (2) that is \u201cplain,\u201d and (3) that \u201caffect[s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error \u2018seriously a\u00a3fect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1770) (other internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Here Miller acknowledges that there is no error under Eleventh Circuit law. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6 \u2014 7 (citing <em>United States v. Dwpree, </em>258 F.3d 1258,1260 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996)). Miller brings this appeal in order to preserve the issue. Because there is no error Miller\u2019s claim fails at the first prong of the plain error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
