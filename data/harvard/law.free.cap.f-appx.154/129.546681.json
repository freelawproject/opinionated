Tague, doing business as Orlando Sanford Aircraft Sales, Inc., appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against Tonya Gier, an officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (\u201cFFWCC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In his complaint, Tague, who was piloting an amphibian seaplane for commercial purposes during the relevant time period, asserted violations of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments based on Gier\u2019s enforcement of the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act (\u201cFMSA\u201d), \u00a7 370.12(2) Fla. Stat. (2005). On appeal, Tague argues the district court erred by dismissing his complaint, after finding that Gier was entitled to qualified immunity from suit because the law in Florida was not clearly established on the issue of whether Tague\u2019s seaplane was a \u201cvessel,\u201d within the meaning of the FMSA. The district court determined that the definition of \u201cvessel\u201d as it existed at the time of Tague\u2019s non-criminal citation was not clearly established and, thus, Gier\u2019s issuance of the citation, which occurred within the scope of her discretionary authority as an FFWCC officer, did not amount to a violation of clearly established constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The defense of qualified immunity may be raised and addressed on a motion to dismiss and will be granted if the \u201ccomplaint fails to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\u201d <em>Chesser v. Sparks, </em>248 F.3d 1117, 1121 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Williams v. Ala. State Univ., </em>102 F.3d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny the defense of qualified immunity on a motion to dismiss, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Dalrymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 994 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Qualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from liability if their conduct does not violate \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (citation omitted). The burden rests on the plaintiff to show that qualified immunity is not appropriate. <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">In its thorough Order, the district court analyzed the legislative history and enactment of the FMSA; analogous provisions of the Florida Vessel Safety Law (\u201cFVSL\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 327.02; the accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>panying Florida Administrative Code sections relevant to the FMSA and FVSL; and the Florida Constitution. The district court concluded that these sources did not provide a definition of vessel sufficient to exempt Tague\u2019s seaplane. Applying our decisions in <em>Dalrymple </em>and <em>Storck v. City of Coral Springs, 354 F.3d </em>1307, 1313-14 (Uth Cir.2003), the court concluded that Gier was entitled to qualified immunity from suit. Based on our thorough review, we agree and affirm based on the well-reasoned opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">. Tague also sued the FFWCC for constitutional violations. The district court held that the FFWCC enjoyed Eleventh Amendment protection against suits brought in federal court. The court found that the FFWCC had not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and thus dismissed Tague\u2019s complaint as to that entity. The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Tague\u2019s negligence claims against Gier and the FFWCC. In this appeal, Tague challenges only the district court\u2019s decision on Tague\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action against Gier. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of the complaint as to FFWCC on Eleventh Amendment grounds, as well as the district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
