On appeal, Oduok challenges (1) the district court\u2019s dismissal based on the statute of limitations, (2) the district court\u2019s dismissal of Phillips based on <em>res judicata, </em>and (3) the district court\u2019s dismissal of Moody based on collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-21\">First, Oduok challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint based on the statute of limitations. He argues that the limitations period was tolled during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>pendency of an action he filed in 2000 against Phillips individually and certain Cobb County officers and entities, and that the instant action relates back to the 2000 action, which was dismissed by the district court. He asserts that the Defendants are estopped from arguing the statute of limitations as a defense because they participated in the 2000 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). A complaint should not be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. <em>See Jackam v. Hosp. Corp. of Am. Mideast, Ltd., </em>800 F.2d 1577, 1579 (11th Cir.1986). Our review of a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations is also <em>de novo. See United States v. American States Ins. Co., </em>252 F.3d 1268, 1270 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">\u201cFederal courts apply their forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions to actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983[J\u201d <em>Uboh v. Reno, </em>141 F.3d 1000, 1002 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cA statute of limitations begins to run when the cause of action accrues. The question of when the limitations period begins to run, however, is one of federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c[T]he statute of limitations does not begin to run until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561-62 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The statute of limitations for personal injury actions in Georgia is two years. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-33. The Georgia renewal statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">When any case has been commenced in either a state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations and the <em>plaintiff discontinues or dismisses the same, </em>it may be recommenced in a court of this state or in a federal court either within the original applicable period of limitations or within six months after the discontinuance or dismissal, whichever is later, subject to the requirement of payment of costs in the original action as required by subsection (d) of Code Section 9-11-41; provided, however, if the dismissal or discontinuance occurs after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation, this privilege of renewal shall be exercised only once.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61(a) (emphasis added). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-10\">(c) Relation Back of Amendments. An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-11\">(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-12\">(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-13\">(3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). \u201cCongress intended Rule 15(c) to be used for a relatively narrow purpose; it did not intend for the rule to be so broad to allow an amended pleading to add an entirely new claim based on a different set of facts.\u201d <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[A]n untimely claim must have more in common with the timely filed claim than the mere fact that they arose out of the same trial or sentencing proceeding\u201d and \u201cmust have arisen from the \u2018same set of facts\u2019 as the timely filed claim, not from separate conduct or a separate occurrence in \u2018both time and type.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Here, the district court did not err by granting the Defendants\u2019 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations. Oduok\u2019s cause of action accrued on August 28, 1998, when he was injured while being arrested. He filed the instant action in state court over five years later, on October 6, 2003, which was beyond Georgia\u2019s applicable two-year limitations period. Neither the Georgia renewal statute nor the relation back doctrine renders Oduok\u2019s complaint timely. Simply put, by its plain terms, the Georgia renewal statute does not apply because the federal claims in Oduok\u2019s 2000 action were dismissed on the merits <em>by the district court, </em>not Oduok as O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61(a) requires. Moreover, Oduok\u2019s instant complaint, which was filed in state court over three years after the dismissal of the 2000 action and which names entirely different defendants, does not meet the requirements of Rule 15(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court did not err by granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-14\">. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Oduok\u2019s motion for recusal. <em>Cf. United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir.2004) (reviewing district judge\u2019s decision on motion to recuse for abuse of discretion). We likewise find no error in the district court's denial of Oduok\u2019s motion to remand. Simply put, remand was not warranted because Oduok stated federal claims based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and, accordingly, the district court had original jurisdiction over the action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441(b) and 1446(b). We decline to consider Oduok\u2019s other arguments as they are raised for the first time on appeal and they do not fall within any of the exceptions we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>recognized to the rule that we will not consider issues not raised in the district court first. <em>See Access Now, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\">. We are unpersuaded by Oduok\u2019s additional argument \u2014 that the 2000 action equitably tolled the statute of limitations \u2014 because he has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances beyond his control and avoidable even with diligence. <em>See Cabello </em>v. <em>Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1155 (11th Cir.2005) (\"Equitable tolling is appropriate only in \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 that are both beyond the plaintiff\u2019s control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We observe that Odouk has demonstrated no basis, let alone extraordinary circumstances, to explain why he could not have brought the instant claims against the Defendants in the 2000 action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-23\">. Because we find the instant action barred by the statute of limitations, we need not, and do not, reach the district court\u2019s alternate grounds for dismissing Oduok\u2019s claims against Defendant Phillips as precluded by <em>res judicata </em>and against Defendant Moody as precluded by collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
