Booker, </em>543 u.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Cardona\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Cardona, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 269 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated our November 4, 2004 decision and remanded Cardona\u2019s case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. Cardona v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2253, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-30\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b761-31\">Cardona pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). The district court sentenced Cardona to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Cardona argued that the district court improperly determined that Cardona was a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Although Car-dona appealed his sentencing role enhancement, his initial brief on appeal challenged only the sufficiency of the evidence. Car-dona did not raise a Sixth Amendment violation or any constitutional challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>his sentence in his prior appeal. Cardona did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle. Cardona did not claim that he was entitled to a jury trial on the role enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In his reply brief on appeal, Cardona attempted, for the first time, to raise an issue pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 4, 2004, this Court affirmed Cardona\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 990 (internal citations and citations omitted). We have applied <em>Ardley </em>to several post-Boo/cer-remand decisions and have concluded that defendants abandoned their Boo/cer-type claims when they failed to raise them in the district court or in their initial brief in this Court on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Pipkins, </em>412 F.3d 1251, 1252 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe well-established law in our circuit requires that issues be raised in the parties\u2019 initial brief.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201c[t]he Appellant\u2019s failure to raise the <em>[Booker </em>] issue in his initial brief bars him from doing so now\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">All of these <em>post-Booker </em>cases were remanded using the same or nearly identical two sentence form remand order from the Supreme Court. Specifically, the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order in this case states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM4\">Motion of petitioner to leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-13\"><em>Cardona v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2253, 161 L.Ed.2d 1052 (2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Thus, we further now consider Cardona\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Booker </em>and conclude that Cardona abandoned any <em>Apprendi /Blakely /Booker </em>claim by not timely raising a constitutional challenge to his sentence in his initial brief on appeal. As our <em>Pipkins, Sears, </em>and <em>Dockery </em>decisions indicate, we have consistently concluded that there is nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order that requires us to treat a case as though the <em>Booker </em>issue was timely raised when the defendant fails to raise it in on direct appeal. As we explained in <em>Pipkins,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">We have a long-standing rule that we will not consider issues that were argued for the first time in a petition for rehearing, and we adhere to that rule today. Moreover, there is nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order that requires us to treat this case as though the issue had been timely raised in this court. And, the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Booker </em>that we are to apply our \u201cordinary prudential doctrines\u201d in considering these types of challenges to sentences. Our ordinary prudential doctrine requiring parties to raise all issues in their initial briefs precludes us from addressing the Defendants\u2019 arguments asserted for the first time before this court in their Petitions for Rehearing en Banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\"><em>Pipkins, </em>412 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">As pointed out in <em>Pipkins, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that the fact that <em>Booker </em>was to be applied to cases on direct review did not mean \u201cthat every sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation [or] that every appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769. Indeed, the Supreme Court directed courts to \u201capply ordinary prudential doctrines [including], for example, whether the issue was raised below----\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">We note that the Supreme Court has applied its own prudential rules to foreclose the ability of defendants to raise <em>Blakely </em>claims. In <em>Pasquantino v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1766, 1781 n. 14, 161 L.Ed.2d 619 (2005), decided after <em>Booker, </em>the petitioners argued \u201cin a footnote that their sentences should be vacated in light of <em>Blakely </em>.... \u201d However, the petitioners \u201cdid not raise this claim before the Court of Appeals or in their petition for certiorari.\u201d <em>Pasquantino, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1781 n. 14. Although the petitioners failed to previously raise the issue, \u201c[t]his omission was no fault of the defendants, ... as the petition in this case was filed and granted well before the Court decided <em>Blakely. </em>Petitioners thus raised <em>Blakely </em>at the earliest possible point: in their merits briefing.\u201d <em>Pasquantino, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1783 n. 5 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Despite the fact that petitioners raised their <em>Blakely </em>claim at the earliest possible moment after that decision was released, the Supreme Court applied its prudential procedural rules and declined to address the issue. <em>Pasquantino, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1781 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">In summary, in his initial brief on appeal, Cardona asserted no <em>Apprendi /Blakely/Booker-hased </em>challenge to his sentence. Accordingly, we reinstate our November 4, 2004 opinion and affirm Car-dona\u2019s sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">. Although this Court does not consider <em>Book</em>er-type issues not raised in any way in a party\u2019s initial brief, we have liberally construed what it means to raise a Booker-type issue. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (evaluating whether a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim was made by reviewing whether a defendant: (1) referred to the Sixth Amendment; (2) referred to Apprendi or another related case; (3) asserted his right to have the jury decide the disputed fact; or (4) raised a challenge to the role of the judge as fact-finder with respect to sentencing factors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-16\">. On July 13, 2004, the same day that Cardona filed his reply brief, Cardona also attempted to raise the <em>Blakely </em>issue by filing a \"Motion to Supplement Issues on Appeal.\u201d On June 26, 2004, this Court denied Cardona's motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
