He was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment. He appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Jimenez-Renteria argues that his modified presentence investigation report (\u201cMPSR\u201d) was the only source used by the district court to establish that he had a prior aggravated robbery conviction. He contends that the MPSR was insufficient to establish that this prior conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Jimenez-Renteria also asserts that the district court should have applied the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-17\">The MPSR noted that, on April 7, 2003, Jimenez-Renteria pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Jimenez-Renteria has never denied that he had a prior aggravated robbery conviction. Therefore, the district court was free to adopt that information without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-18\">Jimenez-Renteria did not object to this enhancement in the district court and, therefore, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005). Because Jimenez-Renteria had a prior conviction for aggravated robbery which falls within one of the enumerated definitions of a crime of violence under the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2, the 16-level enhancement of Jimenez-Renteria\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) was not plain error. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)); <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 273-275 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005) (No. 05-5469).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-20\">For the first time on appeal, JimenezRenteria contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As Jime<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>nez-Renteria concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d at 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
