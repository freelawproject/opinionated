Kerwick asserts the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in failing to accord controlling weight to Dr. John B. Mulliken\u2019s opinion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-25\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-26\">We must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is ... such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c \u2018Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158 \u2014 59 (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>omitted). We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">A claimant bears the burden of establishing disability. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). Social security regulations provide a five-step sequential process to evaluate whether a claimant has proven she is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a). At the fourth step, the ALJ makes a determination of the claimant\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity by considering the claimant\u2019s ability to sit, stand, walk, lift, carry, push, pull, reach, handle, stoop, crouch, and other work-related physical demands. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1545(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Social security regulations also provide guidelines for the ALJ to use when evaluating medical opinion evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527. The ALJ considers many factors when weighing medical opinions, including the examining relationship, the treatment relationship, whether an opinion is amply supported, whether an opinion is consistent with the record, and a doctor\u2019s specialization. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d). In social security disability benefits cases, generally, the opinions of examining physicians are given more weight than non-examining physicians, the opinions of treating physicians are given more weight than non-treating physicians, and the opinions of specialists (on issues within their areas of expertise) are given more weight than non-specialists. <em>See </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(1) \u2014 (2), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">A treating physician\u2019s testimony \u201c \u2018must be given substantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (citation omitted). We have \u201cconcluded \u2018good cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240\u201441 (11th Cir.2004). An ALJ does not need to give a treating physician\u2019s opinion considerable weight if the claimant\u2019s own testimony regarding her daily activities contradicts that opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. However, the ALJ must clearly articulate reasons for giving less weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Additionally, the opinion of a specialist is generally entitled to more weight than the opinions of other non-specialists. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(5). However, the ALJ must \u201calways consider the medical opinions in [the] case record together with the rest of the relevant evidence ... receive[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(b). While specialists \u201cgenerally\u201d are entitled to more weight, when there are internal inconsistencies, the specialist\u2019s opinion deserves less deference. <em>See Guilliams v. Barnhart, </em>393 F.3d 798, 803 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The ALJ accorded little weight to the opinion of Dr. Mulliken, a treating physician and a specialist, finding Dr. Mulliken\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with the weight of the record in its entirety. Substantial evidence supports this conclusion. The ALJ noted Dr. Mulliken opined Kerwin could (1) sit for three hours; (2) stand or walk for 2 hours; (3) occasionally lift up to 20 pounds; (4) grasp, push, and pull with no limitation; and (5) bend and squat, but not crawl or climb or use her feet repetitively. The ALJ pointed out Dr. Mulliken\u2019s opinion Kerwick could not sit for more than three hours or stand for more than two hours is contradicted by Kerwick\u2019s high school attendance, where she sat for nearly seven hours a day, and past employment, where she worked eight hours a day. In high school, Kerwick sat in a classroom 42 minutes of every hour, 7 times a day, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>days a week. Kerwick was active while working in child care, sitting and standing eight hours a day. Also, she successfully performed clerical work at her uncle\u2019s office for a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Dr. Mulliken\u2019s opinion is also inconsistent with other medical opinions in the record. The ALJ examined evidence from multiple medical sources \u2014 Dr. Woletsky, a treating pediatrician who saw Kerwick about four or five times per year; Dr Seo, a consulting physician; Dr. Smith, a consulting orthopedic surgeon; and Dr. Buonocore, a state agency medical consultant. Evidence from these sources support a finding Kerwick is able to sit without difficulty for up to six hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Further, Dr. Mulliken\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with Kerwick\u2019s own testimony. Kerwick acknowledged she could sit for a couple of hours, then stand for an hour. Kerwick testified she could drive a car, and help cook and clean at home. Also, in the past, Kerwick participated in a gym class and in the Special Olympics.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">In sum, the ALJ articulated several reasons for giving less weight to Dr. Mulliken\u2019s opinion. Thus, we conclude the ALJ\u2019s determination that Dr. Mulliken\u2019s opinion should be given little weight is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
