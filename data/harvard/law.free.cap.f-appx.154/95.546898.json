The district court dismissed the petition because Carr should have filed it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d The reason Carr did not do that is he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and lost, and a second one would be barred by \u00a7 2255 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. However, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2255 115. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">An application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 115. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence only if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The burden is on the movant to establish the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the Court of Appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b) &amp; 2255 K 8. Such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, and been denied, may not circumvent the AEDPA\u2019s successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the savings clause only applies when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense;\u201d and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. They will all be met only in the narrowest of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Carr is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d does not apply. He has not met the requirements for proceeding under that clause which we laid out in <em>Wofford. </em>Carr\u2019s argument that those requirements do not apply and he may proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claim goes to the sentencing court\u2019s jurisdiction ignores the fact that jurisdictional claims are cognizable in \u00a7 2255 proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 K1 (\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that ... the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>tence ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence.\u201d). More importantly, it also ignores the fact that the <em>Wofford </em>case involved a jurisdictional claim, 177 F.3d at 1238, and, therefore, that decision itself establishes there is no jurisdictional exception to its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
