During his revocation hearing, Daniels admitted to supervised release violations and requested that he be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, without a term of supervised release) based on his inability, or unwillingness, to comply with the requirements of supervised release. The district court rejected the request, after stating: \u201cYour argument is basically [that] ... the more unsuccessful you demonstrate to the [cjourt you are going to be on supervised release[,] the more we\u2019re going to reward you by not putting you on supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">On appeal, Daniels argues that his sentence, while legal, was unreasonable because: (1) he is a \u201ctroubled individual,\u201d who was sexually abused as a child, suffers from epileptic seizures, has attempted suicide, and has serious substance abuse problems; and (2) he can successfully complete a term of imprisonment, but has difficulty meeting the technical requirements of supervised release. He notes that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court was required to, but did not, consider his history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we reviewed a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release using the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4). <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>910 F.2d 768, 769 (11th Cir.1990). Although the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>excised \u00a7 3742(e) and replaced the standard of review with a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard, <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764-66, that standard is the same as the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard in \u00a7 3742. Therefore, we will review Daniels\u2019s sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">Upon finding that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a court, after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7), may revoke a term of supervised release and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In addition, \u201cthe court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment,\u201d the length of which \u201cshall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which governs violations of supervised release, contains policy statements, one of which, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. Policy statements are merely advisory and thus, non-binding. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2002). It is enough if \u201cthere is some indication the district court was aware of and considered [Chapter 7 of the guidelines,]\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Additionally, the district court may impose any sentence within the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 362-63 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release, ... except that a defendant ... may not be required to serve on any such revocation ... more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a Class B felony[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Because the record demonstrates that (1) Daniels\u2019s sentence legally was imposed; (2) the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a longer term of imprisonment, rather than an additional term of supervised release, was based on its hesitation to reward defendants who are unsuccessful on supervised release; and (3) the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we conclude that Daniels\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Daniels\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
