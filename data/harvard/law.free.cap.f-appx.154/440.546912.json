Cuevas argues that his guilty plea was rendered invalid because the district court failed to advise him properly of the term of supervised release that he faced. The district court complied with Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-24\">Given that the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines and that Cuevas has not identified any circumstances that would warrant a downward departure, Cuevas cannot show that the court\u2019s failure to advise him fully concerning the court\u2019s ability to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-25\">Cuevas fails to identify any Rule 11 error relative to the district court\u2019s purported failure to explain the possibility of obtaining a reduction in his sentence for providing substantial assistance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Government pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 11. Cuevas\u2019s suggestion that the trial court erred by failing to allow him to withdraw his plea is frivolous given that Cuevas never sought to withdraw his plea in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Last, Cuevas has established obvious error because he was sentenced under a mandatory Guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). Cuevas fails, however, to meet his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s comments that it hated the sentence that Cuevas, a first-time offender, faced and that it was \u201cso long\u201d mean that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under advisory Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 318 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
