In his complaint, Hale sued 88 defendants for alleged constitutional violations relating to ten disciplinary reports. Hale moved to abate the instant proceedings because he was pursuing relief in state court first. The district court determined that Hale\u2019s claims were not cognizable under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because they would imply the invalidity of the sentence \u2014 a position supported by Heck\u2019s extension in <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997), to cover disciplinary determinations that affect the length of a sentence. Accordingly, because Hale\u2019s disciplinary reports had not been invalidated, the district court dismissed Hale\u2019s action without prejudice. After careful review of the record and Hale\u2019s brief, we affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">On appeal, Hale argues the district court\u2019s conversion of his motion for abeyance and subsequent dismissal of the action was error, at least in part, because one of his claims was based on an overturned disciplinary report and thus had accrued and was cognizable. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a civil rights plaintiff suing to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment must prove that the conviction or sentence has been invalidated. <em>See </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. A claim for damages relating to a conviction or sentence that has not been invalidated is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. The Supreme Court has applied the <em>Heck </em>analysis to claims made by prisoners challenging prison disciplinary actions. <em>See Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 648, 117 S.Ct. at 1589. Notably, for purposes of Hale\u2019s instant arguments, in <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court expressly disapproved of the district court\u2019s abeyance of the \u00a7 1983 action, pending invalidation of the disciplinary actions challenged by the prisoner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">Since we are remanding, we must add a word concerning the District Court\u2019s decision to stay this \u00a7 1983 action while respondent sought restoration of his good-time credits, rather than dismiss it. The District Court was of the view that once respondent had exhausted his state remedies, the \u00a7 1983 action could proceed. This was error. We reemphasize that \u00a7 1983 contains no judicially imposed exhaustion requirement; absent some other bar to the suit, <em>a claim either is cognizable under \u00a7 1983 and should immediately go forward, or is not cognizable and should be dismissed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak1\"><em>Id. </em>at 648, 117 S.Ct. at 1589 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Accordingly, as to nine of the disciplinary reports Hale challenges \u2014 the reports that Hale concedes have not been invalidated, as they are part of a pending state court action\u2014 the district court correctly dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">As for Hale\u2019s challenge to the tenth disciplinary report, dated July 26, 2002, our review reveals that Hale alleged in his complaint that this report <em>was </em>invalidated. <em>See </em>Civil Rights Complaint Form, R.l at 8-9. Moreover, Hale attached to his Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>plaint the grievance he filed, as well as the State\u2019s response, which indicates the following: \u201cThe disciplinary report you received on 7/26/02, for violation of 1-8 spoken threats, log# 110-021636 has been overturned. Our decision to overturn the disciplinary report was based on technical errors made in the processing of same. All necessary adjustments will be made to your inmate file and record. Based on the above information, your grievance is approved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Ex. SS.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (R <em>&amp; </em>R), Hale requested that the district court permit him to amend his complaint to pursue only those claims that had accrued and were not <em>Heck-barred. </em>Since his claim based on July 26, 2002 report was not <em>Heck-barred, </em>pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), he was entitled to amend as a matter of right because the defendants were not yet served. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P 15(a) (\u201c[a] party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served ... \u201d). Instead of allowing him to amend the complaint, however, the district court stated, in its order adopting the R <em>&amp; </em>R, that \u201c[bjecause the overturned disciplinary report ... is included in the currently-pending Leon County case, the statute of limitations will begin to run from the date that case is resolved, not the date the individual disciplinary report was overturned.\u201d We have very carefully reviewed the record and can find nothing indicating that the July report is part of the Leon County case. Moreover, even if the report was a part of that action, it does not necessarily follow that Hale\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim has not accrued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court insofar as it dismissed the nine <em>Heck-barred </em>claims, which involve disciplinary reports that have not been invalidated, and vacate the ruling of the district court insofar as it dismissed the claim challenging the overturned July 26, 2002 report. On remand, Hale should be permitted to amend his complaint to pursue this claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">. Because Hale is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we construe his pleadings more liberally than we would formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F,2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-18\">. Statutes of limitation pose no difficulty to plaintiffs whose convictions or sentences have not been invalidated because their \u00a7 1983 action has not yet arisen. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 489, 114 S.Ct. at 2374. The statute of limitations begins to run when the cause of action accrues. <em>Kelly v. Sema, </em>87 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1996). The cause of action accrues on the date when the conviction or disciplinary action is reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 1239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-21\">. Our holding is narrow. We have not considered the merits of the claim concerning the July 26, 2002 report. We hold <em>only </em>that Hale should be permitted to assert the claim in an amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
