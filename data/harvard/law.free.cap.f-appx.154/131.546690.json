Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly denied summary judgment to Officer Cosby because Officer Cosby had notice that his actions toward Kingdom violated her clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure. In <em>Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989), the United States Supreme Court defined a \u201cseizure\u201d within the Fourth Amendment context as a \u201cgovernmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 109 S.Ct. at 1381. In <em>Inyo, </em>the Supreme Court held that a police road block intentionally created to stop a fleeing felon met this definition, where the physical obstacle of the road block had the intended effect. <em>Id. </em>at 598-99, 109 S.Ct. at 1382. In the present case, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kingdom, we agree with the district court that sufficient evidence exists from which a jury could find that officer Cosby commanded innocent motorists to stop through display of his police authority and that his conduct constituted a \u201cmeans intentionally applied\u201d to seize Kingdom and others. We also agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Kingdom\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure was clearly established in May, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In sum, because we see no merit to any of the arguments Cosby makes in this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
