Asylum relief</p>\n<p id=\"b914-22\">Cabrera argues that the IJ erred in denying his claim for asylum because he presented substantial evidence demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) on account of his membership in a particular social group and his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>As an initial matter, we are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We can review a final order of removal only if \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right....\u201d INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Accordingly, we have held that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that were not raised before the BIA. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Galindo-Del Valle v. Attorney Gen., </em>213 F.3d 594, 599 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In this case, Cabrera did not present to the IJ or the BIA his claim for asylum on account of his membership in a particular social group. Therefore, Cabrera has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to this claim, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">When the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision became the final removal order subject to review. <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo the extent that the [IJ]\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ]\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal....\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-13\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. If the petitioner demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebut-table presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If he cannot show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution.\u201d We have stated, however, that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors, such as his political opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The petitioner must establish this causal connection by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d on account the statutory factor. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted)(emphasis in original). We have noted that to establish a claim of persecution by a guerrilla group on account of a political opinion, the petitioner \u201cmust establish that the guerrillas persecuted [him] or will seek to persecute [him] in the future <em>because of </em>[his] actual or imputed political opinion. It is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerrillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted)(emphasis in original). Finally, we have approved of a \u201ccountry-wide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \u201cinternal resettlement alternative\u201d in his own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">In this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Cabrera failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. Thus, he was not eligible for asylum, and the record does not compel a reversal of this determination. Cabrera did not suffer past persecution because he was never physically harmed by the FARC, and at most, he only received occasional verbal threats, which Cabrera testified always came through other sources such as the temporary employees of his company. Persecution is an extreme concept, and this evidence is insufficient to compel a reversal of the IJ\u2019s finding that Cabrera did not suffer past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Cabrera did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion because the threats he had received stemmed from his company\u2019s refusal to pay \u201cwar taxes\u201d to the FARC when operating within the dangerous \u201cred zones\u201d in Colombia. Thus, Cabrera cannot establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion because of this refusal to cooperate with the FARC\u2019s demands. Finally, there is no showing why Cabrera could not seek internal resettlement in Colombia, or refuse to perform contracts in certain known dangerous areas, in order to avoid future persecution from the FARC. Accordingly, we deny Cabrera\u2019s petition for review as to his request for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>II. Protection under the CAT</p>\n<p id=\"A2B\">Cabrera also argues that the IJ erred in denying his claim for protection under the CAT, contending that he presented evidence that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured by the FARC if he returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In order to obtain relief under the CAT, the burden is on the applicant to establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-6\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). In <em>Sanchez, </em>we held that in order \u201c[t]o demonstrate eligibility for CAT protection, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that [he] will be tortured in [his] home country at the hands of the government or that the government will acquiesce in the torture,\u201d and rejected the applicant\u2019s claim because she presented no evidence on either point. 392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">In this case, like <em>Sanchez, </em>Cabrera presented no evidence that the government would torture him upon his return to Colombia or that the government would acquiesce to his torture at the hands of the FARC. Because Cabrera cannot demonstrate his eligibility for protection under the CAT, we deny his petition for review as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-13\">. Cabrera abandoned his claim for withholding of removal under the INA by failing to raise any argument on this claim in his petition for review. <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
