The district court sentenced Bullard to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000). The court also specified an identical alternate sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Bullard appeals, asserting that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because it was enhanced under the mandatory federal sentencing guidelines scheme based on facts found by the district court to which Bullard did not admit. We conclude that no Sixth Amendment error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">Initially, we reject Bullard\u2019s claim that his criminal history category was erroneously elevated from V to VI based upon an impermissible judicial finding that he was serving a term of probation when he committed the firearms offense to which he pled guilty. The district court\u2019s finding served as a valid factor upon which Bullard\u2019s sentence could be based because a defendant\u2019s probationary status constitutes a form of \u201cdata inherent in a prior conviction [rather than] extraneous to it.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and its progeny, the fact that Bullard was on probation could be relied upon by the district court even though it was neither found by a jury nor admitted to by Bullard.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-20\">With Bullard\u2019s criminal history score properly fixed at VI, it follows that the district court\u2019s judicial enhancement of Bullard\u2019s base offense level of 24 entailed no Sixth Amendment consequence. This is so because the guideline sentencing range for a defendant with an offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of VI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>is 100-125 months. Thus, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred because Bullard received a prison term of 120 months, a sentence well within the permissible guideline range before adjusting the offense level for acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Bullard\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-18\"> As required by <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 288 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), in determining whether Sixth Amendment error occurred, the sentence imposed must be compared to the permissible guideline range without consideration of any adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
