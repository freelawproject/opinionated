GemStat. \u00a7 14-277.1 (1993) (Count 3); and resisting, delaying, or obstructing a public officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, assimilating N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14r-223 (1993) (Count 4). The magistrate judge sentenced Mays to twelve months on Count 1, a consecutive four months on Count 3, and a concurrent sixty days on Count 4. Mays appealed to the district court, challenging the magistrate judge\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence on Count 3. The district court affirmed Mays\u2019 sentence and Mays timely appealed. We find no error in the district court\u2019s order affirming the sentence imposed by the magistrate judge. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Mays, </em>No. CR-05-30 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 1, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
