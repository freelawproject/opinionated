Bradford\u2019s attorney initially filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether there was appeal-able error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Bradford\u2019s counsel filed a supplemental brief raising the issue of whether his enhanced punishment as an armed career criminal violated his right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment. Bradford was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but did not do so. Finding no meritorious issues, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Although Bradford did not object to the presentence report or dispute that he had at least three prior convictions for felony breaking and entering under North Carolina law, he contends that whether or not these offenses qualified as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d or were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000) were facts that had to be charged in the indictment and determined by the jury or admitted by him. However, Bradford\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005). Because the facts necessary to support both the fifteen-year mandatory minimum prison sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and the enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B) (2003) \u201cinhere in the fact of conviction,\u201d there was no error. <em>See id. </em>at 283, 287 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Bradford\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw <em>from </em>representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
