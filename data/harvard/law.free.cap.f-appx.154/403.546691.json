See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b428-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Timothy Rudolph Wade pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of 500 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), 846 (2000), and possession of counterfeit money, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 (2000). The district court sentenced Wade to 216 months of imprisonment. Wade\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but asserting the following claims: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying Wade\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea; and (2) the district court\u2019s sentence was too severe. In a supplement, counsel challenges the constitutionality of Wade\u2019s sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Wade has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">A defendant who seeks to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing must demonstrate a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal of the plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). A \u201cfair and just\u201d reason is one that essentially \u201cchallenges the fairness of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceeding\u201d or \u201cchallenges the fulfillment of a promise or condition emanating from the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992). A court should closely scrutinize the Rule 11 colloquy and attach a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding if the Rule 11 proceeding is adequate. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996). After reviewing the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding no \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal of Wade\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">Wade also alleges that the district court\u2019s sentence was too severe. Because we find that the district court correctly calculated the sentencing guideline range and Wade\u2019s sentence was within the statutory maximum penalty, we decline to review the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Wade in the middle of the guideline range. <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Wade further challenges his sentence as a career offender, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2003), under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Specifically, he argues that his sentence was improperly enhanced based on a prior conviction. Because Wade did not object below, this claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, 401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th </em>Cir.2005). This court has held that, where the facts are undisputed, the application of the career offender enhancement falls within the exception for prior convictions. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005); <em>accord United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cCareer offender status is not \u2018a sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a fact other than a prior conviction.\u2019 ... <em>Booker </em>explicitly excepts from Sixth Amendment analysis the third component of the <em>crime </em>of violence determination, the fact of two prior convictions.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 247 (4th Cir.2005) (finding no plain error in the district court\u2019s designation of Harp as a career offender), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005) (No. 05-5887). Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in designating Wade as a career offender and that Wade\u2019s sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment in this regard.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">We have reviewed Wade\u2019s claims in his supplemental brief and various supplements and find them without merit. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Wade\u2019s conviction and sentence. To the extent that Wade challenges the court\u2019s imposition of a sentence with a properly calculated guideline range, we dismiss that portion of the appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> Furthermore, Wade has failed to demonstrate that the plain error in sentencing him under a mandatory guideline scheme affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
