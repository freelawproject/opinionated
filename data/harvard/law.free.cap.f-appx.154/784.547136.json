Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et. seq., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985, 1986, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 case, the district court, ruling on defendants\u2019 alternative motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, granted defendants summary judgment <em>on </em>Counts I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII of plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. <em>See </em>Order on Motion to Dismiss Complaint or, in the alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, dated February 28, 2005. This disposed of all of plaintiff Maggio\u2019s claims. As for Count III, plaintiff Gamo\u2019s claim for assault and battery, the court concluded that that count failed to state a claim for relief. <em>Id. </em>The court gave Gamo leave to amend Count III by a date certain so to identify the persons who allegedly committed the assault and battery and the constitutional rights purportedly infringed. The court\u2019s order stated that Gamo\u2019s failure to amend Count III would result in a dismissal without further notice. <em>Id. </em>Gamo failed <em>to </em>amend Count III. The court therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>dismissed the case with prejudice, entering final judgment for defendants on all claims. <em>See </em>Order Dismissing Case in its Entirety, dated March 25, 2005. Maggio and Gamo now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserted claims for false arrest and imprisonment and illegal search of plaintiffs\u2019 persons and seizure of their currency, in violation of the Fourth Amendment; assault and battery upon plaintiff Gamo; deprivation of plaintiffs\u2019 property without due process, in violation of the Fifth Amendment; imposition of excessive fines, in violation of the Eighth Amendment; conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; and \u201cneglect to prevent\u201d unlawful acts under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Plaintiffs contend that summary judgment was improper because defendants did not file a concise statement of material facts, and, although there were disputed issues of material fact, plaintiffs were not required to point out those disputed facts because the defendants had not met their burden to show that they were entitled to summary judgment. Plaintiffs also contend that the district court could not grant the motion to dismiss because it considered matters outside the pleadings and, moreover, improperly acted as a fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We find no error in the manner in which the court handled the matter. The court did not improperly convert defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment because defendants\u2019 motion explicitly relied on the summary judgment rule, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Even if we were to conclude that the court failed to comply with Rule 56\u2019s requirement that the non-movant be given ten days\u2019 notice of the court\u2019s intention to take a motion for summary judgment under advisement, we would find the error harmless because plaintiffs were well aware of defendants\u2019 reliance on Rule 56, as evidenced by the arguments they made and the documents they submitted in response to defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In this case, the material facts are not in dispute; hence, it was ripe for summary judgment consideration. The question thus becomes whether the court erred in granting summary judgment (as well as defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count III).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">The district court dispositive order of February 28, 2005, contains an accurate statement of plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the applicable law. We discern no error in the court\u2019s application of that law to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The court\u2019s judgment is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
