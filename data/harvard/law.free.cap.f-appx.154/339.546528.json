On appeal, Armstrong\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, stating there were no meritorious issues, but raising the issue of whether the district court denied Armstrong\u2019s motion to continue sentencing for the purpose of perhaps receiving a motion by the Government for a downward departure based upon substantial assistance. Armstrong was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not respond. The Government elected not to file a separate brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a continuance at sentencing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Speed, </em>53 F.3d 643, 644 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cBecause a district court has broad discretion in scheduling the sentencing proceeding, \u2018[a]bsent a showing both that the denial was arbitrary and that it substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s opportunity to secure a fair sentence, we will not vacate a sentence because a continuance was denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Speed, </em>53 F.3d at 644\u201445 (quoting <em>United States v. Booth, </em>996 F.2d 1395, 1397-98 (2d Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In <em>Speed, </em>the defendant sought a continuance because he was interviewed by law enforcement authorities and could be called to testify. According to the defendant, the likelihood the Government would file a motion for a downward departure would increase if he testified at a trial. However, we noted there was no abuse of discretion because the defendant could not state when the sentencing should be held or at what trials he may be called to testify. Likewise, Armstrong could not provide any specific information about the nature of his assistance except to say he was providing information about several murders. There was no indication charges were being brought against individuals as a result of Armstrong\u2019s information. In addition, the Government specifically stated Armstrong failed to provide substantial assistance. Accordingly, we find the court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Armstrong\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-18\">. <em>Anders v.
