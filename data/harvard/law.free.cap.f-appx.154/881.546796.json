On appeal, Lebr\u00f3n argues that the district court erred by committing the structural error of not considering the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when fashioning his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that \u201cfull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>consideration\u201d of those factors is required, and that, because the district court did not indicate that it had considered any of the factors, we should assume that it relied solely on the guidelines range. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Because Lebr\u00f3n did not object to his sentence on the grounds raised in this appeal, we will review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (holding that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to his sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds meant that this Court would review only for plain error). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Here, the district court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise. The record indicates that the district court considered the statutory factors and purposes prior to imposing a sentence that it found to be sufficient, but not more than necessary, to satisfy those purposes. While it did not specifically elaborate on each and every factor, we have squarely held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>No. 426 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err when imposing Lebron\u2019s sentence because it considered the statutory factors and was not required to elaborate or discuss each of them on the record. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-11\">. This total sentence represents the sentence imposed with respect to Count 1 and the mandatory 60-month consecutive sentence with respect to Count 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">. Lebr\u00f3n admits that he lodged no objections to his sentence and, therefore, plain error review applies. However, he urges us to consider the error a structural one deserving of <em>de novo </em>review. In doing so, he purports to adopt the dissenting opinions in this Court\u2019s denial of the petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005). However, \u201d[t]he law of this circuit is emphatic that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997). Thus, this argument lacks merit and is not further addressed. Furthermore, Lebr\u00f3n does not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Therefore, it is not addressed. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>416 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>failure to raise a <em>Booker </em>challenge in the initial brief abandons the issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
