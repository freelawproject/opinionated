Gagum\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Gagum filed a pro se brief arguing that the district court\u2019s sentence was not reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, 401 </em>F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. As </em>stated in <em>Hughes, </em>this court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed, range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">Gagum claims that his sentence is unreasonable. In his plea agreement, Ga-gum agreed that he was a career offender. The district court correctly determined his sentencing guideline range. After acknowledging that the sentencing guidelines were advisory, the district court consulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). The district court selected a prison sentence of 210 months, in the middle of the advisory guideline range, based upon Gagum\u2019s prior criminal record. The district court expressed its hope that the sentence would serve as a deterrent to future criminal behavior because Gagum\u2019s previous prison time had not had an adequate deterrent effect on him. Because the district court relied on appropriate sentencing considerations and it imposed a sentence well within the advisory guideline range, we conclude that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Gagum\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-13\"> Gagum also claims that under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C) (2004), he should have received a base offense level of thirty-two. However, as his crime carried a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, his base offense level was thirty-four under USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B). The district court did not err in calculating his base offense level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
