Torres, and Sof\u00eda M. Lopez, through counsel, seek review of two Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) decisions (1) affirming the Immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>gration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order finding them removable and denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158,1281, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c), and (2) denying their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s December 10, 2004, decision affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. However, we do not have jurisdiction to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cWe review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. \u201d Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). We have held that \u201c[sjince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under the INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We conclude that we are without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal issued on December 10, 2004. The petitioners were required to file a petition for review of their underlying claims by January 10, 2005. However, they did not do so until March 22, 2005. While the petitioners filed a motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance on January 10, 2005, this filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review in this Court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Though we retain jurisdiction to review the March 3, 2005, BIA order denying the petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration, they fail to raise any argument with respect to this motion. Accordingly, this claim is abandoned. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Based on the foregoing, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny the petition for review in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
