On appeal, Bland\u00f3n argues that the district court erred in not granting her a minor-role reduction because it failed properly to apply the test from <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). She argues that, under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the district court was required to measure her conduct against the other participants\u2019 conduct. She argues that because the district court categorically denied her request for a minor-role reduction based upon her being a drug courier, and as such, applied a per <em>se </em>preclusive rule, the standard of review in this case should be <em>de novo, </em>not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-19\">The standard of review for a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a minor-role reduction is clear error. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 937-38). The proponent of the reduction always bears the burden of proving the entitlement to the reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if she is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [her] role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5. In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court\u2019s decision \u201cshould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, her role as compared to that of other participants in her relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. In looking to relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating her base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The district court determined that because Bland\u00f3n was held accountable only for the amount of drugs she imported into the United States, her actual conduct and her relevant conduct were identical. <em>See DeVaron, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43. (\u201c[A] district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of these drugs.\u201d) Thus, concluding Bland\u00f3n did not play a minor role in the relevant conduct, the district court was not required to analyze the <em>DeVaron </em>second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Because the record demonstrates that the district court did not categorically exclude Bland\u00f3n from a minor-role reduction and it properly applied the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, we conclude there was no clear error. Accordingly, we affirm Blandon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
