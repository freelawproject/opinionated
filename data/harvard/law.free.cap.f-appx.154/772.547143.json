Prieto, </em>232 F.3d 816 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cPrieto </em>I\u201d), we affirmed Carlos Alberto Prieto\u2019s convictions, imposed pursuant to a jury verdict, for conspiracy to steal computer equipment and transport it in foreign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314 and 371 (Count 3); two counts of attempting to rob a United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d) truck by force, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2 (Counts 4 and 6); and two counts of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence (the attempted robberies), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2 (Counts 5 and 7). In his direct appeal, Prieto did not challenge his sentence consisting of a total term of 378 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. The sentence included three concurrent terms of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment for Counts 3, 4 and 6; a 60-month consecutive term as to Count 5; and a separate 240-month consecutive term as to Count 7. In calculating the 78-month terms, the district court imposed a 5-level enhancement to Prieto\u2019s offense level for possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">In March 2005, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Prieto filed a motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that (1) his sentence should be reduced based upon Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and (2) his conviction and 240-month consecutive sentence on Count 7 were \u201cfatally flawed\u201d as they were based on the same firearm possession as his conviction and 60-month term on Count 5. The government conceded that Amendment 599 foreclosed the five-level enhancement where Prieto also had received separate consecutive sentences for violations of \u00a7 924(c) and submitted that it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to reduce Prieto\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">The district court granted Prieto\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion and recalculated Prieto\u2019s sentence without the five-level increase, which resulted in an overall 27-month decrease in Prieto\u2019s total term of imprisonment. Thus, Prieto received a 351-month total sentence. Prieto then filed this appeal, <em>\u201cPrieto II,\u201d </em>arguing that the district court erred by failing to address the merits of his \u00a7 3582 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> More specifically, Prieto contends the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>trict court erred by failing to vacate his 240-month sentence on Count 7, which he asserts was based on the same underlying conduct as his conviction for Count 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). Abuse-of-discretion review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">recognizes the range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach. By definition ... under the abuse of discretion standard of review there will be occasions in which we affirm the district court even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call. That is how an abuse of discretion standard differs from a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. As we have stated previously, the abuse of discretion standard allows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2516, 161 L.Ed.2d 1114 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court is authorized to modify a sentence when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9\">a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after eonsidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201cBoth the language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this circuit\u2019s precedent indicate that the sentencing court\u2019s power to reduce a sentence is discretionary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Amendment 599, which clarified the policy against double-counting a firearm both (1) under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) <em>and </em>(2) for purposes of a weapons enhancement for the underlying offense Guidelines range, provides the .following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-14\">[i]f a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any ... weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599 (2000). Amendment 599 is retroactively applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>and therefore applies to Prieto. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Thus, under \u00a7 3282(c)(2), the district court had the discretion to reduce Prieto\u2019s sentence and grant Prieto relief in the form of applying Amendment 599 to his case. The court correctly determined that the five-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) did not apply to Prieto because he also was convicted in separate counts for use of a firearm during and in furtherance of a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599 (2000). Moreover, the district court correctly calculated Prieto\u2019s modified Guidelines range after the five-level enhancement was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We reject Prieto\u2019s suggestion that he was entitled to additional relief in the form of a vacation of his 240-month consecutive sentence on Count 7, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). His argument \u2014 that the criminal conduct underlying Counts 5 and 7 was the same \u2014 simply is not a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it does not concern an amendment to the Guidelines. Prieto received all of the relief to which he was entitled under Amendment 599. On this record, we can find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s disposition of Prieto\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\">. To the extent Prieto raises new issues <em>not </em>related to Amendment 599, including his Double Jeopardy argument and his challenge to the district court\u2019s jury instructions at trial, those claims are outside the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which concerns sentencing ranges lowered by the Sentencing Commission under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). Accordingly, we will not address those arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-10\">. We are unpersuaded by Prieto's argument that the district court erred by failing to allow him to file a reply to the government\u2019s response to his motion. By its own terms, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides that a district court may reduce a sentence <em>on its own motion, </em>thereby negating Prieto's suggestion that he has the <em>right </em>to file a response in such a proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
