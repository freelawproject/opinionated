Barnhart (\u201cCommissioner\u201d), that Palomo was not entitled to disability income benefits and supplemental security income benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423, 1382c. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">On June 21, 2001, Christina Palomo, then a 20-year old female with a ninth grade education and vocational experience as a fast-food worker, alleged disability beginning on June 21, 1999, due to high blood pressure, pseudotumor cerebri, asthma, obesity, Bell\u2019s palsy, and headaches. Following the five-step analysis pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(b-f) &amp; 416.920(b-f), the ALJ weighed several doctors\u2019 diagnoses, assessed Palomo\u2019s work history and residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), and considered testimony from a vocational expert. The ALJ concluded that Palomo was capable of performing a significant range of sedentary work. Thus, the ALJ concluded that Palomo was not \u201cdisabled\u201d under the Social Security Act. The Appeals Council denied Palomo\u2019s request for review, making the determination of the ALJ the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 205, Palomo sought review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate, who recommended that the Commissioner\u2019s decision be affirmed. After Palomo filed objections, the district court entered an order adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. Palomo timely filed a notice of appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cIt must be more than a scintilla, but it need not be a preponderance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Any findings of fact by the Commissioner supported by substantial evidence are conclusive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence, but may only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">Palomo attacks the Commissioner\u2019s decision on a number of grounds, none of them with merit. First, Palomo argues that the ALJ erred by failing to give proper consideration to the opinions of her treating physicians. Second, Palomo argues that the ALJ erred by failing to consider her mental and educational limitations, as reported by Lester Harrell, Ph.D. Third, Palomo argues that the ALJ erred by failing to give a proper rationale for his credibility evaluation. Fourth, Palomo argues that the ALJ erred in finding that she had a high school education. Fifth, Palomo argues that the ALJ incorrectly allocated the burden of proof. We consider each argument in turn.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Palomo argues that the ALJ failed to give greater weight to the opinions of her treating physicians. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. The ultimate determination of disability is reserved for the Commissioner,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and an ALJ must take into consideration all of the evidence from the claimant\u2019s treating physicians.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In order to discredit evidence from a treating physician, the ALJ must present good cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An ALJ may diminish the weight of a treating physician\u2019s opinion when it is unsupported by the evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Here, the ALJ properly discounted the opinions of Robert Shumaker, M.D., and Antonio Guerra, M.D. Although both Dr. Shumaker and Dr. Guerra initially reported that Palomo was disabled, each subsequently provided reports contradicting their initial assessment. Dr. Shumaker stated that Palomo could lift and carry less than ten pounds, and stand and walk for at least two hours of an eight-hour workday; Dr. Guerra stated that Palomo could lift and carry six-to-ten pounds, stand and walk two-to-four hours per workday, and sit four-to-six hours per workday. Moreover, Dr. Guerra stated that Palomo was able to perform her past relevant work as a drive-through cashier at a fast-food restaurant. The inconsistency in the treating physicians\u2019 reports provides good cause for not giving their testimony greater weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">These findings are consistent with the evidence presented at the hearing before the ALJ by Michael Perkins, M.D. Specifically, Dr. Perkins testified that Palomo retained the functional capacity to occasionally lift twenty pounds, frequently lift ten pounds, stand and walk at least two hours per workday, and sit six hours per workday. Dr. Perkins\u2019s testimony provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Palomo retained the residual functional capacity for a wide range of sedentary work. We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Second, Palomo argues that the ALJ failed to consider the mental and educational limitations reported by Lester Harrell, Ph.D. Specifically, Dr. Harrell found that Palomo was functioning in the borderline range of intellectual functioning and that she had a sixth-grade spelling level and fifth-grade reading level.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">We conclude that the ALJ properly considered this evidence. The ALJ specifically noted that Palomo\u2019s intellectual functioning was in the borderline range. Furthermore, the ALJ stated that this level of functioning would not preclude Palomo from performing unskilled work activity, which requires little or no judgment and involves simple tasks that can be learned on the job in a short period of time. Moreover, Dr. Harrell never testified that Palomo was unable to perform unskilled work, which does not require academic skills or vocational preparation. We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Third, Palomo argues that the ALJ failed to provide a proper rationale for its finding that her subjective complaints were not entirely credible. We defer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s findings, as it has the responsibility to resolve questions of credibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A claimant\u2019s subjective complaints must be corroborated, at least in part, by objective medical evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">As the magistrate reported, the ALJ thoroughly discussed the medical records which included extensive information on Palomo\u2019s complaints, impairments, aggravating factors, and treatment. Here, the ALJ found that Palomo\u2019s physical examinations were essentially normal and that Palomo\u2019s symptoms were reasonably well-controlled with medication, even during two pregnancies. Moreover, the ALJ noted gaps in Palomo\u2019s medical treatment from March 2000 to September 2000 and from December 2001 to January 2003. On this evidence, we find that the ALJ could have reasonably concluded that Palomo\u2019s symptoms were not as severe as she alleged. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>D</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Fourth, Palomo asserts that the ALJ erred in finding that she had a high school education when, in fact, she had only completed the ninth grade. At most, this error is harmless.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The social seeurity regulations consider a ninth-grade education to be a \u201climited education,\u201d which allows the person to perform unskilled work.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here, the ALJ considered evidence from a vocational expert that identified unskilled jobs that were within Palomo\u2019s residual functional capacity. Moreover, Palomo has failed to show that her ninth grade education would prevent her from performing the unskilled work identified by the vocational expert and adopted by the ALJ. Thus, Palomo cannot show that the ALJ\u2019s error affected her substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\n<em>E</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Fifth, Palomo contends that the ALJ and the district court erroneously placed the burden of proof on Palomo to show that she was not able to perform the work identified by the vocational expert. Palomo asserts that she is only required to show that she cannot perform her past relevant work. We disagree. Under the fifth-step of the evaluation process, the Commission bears the burden of showing that there exists work in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Once such jobs are identified, the burden shifts back to the claimant to rebut this finding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ALJ followed this burden-shifting approach, and we reject Palomo\u2019s contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner\u2019s final decision denying Palomo\u2019s claim for benefits under the Social Security Act is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Palomo presents two additional arguments on appeal. First, Palomo argues that the severity of her impairment \u201cwaxes and wanes,\u201d which renders her unable to maintain employment. <em>See Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618 (5th Cir.2003). Second, Palomo argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is deficient because it did not include limitations due to blurred vision and headaches. Since neither argument was presented to the ALJ or to the district court, we decline to consider them for the first time on appeal. <em>Greenberg v.
