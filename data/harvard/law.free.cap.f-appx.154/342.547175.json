Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Lynch has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Additionally, we construe Lynch\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence, not previously discoverable by due diligence, that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2), 2255 (2000). Lynch\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. <em>See In re Vial, </em>115 F.3d 1192, 1198 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc) (holding that \u201c \u2018newly discovered evidence\u2019 exception to the bar on second and successive \u00a7 2255 proceedings ... applies only to challenges to the underlying conviction; it is not available to assert sentencing error.\u201d). Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-12\"> Because Lynch's Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion was not filed within ten days of the district court\u2019s judgment as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), the time for appealing that order expired before he filed his notice of appeal on May 23, 2005, and only the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion and motion to amend was preserved for appeal. <em>See Alston v. MCI Communications Corp., </em>84 F.3d 705, 706 (4th Cir.1996) (only a timely Rule 59(e) motion tolls time period for filing notice of appeal); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv)-(vi).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
