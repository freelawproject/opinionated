Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">In his complaint, Amesbury alleged that United States Forest Service Officer Hugh Booth falsely arrested him in October 2002 for violating 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.58(a), as supplemented by United States Forest Service Order 2002-07, which prohibited camping for longer than 14 days. Amesbury also alleged that he was again unlawfully arrested and imprisoned in April 2003 based on a separate incident at the same site, claiming that Florida Fish <em>&amp; </em>Wildlife Conservation Commission Officer Thomas Groff wrongfully wrote him a state citation for parking in a restricted area, arrested him, and had his vehicle and personal belongings towed and impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">Having reviewed the record and considered the argument of the parties we find no reversible error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, Amesbury\u2019s complaint does not state a false arrest claim as it pertains to his arrest by Officer Booth. In FTCA actions, federal courts apply the law of the situs state to determine whether a tort claim has been stated. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). In Florida, probable cause is an affirmative defense to the tort of false arrest, and the facts asserted in Amesbury\u2019s complaint make clear that there was more than probable cause for his arrest. Nor could Amesbury state a claim under the FTCA for his arrest by Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission <em>Officer </em>Thomas Groff because the allegations pertaining to this claim all involved behavior by state rather than federal actors. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Amesbury\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>We also find meritless Amesbury\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint, as Amesbury could not allege a colorable claim that federal officers violated his fourth amendment rights under the facts presented in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order dismissing a complaint, accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor. <em>Chesser v. Sparks, 248 F.3d 1117, </em>1121 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
