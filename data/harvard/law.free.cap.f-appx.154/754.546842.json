On appeal, Outler argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence based on facts neither alleged in the indictment nor proven to a jury. Outler argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is an ineffective or inadequate avenue to challenge his detention because he has raised <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), claims in prior motions, including a previous \u00a7 2255 motion. He contends that because those pri- or motions were denied, \u201cit was highly unlikely if the trial court would ... reverse itself if these [s]ame allegations were presented a second time,\u201d and, therefore, any remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-22\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>clause in \u00a7 2255, however, permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The burden lies with the petitioner to affirmatively show that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255; <em>In re Blackshire, </em>98 F.3d 1293, 1293 (11th Cir.1996). The restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause, and a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. See Wofford v. Scott, 177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). The savings clause only applies when (1) the movant\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244; <em>see also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Outler argues that the savings clause applies to him because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>should be applied retroactively on collateral review. We have held that \u201cthe constitutional rule announced in <em>Booker </em>is a prototypical procedural rule .... that do[es] not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.2005). The first prong of the savings clause test therefore has not been met because <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The second prong of the savings clause test also has not been met because the offenses for which Outler was convicted have not been made \u201cnonexistent\u201d by <em>Booker. </em>In <em>Sawyer, </em>we held that where a subsequent decision \u201cclarified the standard by which a jury must find the defendant guilty of a [specified crime]\u201d and where the defendant was convicted under the prior standard, the defendant was not convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d for the purposes of a habeas petition. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1366. <em>Booker, </em>even if it were retroactively applicable on collateral review, addressed sentencing issues. It did not invalidate the crimes for which Outler was convicted. Outler thus has not satisfied the prerequisites necessary to invoke \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
