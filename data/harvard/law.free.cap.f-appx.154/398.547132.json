Hatten appeals, arguing that he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea and challenging the validity of his sentence. We affirm Hat-ten\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-22\">Hatten contends that the government breached the plea agreement by arguing for the application of the murder cross reference of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l) (2003). We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the government did not breach the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">The parties are in apparent agreement that Hatten is entitled to be resentenced in light of <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, although we affirm Hatten\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of Hughes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because we are vacating Hatten\u2019s sentence, we need not address Hatten\u2019s other sentencing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-24\">Even though the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West Supp.2005). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-18\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Hatten's sentencing. 401 F.3d at 545 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
