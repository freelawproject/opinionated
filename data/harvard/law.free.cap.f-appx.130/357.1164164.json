Because the district court had the discretion to reduce Joseph\u2019s sentence and did not abuse its discretion by choosing not to reduce his sentence, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">A jury convicted Joseph of conspiracy to commit bank robbery and armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d), (e) and 371 (counts 1 and 2); kidnaping during a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e) (count 3); use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (count 4); and possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j) (count 5). Rl-99,121. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Joseph and three co-defendants, Ryan Joseph, Charles Joseph, and Watson Dilbert (collectively \u201cthe co-defendants\u201d), were involved in a bank robbery during which they took Connie Norris, the bank\u2019s assistant branch manager, hostage. PSI U 9. The co-defendants entered the bank armed with semiautomatic weapons, obtained $79,805, and used Norris as a shield while exiting the bank. <em>Id. </em>11119, 13. They forced Norris into the getaway car, driven by Joseph, and a high-speed chase ensued, during which the co-defendants pointed their guns at Norris. <em>Id. </em>HH10, 13. During the chase, the car became airborne and landed on a railroad track. Joseph and the co-defendants left Norris in the car and fled on foot. They fired several shots at officers during the foot pursuit but were eventually caught. <em>Id. </em>HIT 10,11. Joseph received a seven-level increase in his offense level for discharge of a firearm pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A). Rl117.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The district court sentenced Joseph to a total prison term of 270 months, which reflected concurrent terms of 60 months on count one, 210 months on count two, 210 months on count three, and 120 months on count five, and a consecutive term of 60 months on count four. Rl-121. Joseph appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court \u201cdouble counted\u201d when it sentenced him under \u00a7 924(c) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(a). Rl-134 at 2. We affirmed his sentence because the enhancement did not involve the same firearm or possession for which a penalty was imposed under \u00a7 924(c), and his sentence could be enhanced based on the possession of firearms by his coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Joseph filed a motion to modify his sentence and asserted that as a result of Amendment 599, which applied retroactively, his offense level should have been reduced by seven levels, which would have resulted in a reduced guideline range of 78-97 months. R2-254. He also contended that with Amendment 599, his sentence would be a minimum of 180 months total. R2-257 at 3. He asserted that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 21, 159 L.Ed.2d 851 (2004), applies to his case and renders application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) unconstitutional as applied to him. He argued that \u00a7 3553(a) factors could not be used as grounds to deny his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A41\">The district court denied Joseph\u2019s motion. The court recalculated Joseph\u2019s offense level and determined that, as a result of a mandatory minimum sentence for count three, the guideline sentence would be 120 months of imprisonment plus a consecutive 60-month term for count four. As a result, with Amendment 599, Joseph\u2019s sentence would be a total of 180 months. The court considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), noted the nature and circumstances of the offense, and stated that it was \u201ca concern of [the][c]ourt that a sentence in this case protect the public from future crimes of the defendant as well as afford adequate deterrence.\u201d R2-256 at 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The court indicated that it was not required to reduce Joseph\u2019s sentence and declined to do so, specifically finding that \u201cthe original sentence as imposed is appropriate considering the brutality of this particular offense, the propensity for dangerous conduct shown by the defendant, and the necessity to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Joseph argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to modify his prison term by basing its decision on \u201cthe manner in which the crime was committed when the jury did not find the [aggravating] factor beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6. Joseph asserts that, in light of <em>Blakely, </em>the application of \u00a7 3553(a) is unconstitutional as applied to him and may not be used as grounds to deny his motion. He contends that the district court failed to show how it would have imposed the same sentence absent the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement and provided no authority justifying a sentence imposed outside of the guideline range. He argues that the district court\u2019s application of the seven-level firearm increase was not a harmless error because it significantly increased the applicable guideline range. He asserts that although the district court\u2019s authority to modify his sentence is discretionary, the court is not entitled to abuse its discretion, and that he should not be penalized for conduct already considered. He posits that the district court based its denial of his motion on factors for which he was already punished. He asserts that the district court covertly imposed an upward departure from the guidelines without informing him of its intentions to go outside of the required sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Joseph also argues that the seven-level enhancement is not precluded from consideration because he is seeking modification of his sentence, and he was punished twice for the same conduct. He asserts that once the district court found that Amendment 599 applied to his sentence, it acknowledged that he was sentenced in violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, 144 F.3d </em>756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe abuse of discretion standard has been described as allowing a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir.1989). A court is authorized to modify a sentence when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Before deciding to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court must: (1) \u201csubstitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed;\u201d and (2) \u201cconsider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. \u201cBoth the language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this circuit\u2019s precedent indicate that the sentencing court\u2019s power to reduce a sentence is discretionary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>3553(a) provides that, in imposing a sentence, the district court must consider factors including the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Guidelines Amendment 599 clarified the policy against double-counting a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and under a weapon enhancement for the underlying offense guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599 (2000). Amendment 599 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">[i]f a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any ... weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599 (2000). Amendment 599 is retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">As a preliminary matter, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>-U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, -, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which extended the holding of <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines, is not applicable in this case because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes only modification of a sentence as a result of an amendment to the guidelines made retroactive by the Sentencing Commission and is not a means to attack the constitutionality of a sentence. To the extent Joseph argues that use of \u00a7 3553(a) is unconstitutional, <em>Booker </em>does not affect a court\u2019s ability to consider the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) in determining an appropriate sentence. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757 (stating that courts can \u201ctailor [a] sentence in light of ... statutory concerns\u201d other than the guidelines ranges).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">The district court had the discretion to reduce Joseph\u2019s sentence and did not make a clear error of judgment by denying his motion. The court first determined that Joseph\u2019s sentence would be a total of 180 months of imprisonment with Amendment 599. <em>See </em>R2-256 at 2-3. Additionally, the record reflects that the district court considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) in determining whether to reduce Joseph\u2019s sentence, specifically discussing the factors related to protecting the public from a defendant\u2019s future crimes and affording adequate deterrence. The court properly recognized that it was not required to reduce Joseph\u2019s sentence and opted not to do so, concluding that his original sentence was more appropriate given the nature of the offense and the need to protect the public from Joseph\u2019s further crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">Because the district court\u2019s decision is not a clear error of judgment, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Joseph\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. Joseph\u2019s argument, by way of reply, was not filed until 19 July 2004, one week after the district court denied his motion. <em>See </em>R2-256; R2-257.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
