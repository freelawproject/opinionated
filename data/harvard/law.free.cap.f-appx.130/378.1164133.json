Simmons filed his petition <em>after </em>the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996); therefore, the provisions of that act govern this appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability on \u201c[wjhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992), by failing to address appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to a hearsay statement made by one of the police officers involved in the case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">First, Simmons argues that the state\u2019s brief was untimely. \u201cThe appellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the appellant\u2019s brief is served.\u201d Fed. R.App.P. 31(a)(1). Simmons indicated in his certificate of service that he furnished this Court with a copy of his brief on November 17, 2004. However, because he did not indicate that he served a copy of his brief on the state, the state\u2019s time for filing a response brief started the day that this Court issued a letter confirming the brief due date. Because this Court\u2019s letter was sent to the state on November 24, 2004, and December 25, 2004 was a Saturday, the state\u2019s brief, e-filed on Monday, December 27, 2004, was timely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 26(a) (excluding weekends and holidays from calculation of time periods).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">We next address the merits of Simmons\u2019s <em>Clisby </em>claim. \u201c[I]n reviewing a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas petition, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and review <em>de novo </em>both questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Peoples v. Campbell, </em>377 F.3d 1208, 1224 (11th Cir. 2004). However, when the district court makes no independent finding of facts, we review its holdings <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">When a district court does not address all of the issues in a \u00a7 2254 petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims whenever the district court has not resolved all such claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938. \u201cA claim for relief for [these] purposes ... is any allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (providing that a habeas application by a state prisoner will only be entertained \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>A review of Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and his direct appeal to the state appellate court reveals that Simmons never raised the hearsay issue as a federal constitutional claim. Thus, the district court did not violate Clisby\u2019s requirement to address an \u201callegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>See Callahan v. Campbell, </em>396 F.3d 1287, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2005) (remanding petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition to the district court to address the merits of all of the constitutional claims raised in the petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
