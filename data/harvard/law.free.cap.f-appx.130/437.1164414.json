Asylum Application</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). An asylum application must be \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). However, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination of whether extraordinary circumstances excuse an untimely application. <em>Id.; see also Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">Because we lack jurisdiction, the petition for review is dismissed to the extent that it seeks review of the denial of the petitioners\u2019 asylum application or the determination that their application was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, [this Court] reviewfs] the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We review the legal determinations of the BIA <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir. 2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Therefore, we will reverse a finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 28, 2004) (No. 04-7944); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary____\u201d). We also review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). An alien can meet his burden by showing either (1) \u201cpast persecution in his country based on a protected ground,\u201d in which case a rebuttable presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he was returned to his country; or (2) \u201ca future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. In discussing alleged persecution from the FARC, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">To qualify for withholding of removal based on persecution by a guerilla group on account of a political opinion, [a petitioner] must establish that the guerillas persecuted [him] or will seek to persecute [him] in the future <em>because of </em>[his] actual or imputed political opinion. It is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuU\"><em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">In this case, the petitioners set forth the following grounds to establish future persecution: he claims that he held an antiFARC political opinion, that the guerilla groups is aware of that opinion, that his brothers were killed because they held the same political opinion, and that he will likely be persecuted if he returns to his country.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The BIA agreed with the IJ in concluding that the petitioners did not meet their evidentiary burden in proving a threat of future persecution. First, the IJ noted that Castro\u2019s testimony showed that the FARC made demands on him not because of his political opinion, but rather for financial support. In addition, the IJ did not find Castro\u2019s testimony about his reasons for returning to Colombia to be credible. Because Castro provided different reasons for his return at different times, the IJ concluded that the internal inconsistency undermined Castro\u2019s argument that he faced a threat of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">However, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners did not meet their burden of proof. For that reason, we reject the petition for withholding of removal. Other than Castro\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, there is no evidence in the record showing that Castro suffered past persecution, or that it is more likely than not that he will face a future threat of persecution, because of his political opinion. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that Castro\u2019s only contact with the FARC was not on account of his political opinion, but rather was based on the FARC\u2019s attempts at obtaining support and financing from Castro. As we have stated, \u201c[i]t is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Neither does the evidence in the record compel the conclusion that Castro is more likely than not to be persecuted if he returned to Colombia. In fact, the last alleged contact with the FARC occurred in October 1999 when Castro\u2019s nephew received a telephone call at Castro\u2019s business. After this alleged persecution, Castro did not leave Colombia until March 2000, about two months after he had obtained a visa. In addition, Castro then returned to Colombia for eight months in 2000, apparently with no trouble. Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners did not establish a clear probability that they would be persecuted if returned to Colombia is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">PETITION DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">. Castro is the primary petitioner. Restrepo, Castro\u2019s wife, is a derivative applicant and therefore relies on Castro\u2019s application and testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\">. Because the petitioners\u2019 removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996) (\"IIRIRA\u201d), this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), as amended by IIRIRA. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-18\">. The petitioners abandoned their claim for withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), by failing to raise any argument on this claim in their petition for review. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
