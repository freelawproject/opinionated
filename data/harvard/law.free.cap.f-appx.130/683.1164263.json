In light of the summary affirmance, we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">The immigration judge\u2019s finding that neither Nokshiqi\u2019s nor his uncle\u2019s testimony was credible with regard to a perceived danger in Albania to Nokshiqi and, ultimately, that Nokshiqi had failed to .meet his burden of establishing eligibility for asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">As Nokshiqi did not make the showing required to establish eligibility for asylum, he cannot meet the more stringent standard necessary to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). Nokshiqi failed to present his request for relief under the Convention Against Torture to the BIA. Given his failure to exhaust this issue, this court is without jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
