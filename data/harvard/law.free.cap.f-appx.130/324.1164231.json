Davis, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 385 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has vacated our prior judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-19\">When Davis was before this court prior to the <em>certiorari </em>petition being filed, he did not raise any issue based upon <em>Booker, Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), or <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). While Davis had made a challenge to the drug quantity found by the judge at sentencing, he only challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. We have held that a challenge to sufficiency of the evidence is not sufficient to preserve a <em>Booker </em>claim. <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">Following the well-established rule in this circuit, <em>see United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2004), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>391 F.3d 1327 (11th Cir.2004), issues that are not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned. In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001), we applied this rule to a case remanded from the Supreme Court in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>Recently, we applied <em>Ardley </em>to a <em>post-Booker </em>remand and found that the defendant had abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim because he failed to raise it at the district court or in his initial brief. <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-21\">Our opinion affirming the conviction and sentence in this case is accordingly REINSTATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
