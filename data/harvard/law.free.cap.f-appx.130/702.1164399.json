He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Jones\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered in compliance with Fed. R.Crim. P. 11. Jones has not shown that the district court erred in imposing his sentence. The district court imposed Jones\u2019s sentence in compliance with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim. P. 82, did not err in calculating the quantity of drugs attributable to Jones for sentencing purposes, and did not err by enhancing Jones\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because Jones possessed a dangerous weapon during his offense. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 877-79 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 343-44 (5th Cir. 1993). Finally, Jones has not demonstrated plain error with regard to his argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . The district court\u2019s error in enhancing Jones\u2019s sentence under the mandatory sentencing regime in effect at the time after finding facts not admitted by Jones or proven beyond reasonable doubt does not rise to the level of plain error. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one. <em>See United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
