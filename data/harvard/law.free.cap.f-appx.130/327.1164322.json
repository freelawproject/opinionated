Roger appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim for relief, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), of Roger\u2019s civil rights action, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against Jeb Bush, as Governor of the State of Florida (\u201cGovernor\u201d); Christopher Reith, as a hearing officer in the CircuiVCounty Court in Broward County; and Jane/John Doe, as \u201crespondeat superrior for Broward County\u2019s Traffic Division.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roger argues on appeal that this dismissal was erroneous. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of Roger\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Roger filed a <em>pro se </em>amended \u00a7 1983 complaint, asserting that the Governor, Reith, and Jane/John Doe denied him his civil rights, pursuant to the First, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, by maliciously prosecuting him, and by convicting him of a traffic infraction after failing to bring this infraction to trial within 180 days of the issuance of the citation. Roger contended that his claim of malicious prosecution was based on the defendants (1) committing fraud and abuse of process, (2) failing to notify him of a decision, (3) falsifying documents, and (4) failing to calendar a motion. Roger also generally stated that the defendants discriminated against him because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">In support of his complaint, Roger alleged the following facts. On July 18, 2000, a police officer with the City of Parkland, Florida, stopped Roger and issued him a traffic citation for making an improper U-turn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roger entered a plea of not guilty to the traffic infraction, posted a bond in the amount of $75, and returned to his residence in New York. Moreover, Roger filed an affidavit with the traffic court, explaining that he did not observe a no U-turn sign, and that his crying child had distracted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Roger contended that his trial for the infraction, which was scheduled to occur in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the County Court in and for Broward County, repeatedly was postponed, first from October 26, 2000, to January 4, 2001, and, subsequently, to March 7, 2001, and to May 10, 2001. On May 2, 2001, Roger filed in the traffic court a motion to dismiss the citation because he had not been tried within 180 days from its issuance, in violation of Rule 6.326 of the Florida Rules of Traffic Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 10, 2001, without setting Roger\u2019s motion to dismiss on its calendar and in Roger\u2019s absence, the traffic court conducted a trial on the traffic infraction and found Roger guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Roger further contended in his complaint that he never received proof of this conviction. Instead, he received a document from the traffic court, notifying him that he had to attend driving school to avoid being arrested and having the infraction appear on his driving record. Roger responded by sending a letter to various state and county officials, accusing them of \u201cracketeering.\u201d Although the Clerk of the Court informed Roger in a letter that Marc Gold \u2014 the person Roger referred to as Jane/John Doe in his complaint \u2014 would review the matter, Roger never received a response from Gold. Roger also contended that his driving record does not reflect the infraction at issue in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Roger generally argued in his complaint that the defendants violated his civil rights either by exceeding their authority in prosecuting his traffic infraction after the relevant 180-day period, or by failing to intervene or investigate. As relief, Roger sought (1) damages in the amount of $78,000, (2) injunctive relief in the form of an order \u201ccommanding defendants to stop and cease their activity,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) a declaration that the defendants denied him his civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss this amended complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The defendants argued, among other things, that the complaint should be dismissed against Reith because (1) Reith was acting within his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>discretionary authority as a hearing officer when he adjudicated Roger guilty, and (2) Roger had failed to show that Reith violated a clearly established constitutional right. Moreover, the defendants argued that, because the allegations against the remaining plaintiffs appeared to involve only lack of supervision, they also were entitled to immunity. In the alternative, the defendant argued that Roger\u2019s complaint was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, are barred from reviewing constitutional claims if the claims succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants also argued that the Eleventh Amendment was an absolute bar to Roger\u2019s complaint to the extent he was seeking damages against the state or its agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">After Roger failed to respond to this Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court granted it. The court first determined that Reith was entitled to qualified immunity because (1) Reith had been acting within the scope of his discretionary authority as a hearing officer when he adjudicated Roger guilty; and (2) Roger had failed to allege a clearly established constitutional violation. The court also coneluded that, although Roger\u2019s allegations against the Governor and Jane/John Doe were \u201cnot entirely clear,\u201d the allegations appeared to relate to the defendants\u2019 failures to supervise or intervene and, thus, also were barred under the doctrine of qualified immunity. Alternatively, the court determined that it should abstain from hearing Roger\u2019s \u00a7 1983 because, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, Roger was seeking review of a state court\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Roger is arguing on appeal that the court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because the defendants failed to answer either his amended complaint, or to provide through discovery documents that contradicted the facts alleged in his complaint. Roger asserts that the dismissal was not warranted because Reith erred in failing to grant Roger\u2019s motion to dismiss his traffic infraction after it was not tried within 180 days. He also generally asserts that the defendants were either directly or vicariously liable because (1) they exceeded the scope of their duties in prosecuting him, (2) Reith had no absolute immunity, and (3) Reith should have been disqualified \u201cdue to [his] malicious prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Magluta v. Samples, 375 </em>F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004). To the extent Koger is challenging the court\u2019s dismissal prior to the defendants providing discovery, a complaint is subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when the plaintiff \u201ccan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,\u201d or \u201cwhen its allegations-on their face-show that an affirmative defense bars recovery on the claim.\u201d <em>See Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations and quotations omitted). \u201c[Ujnsupported conclusions of law or of mixed fact and law have long been recognized not to prevent a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1036 n. 16 (citation omitted). On the other hand, \u201c[a]ll well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn from those facts are taken as true.\u201d <em>McGinley v. Houston, </em>361 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">i. <em>Heck v. Humphrey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">To the extent Koger was seeking damages and declaratory relief, the Supreme Court held in <em>Heck </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, dedared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acq\"><em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Thus, a plaintiff may not obtain damages under \u00a7 1983 if a judgment in his favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, although the district court did not discuss <em>Heck </em>in its order granting the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, we may affirm a decision of the district court \u201con any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied.\u201d <em>See Fishermen Against Destruction of Environment, Inc. v. Closter Farms, Inc., </em>300 F.3d 1294, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Liberally construing Roger\u2019s amended complaint, the only constitutional claims he raised that were cognizable under \u00a7 1983 were the denial of his right to a speedy trial and malicious prosecution. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the extent he was arguing a speedy-trial claim, the Sixth Amendment guarantees that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. Const. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>amend. VI. We have concluded that, if a defendant\u2019s constitution right to a speedy-trial has been violated, dismissal of an indictment, information, or complaint is mandatory under Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(b)(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1297 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2837, 159 L.Ed.2d 270 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">To the extent Roger asserted a claim of malicious prosecution, a plaintiff seeking to establish such a violation in a \u00a7 1983 action must prove a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures, in addition to the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution. <em>Wood v. Kesler, </em>323 F.3d 872, 881 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 879, 124 S.Ct. 298, 157 L.Ed.2d 143 (2003). We have looked to both state and federal law for the elements of common law tort. <em>Id. </em>To allege this common law claim in Florida, a plaintiff must assert, among other elements, that the termination of the original proceeding constituted a bona fide termination of that proceeding in favor of the present plaintiff. <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Thus, in raising both of these constitutional claims, Roger essentially was challenging either the legality of his conviction or his sentence. A judgment in Roger\u2019s favor in his speedy-trial claim would \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.\u201d <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372; <em>see also Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1297. Similarly, judgment in Roger\u2019s favor in his malicious-prosecution claim was dependent on a finding that the prosecution terminated in his favor. <em>See Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1234. Roger\u2019s claims for damages and declaratory relief based on these constitutional violations, therefore, were barred under <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">To the extent Roger also was seeking injunctive relief in requesting an injunction \u201ccommanding defendants to stop and cease their activity,\u201d the Supreme Court has determined that, despite the limitations of <em>Heck, </em>a plaintiff may still seek prospective injunctive relief, <em>see Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 1589, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). To obtain such relief, however, a plaintiff must show that the relief will not \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. <em>See id., </em>520 U.S. at 648, 117 S.Ct. at 1589. Because Roger\u2019s requested prospective relief would have \u201cnecessarily implied\u201d that the defendants violated his speedy trial rights and/or maliciously prosecuted him and, thus, that his convictions were invalid, the court also did not err in dismissing Roger\u2019s claims to the extent he was seeking injunctive relief. Accordingly, the court did not err in dismissing for failure to state a claim Roger\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">ii. <em>Quali\u00f1ed Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Even if we were to conclude that <em>Heck </em>was inapplicable, the district court properly determined that the defendants were protected under the doctrine of qualified immunity. \u201cQualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Kingsland, 382 F.3d </em>at 1231 (quotation and marks omitted). \u201cQualified immunity represents a balance between the need for a remedy to protect citizens\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>rights and the need for government officials to perform their duties without the fear of constant, baseless litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it is \u201cappropriate for a district court to grant the defense of qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage if the complaint \u2018fails to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">To receive qualified immunity, \u201cthe public official must first prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.\u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1232 (quotation omitted). The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that qualified immunity is not appropriate. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether the plaintiff has met his burden, courts must apply the following two-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">(1) \u201c[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d and (2) if a constitutional right would have been violated under the plaintiffs version of the facts, the court must then determine \u201cwhether the right was clearly established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\"><em>Storck v. City of Coral Springs, </em>354 F.3d 1307, 1314 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). \u201c[I]f no constitutional violation is established, then the officer prevails, and \u2018there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Storck, </em>354 F.3d at 1314 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In the instant case, Koger\u2019s allegations in his amended complaint reflect that the defendants were acting within the scope of their discretionary authority as a hearing officer, county official, and state official; thus, Koger had the burden of alleging a constitutional violation. <em>See Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1232. To the extent Koger was attempting to assert a claim of malicious' prosecution, he had to allege, as discussed above, that the prosecution terminated in his favor. <em>See id. </em>at 1234. Moreover, Koger had to allege that the defendants acted without probable cause. <em>See id. </em>Because Koger neither alleged facts showing that the prosecution terminated in his favor, nor that probable cause was lacking in the prosecution of his traffic infraction, he failed to assert a constitutional claim of malicious prosecution. <em>See Marsh, </em>268 F.3d at 1036; <em>see also Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cconclusory allegations, unwarranted factual deductions or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal [for failure to state a claim]\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1016, 124 S.Ct. 568, 157 L.Ed.2d 430 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Furthermore, to the extent Koger was attempting to assert that he was denied his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment, factors to be considered in a speedy-trial claim include \u201c(1) whether the delay before trial was uncommonly long; (2) whether the government or the defendant is more to blame for that delay; (3) whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial; and (4) whether the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of the delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1290 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). \u201cThe first factor serves a triggering function; unless some \u2018presumptively prejudicial\u2019 period of delay occurred, we need not conduct the remainder of the analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The delay at issue in this first factor \u2014 the time between the date of the indictment and the trial date \u2014 is considered \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d as it approaches one year. <em>Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Regardless, the Supreme Court has recognized that a defendant generally cannot establish a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim, however long the delay, if the government pursued the prosecution with \u201creasonable diligence,\u201d and the defendant fails to show that the delay resulted in \u201cspecific prejudice to his defense.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>376 F.3d at 1290 (quoting <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 656, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 2693, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992)). Moreover, we have determined that a defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice unless each of the first three factors \u201cweights] heavily against the government.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1296. A defendant who must prove actual prejudice to establish a speedy trial claim can do so by showing (1) oppressive pretrial incarceration; (2) anxiety and concern resulting from the delay; or (3) the possibility that his defense will be impaired. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Clark, </em>83 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Here, the delay between the issuance of the traffic citation at issue on July 18, 2000, and Roger\u2019s trial for this offense on May 10, 2001, was approaching one year and, thus, arguably was \u201cpresumptively prejudicial.\u201d <em>See Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1296. Moreover, by filing his motion to dismiss, Roger asserted his right to a speedy trial before he was convicted. Nevertheless, Roger conceded in his affidavit in support of his motion to dismiss that his trial was not commenced prior to May 2, 2001, based on non-appearances by both parties. Most importantly, Roger, who was not incarcerated because of the traffic infraction, did not allege in his amended complaint that he suffered \u201cactual prejudice\u201d from this delay. <em>See Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1296. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that Roger failed to assert a constitutional violation of his right to a speedy trial, and that Reith also was entitled to qualified immunity as to this claim. <em>See Storck, </em>354 F.3d at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Finally, to the extent Roger asserted that the remaining defendants were liable based on their failure to investigate, and to the extent that this claim may be construed as a due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, we determined in <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2002), that, because substantive due process rights are created by the Constitution and \u201cno amount of process can justify [their infringement],\u201d a plaintiff had no substantive due process right to an investigation of a constitutional claim by a sheriff\u2019s office. <em>See id. </em>at 1356. In addition, we concluded in <em>Vinyard </em>that the plaintiff was unable to show a procedural due process violation because, absent a showing by the plaintiff of federal or state law that gave her an entitlement to an internal investigation, there was no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest at stake in the case. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, in this case, Roger failed to identify in his amended complaint a federal or state law under which he was entitled to an internal investigation. Furthermore, although Roger arguably also asserted that the remaining defendants were vicariously liable, \u201csupervisory officials are not liable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of <em>respondeat superior </em>or vicarious liability.\u201d <em>See Smith ex rel. Smith v. Siegelman, </em>322 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that he district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\">. To the extent the defendants are arguing that Roger\u2019s notice of appeal (\"NOA\u201d) was untimely, an NOA generally must be filed within 30 days after the judgment or order being appealed is entered. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(A). However, this 30-day appeal period does not begin to run until a final judgment is entered on a separate document, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 and 79(a). <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(7) (defining entry of a judgment or order as when it is entered in compliance with Rule 58 and Rule 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Because the district court did not enter a final judgment on a separate document in this case, this Court has appellate jurisdiction, whether or not Roger filed his NOA within 30 days of the entry of the court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint. <em>See Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2001) (concluding that this Court had appellate jurisdiction because the district court failed to enter a final judgment on a separate document).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\">. Apparently in support of his claim of malicious prosecution, Roger also asserted in his amended complaint that, although he is an African American male, the officer identified Roger\u2019s race on the traffic infraction as a white male.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\">. Rule 6.325(a) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Except as otherwise provided in this rule, every defendant charged with a noncriminal traffic infraction shall be brought to trial within 180 days of the date the defendant is served with the uniform traffic citation or otherwise charging document. If trial is not commenced within 180 days, the defendant shall be entitled to dismissal of the infraction charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>See </em>Florida Rules of Traffic Court, Rule 6.325.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\">. Roger attached to his amended complaint, among other documents, copies of (1) the traffic citation at issue, charging that he violated a traffic-control device by making an improper U-turn; (2) his written plea of not guilty; (3) notices of his hearing dates on October 26, 2000, and January 4, March 7, and May 10, 2001; (4) a sworn affidavit he attached to his motion to dismiss the traffic citation, in which he attested that his trial had not commenced prior to May 2, 2001, based on non-appearances by both parties; and (5) a court record, reflecting that (i) the court adjudicated Roger after conducting a court trial on May 10, 2001, (ii) ordered him to attend driving school and to pay $75 in fines and court costs, and (iii) applied his bond to these costs. Additional attachments included (1) letters from Roger to the Broward County Sheriff's Office, in which he threatened to file a lawsuit against the state and the Sheriff\u2019s Office; (2) a letter from the Sheriff's Office to Roger, informing him that, on the court's order, the Sheriff's Office had issued to the Clerk of the Court a check for the requested bond amount; and (3) a letter from the Clerk of the Court to Roger, informing him that his earlier correspondence had been forward to Gold, the person in charge of questions or requests made in reference to court adjudications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b354-14\">. Although the complaint did not define \"their activity,\u201d the district court construed this demand for relief as for an injunction, ordering the defendants from trying cases after the 180-day speedy-trial deadline imposed by Rule 6.325.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\">. The defendants also argued in their motion to dismiss that Roger\u2019s claims were barred, pursuant to <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). The Supreme Court in <em>Younger </em>abstained from hearing a plaintiff's claim challenging the constitutionality of a state statute under which he was being prosecuted as a defendant, concluding that a sufficient state forum existed for the plaintiff to raise his constitutional defense. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. at 755. However, this abstention doctrine is not triggered unless the relief sought in the federal court would create an \"undue interference with state proceedings.\u201d <em>See Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2004). Because the instant case involved an underlying criminal proceeding in which Roger\u2019s conviction was final, and because Roger did not assert that he had an appeal pending in the case, the relief Roger sought would not have created any \"undue influence.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">. To the extent Roger appears to be arguing for the first time on appeal that he suffered a violation of his constitutional rights because (1) he was deprived of his right to be fairly represented in court, (2) his trial was continued for no reason and without his knowledge, and (3) he was denied his right to appeal in the state court, we decline to review these arguments in the first instance. <em>See Stavropoulos v. Firestone, </em>361 F.3d 610, 616 n. 6 (11th Cir.2004) (declining to consider a legal theory that was not presented to the district court), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1850, 161 L.Ed.2d 727 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. Section 1983 provides that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and law, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law [or] suit in entity....\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Thus, although Koger cited in support to Rule 6.325(a) of the Florida Rules of Traffic Court and alluded to various state-law claims, he could not allege a \u00a7 1983 claim in the absence of a constitutional violation. <em>See Doe v. Kearney, </em>329 F.3d 1286, 1289-90 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 947, 124 S.Ct. 389, 157 L.Ed.2d 277 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">. Rule 48(b)(3) provides that \"[t]he court may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint if unnecessary delay occurs in ... bringing a defendant to trial.\" <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 48(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\">. The district court also dismissed Roger\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>doctrine. <em>\"Rooker-Feldman </em>bars lower federal court jurisdiction where four criteria are met: (1) the party in federal court is the same as the party in state court; (2) the prior state court ruling was a final or conclusive judgment on the merits; (3) the party seeking relief in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise its federal claims in the state court proceeding; and (4) the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or was inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>See Storck, </em>354 F.3d at 1310 n. 1 (quotation omitted). Under the doctrine of absolute immunity, \u201cQludges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (quotations and marks omitted). Moreover, the Eleventh Amendment bars suits against state officials acting in their official capacities when the state is the real, substantial party in interest. <em>See Shands Teaching Hosp. &amp; Clinics, Inc. v. Beach St. Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2000). However, because the district court properly dismissed this action under <em>Heck </em>and the doctrine of qualified immunity, we need not determine whether these other defenses were applicable. <em>See Fishermen, </em>300 F.3d at 1296-97 (may affirm based on any adequate ground).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
