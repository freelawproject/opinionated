Woods appeals his 64-month sentence for conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1344, resulting from his participation in a mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>gage-fraud scheme. Woods contends that the district court erred in (1) imposing a three-level upward enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(b), based on his role as a supervisor; and (2) determining his guideline sentence based on facts that neither were charged in his indictment nor found beyond a reasonable doubt, in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Woods\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended that his offenses be grouped together, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d), and that his base offense level be set at 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) (guideline for offenses involving fraud).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI also recommended a 14-level increase because the offense involved approximately $494,095 in losses, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H) (guideline for loss amounts greater than $400,000); a 2-level increase because the offense involved fraudulent conduct during a bankruptcy proceeding, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(7)(B); a 2-level increase because the offense involved sophisticated means, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C); a 2-level increase because the offense involved the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i); and a 4-level upward adjustment based on his aggravated role in the offenses, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Woods objected to all of the PSI\u2019s recommended guideline enhancements, but he did not argue that a jury \u2014 instead of the district court \u2014 should decide them. Woods also objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. On the recommended \u00a7 3B 1.1(a) enhancement, Woods specifically argued that (1) the offense did not involve at least five participants, and (2) the PSI did not contain specific allegations that he directed the activities of other participants in the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing on Woods\u2019s objections, the district court overruled them, except for (1) the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(7)(B) increase for bankruptcy fraud; and (2) the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) adjustment for aggravating role, to the extent the court determined that only a three-level enhancement was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining this role adjustment, the court explained that \u201c[w]e have at least five people in the offense and he is certainly a supervisor. But I will sustain the objection in part and award three points, not four points, for his role in the offense.\u201d With a resulting offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of I, Woods\u2019s guideline range was 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court ultimately sentenced him to 64 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">1. <em>Aggravating Role Adjustment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">As discussed above, Woods argues on appeal that the district court erred in imposing a three-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) adjustment for being a supervisor in the offense. He contends that the record showed that only three persons were arguably participants in the fraud, and that the fraud was not \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination of Woods\u2019s role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the scheme and <em>de novo </em>its application of the guidelines to that role. <em>See United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041 (11th Cir.2004). A court is authorized to apply a three-level upward adjustment in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if he was \u201ca manager or supervisor ... and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is a person \u201cwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir. 2003). In determining the nature of the defendant\u2019s role, the court may consider \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">To the extent Woods is contending that only three persons were participants in the fraud or that the scheme was not, otherwise, extensive, Kimberly Patillo, Sharon Jenkins, and Craig Davis pled guilty to the instant offenses. Shawn Wilson, although not convicted of these offenses, verified to a lender that Patillo had an account with Northwestern Mutual while knowing that this information was untruthful. Milton Kevin Barbee similarly falsely verified that two \u201cbuyers\u201d had various amounts on deposit with First Financial. And Melissa Skinner was \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d because, in exchange for $3,000, she agreed to pose as another person and provided false identification documents at a real estate closing. Thus, the scheme involved at least five participants. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SB1.1, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">To the extent Woods also is challenging whether he played a supervisory or managerial role, Davis testified at sentencing that, in exchange for $17,000, Woods recruited him to clean up real-estate properties, illegally turn on utilities, obtain false identification documents, and pose as another person at a real-estate closing. Additional testimony at sentencing showed that Woods also directed Wilson and Barbee to provide false financial information, which information Woods used to obtain more property. Because Woods both recruited and supervised these persons\u2019 activities in the scheme, the court did not clearly err in applying a \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) role adjustment. <em>See Njau, </em>386 F.3d at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">II. <em>Blakely/Booker Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Woods also asserts that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely </em>by determining his guideline sentence based on facts that neither were charged in his indictment nor proven to a jury. Because Woods failed to raise this constitutional claim in the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (applying plain error review to <em>Blakely </em>claim that appellant failed to raise in the district court), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-1148, 73 USLW 3531 (Feb. 23, 2005). Under plain error review, an appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and internal marks omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The Supreme Court determined in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2362-63. After the district court sentenced Woods, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Blakely </em>that the imposition \u2014 based solely on the sentencing judge\u2019s factual findings \u2014 of a sentencing enhancement above the 53-month standard range indicated in the State of Washington\u2019s Sentencing Reform Act violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights because the facts supporting the findings neither were admitted by the defendant, nor found by a jury. <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. The Court in <em>Blakely, </em>however, expressly stated that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), however, recently determined that \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance [existed] between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue [in <em>Blakely </em>].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 749. The Court, therefore, concluded that the mandatory nature of the guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 749-51. The Court also reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we reviewed a similar appeal in which the appellant had failed to preserve a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection in the district court, and the Supreme Court had decided <em>Booker </em>while the appellant\u2019s sentence was pending on direct appeal. Applying plain error review, we determined that the appellant had satisfied the first element of plain error by showing error because, under a mandatory guideline system, the appellant\u2019s sentence had been enhanced based on judicially determined factual findings that went beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">We also determined in <em>Rodriguez </em>that the second element of plain-error review had been met. <em>Id. </em>At 1299. We explained that, although the <em>Booker </em>error had not been \u201cplain\u201d when the court had sentenced the appellant, \u201cwhere the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal \u2014 it is enough that the error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (directing that decision was applicable to all cases on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">But we concluded in <em>Rodriguez </em>that no plain error had occurred because, under the third element of plain error, the appellant had failed to show that the <em>Booker </em>error \u201ca\u00a3fect[ed] substantial rights,\u201d that is, that the error \u201cmust have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299, 1306. (quotation omitted). We discussed that the test for showing that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d was the formulation of a reasonable probability of a different result, which means a probability \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (quotation omitted). We also reiterated that, under this third element, \u201c[i]t is the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>dant rather than the [g]overnment who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we determined that the record in <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cprovide[d] no reason to believe any result [was] more likely than not,\u201d we concluded that the appellant had not met his burden on the third element of plain-error review. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. And we concluded that we \u201cha[d] no occasion to decide how he would have fared under the fourth [element].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In the instant case, Woods, in pleading guilty, did not admit to facts on which the court relied in enhancing his guideline sentence under a mandatory guidelines system. We conclude that <em>Booker </em>error occurred and that it is now \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298-99.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, similar to the facts in <em>Rodriguez, </em>Woods has not explained on appeal, much less proven under the third element of plain-error review, how his substantial rights were affected by the court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Indeed, district courts still must consider guideline ranges. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764 (\u2018Without the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the [Sentencing Reform Act] nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d). Because the court heard extensive testimony on Woods\u2019s offense conduct, the court, at least implicitly, considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and Woods\u2019s character. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In imposing a sentence of 64 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence in the middle of Woods\u2019s guideline range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment, the court, at least implicitly, demonstrated that it considered the need for the sentence imposed, and that it would not have imposed a lesser sentence, but for the then mandatory nature of the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)-(4). And the court ordered a restitution amount that reflected the loss sustained by the victims of the fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Even in the absence of these determinations, the likelihood of a different result would be speculative without a clear state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ment or sign from the court that, but for the fact that its discretion was constrained under the federal guidelines, it would have imposed a lighter sentence. <em>See Rodriguez, 3</em>98 F.3d at 1300-01. Woods has not cited to such evidence. At best, it is unclear whether the court would have imposed a different sentence. Woods, therefore, has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that his sentencing would have been different but for the <em>Booker </em>error, and we need not determine the fourth element of plain-error review. <em>See id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In sum, the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>and this error was \u201cplain.\u201d We, however, conclude that we may not exercise our discretion to notice this forfeited error because Woods has failed to carry his burden of showing that this <em>pre-Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights. We, therefore, affirm Woods\u2019s 64-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">. To avoid <em>ex post facto </em>issues, the PSI used the 2001 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines in calculating Woods's guideline sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-13\">. The court also agreed to grant Woods a two-level \u00a7 3El.l(a) adjustment for acceptance of responsibility after Woods agreed to withdraw a previously filed motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. We explained in further detail in <em>Rodriguez </em>that <em>\"pre-Booker </em>defendants must establish a reasonable probability that if the district court had considered the guidelines range it arrived at using extra-verdict enhancements as merely advisory, instead of mandatory, and had taken into account any otherwise unconsidered [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)] factors, the court would have imposed a lesser sentence than it did.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. In determining that <em>Booker </em>error occurred in <em>Rodriguez, </em>we noted, without deciding, that an enhancement for obstruction of justice may not have been a <em>Booker </em>error \"because the jury verdict convicting the appellant of the crimes he denied necessarily, albeit implicitly, found that he had engaged in behavior that fit[] within \u00a7 3C1.1.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 n. 5. In the instant case, however, Woods contested during his plea colloquy and at sentencing the facts underlying his sentence enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. These other relevant factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: \"(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed-(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for ... (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines ...; (5) any pertinent policy statement []; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
