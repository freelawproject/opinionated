Previously, this court remanded Thomas\u2019 appeal for a determination whether his untimely filing of a notice of appeal was due to excusable neglect or good cause. On remand, the district court determined that Thomas had not shown that the untimely filing was due to excusable neglect or good cause. In compliance with our remand order, the district court has returned the case to this court. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">The record indicates that shortly after the district court returned this case to our court, Thomas was convicted by a jury for possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute. We have held that a defendant\u2019s claim to release pending trial is mooted by the defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, we need not remand this case to the district court given that the order appealed from relating to pretrial detention and bail has been superceded by Thomas\u2019 conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">Thomas\u2019 appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
