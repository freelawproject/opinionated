Meadows appeals the Fed. R. Crv. P. 12(b)(1) dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, asserting that his due process and equal protection rights were violated when he was denied certain tax reductions to the assessed value of his home which had been granted to his similarly situated neighbor. Because Texas provided Meadows with a \u201cplain, speedy, and efficient\u201d remedy for his tax complaint, the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, bars federal jurisdiction, and the complaint was properly dismissed. <em>See McQueen v. Bullock, </em>907 F.2d 1544, 1547 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The fact that Meadows did not fully pursue the avenues available to him under state law does not invalidate the jurisdictional bar created by \u00a7 1341. <em>See Washington v. Linebarger, Goggan, Blair, Pena &amp; Sampson, LLP, </em>338 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Stephens v. Portal Boat Co., </em>781 F.2d 481, 483 (5th Cir.1986). Meadows\u2019 reliance on <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Comm\u2019n of Webster County, </em>488 U.S. 336, 109 S.Ct. 633, 102 L.Ed.2d 688 (1989) is misplaced. The Tax Injunction Act was not implicated in that case due to the fact that the plaintiffs had first pursued relief under state law and received Supreme Court review upon certiorari from the state supreme court decision. <em>See id. </em>at 339-42,109 S.Ct. 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">To the extent that Meadows argues that he has no remedy under state law because he does not challenge the accuracy of the taxes he paid but essentially seeks to increase his neighbor\u2019s taxes, his claim is undermined by the plain language of his complaint, wherein he requests a refund in the amount of taxes he alleges he overpaid in 2002 and 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
