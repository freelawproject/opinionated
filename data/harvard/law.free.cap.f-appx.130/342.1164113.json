We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and accept the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true. <em>Samco Global Arms, Inc., v. Arita, </em>395 F.3d 1212, 1214 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005). Abele asserted two possible bases of federal jurisdiction: federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1331, and diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1332. Because Abele did not allege in his complaint that he and the defendants were citizens of different states, the district court correctly found that diversity jurisdiction was lacking under'28 U.S.C. section 1332. We affirm that aspect of the holding of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">We disagree with the holding of the district court that Abele failed to show that federal question jurisdiction existed. There is a difference between the lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1351-52 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe test of federal jurisdiction is not whether the cause of action is one on which the claimant can recover. Rather, the test is whether the cause of action alleged is so patently without merit as to justify ... the court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>gram Equip. Co., Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir.1990) (en banc) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Jurisdiction is not lost because a complaint fails to state a cause of action on which the plaintiff could actually recover. <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). If the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief, the dismissal of the case should be on the merits, not for want of jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Whether a claim arises under federal law for purposes of federal question jurisdiction is governed by the \u201cwell-pleaded complaint\u201d rule, which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the complaint. <em>Dunlap v. G &amp; L Holding Group, Inc., 381 F.3d </em>1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2004). Furthermore, because Abele is <em>pro se, </em>we must construe his complaint more liberally than if it had been drafted by a lawyer. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990). In the light of that relaxed standard, we conclude that Abele\u2019s complaint raised several federal questions: (1) whether the defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq.; </em>(2) whether the defendants violated Abele\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law; and (3) whether the defendants violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The district court erred in dismissing Abele\u2019s complaint for lack of a federal question. The district court did not find that these federal laws were invoked in Abele\u2019s complaint solely to obtain jurisdiction, nor did the district court find that Abele\u2019s claims were insubstantial and frivolous. <em>Cf. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d at 1352. If the \u201cchallenge to the court\u2019s jurisdiction [wa]s also a challenge to the existence of a federal cause of action, the proper course of action for the district court ... [wa]s to find that jurisdiction exist[ed] and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits of the plaintiffs case.\u201d <em>McGinnis, </em>918 F.2d at 1494.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The district court correctly held that diversity jurisdiction was lacking. The district court, however, erred in dismissing this case for lack of federal question jurisdiction. We vacate that ruling and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
