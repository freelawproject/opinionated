Elliott argues on appeal that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in applying the federal guidelines in sentencing him, in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm Elliott\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">A federal grand jury returned a four-count superseding indictment against Elliott, charging him with committing the above-referenced offenses by transporting a person under the age of 18 in interstate commerce from Florida to Louisiana and Texas, with the intent of engaging in sexual activity, on or about June 6, 2003, and June 28, 2003, respectively (\u201cCounts 1 and 2\u201d). This superseding indictment also charged Elliott with using a person under the age of 18 to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) and (d) (\u201cCount 3\u201d); and with possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4) and (b)(2) (\u201cCount 4\u201d). This indictment, however, did not allege the exact age of the juvenile, or that the offenses in Counts 1 and 2 involved causing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">In lieu of trial, Elliott orally agreed to plead guilty to Counts 1 and 2 of his superseding indictment, in exchange for the government agreeing to dismiss Counts 3 and 4 at the time of sentencing. During Elliott\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the government proffered that, had the case proceeded to trial, it would have proven, among other facts, that, on June 6 and June 28, 2003, Elliott took a juvenile, who was 15 years\u2019 old, from Florida to Louisiana and Texas, to engage in sex. Other than objecting to statements that the sexual conduct occurred before the trips at issue \u2014 conduct that was the basis for pending state charges \u2014 Elliott agreed with the government\u2019s factual proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">Prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentenee investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), setting out a detailed statement of facts on Elliott\u2019s acts of transporting the juvenile across interstate lines and engaging in sexual activities with her in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. These facts included, among other things, that (1) the victim told law enforcement officers in Florida that Elliott took photographs of her in the nude; (2) officers found photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>graphs of the victim in the nude with her genitals exposed and with leather straps laying across her body in Elliott\u2019s personal computer; and (3) law enforcement officers in Texas also discovered computer discs containing pornography and the above-described photographs of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The probation officer recommended in the PSI that Elliott\u2019s offenses be grouped together, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b), and that his combined base offense level be set at 19, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Gl.l(a)(l) (guideline for \u00a7 2423(a) offenses involving a person under the age of 18), because the victim was 14 years\u2019 old. The PSI also recommended a two-level upward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Gl.l(b)(2), because the offense involved a victim who had attained the age of 12 years, but had not yet attained the age of 16 years, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 21. Despite these calculations, however, the PSI determined that the provisions in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1 were applicable because, under the cross reference in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Gl.l(e)(l), the offenses of conviction involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(a) &amp; (b)(1), Elliott had a base offense level of 27, which was adjusted upwards two levels because the victim was under the age of 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">After the PSI applied a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), Elliott\u2019s adjusted offense level was 27. Moreover, with a criminal history category of I, Elliott\u2019s resulting guideline range was 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. Elliott\u2019s only objection to his PSI that affected the calculation of his guideline range involved the recommendation that he only receive a two-level, instead of a three-level \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">On June 9, 2004, at sentencing, Elliott again only objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a three-level \u00a7 3E1.1 downward adjustment. The district court sustained this objection, thereby adjusting downward Elliot\u2019s total offense level to 26 and his resulting guideline range to 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After stating that he had no objections to the court\u2019s calculation of his guideline range, Elliot\u2019s counsel argued for a lenient sentence under the guidelines, based on the facts that (1) Elliott previously had lead a \u201claw-abiding life,\u201d (2) his conduct in the instant offense was \u201cout of character,\u201d and (3) he was remorseful. He also requested that the court waive any fines if it imposed restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The court, without objection, ultimately sentenced Elliott to concurrent sentences of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, 5 years\u2019 supervised release, a $1,500 fine, and 1,302.59 in restitution. In imposing this maximum guideline sentence, the court cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ed to the serious nature of the offenses and to aggravating factors, including the fact that Elliott\u2019s last trip to Texas was made in direct violation of a court order. The court also explained that it had considered all of the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that it had found that the sentence satisfied these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In an appeal brief Elliott filed before the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>he argues that the district court plainly-erred in sentencing him pursuant to the federal guidelines because they are unconstitutional. Elliott acknowledges a prior decision by this Court that unpreserved <em>Blakely </em>error could not be plain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Elliott generally contends that (1) this prior decision was incorrectly decided, (2) he should not be deemed to have \u201cforfeited\u201d his constitutional rights; and (3) plain error occurred because he would have received a lesser sentence if the court had not been \u201cbound by the guidelines.\u201d Without explanation, Elliott also asserts that the court\u2019s use of the guidelines prejudiced him because the victim was a willing participant in the offenses of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Because Elliott faded to raise his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim in the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.) (applying plain-error review to a newly-raised <em>Blakely </em>claim), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-1148 (Feb. 23, 2005); <em>see also United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a defendant either must (1) refer to the Sixth Amendment, <em>Apprendi, </em>or other related cases; (2) assert his right to have the jury decide the disputed fact; or (3) raise a challenge to the role of the judge as factfinder to preserve a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim) (mandate withheld).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under plain error review, an appellate court may not correct an error that the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u201c \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The Supreme Court determined in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. After the district court sentenced Elliott, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Blakely </em>that the imposition \u2014 based solely on the sentencing judge\u2019s factual findings \u2014 of a sentencing enhancement above the 53-month standard range indicated in the State of Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ington\u2019s Sentencing Reform Act violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights because the facts supporting the findings neither were admitted by the defendant, nor found by a jury. <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. The <em>Blakely </em>Court, however, expressly stated that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>124 S.Ct. at 2538 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>recently determined that \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance [existed] between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue [in <em>Blake</em>ly].\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. The Court, thus, concluded that the mandatory nature of the guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id., </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-51. The Court also reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we reviewed a similar appeal in which the appellant had failed to preserve a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection, and the Supreme Court had decided <em>Booker </em>while the appellant\u2019s appeal was pending. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1297-98. Applying plain-error review, we determined that the appellant had satisfied the first element of plain error by showing error because, under a mandatory guideline system, the appellant\u2019s sentence had been enhanced based on judicially determined factual findings that went beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 1300. We also concluded that the second element of plain-error review had been met because, although the <em>Blakely/Booker </em>error had not been \u201cplain\u201d when the court had sentenced the appellant, \u201cwhere the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal \u2014 it is enough that the error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)); <em>see also Booker, </em>5125 S.Ct. at 769 (directing that the decision was applicable to all cases on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">We, however, concluded that no plain error had occurred in <em>Rodriguez </em>because, under the third element of plain error, the appellant had failed to show that the <em>Booker </em>error had \u201caffect[ed] substantial rights,\u201d that is, that the error \u201cmust have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299-1301 (quotation omitted). We discussed that the test for showing that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d was the formulation of a reasonable probability of a different result, which means a probability \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (quotation omitted). We also reiterated that, under this third element, \u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the [government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because we determined that the record in <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cprovide[d] no reason to believe any result [was] more likely than not,\u201d we concluded that the appellant had not met his burden on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>third element of plain-error review. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Moreover, we concluded that we \u201cha[d] no occasion to decide how [the appellant] would have fared under the fourth [element].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In the instant appeal, to the extent the court adjusted Elliott\u2019s guideline sentence upwards two levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2Gl.l(b)(2), because the offense involved a victim who had attained the age of 12, but had not yet attained the age of 16, Elliott admitted during his change-of-plea hearing that the victim was 15 years\u2019 old. Thus, Elliott did not show that this adjustment constituted a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that district court did not commit a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker </em>by relying on facts admitted by the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On the other hand, by adjusting Elliott\u2019s guideline range under the provisions in \u00a7 2G2.1, the court relied on facts not admitted by Elliott, that is, that (1) one of the computer discs that law enforcement officers seized in Texas contained nude photographs of the victim engaging in sexually-explicit conduct; (2) these photographs were taken both in New Orleans, Louisiana, and at Elliott\u2019s residence in Pensacola, Florida; and (3) two cameras and discs containing photographs were recovered from the Texas motel room in which Elliott was found with the juvenile and arrested. Moreover, the court \u201cwas operating under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>Booker </em>error, therefore, occurred, and it is now \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">However, similar to the facts in <em>Rodriguez, </em>Elliott has not explained, much less proven under the third element of plain-error review, how his substantial rights were affected by this <em>Booker </em>error. Indeed, district courts still must consider defendants\u2019 applicable guideline ranges. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764 (\u201cWithout the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the [Sentencing Reform Act] nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The PSI contained an extensive summary of the facts underlying the offenses of conviction, and the court explicitly stated that it had considered the nature and circumstances of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Indeed, in imposing a sentence at the high end of Elliott\u2019s guideline range, the court cited to the serious nature of the offenses and to aggravating factors, including that Elliott\u2019s last trip to Texas was made in direct violation of a court order. The court\u2019s imposition of this sentence also demonstrated that it considered the need for the sentence imposed, and that it would not have imposed a sentence below Elliott\u2019s guideline range, but for the then mandatory nature of the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)-(4); <em>see also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>States v. Curtis, </em>400 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that the imposition of the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by the relevant guideline range was \u201cinconsistent with any suggestion that the sentencing judge would have imposed a lesser sentence if the judge had realized the [federal guidelines] were advisory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Nevertheless, even in the absence of these determinations, the likelihood of a different result would be speculative without a clear statement or sign from the court that, but for the fact that its discretion was constrained under the federal guidelines, it would have imposed a lighter sentence. <em>See Dowling, </em>403 F.3d at 367, No. 04-10464, manuscript op. at 5 (concluding that no plain error occurred because the defendant could not point to anything in the record indicating a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similar to the defendant in <em>Dowling, </em>Elliott has not cited to such evidence. At best, it is unclear whether the court would have imposed a different sentence. Elliott, therefore, has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result of his sentencing would have been different but for the <em>Booker </em>error, and we need not determine the fourth element of plain-error review. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In sum, the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>and this error was \u201cplain.\u201d We, however, may not exercise our discretion to notice this forfeited error because Elliott has failed to carry his burden of showing that this <em>pre-Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in applying the federal guidelines in sentencing Elliott. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">. In support of this cross reference, the probation officer cited to the fact that one of the discs that law enforcement officers seized in Texas contained nude photographs of the victim engaging in sexually explicit conduct. The officer also explained that (1) these photographs were taken both in New Orleans, Louisiana, and at Elliott\u2019s residence in Pensacola, Florida; and (2) two cameras and discs containing photographs were recovered from the Texas motel room in which Elliott was found with the juvenile and arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-12\">. Although the court initially stated that Elliott\u2019s guideline range was 63 to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, it later showed that it understood that the actual range was 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment by stating that it was sentencing Elliott to his maximum guideline sentence of 78 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. We concluded in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>381 F.3d 1070, 1075-77 (11th Cir.2004), <em>opinion vacated and superseded on rehearing by United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2005) (mandate withheld), that, because neither the Supreme Court nor this Court had resolved the issue whether <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal guidelines, the defendant could not show that any error in sentencing the defendant under the federal guidelines was plain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b392-10\">. Justice Breyer also explicitly noted in <em>Booker </em>that, despite that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding was applicable to all cases on direct review, the Court did not \"believe that every appeal [would] lead to a new sentencing hearing,\u201d and that it \"expect[ed] reviewing courts to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the 'plain error' test.\" <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. We explained in further detail in <em>Rodriguez </em>that <em>\"pre-Booker </em>defendants must establish a reasonable probability that if the district court had considered the guidelines range it arrived at using extra-verdict enhancements as merely advisory, instead of mandatory, and had taken into account any otherwise unconsidered [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)] factors, the court would have imposed a lesser sentence than it did.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. These other relevant \"sentencing goals\u201d include: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed-(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective maimer; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for ...
