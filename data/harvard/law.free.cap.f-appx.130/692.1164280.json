PRADO, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">This appeal involves a claim for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In their petition for review, petitioners Operators and Consulting Services, Inc. and Zurich American Insurance Company (together, \u201cOCS\u201d) ask this court to set aside an order by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) holding them responsible for the claimant\u2019s disability compensation and medical costs. For the reasons discussed below, this court denies OCS\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">Before the injury which is at the heart of this appeal occurred, OCS provided workers for the operation of an offshore platform pursuant to a contract with Burlington Resources. OCS hired claimant-respondent James Morrison as a field mechanic to repair mechanical equipment on the platform. As a mechanic, Morrison was required to carry equipment weighing up to 75 pounds. On October 16, 1997, Morrison injured his back while climbing up a ladder. A week after the accident, Morrison sought treatment for his injury from Dr. Karri Gramlich, a chiropractor. Dr. Gramlich treated Morrison until February 1998, at which point she reported that Morrison was ready to resume work on a normal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">In May 1998, Burlington Resources terminated its contract with OCS and contracted with respondent Danos <em>&amp; </em>Cur\u00f3le Marine Contractors (\u201cDanos &amp; Cur\u00f3le\u201d) to provide workers for the platform. Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le hired Morrison on May 8, 1998 after he successfully completed a preemployment agility test. On May 22, Morrison returned to Dr. Gramlich for treatment, complaining of pain in his left leg. Dr. Gramlich treated Morrison until September 1998. Because his condition showed little improvement, Dr. Gramlich referred Morrison to Dr. Andrew Wilson, a neurosurgeon. Dr. Wilson began treating Morrison on September 15, 1998, but Morrison\u2019s condition worsened to the point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>that he was unable to continue working. Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le terminated Morrison on October 22, 1998. Dr. Wilson operated on Morrison\u2019s back on July 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Morrison filed claims for disability compensation and medical expenses under the Act against both OCS and Danos &amp; Cu-role. Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le denied responsibility for Morrison\u2019s disability, maintaining that the disability resulted from the natural progression of the October 16, 1997 injury Morrison suffered while working for OCS. After considering the evidence, the ALJ agreed with Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le. The ALJ found that Morrison\u2019s disability was attributable to the injury he sustained while working for OCS and that Morrison\u2019s back condition was not aggravated by his employment with Danos <em>&amp; </em>Cur\u00f3le. The ALJ, therefore, concluded that OCS was responsible for all of Morrison\u2019s disability compensation and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">OCS appealed to the Department of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d). The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ruling. OCS now asks this court to set aside the ALJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">This court reviews a decision of the Board using the same standard the Board applies to review a decision of the ALJ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is, this court determines whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cSubstantial evidence is that relevant evidence \u2014 more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance \u2014 that would cause a reasonable person to accept the fact finding.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ, nor reweigh or reappraise the evidence; instead, it may only determine whether evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court will uphold the Board\u2019s decision if the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0y\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">OCS challenges the ALJ\u2019s determination that it is solely responsible for Morrison\u2019s disability. OCS maintains that Morrison\u2019s injury was aggravated while he worked for Danos <em>&amp; </em>Cur\u00f3le, and that as a result, Danos <em>&amp; </em>Cur\u00f3le is liable for the costs of Morrison\u2019s disability. Specifically, OCS contends that the ALJ misapplied the \u201caggravation rule.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">The \u201caggravation rule\u201d is a judicially created rule for allocating liability among employers for a worker\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rule provides that if a claimant\u2019s disability arose from the natural progression of an injury sustained while working for the first employer, that employer is completely liable for the subsequent expenses the claimant incurs from the injury, even after the claimant no longer works for the first employer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, in cases where the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ability results from cumulative traumas, the responsible employer depends upon the cause of the worker\u2019s ultimate disability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the disability is \u201cat least partially the result of a second trauma that occurs while working for a second employer and that injury aggravates, accelerates or combines with the prior injury to create the ultimate disability,\u201d the second employer is hable for all medical expenses and compensation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the dispositive issue in this appeal is whether Morrison\u2019s disability arose from the natural progression of the injury suffered on October 16, 1997 while he worked for OCS, or whether his disability was caused by an aggravation, exacerbation, or acceleration of that injury while he worked for Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the AL J\u2019s finding that Morrison\u2019s disability resulted solely from the injury he suffered during his employment with OCS. Dr. Wilson testified in his deposition that he began treating Morrison in September 1998. Dr. Wilson opined that Morrison\u2019s injury naturally progressed to the point that surgery was the only way to mitigate further damage. Dr. Wilson admitted, however, that there was a possibility that Morrison\u2019s employment with Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le exacerbated Morrison\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Dr. Gramlich also attributed Morrison\u2019s surgery to the injury that occurred in October 1997. She acknowledged that working for Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le may have aggravated Morrison\u2019s back condition, but opined that the herniated disk that required surgery resulted from Morrison\u2019s original injury during his employment with OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"A5q\">In addition, Morrison testified that he continued to experience lower back pain while working for OCS. Morris explained that nothing about his job changed when he began working for Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le. He stated that he continued to perform the same job on the same platforms, but explained that he worked smarter to avoid hurting his back. He described his job with Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le as neither more nor less strenuous than his work with OCS. Together, testimony from these witnesses constitutes substantial evidence that Morrison\u2019s disability resulted from the natural progression of the injury he suffered in October 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">OCS argues that passing the preemployment agility test shows that Morrison\u2019s back was no longer impaired when he began working for Danos <em>&amp; </em>Cur\u00f3le. However, Martin Knijn, the physical therapist who conducted the agility test, testified that the test was designed to test capabilities, not the amount of stress the back could sustain. Knijn explained that the successful completion of the test demonstrates that an employee is capable of performing most of his job duties for a limited amount of time. Thus, passing a preemployment agility test does not necessarily indicate that Morrison\u2019s initial back injury was resolved by the time he began working for Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">OCS also argues that Morrison\u2019s strenuous work activities with Danos &amp; Cur\u00f3le over a five month period demonstrate that the disability arose from an aggravation or acceleration of a preexisting injury. Morrison, however, testified that his job with Danos <em>&amp; </em>Cur\u00f3le was neither more nor less strenuous than his work with OCS, and he did not testify that he suffered a subsequent injury. Although Morrison explained that Dr. Gramlich released him to return to work for OCS, substantial evidence indicates that he was not symptom-free at that time and that his pain progres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>sively increased throughout the time he worked for OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Morrison\u2019s disability resulted from the natural progression of his October 1997 injury; thus, under the \u201caggravation rule,\u201d OCS, as the first employer, is solely responsible for Morrison\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The ALJ did not err by determining that OCS is responsible for Morrison\u2019s disability compensation and medical costs because substantial evidence indicates that Morrison\u2019s disability was caused by his injury while working for OCS. As a result, the Board properly affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Consequently, this court DENIES the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-20\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">. <em>SGS Control Servs. v.
