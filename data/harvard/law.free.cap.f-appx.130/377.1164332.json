Webb, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his civil suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Webb does not present any arguments on appeal. He submitted the docket sheet from the district court and copies of various pleadings, including his amended complaint, the original complaint, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order dismissing the case, and the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-27\">Issues that are not briefed on appeal are considered abandoned. <em>Denney v. City of Albany, </em>247 F.3d 1172, 1182 (11th Cir. 2001). Thus as Webb fails to assert any error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u00a7 1983 action, we could deem such arguments abandoned. <em>Pro se </em>pleadings, however, are governed by less stringent standards than counseled pleadings. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 596, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Therefore, even though Webb fails to raise any arguments on appeal, we liberally construe his appeal to encompass a challenge to the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. </em>We accept all allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Shands Teaching Hosp. and Clinics, Inc. v. Beech St. Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2000). A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted \u201conly if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201cnegligent conduct does not give rise to \u00a7 1983 liability for resulting unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Cannon v. Macon County, </em>1 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Upon careful review of the record, we find no reversible error. Webb\u2019s amended complaint alleged that his probation violation conviction resulted from the negligent and irresponsible conduct of the probation office. Allegations of negligent conduct are insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Webb\u2019s amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and the district court properly dismissed Webb\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
