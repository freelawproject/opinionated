Day, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus as time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Day argues that his petition was timely filed because the statute of limitations was tolled by his \u201cvarious applications, petitions, and post-trial motions which were properly filed and pending,\u201d including his May 29, 1998, \u201cMotion to Vacate for Lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>of Court\u2019s Jurisdiction.\u201d He asserts that his motions for return of property tolled the limitations period and were relevant to the pertinent judgment. He submits that the limitations period should be equitably tolled due to the substance of his motions. Finally, Day claims that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d would occur if his petition was not granted, due to the \u201cmultitude of constitutional violations, and his claim of actual and factual innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo. Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). We review findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations is a question of law that is subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The applicable statute of limitations for a state prisoner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) petition is codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">(2) The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">\u201cFor prisoners whose convictions became final before the effective date of the AED-PA, ... the statute of limitations begins running on April 24, 1996, giving these prisoners one year from this date to file a habeas petition.\u201d <em>Nyland, </em>216 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">\u201c[A]n application is <em>\u2018properly </em>filed\u2019 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000) (emphasis in original). \u201cGeorgia law makes clear that a sentencing court has jurisdiction to examine a motion to vacate outside the sentencing term if it alleges that a sentence is void.\u201d <em>Estes v. Chapman, </em>382 F.3d 1237, 1239-40 (11th Cir.2004). We have held that a Georgia prisoner\u2019s \u201cMotion to Vacate Illegally Imposed Sentence\u201d was properly filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) and acted to toll the statute of limitations period for filing a federal habeas petition. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. In Georgia, an appeal is no longer pending \u201cwhere the appellate court has issued the remittitur and it has been received and filed in clerk\u2019s office of the court below.\u201d <em>Chambers v. State, </em>262 Ga. 200, 415 S.E.2d 643, 644-45 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Our Court\u2019s precedent establishes that equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy that is to be applied sparingly in extraordinary cases. <em>Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1265 (11th Cir.2004) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and quotations omitted). Equitable tolling is appropriate when movant shows extraordinary circumstances \u201cbeyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence\u201d prevented him from timely filing. <em>Id. </em>For purposes of calculating the statutory period in this case, the time period begins on the day after the event that starts the period and ends on the day that stops the period. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The district court did not err by dismissing Day\u2019s petition as untimely. Day\u2019s conviction became final in 1992. Day\u2019s AED-PA statute of limitations began running on April 24, 1996. On that date, his state habeas case was pending in the Georgia courts, tolling the limitations period until the trial court received the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s remittitur on November 9, 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 9, 1997, the limitations period began to run. Day\u2019s 1997 and 1998 motions for return of property did not toll the limitations period because the motions were not \u201capplication[s] for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment [of Day\u2019s conviction]\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Day did not file another application for collateral review until his May 29, 1998, \u201cMotion to Vacate for Lack of Court\u2019s Jurisdiction.\u201d Two hundred and one days elapsed between November 9, 1997, and May 29, 1998. Day\u2019s motion was pending in the Georgia courts until April 9, 2002, at which time the limitations period began to run. Day had no applications pending until he filed a state habeas petition on October 4, 2002. One hundred seventy-eight days had elapsed between April 9, 2002, and October 4, 2002. A total of 379 days of untolled time elapsed between April 24, 1996, when the statutory period began to run, and October 21, 2002, when Day filed his federal petition. Therefore, Day\u2019s federal petition was untimely, and the district court did not err in dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Further, Day is not entitled to equitable tolling. He has neither presented extraordinary circumstances nor established that the testimony which forms the basis of his claim for equitable tolling was both beyond his control and unavailable even with due diligence. Therefore, the district court did not err by failing to apply equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-15\">. Because Day filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), the provisions of that act apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">. Under the AEDPA, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability (COA). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). When a district court grants a COA on some, but not all, issues raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant may seek a broader COA by \"explicitly requesting\u201d that we consider an uncertified issue. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1251, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2000). Because Day did not \"explicitly request\u201d that we expand the COA to include his claim regarding a \"miscarriage of justice,\u201d we do not address it as it is outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. Although Chatman asserts that this action was not a habeas case, the published opinion in the case represented it as a habeas case and no evidence in the record suggests otherwise. <em>See Day v. Stokes, </em>268 Ga. 494, 491 S.E.2d 365, 366 (1997). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by determining the case to be a habeas case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
