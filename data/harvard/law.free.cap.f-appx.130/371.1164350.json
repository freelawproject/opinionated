After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ali\">A. Cayasso\u2019s Arrest and Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Cayasso arrived in Miami as a crew member on a Honduran ship. One of Cayasso\u2019s co-workers, Kenry Estrada, disembarked from the ship and was arrested with 1,079 grams of cocaine in his sandals. Estrada immediately led police to Cayasso, who was waiting at a pre-arranged meeting point in downtown Miami. Estrada identified Cayasso as the person who had given him the sandals containing the cocaine. Estrada also said that Cayasso promised to pay Estrada $1,500 if Estrada would carry the cocaine onto shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">After Cayasso was apprehended and advised of his constitutional rights, he made various statements to law enforcement officers. According to the officers\u2019 testimony at trial, Cayasso stated that the cocaine-filled sandals had been brought onto the ship in Honduras by a man named John Brown. Brown, who was apparently also a member of the ship\u2019s crew, had paid Cayasso to take the cocaine off the ship in Miami. However, Cayasso was going on vacation in Miami and therefore would be subjected to a full-fledged customs search, as opposed to the much less intrusive search of a ship\u2019s crewmember who is not intending to stay in the United States. Cayasso therefore recruited Estrada to carry the cocaine because Estrada would be subjected only to the lighter \u201cship\u2019s security\u201d and not to U.S. Customs. Estrada was given the cocaine-filled sandals by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>John Brown in Cayasso\u2019s onboard cabin the night before the arrests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">B. Cayasso\u2019s Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The trial evidence consisted primarily of Estrada\u2019s testimony and the testimony of three officers who recounted the details of Cayasso\u2019s post-arrest confession. The jury was told that no trace of cocaine was found on Cayasso\u2019s person or in a search of his quarters on the ship. Additionally, Cayasso\u2019s fingerprints were not found on the shoes, the cocaine, or any other object seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">However, Cayasso contends that certain statements by the prosecution warrant a new trial. Thus, we detail at some length the allegedly improper statements, and the context in which they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">1. Reference in Opening Statement to Post-Arrest Silence</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">During its opening statement at trial, the government told the jury that it would hear from Kenry Estrada. The government then mentioned that, after Estrada and Cayasso were arrested, they were taken to the Port of Miami and questioned by Customs agents and police. The prosecutor then made the following statement, in which he mentioned Cayasso\u2019s failure to respond when Estrada was brought into Cayasso\u2019s interrogation room:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">The defendant [Cayasso] was also taken back to the Port of Miami and thereafter he was given a right not to talk and agreed to talk. You will hear that both Kenry Estrada and he confessed, not right away, but that he confessed. He said initially he didn\u2019t know anything about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">The agents continued to question him. They had found 3600 dollars and they were suspicious about it so they asked him about the money. He explained the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">They also confronted him with Kenry Estrada. At one point they brought Kenry Estrada into the room and in a loud voice one of the agents ... asked, is that the guy that gave you the sandals and Estrada agrees, <em>and there\u2019s no response by the </em>defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Defense counsel immediately objected, stating that the prosecutor was commenting on Cayasso\u2019s right to remain silent. The district court sustained the objection and instructed the jury not to consider the defendant\u2019s silence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">Members of the jury, I have already advised you, and I will do so again, that the defendant does not have to testify and that cannot be considered by you in any way in considering whether the government has proved their case. You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">The prosecutor then went on to describe Cayasso\u2019s confession in detail and concluded his opening statement without further reference to Cayasso\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">2. Government\u2019s Remark that Defense Counsel was \u201cPlaying\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-19\">In its closing argument rebuttal, the government stated that defense counsel was \u201cplaying on the ignorance of lay people.\u201d Specifically, the prosecutor made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-20\">[Cayasso\u2019s counsel] would like this case to be about Kenry Estrada. That\u2019s why he spent the bulk of his time talking about Kenry Estrada. You will get that plea agreement along with the other exhibits. Like [Cayasso\u2019s counsel] I encourage you to read the whole thing. We have gone through it before in front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of a judge. There are no secrets in there. [Cayasso\u2019s counsel] is playing on the\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Cayasso\u2019s counsel objected, stating that \u201c[t]his is improper. He can\u2019t attack counsel. He is saying I am playing, which is not appropriate.\u201d Overruling the objection, the court responded that the government was \u201csimply replying to [defense counsel\u2019s] argument.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUu\">The following interchange then occurred in front of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">[Government]: He is playing on the lay ignorance of people as to plea agreements, arraignments and pretrial detention matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[Defense counsel]: Objection. Again this is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">[Government]: He knows that these plea agreements are gone over in open court. He also wants you to think this case is about the personal credibility of the lawyers involved, whether he is telling you the truth, whether I am telling you the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">3. Government\u2019s Statement about Estrada\u2019s Bond Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">With respect to the bond hearing, the government made the following statement in its rebuttal during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah_\">I mentioned before that defense counsel was playing on the ignorance of lay people about the minutia that go on in the criminal justice system. They\u2019re things only lawyers or other people involved here need to know day-to-day. He was playing on that and I will give you an example. He said Kenry Estrada was held because there was no bond good enough. He even asked that\u2019s because he was dangerous. What he did not tell you is that defendants can be held on bond without any reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azq\">Cayasso objected again, stating that the government \u201cwas trying to bring up a legal response to something that was not brought into evidence.\u201d Overruling the objection, the district court stated, \u201cI believe it is directly in response to something that you represented in your closing argument. Overruled.\u201d The government then continued by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">What [defense counsel] asked during trial was, was [Estrada denied bond] because [he] was dangerous? What [defense counsel] did not tell you is one of the bases for holding someone without bond is if they pose a risk of flight. When they look at risk of flight they look at whether they have family in the area or if you own any property. He has no family. He is not from here so of course he was detained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Cayasso claims that this statement regarding the government\u2019s reasons for opposing Estrada\u2019s bond is unsupported by the evidence. Cayasso moved for the district court to instruct the jury that the government had opposed Estrada\u2019s bond because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>no bond would be sufficient. The district court denied this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on all four counts: (1) conspiracy to import cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 968; (2) importation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a); (3) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; and (4) possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Cayasso was sentenced to 72 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Cayasso timely appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Cayasso argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based upon: (1) the government\u2019s reference in its opening statement to Cayasso\u2019s post-arrest silence; (2) the government\u2019s allegedly disparaging remark in its rebuttal statement that defense counsel was \u201cplaying\u201d; and (3) the government\u2019s claim in its rebuttal regarding the basis for Estrada\u2019s pre-trial detention. Cayasso also argues that, if the errors are not individually sufficient to require a new trial, the cumulative effect of all the errors is sufficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">A. Reference to Cayasso\u2019s Post-Arrest Silence</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Cayasso argues that the prosecutor\u2019s brief reference to Cayasso\u2019s failure to respond when confronted with Estrada\u2019s presence violates the constitutional prohiction against using a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence against him and requires a new trial. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (\u201c[I]t does not comport with due process to permit the prosecution during the trial to call attention to [the defendant\u2019s] silence ____\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">\u201cWhile a single comment alone may sometimes constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation, the Supreme Court[ ] ... [made] clear that a single mention does not automatically suffice ... when the government does not specifically and expressly attempt to use ... the improper comment to impeach the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Stubbs, </em>944 F.2d 828, 835 (11th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987)). Here, as in <em>Stubbs, </em>\u201c[t]he prosecution made no specific inquiry or argument about [Cayasso\u2019s] postarrest silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In fact, the prosecution was discussing this silence in the context of a subsequent confession and was clearly focusing on what Cayasso said, as opposed to what he did not say. The government also mentioned Cayasso\u2019s lack of response only in passing, and it was never discussed again. <em>Cf. United States v. Tenorio, </em>69 F.3d 1103, 1107 (11th Cir. 1995) (reversing conviction where a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence \u201cwas the touchstone of the government\u2019s ease-in-chief, its cross-examination of the defendant, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>closing argument during [the] trial of short duration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">More importantly, the district court\u2019s curative instruction generally informed the jury that it could not consider Cayasso\u2019s failure to testify when deciding if the government had proved its case. <em>See United States v. Herring, </em>955 F.2d 703, 710 (11th Cir.1992) (stating that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct may be rendered harmless by curative instructions to the jury\u201d). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying Cayasso\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Cayasso\u2019s post-arrest silence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">B. Statements in Prosecution\u2019s Rebuttal Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Cayasso also challenges the two remarks made in the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal argument, namely the remark that defense counsel was \u201cplaying\u201d and the statement regarding the reason Estrada was denied bond. In order to succeed on appeal, Cayasso must show that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper and that, in the context of the entire trial, the improper closing statement prejudiced Cayasso\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d 1194, 1198 (11th Cir.2000). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudiced if \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome would be different.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>74 F.3d 1093, 1097 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Also, \u201c[t]his [C]ourt gives considerable weight to the district court\u2019s assessment of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and conduct.\u201d <em>Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d at 1198 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Under the facts of this case, even if the prosecution\u2019s statements during its rebuttal were improper,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cayasso has not established that his substantial rights were affected. The prosecutor\u2019s statements involved a witness\u2019s bond hearing and a comment in response to defense counsel\u2019s characterization of the grand jury proceeding. In the context of the full trial, these statements are insignificant. Cayasso confessed, describing his involvement in the crime to three officers who all testified at trial. Cayasso\u2019s confession was directly corroborated by Estrada\u2019s testimony. We thus conclude that the evidence against Cayasso was strong enough that he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>failed to establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome would be different.\u201d <em>See Adams, </em>74 F.3d at 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We further conclude that any cumulative effect that the allegedly improper statements may have had is also insufficient to warrant a new trial, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 1099-1100 (discussing cumulative effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cayasso\u2019s motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-21\">. Brown apparently was not apprehended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\">. Evidently, the government was responding to several statements made by defense counsel impugning the credibility of the prosecution. Defense counsel discussed at length certain evidence that was withheld from the grand jury, including the evidence that Cayasso's fingerprints were not on any of the drug-related objects. Defense counsel asked the jury: \"If they are willing to hide stuff from the grand jury, what are they willing to hide from you?\u201d In addition, defense counsel referenced Estrada's bond hearing, and the fact that the government had opposed bond as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-17\">Now, before [Estrada] is brought in front of a judge he has a bond hearing. The Government moves for pretrial detention, doesn't want the man released. No bond is good enough. That was just a few weeks ago. Now they're willing to go in front of a Court and ask the Court to give him a lower sentence than he should get.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\">. Cayasso does not appeal his sentence, and raises issues related only to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for new trial based upon the allegedly improper statements made by the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\">. \u201cThe decision whether to grant a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of a trial judge as he is in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of a statement or evidence on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Satterfield, </em>743 F.2d 827, 848 (11th Cir.1984). \"When a curative instruction has been given to address some improper and prejudicial evidence, we will reverse only if the evidence 'is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Harriston, </em>329 F.3d 779, 787 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">. Cayasso also argues that the prosecution\u2019s comment on his failure to respond violated Federal Rule of Criminal procedure 16(a)(1)(A). Rule 16(a)(1)(A) requires the government to disclose \"the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant, before or after arrest, in response to interrogation by a person the defendant knew was a government agent if the government intends to use the statement at trial.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A). Such a statement includes a defendant\u2019s refusal to make a statement. <em>United States v. Manetta, </em>551 F.2d 1352, 1356 (5th Cir.1977). \"The purpose of [R]ule 16 is to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial rather than to punish the government's non-compliance.\u201d <em>United States v. Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d 993, 999 (11th Cir. 1995). As discussed above, the government made no use of the fact that Cayasso failed to respond at the moment when Estrada was brought to Cayasso's interrogation room. We thus conclude that this also is not reversible error in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\">. On appeal, the government argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in his rebuttal were appropriate responses to Cayasso\u2019s closing argument under the \"fair reply doctrine.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sarmiento, </em>744 F.2d 755, 765 (11th Cir.1984) (stating that the prosecution is entitled to respond to the arguments of the defense, and that the issues raised by a defendant in his closing argument are \"fair game for the prosecution on rebuttal\u201d). However, we need not reach this issue because we determine above that, in any event, Cayasso's substantial rights were not prejudiced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
