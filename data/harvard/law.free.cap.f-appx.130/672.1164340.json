Acosta now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Acosta contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress because Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Anthony Ray Mata unconstitutionally extended the duration of Acosta\u2019s detention for a traffic stop beyond the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. Acosta contends that this violated his rights under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), which applies to traffic stops. <em>See United States v. Valadez, </em>267 F.3d 395, 397-98 (5th Cir. 2001). Acosta also contends that there was no factual basis for a reasonable suspicion of his criminal activity that justified his extended detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Acosta\u2019s contentions lack merit because questions of the type asked him by Trooper Mata, concerning his travel plans and criminal history, are permissible in connection with a traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 508 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Moreover, the questioning of Acosta occurred during the time necessary for Trooper Mata to effectuate the purpose of the stop, which was to issue Acosta a warning for an expired inspection sticker. Both Trooper Mata\u2019s testimony and a videotape clearly show that, after pulling Acosta over, Mata spent the remaining time, up until Acosta voluntarily consented to a search, in preparing the written warning. Because the questioning occurred as Mata was preparing the warning, it did not result in an unconstitutionally extended detention. <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Acosta\u2019s second contention, that his consent was not an independent act of free will sufficient to purge the taint of the asserted Fourth Amendment violation, necessarily depends on a finding of a constitutional violation in his detention. However, because no Fourth Amendment violation occurred, the court does not need to address this claim. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
