No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), govern this petition. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-23\">Uribe filed an asylum application alleging that, in April 2000, his taxi cooperative was employed by the Liberal Party in Colombia during a presidential campaign. While Uribe was driving his taxi, two members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) approached him and asked to borrow his taxi. Uribe became afraid and left Colombia for the United States for five months. He returned to Colombia in October 2000. In December 2000, while driving his taxi, he was given a phone number to call: when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>he called he was threatened by FARC and declared a \u201cmilitary objective and political enemy.\u201d Several days later, he claimed that while driving his taxi, he was pursued by FARC members in a white Renault, but that he was able to escape. He then left for the United States. Uribe stated that he never had participated in politics; he was paid for his services with no link to politics. He claimed that FARC, however, believed him to be a collaborator with the Liberal Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Uribe testified at a hearing before the IJ that he became a Liberal Party member in 1998: his duties included transporting party members and distributing party propaganda merchandise, such as shirts and keychains. He testified that he participated in party meetings and election campaigns. Uribe also testified about (1) his three encounters with FARC, (2) threats made to his wife, who has remained in Colombia, that FARC will kill him if he is found, and (3) the purported FARC vandalism of a taxi in Colombia owned by Uribe but driven by Uribe\u2019s son. The IJ rejected his claims, determining that Uribe (1) had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and (2) failed to provide credible testimony or sufficient corroborating evidence showing a plausible basis for his fear of persecution in Colombia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Uribe argues that he presented much evidence to support his asylum and withholding of removal application. He contends that the reason FARC approached him was because of his involvement with the Liberal Party. He asserts that his testimony about his encounters with FARC compels a conclusion that the threats he received were due to his political involvement. And he submits that he established a well-founded fear of persecution based on threats he received when he returned to Colombia in 2000, threats to his wife, and the vandalism of his son\u2019s taxi.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">We review the IJ\u2019s findings of fact under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test: we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We also review the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). And on credibility determinations, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of,\u201d among other things, political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">We initially note that Uribe does not mention the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which provided the basis for her rejection of Uribe\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. Instead, Uribe asserts that he presented substantial evidence supporting his claims. But this misapprehends our law: we review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>IJ\u2019s decision \u2014 not the petitioner\u2019s claims\u2014 for whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. And here we determine that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The IJ pointed to several inconsistencies between Uribe\u2019s testimony and his asylum application. Uribe stated in his application that he never participated in politics, but he testified that he was a Liberal Party member since 1998 and was involved in party activities. Uribe provided no documentation of his party membership apart from a letter indicating his involvement since 1997. Uribe offered no credible evidence connecting FARC to the Renault incident. Also, he testified that a person in the Renault aimed a gun at him, but his application failed to mention a gun. He provided no statement from his wife about the allegedly threatening phone calls she received. Although Uribe claimed he did not report the FARC incidents to Colombian authorities because he was afraid of retaliation, his son filed a district attorney report on the alleged vandalism of the taxi. Uribe also did not present evidence authenticating his photographs of the vandalized taxi. And Uribe stated that, despite his fear of harm from FARC, he left the United States in 2000 without applying for asylum, returned to Colombia, and resumed driving a taxi.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In other words, the inconsistencies between the facts alleged in the asylum application and Uribe\u2019s testimony are not minor: they call into doubt the entire basis for Uribe\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (stating that adverse credibility finding must go to the \u201cheart\u201d of the asylum claim and should not be based on minor inconsistencies). An IJ\u2019s \u201cextremely detailed adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s denial of [an alien\u2019s] petition.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. Here, the IJ provided cogent reasons for her credibility determination: these reasons are supported by substantial record evidence. <em>See id. </em>(citations omitted). Consequently, we uphold the IJ\u2019s determination that Uribe was not entitled to asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-16\">. To the extent Uribe challenges the denial of CAT relief, he did not raise this issue before the BIA. This claim is unexhausted, and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion: the IJ\u2019s decision became the final removal order subject to review. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. We reject Uribe\u2019s claim that he qualified for withholding of removal, a higher standard than what is needed to show entitlement to asylum relief and a standard that Uribe has not met. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
