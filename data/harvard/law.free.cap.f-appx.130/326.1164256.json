Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant Dennis Calvin McCrimon\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. McCrimon, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 977 (11th Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court vacated the opinion and remanded the case to us for consideration in light of <em>Booker. See McCrimon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1686, 161 L.Ed.2d 474 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-26\">The government indicted McCrimon on two counts: possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); and possession of a firearm while subject to a domestic violence restraining order, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(8) and 924(a)(2) (Count II). Pursuant to a plea agreement, McCrimon plead guilty to Count I. Appellant sought a downward departure, which the district court denied. McCrimon received a 27-month sentence, followed by three years of supervised release and a $100 special monetary assessment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>f\u00edne was waived, and the government dismissed Count II of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In his direct appeal to this Court, McCrimon challenged his sentence. He did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence, nor did he assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny, in either his initial brief. Only later did counsel for McCrimon seek to file a merits brief in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Moreover, counsel for the Appellant had previously moved to withdraw from further representation and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We granted to counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, denied the request to file a <em>Blakely </em>brief, and affirmed McCrimon\u2019s sentence and resulting sentence. After this Court affirmed his conviction, McCrimon then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, challenging his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">This Court recently addressed a similar case which had been remanded in light of <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Dockery, </em>we observed that the appellant in that case did not raise a constitutional challenge or an argument based on <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Apprendi </em>principles. <em>See Dockery </em>at 1262. We further noted how we handled cases which were remanded with instructions to reconsider in light of <em>Apprendi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">Nothing in the Apprendi opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the Apprendi issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either Apprendi or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Because he made no arguments in his initial brief raising <em>Booker/Apprendi </em>issues, the Appellant has abandoned those issues on appeal. Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, the Appellant\u2019s sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
