In closing arguments, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">Finally, these officers, if they were up to some sort of high jinks in all this and if this wasn\u2019t something they felt strongly about and the evidence wasn\u2019t strong and they didn\u2019t see what they said they saw, do you really think these two NOPD officers would bring this case to the FBI?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Quinn argues that the district court committed reversible error by overruling his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement as improper bolstering of witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Because the prosecutor\u2019s statement vested the officers\u2019 testimony with the imprimatur of the Government, in that it implied that the witnesses must have been truthful and the case must have been strong or the officers would not have asked the FBI to pursue it, the statement was improper. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d 868, 874 (5th Cir.2003). Nonetheless, the magnitude of the prejudice suffered by Quinn was not significant. In addition, the court\u2019s instructions to the jury negated any prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s statement. Moreover, even considering that the testimony presented by the prosecution was bolstered, it cannot be said that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s statement, the jury would have acquitted Quinn. <em>See Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d at 875; <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>901 F.2d 1223, 1227 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Iredia, </em>866 F.2d 114, 117 (5th Cir.1989). The district court did not commit reversible error by overruling Quinn\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">Accordingly, Quinn\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
