(\u201c3 Eagles\u201d). For the following reasons, this court affirms the district court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-23\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b712-24\">In October 2002, the district court entered judgment against Wayne Rousseau and in favor of 3 Eagles in the amount of $1,341,462.14. 3 Eagles sought to satisfy the judgment, in part, with money Rousseau had invested in Standard Collision. In June 2003, Kresge \u2014 as Standard Collision\u2019s registered agent for service of process \u2014 was served with a citation, a petition of garnishment, and garnishment interrogatories. Kresge responded to the interrogatories and confirmed that Rousseau had invested $285,028.87 in Standard Collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-25\">In August 2003, 3 Eagles asked the district court to order Standard Collision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>turn over the money that Rousseau had invested in Standard Collision. The district court granted the request and issued an Order to Turn Over and Deposit Seized Funds (the \u201cTurn Over Order\u201d). The Turn Over Order directed Standard Collision to liquidate Rousseau\u2019s investment and to turn over the sum of $285,028.87 to the court\u2019s registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Kresge was served with the Turn Over Order on September 23, 2003 but did not challenge it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Standard Collision failed to comply with the order, 3 Eagles asked the district court to hold Kresge in contempt. Neither Kresge nor Standard Collision responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In January 2004, the district court held Kresge in contempt. As a sanction, the district court ordered Kresge to pay 3 Eagles\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees associated with the contempt action. When Standard Collision still failed to comply, 3 Eagles asked the court to enforce the contempt order and to impose additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In April 2004 \u2014 seven months after being served with the Turn Over Order \u2014 Standard Collision and Kresge filed a pleading opposing 3 Eagles\u2019 motion to enforce and asked the court to reconsider the Turn Over Order under Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They argued that the Turn Over Order was erroneous because 3 Eagles did not follow the appropriate garnishment procedures and because the order gave 3 Eagles more rights against Standard Collision than Rousseau had. In response, the district court ordered 3 Eagles to file a supplemental brief addressing whether a garnishment proceeding can be used to force a corporate garnishee to liquidate a judgment debtor\u2019s equity interest in the corporation and turn over the proceeds to the creditor. The court also ordered 3 Eagles to submit a statement of its attorney\u2019s fees associated with preparing the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Ultimately, the district court determined that the Turn Over Order and contempt order were invalid because 3 Eagles failed to show that Standard Collision possessed Rousseau\u2019s property. The court vacated the Turn Over Order and lifted the sanctions order. The court, however, also ordered Kresge and Standard Collision to pay 3 Eagles $9,207.50 in attorney\u2019s fees as compensation for the cost of filing the supplemental brief. The court\u2019s order indicates that the court acted pursuant to the inherent authority of a district court to enforce its orders. Kresge and Standard Collision appeal the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">The district court has broad discretion to impose sanctions in a civil contempt proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, this court reviews the imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">Kresge and Standard Collision first argue that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>3 Eagles knew or should have known that no legal basis existed for the Turn Over Order. Even if a court issues an erroneous order, a party must obey the order until it is reversed through an orderly proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The remedy for an erroneous order is appeal, not noncompliance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When a party disobeys a court order, the court uses a civil contempt proceeding to either compel compliance or compensate a litigant for damages resulting from the noncompliance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cCompensatory civil contempt reimburses the injured party for the ... losses flowing from noncompliance and expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in the attempt to enforce compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An award of attorney\u2019s fees is an appropriate sanction where a party incurs additional expenses as a result of the other party\u2019s noncompliance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In this case, the district court\u2019s award was appropriate because 3 Eagles incurred the cost of filing the supplemental brief as a result of Kresge\u2019s failure to comply with the Turn Over Order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Had Kresge complied with, or at least challenged, the Turn Over Order, 3 Eagles would not have pursued the contempt action or the enforcement action. The district court, in turn, would not have ordered 3 Eagles to file the supplemental brief. Although 3 Eagles may have filed an additional pleading if Kresge or Standard Collision had responded to the Turn Over Order, the district court specifically ordered the supplemental brief as part of the enforcement action. Because 3 Eagles incurred additional expenses as a result of Standard Collision\u2019s noncompliance, the district court did not abuse its discretion even though the court ultimately determined that no legal basis existed for the Turn Over Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Kresge and Standard Collision next complain that 3 Eagles is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because it is not the prevailing party. The district court, however, did not award attorney\u2019s fees based on who prevailed. The district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to compensate 3 Eagles for the additional expense it incurred when Kresge failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders. The district court\u2019s inherent power to sanction does not depend on who prevails; instead, the district court may sanction a party \u201cto enforce compliance with an order of the court or to compensate for losses or damages sustained by reason of noncompliance.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Kresge failed to challenge the Turn Over Order and the contempt order before finally opposing the enforcement action. Had Kresge responded earlier, the district court would not have ordered 3 Eagles to file the supplemental brief. The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding fees because the award compensates 3 Eagles for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in its attempt to enforce compliance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Finally, Kresge and Standard Collision maintain that they should not be forced to pay attorney\u2019s fees because 3 Eagles failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order for the supplemental brief. They argue that 3 Eagles did not address whether a garnishment proceeding may be used to require a corporate garnishee to liquidate a judgment debtor\u2019s equity interest in the corporation, but instead advanced a new explanation about why it should prevail. Although 3 Eagles advanced a new argument in the supplemental brief, the award was still appropriate because it represented losses that flowed from noncompliance with a court order and expenses that were reasonably and necessarily incurred in an attempt to enforce compliance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The district court did not award attorney\u2019s fees based on the contents of the supplemental brief, but rather on Kresge\u2019s inaction, which ultimately caused 3 Eagles to incur the costs of the supplemental brief. The district court required 3 Eagles to file an additional brief as part of an enforcement proceeding \u2014 a dispute that could have been resolved much earlier had Kresge responded to the court\u2019s orders. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees associated with the additional briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Having determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to 3 Eagles, the court AFFIRMS the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">.
