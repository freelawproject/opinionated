He appeals his sentence based on the district court\u2019s the district court\u2019s application of a base offense level premised on a quantity of drugs, three tons, not specifically charged in the indictment to which he pleaded guilty, was unlawful and violated his lights pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He also contends that the district court erred by failing to grant a downward departure because he played only a minor role in the offense. We hold that Valencia-Aguirre must be resentenced based on the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. However we find Valeneia-Aguirre\u2019s minor role argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s sentence was a result of his participation in a scheme to transport cocaine from Columbia into the United States using a fishing boat. The vessel, a wolf in sheep\u2019s skin, was designed to appear as though it were engaged in offshore fishing activities. Valencia-Aguirre was recruited and paid to play the role of one of the fisherman. The cocaine was secreted in a compartment below the galley. All did not go as planned. Valencia-Aguirre was apprehended along with the rest of the boat crew by the United States Coast Guard in international waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. He conceded involvement in the scheme and was given a sentence in part based on the amount of drugs found in the boat. He objected to his base offense level arguing that it should be 32 (25 including adjustments) instead of 38 with a sentencing range of 57 to 71 months. The district court found its hands tied. It stated that the base level was \u201cundoubtedly high\u201d but that it would adhere strictly to the guidelines. The court noted if the law changed \u201cthat\u2019s a mere computation which can be done probably by the two of you [the government and Valencia-Aguirre] by stipulation, and we can amend the judgment at a later date or whatever.\u201d Valencia-Auguirre appealed. In light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) the district court must resentence Valencia-Auguirre.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Because Valencia-Aguirre timely raised his constitutional objection in the district court, this Court reviews the constitutional issue <em>de novo, </em>but will not reverse for harmless error. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>289 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2002). The government has the burden of showing that this error did not contribute to the sentence obtained. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946 (11th Cir.2005). We recently held that the district court committed a <em>Booker </em>error by applying the guidelines as mandatory. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir.2005). Based on the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing disapproving of the severity of the sentence but conceding that the guidelines dictated the harsh result, we held that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1332-33. Although <em>Shelton </em>is a plain-error case, \u201c[t]he appropriate review under the harmless error review standard mirrors the plain error review standard regarding prejudice to substantial rights, except that the burden of persuasion shifts: the government must show the absence of prejudice to the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1327 (11th Cir.1998). In light of the district court's comments regarding Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s sentence and mandatory guidelines regime we find <em>Booker </em>error in Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s sentence. The government has not (and cannot) show that this error was harmless. Accordingly we vacate Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s minor-role reduction argument is another story. We have \u201crepeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). The proponent of the downward adjustment always bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. In determining the defendant\u2019s role, the decision falls within the sound discretion of the district court: \u201ca trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>A district court must decrease the defendant\u2019s offense level by two \u201cif the defendant was a minor participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment. n. 3. Two legal principles govern this inquiry. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. First, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against [his] relevant conduct, that is, the conduct for which [he] has been held accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining a defendant\u2019s conduct in the offense, the \u201camount of drugs is a relevant factor and ... under some circumstances it may be dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Moreover, \u201ca defendant\u2019s status as a drug courier does not alter the principle that the district court must assess the defendant\u2019s role in light of the relevant conduct attributed to [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942. A \u201ccourier status in and of itself is not dispositive of whether a defendant is entitled to or precluded from receiving a downward adjustment for [his] role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants\u201d in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The district court\u2019s decision to deny Valencia-Aguirre a minor-role reduction is supported by the record, even if, as he asserts, he had no knowledge of the structure of the enterprise or of others\u2019 activities. Under the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s relevant conduct arose out of his own activities and his criminal agreement to transfer and transport three tons of cocaine, an amount of drugs large enough to be dispositive of Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s playing more than a minor role in the offense. Under the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, when comparing Valencia-Aguirre\u2019s role to the role of other participants in the offense, his participating as a crew member in the transfer and transport of three tons of cocaine and his receipt of payment for his services shows that he is equally culpable to the other participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED, in part, AFFIRMED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
