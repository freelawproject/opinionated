Because Becerra-Rojas did not file a petition for review within 30-days of the BIA\u2019s denial of his appeal, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision or the BIA\u2019s initial affirmance of this deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>sion. Although we liberally construe Becerra-Rojas\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief as contending that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration, we find that the motion did not toll the running of the review period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">I. <em>THE PETITION FOR REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a direct petition for review in an immigration case is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 and [is] not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Stone v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (citation omitted) (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under the INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)). A motion to reconsider or reopen filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In the instant case, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order on 24 June 2004,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Becerra-Rojas did not file his petition for review until 10 September 2004. Though Becerra-Rojas filed a motion for reconsideration, this motion did not toll the time for appealing the initial affirmation of the IJ\u2019s order. Accordingly, because more than 30 days passed between the BIA\u2019s affirmation of the IJ\u2019s order and the filing of the petition for review, we lack jurisdiction to review the initial affirmation. The petition for review is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">II. <em>THE DENIAL OF THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">The government agrees that we do have jurisdiction to review the denial of Becerra-Rojas\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. United States AG, </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 38, 160 L.Ed.2d 200 (2004). When the BIA has properly affirmed an IJ\u2019s order, denial of an alien\u2019s motion for reconsideration is also appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 1340-41 (affirming denial of motion for reconsideration without extended discussion because BIA\u2019s initial decision was appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">.An alien is eligible for asylum if such alien meets the Immigration and Naturalization Act\u2019s (INA\u2019s) definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). In most cases, to demonstrate \u201crefugee\u201d status under the INA, an alien must show that he is outside of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>accord Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230. We have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that [m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (punctuation omitted). Moreover, the fact that an alien has engaged in political activity that dissident groups oppose does not by itself compel the conclusion that violence directed against that alien is on account of such political activity. <em>See id. </em>(holding that the fact that a bomb exploded in a restaurant where a peace protest organizer was present did not \u201ccompel the conclusion\u201d that militant groups had targeted the organizer on account of her political activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In order to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, such a fear must be \u201c \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231. Where the alleged persecutors were not associated with the government, the alien must show that he could not have avoided persecution by relocating within his home country. <em>Id. </em>When an IJ points to meaningful differences between an alien\u2019s asylum application and testimony at the merits hearing, we will defer to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See D-Muhumed v. United States, </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">In the instant case, the IJ\u2019s opinion correctly noted that Becerra-Rojas claimed in his asylum application that the group of students beat him, but omitted this claim during his direct testimony. Thus, we defer to the IJ\u2019s finding that Beeerra-Rojas\u2019s claim that he was beaten was not credible. With respect to Becerra-Rojas\u2019s allegations of death threats and verbal harassment, we find that, even if credited, these allegations were insufficient to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">With respect to future persecution, Becerra-Rojas proffered an article to the BIA which stated that \u201cviolence [undertaken by the Shining Path] will be low-key and will take place mainly in parts of Peru that are of little political or economic importance, such as shantytowns in Lima and towns in the jungle or the Andean highlands.\u201d Thus, because Becerra-Rojas could avoid future persecution by relocating within Peru, he has not shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s decision that BecerraRojas was not entitled to asylum was correct, and, the BIA did not err by denying Becerra-Rojas\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record and found no error, we AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration and DISMISS his petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">. The government argues that Becerra-Rojas has abandoned any challenge to the denial of his motion for reconsideration by not expressly raising such a challenge in his appellate brief. This position is understandable. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding, in counseled case, that \"[w]hen appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d). However, because Becerra-Rojas is uncounseled we liberally construe his brief as challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-16\">. Because Becerra-Rojas\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after I April 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L.No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\"IIRIRA\u201d), apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
