Aboushehata points to Saudi Arabia\u2019s stringent limitations on his rights to work and travel. Further, he claims that he was twice subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention based on his Palestinian nationality. The evidence showed, however, that Aboushehata was arrested and jailed for two weeks when a physical altercation resulted between him and his employer-sponsor. The other arrest occurred after Aboushehata was discovered to be working without a work permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Aboushehata asserts that his son, Mu-hummed, also suffered persecution on account of his nationality, namely, he was denied permission to obtain heart surgery at King Fasal Hospital because he was a Palestinian-American. Because Muhummed has a rare chromosome abnormality, he needs constant medical treatment and care, which Aboushehata contends that his son cannot obtain in Saudi Arabia as a Palestinian.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Next, Aboushehata argues that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution largely because if he returns, the Saudi government would jail him indefinitely because he remained out of the country longer than he was allowed. Even if he is released from jail, he claims that he would not be able to obtain permission to work and secure the necessary medical treatment for his son because of his Palestinian heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The BIA denied Aboushehata\u2019s claim for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ found significant parts of Aboushehata\u2019s testimony about his arrests and detention to lack credibility. The BIA then concluded that even assuming Aboushehata\u2019s testimony was credible, Aboushehata had failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA reasoned that Aboushehata\u2019s ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>rests for working without the work permit and for getting into a physical altercation with his employer-sponsor did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA further stressed that Aboushehata was ultimately allowed to leave Saudi Arabia to obtain medical treatment for his son, and that his son successfully received medical treatment in the United States. According to the BIA, the fact that Aboushehata was not able to arrange for his son to have the necessary surgery in Saudi Arabia because he and the child were not Saudi citizens did not constitute persecution (especially because Saudi Arabia allowed Aboushehata to bring his son to the United States for the surgery), nor did the fact that Aboushehata may face certain consequences for not returning to Saudi Arabia on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted); see <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2245, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005) (\u201cIn sum, findings of fact made by administrative agencies, such as the BIA, may be reversed by this court only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that this statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a)-(b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a well-founded fear and overcomes any rebuttal by the INS, (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)-(2). The \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d inquiry has both a subjective and objective component \u2014 that is, the applicant must show that her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>has a \u2018good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cPersecution\u201d is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive. <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, 212 </em>F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir. 2000). To qualify as past persecution, \u201ca person\u2019s experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000). An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show that his life or freedom would \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d be threatened upon return to his country because of, among other things, his national origin. <em>See Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">After review and oral argument, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Aboushehata\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. For example, Aboushehata first arrest occurred because he did not have a necessary work permit. Aboushehata\u2019s second arrest occurred after he got into a physical altercation with his employer-sponsor. Finally, and although his son did not receive surgery in Saudi Arabia, Aboushehata was permitted to travel to the United States to obtain the necessary surgery for his son. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that none of these events, either alone or in combination, amount to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Accordingly, we deny Aboushehata\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\">. In his brief, Aboushehata does not raise any challenge to the denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d). When a petitioner fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
