Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Tougnon fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Tougnon cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-20\">We also uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Tougnon failed to establish eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). Finally, we reject Tougnon\u2019s claim that he was denied due process by the Board\u2019s use of its summary affirmance procedure to affirm the decision of the IJ. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 280-83 (4th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-21\">Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
