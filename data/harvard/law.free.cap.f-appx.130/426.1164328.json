Because substantial evidence supported the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) conclusion that Barris did not did not meet or equal the requirements of 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05D for mental retardation, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">In February 1996, Patsy Gibbs applied for supplemental security income benefits (\u201cSSI\u201d) on behalf of her minor grandson, Jeremy Barris, alleging that Barris was disabled on the date of his birth, 13 June 1989, based on hyperactivity. This application was denied initially and on reconsideration. Barris requested and received a hearing before an ALJ, after which the ALJ rendered a decision on 21 January 1999, finding that Barris had the severe impairments of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) and anemia (a blood disorder), and borderline intellectual functioning, but was not disabled. The Appeals Council thereafter vacated the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanded for a new hearing before the ALJ to resolve a \u201cdiscrepancy in the record\u201d as to whether Barris\u2019s intellectual impairment was borderline intellectual functioning or, alternatively, mild mental retardation. Rl, Ex. at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">A second administrative hearing was held on 5 December 2000, before a different ALJ. In a second written decision, issued on 8 January 2001, the ALJ again determined that Barris was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The ALJ found that (1) Barris had only the \u201csevere\u201d impairment of mild mental retardation; (2) Barris\u2019s ADHD was not severe because that condition was controlled with Ritalin, based on Gibbs\u2019s comments to Dr. Santhi K. Das that Barris\u2019s behavior had improved considerably after beginning medication in 1996; and (3) Barris\u2019s anemia was not severe because there was no evidence in the record that the condition caused any physical limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 17. In concluding that none of Barris\u2019s impairments resulted in \u201cmarked and severe\u201d functional limitations, the ALJ noted that no medical expert or treating or examining source had concluded that the impairments, either singly or in combination, met or medically equaled in severity one set forth in the Listing of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the ALJ concluded that Barris had no functional limitations equal to any listed impairment, explaining that Barris had no limitation in five of the six relevant \u201cdomains\u201d \u2014 attending and completing tasks, interacting and relating with others, moving about and manipulating objects, caring for himself, and health and physical well-being \u2014 and only a less than marked limitation in the sixth \u201cdomain\u201d of acquiring and using information. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the ALJ denied benefits and the Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">Gibbs, on behalf of Barris, then filed a complaint in federal district court seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and the parties consented in writing to proceed before a magistrate judge per 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Rl-1, 14, 15. The magistrate judge thereafter entered an order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying benefits. Rl-16. Gibbs, again on behalf of Barris, timely appealed. Rl-17, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On appeal, Gibbs argues that the medical evidence demonstrated that Barris met all of the requirements of Listing 112.05D for mental retardation. Gibbs first notes that the results of four sets of intelligence tests that Barris took between 1995 and 2000 established that he suffered from mild mental retardation, which the second ALJ found to be a \u201csevere\u201d impairment. Gibbs then contends that the second ALJ erred by not specifically indicating in his decision whether he applied the 2000 or 2001 version of the child-mental-retardation regulations, but adds that Barris satisfied either version. Gibbs also argues that the second ALJ improperly failed to find whether Barris\u2019s ADHD or anemia constituted an \u201cadditional and significant limitation of function\u201d under Listing 112.05D. Likewise, Gibbs claims that the second ALJ was legally bound by the first ALJ\u2019s findings that Barris\u2019s ADHD and anemia were \u201csevere\u201d impairments, and could not reconsider those findings following the Appeals Council\u2019s initial remand. Gibbs asserts that, nevertheless, his ADHD met the requirements of Listing 112.05D because the record showed that he could not function adequately without medication because of the severity of his condition. Gibbs contends that the ALJ would have been required to find Barris disabled had the second ALJ properly reviewed the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">We must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, denying Gibbs\u2019s application for benefits on behalf of Barris, is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401-02, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427-28, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), and must also review whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>McRoberts v. Bowen, </em>841 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Graham v. Bowen, </em>790 F.2d 1572, 1575 (11th Cir.1986). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir.1998) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIn other words, substantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintilla.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Upon a thorough review of the record on appeal, including all medical evidence, the complete transcript of the administrative hearing, and the ALJs\u2019 two written decisions denying benefits, and after consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">A person under the age of 18 is disabled, and thus entitled to SSI benefits, if the person \u201chas a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382e(a)(3)(C)(i). Social Security regulations provide a three-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a child is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a). First, the Commissioner must determine whether the child is engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>If yes, the child is not disabled, but if not, the Commissioner must then proceed to the second question, which is whether the claimant has a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>If not, the child is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>If yes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the Commissioner then must consider the third step, whether the child has an impairment that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>If the child satisfies a listing, the child is conclusively disabled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Listing 112.05 indicates that mental retardation is \u201cCharacterized by significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning. The required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in A, B, C, D, E, or F are satisfied.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05. In relevant part to this case, section D of Listing 112.05 requires \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05D. The regulations further provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">[f]or listings 112.05D and 112.05F, we will assess the degree of functional limitation the additional impairment(s) imposes to determine if it causes more than minimal functional limitations, <em>i.e., </em>is a \u201csevere\u201d impairment(s), as defined in [20 C.F.R.] \u00a7 416.924(a). If the additional impairment(s) does not cause limitations that are \u201csevere\u201d as defined in \u00a7 416.924(C), we will not find that the additional impairment(s) imposes an additional and significant limitation of function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.00A. Under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a), an impairment will be found not severe if it is a slight abnormality, or combination of slight abnormalities, that causes no more than minimal functional limitations. 20 C. F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">In determining whether a child\u2019s impairment functionally equals a listing, the regulations require consideration of six \u201cdomains,\u201d which are \u201cbroad areas of functioning intended to capture all of what a child can and cannot do.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). These six domains are: acquiring and using information; attending and completing tasks; interacting and relating with others; moving about and manipulating objects; caring for himself/herself; and health and physical well-being. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(l)(i)-(vi). To satisfy the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d standard, a child claimant must have \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in two domains or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one domain. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). A \u201cmarked\u201d limitation is defined as a limitation that \u201cinterferes seriously with [the] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities,\u201d and is \u201cmore than moderate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(2). An \u201cextreme\u201d limitation is reserved for the \u201cworst limitations\u201d and is defined as a limitation that \u201cinterferes very seriously with [the] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities,\u201d but \u201cdoes not necessarily mean a total lack or loss of ability to function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">As an initial matter, Gibbs\u2019s argument that the second ALJ erred by not clarifying in his written decision whether B arris\u2019s claim was reviewed under the 2000 or 2001 version of the child-mental-retardation regulations is without merit. In adopting the relevant changes, the Social Security Administration explicitly noted that \u201cthe rules make technical changes to the ... childhood mental disorders listings. We expect that these rules will clarify the intent and purpose of the listings for evaluating mental disorders, and will simplify our adjudication of claims involving mental impairments.\u201d 65 Fed. Reg. 50,-746, 50,746 (Aug. 21, 2000) (to be codified at 20 C.F.R. pts. 404 and 416). As such, the changes did not alter any substantive requirement for satisfying Listing 112.05D. <em>See also Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>U.S. 521, 530 n. 7, 110 S.Ct. 885, 891 n. 7, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990) (noting in 1990 that Listing 112.05 required proof of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cIQ of 60-69, inclusive, <em>and </em>a physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant restriction of function or developmental progression\u201d) (emphasis added). In addition, these changes became effective on 20 September 2000, prior to the second ALJ\u2019s decision on 8 January 2001. <em>See </em>65 Fed. Reg. at 50,746; Exh. at 8,18.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Likewise, Gibbs\u2019s contention that the second ALJ was legally bound by the first ALJ\u2019s findings that Barris\u2019s ADHD and anemia were \u201csevere\u201d impairments is without merit. Social Security regulations provide that, in the event the Appeals Council orders a remand, the ALJ \u201cshall initiate such additional proceedings and take such other action ... as is directed by the Appeals Council in its order of remand. The Administrative Law Judge may take any additional action not inconsistent with the order of remand.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.665(b); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1477(b) (noting that an ALJ \u201cshall take any action that is ordered by the Appeals Council and may take any additional action that is not inconsistent with the Appeals Council\u2019s remand order\u201d). In this case, the Appeals Council\u2019s order vacated the first ALJ\u2019s written decision and remanded for further proceedings to resolve a \u201cdiscrepancy in the record\u201d as to whether Barris\u2019s intellectual impairment was borderline intellectual functioning or, alternatively, mild mental retardation. The Appeals Council specifically instructed the ALJ on remand to \u201c[ojbtain additional evidence concerning [BarrisJ\u2019s impairments\u201d including updated school records, \u201cupdated psychological (IQ) testing appropriate to [BarrisJ\u2019s age, and medical source statements about what [Barris] can still do despite the impairments.\u201d Rl, Ex. at 368. The Appeals Council further ordered the ALJ to offer Barris an opportunity for a new hearing and \u201ctake any further action needed to complete the administrative record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Because the Appeals .Council vacated the first ALJ\u2019s written decision with instructions for the ALJ to obtain and consider additional evidence, the specific findings contained in that first written decision were never conclusively established and were subject to modification. Moreover, in order to fully discharge the Appeals Council\u2019s mandate, the second ALJ was required to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>Barris\u2019s updated school records and \u201cwhat [Barris] can still do despite the impairments,\u201d which constituted additional evidence directly bearing on Barris\u2019s functional limitations, the second requirement under Listing 112.05D. Finally, the second ALJ\u2019s action of reviewing the evidentiary record as a whole to determine if Barris\u2019s ADHD and anemia were \u201csevere\u201d impairments was \u201cnot inconsistent with the Appeals Council\u2019s remand order.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1477(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Here, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Barris\u2019s condition did not satisfy Listing 112.05D, and, thus, that Barris was not disabled, is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Richardson, </em>402 U.S. at 401, 91 S.Ct. at 1427. The parties do not dispute on appeal that Barris was not engaged in substantial gainful employment or that Barris\u2019s mild mental retardation was a \u201csevere\u201d impairment, which satisfies the first two steps of the sequential analysis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a). Rather, Gibbs contends that the second ALJ failed to consider whether Barris\u2019s ADHD or anemia constituted an \u201cadditional and significant limitation of function\u201d under the second portion of Listing 112.05D. Although the second ALJ did not explicitly analyze Barris\u2019s ADHD in the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Listing 112.05D, the ALJ did directly analyze the severity of Barris\u2019s ADHD and concluded that the evidence supported a finding that the condition was controlled by medication, and, thus, was not a \u201csevere\u201d impairment. As noted above, the Social Security regulations expressly provide that, if an additional impairment is not \u201csevere,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 416.924(a), the Commissioner \u201cwill not find that the additional impairment(s) imposes an additional and significant limitation of function.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.00A. Thus, Gibbs ultimately was required to demonstrate that Barris\u2019s ADHD or anemia was \u201csevere\u201d in order to satisfy the second portion of Listing 112.05D. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05D (requiring \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 <em>and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of junction\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that Barris\u2019s ADHD and anemia were not \u201csevere.\u201d First, at the administrative hearing, Gibbs directly testified that Barris was hard to control if he did not take his medication, but that he was able to control his behavior and concentration when he took Ritalin. Gibbs also told Dr. Das that Barris\u2019s behavior had \u201cimproved considerably\u201d with Ritalin. Rl, Ex. at 418. Barris\u2019s teachers consistently remarked that Barris\u2019s concentration and behavior improved when he took his medication. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 248-49. Medical progress reports similarly reflected that the medication was working with no side effects. <em>See </em>ex. at 283-85, 317-18, 322-23, 406-07. Janice Griggs, the psychometrist, observed similar results while administering two intelligence tests in early 1997, noting that Barris \u201cwas somewhat wiggly and constantly verbalizing\u201d during the first test but attended the second test well and gave \u201cvery good attention\u201d and concentration to each task. <em>Id. </em>at 303-06. Dr. David D. Hall treated Barris during 1997 and 1998 for behavior problems secondary to ADHD, finding consistent improvement throughout the course of treatment with one exception in May 1998 when Barris temporarily regressed. <em>Id. </em>at 309-11, 349-51. Dr. Das observed in 2000 that Barris\u2019s attention and concentration were in the average range, and diagnosed combined type ADHD in partial remission with medication. <em>Id. </em>at 419-20. Although there was additional evidence that Barris\u2019s behavior was a problem when he did not take his medication, substantial evidence supports the second ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Barris\u2019s ADHD was controlled with medication, and, thus, was not \u201csevere\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 416.924(a) and not a significant limitation under Listing 112.05D.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Likewise, substantial evidence also supported the second ALJ\u2019s finding that Barris\u2019s anemia was not \u201csevere.\u201d As the ALJ correctly noted, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that Barris\u2019s anemia resulted in any physical limitation. Exh. at 16. Other than her argument that the second ALJ was legally bound by the first ALJ\u2019s finding that Barris\u2019s anemia was \u201csevere,\u201d which is without merit for the reasons discussed in detail above, Gibbs\u2019s only other argument on appeal that Barris\u2019s anemia was severe for purposes of satisfying Listing 112.05D is a single statement that \u201c[t]estimony also proved that [Barris] is required to take prescription medication for his anemia.\u201d Appellee Brief at 14-15. The fact that Barris is taking medication for anemia, standing alone, does not conclusively establish that his condition was severe and disabling. \u201cA medical condition that can reasonably be remedied either by surgery, treatment, or medication is not disabling.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Dawkins v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 1211, 1213 (11th Cir.1988) (citation omitted). The fact that B arris\u2019s anemia is completely controlled by medication and has not resulted in any physical limitations forecloses Gibbs\u2019s conclusory allegation that the condition is severe for purposes of Listing 112.05D.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Finally, after finding that Barris\u2019s impairments did not meet or medically equal a listed impairment, the second ALJ properly considered whether Barris\u2019s condition functionally equaled a listed impairment. Ex. at 16-17. Reviewing the evidence of record in light of each of the six relevant \u201cdomains,\u201d the second ALJ found that Barris had no limitations with regard to attending and completing tasks, interacting with and relating to others, caring for himself, moving about and manipulating objects, and health and physical well-being, and a less than marked limitation in acquiring and using information. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). Gibbs has offered no specific argument to dispute these conclusions, and the medical evidence summarized above does not otherwise demonstrate that Barris either had a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation with respect to two of these domains, or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation as to any one of these domains. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 416.924a(e)(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Barris did not did not meet or equal the requirements of 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05D for mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
