P. Coats, reads as follows: \u201cThe State of Texas, County of Taylor: I, David J. Red, clerk of the county court of said county, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the record of the mark and brand of W. P.

Tried below before the Hon. J. C. Randolph.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-18\">The conviction in this case was for the theft of a horse alleged to be the property of Pink Coats, in Coleman county, Texas, on the tenth day of September, 1887. The penalty assessed by the verdict was a term of five years in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-19\">W. P. Coats was the first witness for the State. He testified that his name was W. P. Coats, but he was generally called and commonly known as \u201cPink\u201d Coats. For the three or four years next preceding this trial he had lived in Callahan county, but in February, 1879, when his horse brand was recorded in Taylor county, he resided in the said Taylor county. He owned thirty or forty head of horses whose range was in Callahan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Taylor counties. Some of the said horses ranged at times in the northwest corner of Coleman county. In December, 1886, or in January, 1887, the witness missed from her accustomed range a certain dark bay filly which he owned, and which, at the time of her disappearance, was about twenty months old. The witness last saw that animal in his lot in Callahan county in the fall of 1886. The said animal was branded PC on the left shoulder. Its mother sometimes ran on Jim Ned and Honey creeks, in Coleman county. Witness\u2019s brand was recorded in Taylor county, as shown by the certified copy now tendered in evidence (and set out in the opinion), but had never been recorded in either Callahan or Coleman county. The witness had never seen his bay filly since the fall of 1886. He never gave his consent to any person to take that animal. He never saw the defendant to know him until the previous term of this court, when the defendant told him that if he proved on the trial-that the said animal belonged to him, witness, he, defendant, would pay witness for it, but otherwise he would not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">Bill Hughes was the next witness for the State. He testified that, for the past ten years, he had known the defendant, who lived on Hord\u2019s creek, in Coleman county. He also knew Coats and some of Coats\u2019s horse stock. He had seen Coats managing and controlling horses in the PC brand that ranged in Taylor, Callahan and Coleman counties. In September, 1887, the witness saw a bay mare branded PC in Jackson\u2019s pasture, in Coleman county. That animal, which was then between two and three years old, was in a bunch of twenty or thirty horses which was in the possession of the defendant, who had a man and two boys with him. Townsend, Straley and some other parties were with the witness when he saw the said animal in the possession of the defendant. They were in a hack riding along the public road which paralleled the pasture fence, and the defendant had the drove of horses just inside of the pasture and near the said road. The hack stopped, and the witness and his party had a short conversation with the defendant, who told him that he was going to ship those horses that night from Coleman City. The witness next saw the defendant on the same evening in Coleman City. The animal described by the witness appeared to him to be about two years old. He did not observe it nor its brand until the hack started from the place where it had stopped for the parties to talk to the defendant, and the witness saw the animal and its brand only from the road as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>were riding along. He had never seen it before, so far as he knew. The PC brand on the animal was plain and distinct. Witness said nothing to the defendant at that time about the animal or the brand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">William Townsend testified, for the State, that he was one of the parties in the hack at the time referred to by Hughes. The hack stopped at a certain point on the road bounded by the fence of the Jackson pasture, and a short conversation then ensued between the defendant and the several parties in the hack. The defendant at that time had possession of a drove of twenty-five or thirty head of horses, which he said he was going to ship on that night. John Mann and two boys, one of whom the witness thought was defendant\u2019s son, were with the defendant. The drove of horses was just inside of the pasture, and was being driven up the pasture and along the fence, which paralleled the road. After the hack left the place of the conversation and had traveled three or four hundred yards up the road, in the direction that the horses were going, the witness-observed in the bunch a light brown or bay mare, branded PC on the left shoulder. The witness did not know the age of that' animal, but took it to be two or three years old. Some of the horses in the bunch were branded 2D. The brand on the animal was plain, and was taken by the witness to be PC. Some men might have taken that brand for PG. The witness told Charles Thompson that the brand on the said animal was PC. He denied that he ever told the said Charles Thompson that he could not say the said brand was PC. One of the parties in the hack, referring to the animal, said: \u201cThere is a PC.\u201d Looking at that animal, the witness took the brand to be PC.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">Mr. Stualey and A. Townsend, the two other parties who. were in the hack, testified, for the State, substantially as did the witness William Townsend, except that A. Townsend could not remember whether the animal was a horse or a mare, and Straley, without any qualification whatever, stated that the brand on the said animal was a plain PC.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">Jacob Rathman testified, for the State, that he saw the defendant in Coleman City one evening in September, 1887, and on the same evening saw a drove of twenty-five or thirty head of horses in the stock pens of the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe railway. Among tie said horses was a dark brown or very near black mare, two or three years old, branded PC on the left shoulder. The said brand was a perfectly plain and distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>one. Witness did not think that animal could have been above three years old, although she may have reached the age of four years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">J. M. Barnet testified, for the State, that he was with Rathman, and saw the animal referred to by him. It was among a number of horses which the defendant had in the railroad stock pens; was bay or light brown in color, two or three years old, and distinctly branded PC on the left shoulder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">L. B. Rogers, hide and animal inspector of Coleman county, testified, for the State, that, in September, 1887, the defendant got the witness to go to the railway stock pens in Coleman City to inspect a drove of horses for him. When he first requested witness to go to the pens to inspect the animals, he said that, as they were all in his straight brand, it would not take long to inspect them. He then left witness for the purpose, as he said, of getting another horse. Witness went to the pens and found all the horses to be in the defendant\u2019s brand except a dark bay or brown mare, two or three years old, which was distinctly branded PC. There was another animal in the bunch which had the defendant\u2019s brand and also another brand. \u201cWhen the defendant came back he said: \u2018 I told you they were all in my brand, but thqre are two in the PG brand.\u2019 and he pointed out the animal branded PC, and said, \u2018 that is the PG, and that, and has not my brand on it.\u2019 I said: \u2018All right; I have got it.\u2019 The animal was about six feet from me and I, thinking he had miscalled the brand, said \u2018all right.\u2019 It was a plain PC and so I reported it to the county clerk. The brand was so plain a PC I did not correct him, thinking he had just miscalled the brand.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">Continuing, the witness testified that he helped the defendant load those horses on the cars. John and Tip Mann, two witnesses now under the rule, went off with the defendant and the horses. It was three or four hours before sun down when the defendant called upon witness to inspect the said animals. Five or six people, standing about the pen, or sitting on the fence, were present at the inspection, and when the defendant said that two of the horses in the bunch were in the PGr brand. Neither the witness nor any of the parties at the pen said anything about the brown mare being a PC and not a PGr animal. The witness'could not swear that the said animal was not five years old. She was about the same size as the other animals in the bunch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">Mr. Buchanan testified, for the State, that he met the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>fendant in Fort Worth, Texas, in September, 1887. Defendant then had in charge a car load of horses. Among those animals the witness observed a dark bay mare, smaller than the majority of the other animals, two or three years old, and branded PC on the left shoulder. The witness said nothing to the defendant about that animal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">The State closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\">Milt Graham was the first witness for the defense. He testified that, in the fall of 1882, he sold the defendant, on range delivery, his entire stock of horses in the PG brand. The stock of horses in that brand ranged in the northwest part of Coleman county. The stock delivered consisted of eleven or twelve head, and two or three mares still on the range\u2014witness could not accurately say how many. The mares that were out at the time of the delivery were branded PG. Witness had frequently had people mistake the G on some of his horse stock for C. Many of the G\u2019s were so indistinct that they could easily be taken for C. Defendant himself did not, and could not, know how many PG mares he had, for witness did not know how many, besides the eleven or twelve pointed out, were on the range\u2014and he sold the defendant the entire brand. The prevailing colors of the PG stock of horses were bay and brown. Under the custom of the horse range, whenever a stock man, in branding his colts, should find an unbranded colt following a branded mare, he would place the colt in the same brand that was on the mare, whether he knew or did not know who owned the brand. Mr. Hudson once found one of witness\u2019s PG mares running on the range with a colt, and he accordingly put the colt in the brand of its mother. At the time of the sale to defendant, witness told him that a man had put the PG brand on a colt that he, witness, had never seen. Defendant\u2019s \u2018brand was NED. The PG brand was rather a small one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-8\">Mr. Moore testified, for the State, that some time in the summer of 1887 he saw a certain brown mare, branded PG on the left shoulder, runniug on the range in Coleman county, the range being west of Hord\u2019s creek and near the pasture of C. C. Hudson, which said pasture was about six miles distant from the residence of the defendant. Mr. Coan, who was in attendance upon this court, was with the witness at that time When the witness and Coan returned to defendant\u2019s place on that day, Coan asked defendant who gave the PG brand. Defendant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>plied that he owned the said brand. Coan then told defendant about him and witness seeing the PG mare on the range near Hudson\u2019s pasture. A few days thereafter the witness, who was a tenant on defendant\u2019s place, saw defendant and Coan driving that same mare into defendant\u2019s pen. Afterwards, and just before defendant shipped his horses, the witness saw that same mare in Jackson\u2019s pasture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">Mr. Coan testified, for the defense, that he knew the animal for the theft of which defendant was on trial. He first saw her in the summer of 1887, on the range near Hudson\u2019s pasture in Coleman county. The witness and Moore were together on that occasion, the witness looking for defendant\u2019s stock. The said animal was a brown mare between four and five years old, branded PG on the left shoulder. When witness and Moore got back to defendant\u2019s house on that day, the witness asked the defendant who gave the PG brand. He replied that he owned that brand, having bought it from Milt Graham. Witness then told him that he and Moore had seen a brown mare in that brand on the range near Hudson\u2019s pasture, and that she was in fine condition for shipment. Some days thereafter the witness and defendant hunted for, found and drove up the said mare, and afterwards put her in Jackson\u2019s pasture with other horses, and after that the defendant drove her to Coleman City, and with other horses shipped her to market. The witness helped the defendant drive the bunch the first three or four miles towards Coleman City, where it was shipped, and he knew as a fact that the said mare was the only animal in the bunch that was not in the defendant\u2019s brand. Witness knew that the said animal was the animal for the theft of which the defendant was now on trial, because he personally knew that she was the only PG or PC animal in the bunch, either in Jackson\u2019s pasture or in Coleman City, when shipped. The brand on that animal was PG, the letters being rather small and the G somewhat indistinct, and in such condition that it could readily be taken for PC at a distance of ten or fifteen steps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">Coon Anderson testified, for the defense, that in August, 1887, he found a brown mare branded PG on the left shoulder, running in his pasture, and at once turned her out of the pasture on the range. It was the only animal in the PG or PC brand that witness ever saw on that; range. Witness knew the PG to be the brand that Milt Graham once owned. The said mare looked like the Graham stock of horses</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Mr. Merrimam testified, for the defense, that in the summer of 1887 he saw a certain brown mare, two or three years old, branded PG- on the left shoulder, in Hudson\u2019s pasture, in Coleman county, and afterwards saw the same animal on the range near the said pasture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">J. A. Couch testified, for the defense, that he lived in Coleman county, Texas. Early in 1887 the witness took a drove of horses to the Memphis, Tennessee, market. While he was in Memphis, the defendant arrived in that city from Coleman, Texas, with a car load of horses. The witness and the defendant shipped their horses together from Memphis to Huntsville, Alabama, and afterwards kept their stock together. While in Alabama, the defendant received a letter from his brother in Coleman county, Texas, in which the defendant was informed that some person in Coleman county claimed that he, defendant, had an animal in his bunch branded PC on the left shoulder, belonging to him. Defendant referred the letter to the witness with the remark: \u201cCouch, don\u2019t this beat hell? I want you to go back with me to where the mare is and examine it closely, and see if it is a PC mare.\u201d The witness told the defendant in reply that there was no necessity of going back to where the mare had been left\u2014five miles distant\u2014to examine her, as he had been with her on the drive, and absolutely knew that the brand was PG. Defendant said again that he wanted the witness to be positive and sure about it, and witness told him that he knew the brand to be PG and not PC. The witness took the said animal to be three or. four years old. Witness was once indicted and tried for perjury,, but was acquitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">C. W. Thompson, the brother of the defendant, testified in his behalf, that, while the defendant was in Tennessee, with his horses, in 1887, he, witness, wrote to him, telling him that a party in Coleman county was claiming that defendant had one of his mares\u2014an animal branded PC\u2014in his bunch. To that letter, the witness received the following answer, which was read in evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">\u201cScottsborough, October 17, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">\n<em>\u201cDear Charley:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-11\">I was glad to get your letter this morning, at which time I received four letters from the family at home. I was sorry indeed to hear of the talk that there was about the PG mare\u2014not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that I am uneasy in the least about her, for there can be no danger nor mistake. As soon as I heard of it I called Mr. Couch\u2019s attention to her, and told him that I wanted him to go and take her brand down, and examine it close. He told me that he was positive that it was PG and not PC. I had two of them, and they were the remnant of the Milt Graham stock that I sold Mr. Sutherland. I know that you can recollect the stock. I can get a certificate from the man I traded her to, and as many more certificates as I want. If the grand jury has not adjourned please go before them with this letter, and tell them to hold up until I get a chance, and I will satisfy all parties that there is no dirt about that mare. If it (the grand jury) has adjourned, please see and send this letter to Mr. Coats, and tell him that I will satisfy him about her when I return; that I have not a doubt about her being my mare, and that I can convince him of the fact; and that if I can\u2019t satisfy him that she is my mare, and he can satisfy me that she is his mare, there is no man more willing to right it than I am, for I don\u2019t want, and won\u2019t have her if she is not my own mare.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">\u201cI have swapped out for mules\u2014good ones\u2014and I think I will sell out at fair prices soon, and be at home.

The certificate, which is attached to a purported copy from a record of marks and brands, reads as follows: \u201cState of Texas, County of Taylor: I, David J.

The appellant owned the PG brand. \u2022 The witnesses for the State testified that the animal was branded PC; but the witnesses for the appellant, to wit, Moore, Coan, C. C. Hudson, Couch, Merrimam, testified that it was a PG, and the appellant, when his title was questioned to the animal, stated that it was a PG. G. B. Mann, J. J.

P. Coats (horse brand).</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b484-15\">Opinion delivered November 28, 1888.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Witness my hand and seal of office this 6th day of March, 1888. David J. Red,</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Clerk of the County Court, Taylor County.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">By J. H. Beckens, Deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">(Byrd v. The State, ante, 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">When the horse was taken, Coats, the owner, lived and had lived in Callahan county for four years; he owned thirty or forty head of horses, which ran in Callahan and Taylor counties, and at times ran in the northwest portion of Coleman \u2022county. When the brand was recorded, Coats lived in Taylor county. (Rev. Stats., art. 4556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">It is urged by counsel for appellant that the law with reference to recording brands does not apply to horses, and that therefore the certificate was not competent evidence. Marks and brands would be admissible in evidence to prove ownership, whether recorded or not, if not prohibited by statute. Our statute rejects brands unless recorded. (Rev. Stats., art. 4561.) The statute did not 'make the marks and brands evidence of ownership. They were so intrinsically, but, unless recorded, the statute expressly declares that the brand shall not be recognized as any evidence of ownership of cattle, horses or mules \u25a0upon which the same may be placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">We have carefully examined the facts of this case, and are impressed with the opinion that they do not sustain the verdict. This is not a case of conflict in the evidence so much as a difference of opinion as to whether the brand on the animal was PC or PG. If PC the horse was the property of Coats, the prosecutor. The witnesses in number are about equal and are \u25a0equally positive, with pretty much the same means of knowledge. There was no concealment, the taking being openly, under claim of property, and the brand being such as might reasonably be taken for PC or PG. Under these circumstances we are not willing to sanction the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for another \u2022trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">\n<em>Reversed an d remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
