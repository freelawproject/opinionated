For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore City erred in rejecting as untimely the appellant\u2019s Petition to Transmit Issues to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. On January 2, 2006, Yinnie R. Henderson of Baltimore City died leaving two wills. A March 23, 2005 will named appellant Juanita Russell personal representative and left the decedent\u2019s home and automobile to her niece, Marquitta J. Russell, and the residue of her estate to her and Henderson\u2019s other nieces, Tina R. Brown, Renee K. Sample, and Serrena D. Russell. A July 12, 2005 will named appellee Jennifer Gaither personal representative, made a series of specific bequests, and left Henderson\u2019s entire residuary estate to Nathaniel Jacobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On February 3, 2006, Gaither filed with the Register of Wills for Baltimore City a petition for probate based on the July 12, 2005 will, which was admitted to administrative probate. Nearly six months later, on July 26th, Marquitta Russell (\u201cRussell\u201d) filed a Petition to Caveat in the orphans\u2019 court, seeking to have the July 12, 2005 will invalidated and the March 23, 2005 will admitted to probate. The petition alleged various reasons for the invalidation of the later will, including lack of capacity, undue influence, and fraud. These allegations were denied in an August 29, 2006 Answer to Petition to Caveat filed by Gaither.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On January 18, 2007, the orphans\u2019 court entered a PreTrial Order, which, among other things, required that all pretrial motions, including requests for transmittal of issues, be filed no later than April 16, 2007. Seven weeks after this deadline, on June 4th, Russell petitioned to transfer issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the caveat proceeding to the circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition was opposed by Gaither as untimely because it was not filed \u201cwithin the time determined by the [orphans\u2019] court\u201d under Md.Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-105(b) of the Estates &amp; Trusts (ET) Article. On July 26, 2007, the orphans\u2019 court dismissed Russell\u2019s petition \u201cas not timely filed in accordance with this Court\u2019s order dated January 18, 2007.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">, Both parties in this case rely on subsection (b) of \u00a7 2-105 of the Estates and Trusts Article. Section 2-105, which has not been amended since the revised Article was enacted in Chapter 11 of the Laws of 1974, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">(a) In a controversy in the court, an issue of fact may be determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">(b) At the request of an interested person made within the time determined by the court, the issue of fact may be determined by a court of law. When the request is made before the court has determined the issue of fact, the court shall transmit the issue to a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">(c) After the determination of the issue, whether by the court or after transmission to a court of law, the court shall . enter an appropriate judgment or decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">(d) This section does not apply where the estate is administered under the jurisdiction of a court having general equity . jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">Appellee steers our focus, to the first sentence of \u00a7 2-105(b), arguing that the orphans\u2019 court has the statutory authority to determine \u201cthe time\u201d when a request to transmit issues to the circuit court may be made, that it has done so here in its pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>trial order, and that Russell\u2019s petition failed to meet that deadline. On the other hand, appellant relies on the second sentence of \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(b), contending that because the orphans\u2019 court has not yet \u201cdetermined\u201d the factual issues sought to be transmitted to the circuit court, her petition is timely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Both sides attempt to harmonize these apparently conflicting provisions. The appellee posits this theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">The first sentence clearly states in what time period the transmittal is allowed, <em>i.e., </em>within the time determined by the (orphans\u2019) court. The second sentence clearly addresses what shall be transmitted, <em>i.e., </em>all issues of fact not previously determined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Gaither also notes that a contrary construction would result in an unreasonable result, where a party facing apparent defeat in the orphans\u2019 court could successfully transmit issues at final argument. The appellant would harmonize the provisions in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">The second sentence establishes that the Orphans\u2019 Court lacks authority to require a motion for transmission of issues be made before determination of the issue by the Orphans\u2019 Court. Under the first sentence, however, the Orphans\u2019 Court retains some authority to allow a petition for transmission of issues after the court has determined the issue of fact so long as the request is made \u201cwithin the time determined by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">To resolve these conflicting views as to the meaning of the statute and to clarify the apparent ambiguity of the two sentences in \u00a7 2-105(b), an examination of the legislative history is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">The second sentence traces its lineage to 1777, <em>see </em>Chapter 8, Laws of 1777 (Feb. Sess.), and has been interpreted or applied numerous times by Maryland appellate courts. <em>See, e.g., Banashak v. Wittstadt, supra, </em>167 Md.App. at 679-688, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>893 A.2d 1236; <em>Hill v. Lewis, </em>21 Md.App. 121, 126-27, 318 A.2d 850 (1974)(collecting cases).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These cases have frequently emphasized the mandatory nature of the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s duty to transmit issues at the insistence of a party. <em>See, e.g., Ades v. Norins, </em>204 Md. 267, 272, 103 A.2d 842 (1954)(Upon the request of either party, the orphans\u2019 court is \u201crequired\u201d to frame issues and send them to a court of law for trial); <em>Flaks v. Flaks, </em>173 Md. 358, 365, 196 A. 116 (1938)(Duty to transmit issues \u201cis imperative\u201d); <em>Schmidt v. Johnston, </em>154 Md. 125, 133, 140 A. 87 (1928)(It is the \u201cimperative duty\u201d of orphans\u2019 court to send issues to a law court). In addition, at least in caveat proceedings, Court of Appeals cases have said that a party may request that issues be transmitted to the circuit court at any stage of the proceeding before final adjudication. <em>Humes v. Shillington, </em>22 Md. 346, 358 (1864); <em>Pegg v. Warford, 4 </em>Md. 385, 393-94 (1853); <em>Barroll v. Reading, </em>5 H &amp; J 175, 176 (1821). In <em>Barroll, supra, </em>5 H &amp; J at 176, Judge Buchanan explained the rationale for this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">The regular mode of proceeding in opposition to the admission of a will to probate is by a <em>caveat; </em>and it may often happen, (and probably most frequently does happen) that the necessity for a plenary proceeding and a trial by jury is only discovered after a part, at least, of the testimony is taken; and at any stage of the proceedings, before final adjudication, either party may require it, and the court is not at liberty to refuse it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">It was not until the 20th Century that the Court of Appeals placed some limits on the timing of a request to transmit issues to the circuit court. In <em>Maynadier v. Armstrong, </em>98 Md. 175, 56 A. 357 (1903), in a case involving a dispute over payments from an administrator\u2019s distribution account, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>orphans\u2019 court refused to halt a trial in order to transfer issues to the circuit court. The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting, <em>id. </em>at 179, 56 A. 357:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">There can be no valid <em>reason </em>after a plenary proceeding has been commenced, in a case such as this, why the parties cannot determine before beginning the testimony thereunder whether they want a jury, which is the object of having issues sent to a Court of law. No ease has been cited and we recall none in this State in which, after testimony has been begun before the Court under plenary proceedings, the same questions then being inquired into have been withdrawn from the consideration of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and issues sent to a Court of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Distinguishing <em>Barroll </em>as a caveat case, the <em>Maynadier </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">[W]e are of the opinion that the [statutory predecessor of the second sentence of \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(b) ] does not require the Orphans\u2019 Court to stop the investigations being made before it, as these were, and send to a Court of law issues for the determination of such questions as those proposed in this petition, when that investigation is being made under a plenary proceeding, and the parties had elected to try the questions before the Court. There <em>may be cases under caveats to wills and possibly some other plenary proceedings, in which it may be proper, </em>but when that Court is actually engaged in the hearing of the question whether administrators are entitled to be allowed for such items as these, it might lead to dangerous practices if either party has the right to stop all proceedings in that Court and require issues to be sent to a Court of law. If the petitioners had such right, then, under the statute, administrators would have, which might not only result in delay and useless expense, but might enable dishonest administrators to avoid proper investigations of their administration of estates by imposing such expenses on those seeking to have them as they would be unable to meet. If issues could be demanded when these were, then they could be at any time before final adjudication, and certainly so far as issues of the character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>proposed are concerned, the Legislature never could have intended to have given the privilege to the parties to demand that they be sent to a Court of law when the Orphans\u2019 Court was actually engaged in hearing the very questions proposed to be submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 180-81, 56 A. 357. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Unlike the second sentence of \u00a7 2-105(b) of the ET Article, the key language in the first sentence (\u201cwithin the time determined by the court\u201d) is of comparatively recent origin. It is the 1969 product of the substantive and non-substantive revision of Maryland\u2019s estates and trusts laws drafted between 1965 and 1968 by the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland (\u201cthe Henderson Commission\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Chapter 3, Laws of 1969.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The December 5, 1968 Report of the Henderson Commission contained the following \u201c[cjomment\u201d on the change: \u201cThis Section is intended to continue the present practice now set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 272, 278, 280 and 281(Md.). <em>See Sykes, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 221-229. No substantive changes are intended.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Stiller &amp; Redden, <em>supra, </em>29 Md. L.Rev. at 90 (\u201cNo major changes have been made in the present statutory procedures and powers of the Orphans\u2019 Courts ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The source law for the first two sentences of \u00a7 2-105, Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.), Article 93, \u00a7 278 and \u00a7 280, does not contain the terms \u201cwithin such time as may be determined by the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A more likely source is language found in P. Sykes, <em>Probate Law &amp; Practice </em>(1956) at \u00a7 221 and referenced in the \u00a7 2-105 comment in the Henderson Commission Report: \u201cIn proper cases, <em>provided the request is made in time, </em>the duty of the Orphans\u2019 Court to make up and transmit issues to a court of law is imperative.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 221 of Sykes, distilling Maryland cases like <em>Barroll and Maynadier, </em>goes on to note that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\"><em>Except in caveat cases, </em>after the parties have elected to try, and are actually trying the identical facts embraced in the proposed issues, the Court is not required to stop the hearing and send them. Nor can the Court be asked to transmit issues after it has passed an order on the merits of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">This is what Sykes likely meant by \u201cprovided the request is made in time\u201d and what we believe the Henderson Commission and the 1969 General Assembly intended in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u00a7 2-105(b) reference to \u201cmade within the time determined by the court.\u201d In short, the new provision embraced existing caselaw distinctions rather than abrogated them. Gaither thus has failed to overcome two roadblocks to her reading of the 1969 change to \u00a7 2-105: 1) that a nonsubstantive codification, as intended in these provisions, ordinarily works no change in existing law; and 2) the presumption that a change in the law does not abrogate pre-existing caselaw. <em>See Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 71-72, 935 A.2d 421 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Post-1969 cases and commentary support this conclusion. <em>See Nugent v. Wright, supra, </em>277 Md. at 619, 356 A.2d 548 (quoting from the Henderson Commission Report that the \u201cprior law of Maryland\u201d on caveat proceedings \u201cwill continue to apply\u201d); <em>Hill v. Lewis, supra, </em>21 Md.App. at 127, 318 A.2d 850 (describing the \u201cstate of much of the law with respect to issues submitted by an orphans\u2019 court to a court of law\u201d as \u201csettled\u201d); <em>Banashak v. Wittstadt, supra, </em>167 Md.App. at 687-88, 893 A.2d 1236 (describing <em>Barroll </em>as a \u201cfountainhead decision\u201d and emphasizing its conclusion that an orphans\u2019 court was not free to refuse to transmit issues to the circuit court). Legal commentary on \u00a7 2-105 emphasizes the right of a party to transmit factual issues before the orphans\u2019 court has determined the issue, without mentioning any authority of the court to curtail that right. <em>See Gibber, Estate Administration </em>(5th Ed.1983, 2008) at \u00a7 2.99; <em>Lyon, Will Contests &amp; Related Litigation </em>(MICPEL 2002) at D.10.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Appellee contends that it could not have been the intent of the General Assembly to permit late-blooming forum-shifting, particularly at the insistence of a party facing possible defeat in the orphans\u2019 court. The Court of Appeals, however, addressed this possibility in <em>Maynadier v. Armstrong, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>where it said the orphans\u2019 court was authorized to decline to transmit issues in certain cases, but not in caveat proceedings, where the need for a right to transmit could be the greatest. 98 Md. at 179-81, 56 A. 357. <em>See </em>n. 9, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If this means that the second sentence of \u00a7 2-105(b) is in the nature of a proviso to the first sentence, it is nevertheless the intention of the General Assembly and serves a plausible, if not reasonable, purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">This is a caveat case where the rules for transmitting issues are governed by <em>Barroll.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even if Russell, by not objecting to the pre-trial order, could be deemed to have \u201cagreed\u201d to a plenary proceeding exclusively in the orphans\u2019 court, <em>Maynadier, </em>supra, 98 Md. at 179-81, 56 A. 357, no testimony had been taken, no final adjudication had occurred, and the request to transmit was made \u201cbefore the [orphans\u2019] court [had] determined the issue of fact\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-105(b) of the ET Article.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Because Russell\u2019s right to transmit issues to the circuit court was erroneously denied as untimely, we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings in the orphans\u2019 court.

The 1777 legislation authorized an orphans' court to direct any issue to be tried by plenary proceeding and to call a jury of 12 freeholders of the county to assist in the determination of the issue. The law was revised in 1798 to provide that \"in case either party shall require, the court shall direct an issue or issues to be made up, and sent to any court of law which may be most convenient, under all circumstances for trying the same----\" Chapter 101, Laws of 1798 at \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\">. Not only has the product of the Henderson Commission been described as \"the most significant statutory reform to have been originated in Maryland\u201d in the 20th Century, Stiller &amp; Redden, <em>Statutory Reform in the Administration of Estates of Maryland Decedents, Minors and Incompetents, 29 </em>Md. L.Rev. 85 (1969), this revision gave birth to the State\u2019s now nearly four decades old code revision process. Because of his substantial contributions to the Henderson Commission, the 1974 revision of the Estates and Trusts Article, and code revision in general, this'year the General Assembly took the unprecedented step of dedicating the Estates and Trusts Article to the late Roger D. Redden, the renowned attorney with the law firm of DLA Piper (formerly Piper &amp; Marbury). <em>See </em>Chapter 538, Laws of 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">.

Where such request is made before the Court has determined the issue of fact, the Court shall transmit the issues to a court of law. After the determination of the issue, whether by the Court or after transmission to a court of law, the Court shall enter an appropriate judgment or decree.

The comments of the Henderson Commission on each provision drafted were not contained in Chapter 3 of the Laws of 1969.

Of course, a party\u2019s motive in seeking to transmit issues to the circuit court is irrelevant to the question of his or her statutory right to take such action. <em>Garner v.
