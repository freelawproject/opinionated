Appellant, who was twenty years old at the time of trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Appellant presents three questions on appeal, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">1. Did the trial court err in denying Mr. McMillan\u2019s request for an instruction concerning the affirmative defense of duress to the felony underlying the felony murder charge, despite Mr. McMillan\u2019s videotaped statement to police that he participated in the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>robbery by knocking on the victim\u2019s front door because he was afraid he otherwise would be killed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">2. Did the trial court lack jurisdiction to try Mr. McMillan for felony murder when he was indicted only for first-degree premeditated murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">3. Did the trial court err by issuing a reasonable doubt instruction that the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Standing Committee on Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions had specifically rejected because judges and jurors throughout the state found it too confusing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">On or about November 16, 2005, Hermann Haiss was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat at his home on Cree Drive, in the Forest Heights neighborhood of Oxon Hill. The evidence at trial included testimony from police detectives, evidence technicians, an assistant medical examiner, and Haiss\u2019s son and daughter-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The victim\u2019s body was found on the floor of his garage by his daughter-in-law, Julie Haiss, on November 16, 2005. The front door of the house was ajar, and the safe that had held Haiss\u2019s collection of firearms was open and empty. According to the victim\u2019s son, Frank Haiss (\u201cFrank\u201d), who was familiar with the contents of his father\u2019s gun collection, the missing weapons included a .357 caliber pistol, three rifles, three shotguns, and two muzzle loading firearms. Frank stated that his father had purchased the gun safe and installed a security system for the home two years before the murder, because of an earlier burglary in which several firearms had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Approximately twelve years before the murder, appellant\u2019s aunt and uncle had moved to the house next door to Haiss. Appellant had lived with his aunt and uncle for part of his childhood, and was a playmate of Haiss\u2019s grandchildren. According to Frank, appellant \u201cabsolutely\u201d would have known that Haiss owned guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Appellant was arrested in connection with the murder on December 16, 2005. During a police interrogation, appellant gave a number of conflicting statements concerning the robbery and murder. Although appellant initially denied his involvement, he ultimately admitted that he knocked on Haiss\u2019s door, allowing two friends to gain entry to the victim\u2019s house. But, he denied that he entered Haiss\u2019s house or took part in the robbery and murder. The police interview was recorded on DVD, portions of which were played for the jury during the testimony of the detectives who conducted the interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The first portion of the interview was conducted by Detective Thomas Hollowell. Detective Hollowell testified that he advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which appellant waived. Initially, appellant told Detective Hollowell that he had not recently been in his former neighborhood of Forest Heights. It then emerged that appellant had been \u201changing out\u201d with people from that neighborhood and that he had heard about the murder. Appellant told Detective Hollowell that he heard that an acquaintance named \u201cS.O.\u201d was involved,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and then said that S.O. tried to sell him a .357 pistol for $300, which S.O. indicated had come from Haiss\u2019s house. According to Detective Hollowell, appellant did not indicate that he was afraid of S.O. or threatened by him. Moreover, appellant denied participating, or being forced to participate, in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Detective Bernard Nelson conducted the next portion of the interview. He testified that appellant informed him that he had lived with his aunt and uncle, next door to Haiss. He admitted that he had been inside Haiss\u2019s home on occasion, and had seen weapons. Appellant described S.O. as a friend, to whom he often spoke on the telephone. Appellant told Detective Nelson that he had called S.O. recently because he had not heard from him for awhile. Detective Nelson asked appellant several times if he had been forced or compelled to participate in the crime, and appellant continued to deny any involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">As the interview progressed, appellant admitted to Nelson that the week before the murder, S.O. and another person named \u201cVel\u201d asked him for information about Haiss, including his age, his schedule, whether other persons lived at his house, whether the house had an alarm system, and the type and number of weapons that Haiss owned. In appellant\u2019s account to Nelson, S.O. and Vel told him they planned to knock on the door of Haiss\u2019s house, and then one of them would \u201c[f]uck him up once he opened the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">According to Nelson, appellant later told him that, on the day of the crime, S.O. and Vel came to appellant\u2019s job, and appellant asked S.O. for a ride home from work. Instead, S.O. drove Vel and appellant to Cree Drive, explaining that he and Vel needed appellant to knock on Haiss\u2019s door, because Haiss knew appellant and would open the door for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We discern that the following colloquy from the DVD was played for the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">NELSON: And when you got off of work, they picked you up from work, they called you and told you they were getting you that day? Or how long did you \u2014 [crosstalk]\u2014 how long before that did you know they were going to come and get you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">APPELLANT: I didn\u2019t. They came up there, and was like, can I get them some food? And I got them some food, and I was like, man, I get off in a little bit, why don\u2019t you just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>run me home, you know what I\u2019m saying, so I don\u2019t have to catch the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">NELSON: Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">APPELLANT: And he was like, alright, I gotta talk to you about some things anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">NELSON: Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">APPELLANT: So I get in the car, and we driving toward Forest Heights, and I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t live this way. He\u2019s like, I know where you live at. I\u2019m like, so where you going? He\u2019s like, we\u2019re just going through Forest Heights real quick. I\u2019m like, wait, man, you know what I\u2019m saying, I got shit I have to do. He\u2019s like, all I need you to do is answer the \u2014 knock on the door, so the dude can answer the door. I\u2019m like, the fuck, I don\u2019t, you know what I\u2019m saying, I don\u2019t want nothing to do with this shit. <em>He was like, man, it\u2019s GBA,</em><footnotemark><em>[4]</em></footnotemark><em> you get down or you lay down, you gonna be with that old man in the house or you gonna leave out the house with us, which one you wanna do? I was like, I\u2019ll knock on the door. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Detective Nelson testified that at one point appellant said S.O. and Yel instructed him not to enter the house because Haiss knew him. The following colloquy at trial is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: At any time did the Defendant explain why the others would be concerned about him going into the house because Mr. Haiss knew him, but there was no concern about him knocking on the door when Mr. Haiss knew him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">[NELSON]: He didn\u2019t explain that. But I tried to tell him that he would have known you because he opened the door for you, but now you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t go in because the victim would have known you. It didn\u2019t make much sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>As Nelson recounted, appellant never clearly explained why Haiss\u2019s recognition of him would have been a bar to his entry to the house, but not to his knocking on the door:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApE\">[PROSECUTOR]: Initially, when the Defendant told you that S.O. and Vel ... didn\u2019t want him to go inside the house because Mr. Haiss knew him, did there ever come a time that the Defendant indicated any other reasons why he didn\u2019t go into the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">[NELSON]: Well, he tried to stay with the story that they didn\u2019t want him to go in because the victim would recognize him. He said that he didn\u2019t want to go in because he didn\u2019t want to be involved. But at the same time S.O. was telling him, \u201cEither you stay in the house with the old man or you leave with us.\u201d So he had a choice to make. And that was the reason why he was saying, he kept saying he did not go into the house, but at the same time they were saying, \u201cYou stay in the house with the old man or you leave with us, one or the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did the Defendant ever explain to you how he could be threatened with, \u201cEither you stay in the house with the old man or leave with us,\u201d if he never went in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">[NELSON]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did he ever explain how he could be left in a house that he never went into?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">[NELSON]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever ask him whether or not he was aware, or whether or not he knew that this would end in Mr. Haiss\u2019 death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">[NELSON]: He didn\u2019t say it in so many words, but that quote from S.O., I would think that was part of the conversation, that was the conclusion you had to come to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, did he ever explain to you how being left in the house with a man that he grew up with was a threat if that man wasn\u2019t going to be hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">[NELSON]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Did there ever come a time \u2014 well, at anytime did he say that any weapons were used to threaten him to get him to be involved in this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">[NELSON]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Detective Nelson testified that he asked appellant several times whether appellant had gone to the door and knocked for S.O. and Vel. Nelson recounted that at one point he put his hand on appellant\u2019s shoulder to show compassion, and told appellant that he knew he was lying because his story kept changing. The segment of the interview that the detective described was played for the jury. In that segment, the detective said to appellant: \u201cYou felt pressure to do that for them. If you didn\u2019t do it, you\u2019d probably be dead right now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cI\u2019d probably be dead because they killing everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">According to Nelson, appellant eventually admitted that he was the one who knocked on the door. Nevertheless, his account remained inconsistent. Appellant variously said that he left the scene immediately after knocking on the door; that he left and sat in the green SUV that the group had driven to the scene; and he emerged from the SUV and told the others inside the house to hurry. According to Nelson, appellant also said the green SUV belonged to S.O.\u2019s girlfriend, and that he had driven it to Haiss\u2019s house. In one account, appellant told Nelson that, after Vel and S.O. exited the house, they got back into the SUV, went to someone\u2019s house to \u201cplay\u201d with the weapons, and S.O. then took him home.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Further, Nelson recounted that appellant told him that, on the day after the incident, S.O. and Vel visited appellant and told him not to tell anyone about what had happened. Appellant also said that Vel told him details of the crime: Once inside the house, Vel had started beating Haiss; S.O. and Vel found one gun, but Haiss denied having any others; they found the safe, and forced Haiss to open it; and according to appellant\u2019s recitation, S.O. struck Haiss in the head with a baseball bat and threatened to cut off his fingers with a \u201chacksaw.\u201d Given that a hatchet was recovered from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>crime scene, the detective speculated that appellant might have confused the hatchet with a hacksaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In addition, Nelson testified that appellant told him that, \u201cwhen S.O. came to his apartment the following day, he had the .357 with him and then walked him to a back bedroom and started to put bullets into it....\u201d According to appellant\u2019s recitation, S.O. asked appellant if he had talked to anyone about what happened, and appellant told him no. As reported by appellant to Nelson, S.O. responded: \u201cGood, because I don\u2019t want any harm to come to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Antonio Gooding, an acquaintance of appellant, testified that around Thanksgiving 2005, appellant offered to sell him a gun for \u201c[t]hree or four hundred dollars.\u201d Gooding declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Victoria Wynn, S.O.\u2019s former girlfriend and the owner of the green SUV, testified that around Thanksgiving 2005, she saw appellant and S.O. in the living room of her apartment with an unspecified number of shotguns. She did not know where the weapons came from, but asked S.O. to remove them from her apartment. According to Wynn, appellant did not appear scared, or act as though he were forced to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Devonshire Majors, another acquaintance of appellant and his relative by marriage, testified that around November 2005, she heard appellant tell S.O., a person named \u201cDarvel,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Majors\u2019s boyfriend, Demetrius, that he \u201cgot a move to go on with something, other people I guess.\u201d She explained: \u201cA move can be different crimes, any type of crime. A move can be a robbery. A move can be anything.\u201d According to Majors, appellant said that the move was going to be against someone on his \u201cold street,\u201d Cree Drive, and that he had been watching a house there.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Majors recalled that around Thanksgiving, appellant offered to sell her boyfriend a gun. At the time, appellant either had a rifle or a shotgun in his pants at the time. Majors heard about Haiss\u2019s death on television. She subsequently heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>appellant tell her boyfriend that appellant had to \u201croll out\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t come around no more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Majors admitted that she had initially told the police that S.O. had been the one with the gun in his pants, talking to her boyfriend. She also admitted that when she was initially interviewed by police, she felt that by talking to them she could help her boyfriend, who was jailed on unrelated charges. She insisted, however, that her boyfriend\u2019s case was over before appellant\u2019s trial, and that she could not help her boyfriend\u2019s case by testifying in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">After unsuccessfully moving for a judgment of acquittal, appellant rested without presenting evidence. In the discussion of jury instructions, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I also am requesting ... the duress instruction, because at that point when he realizes, his testimony, they brought him to the scene, then he realizes the man is home and they threaten him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">THE COURT: .. . My recollection is that the law is very clear that duress must be imminent. It must be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXE\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">THE COURT: \u2014 a threat of direct physical harm to the individual at that moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Correct. That\u2019s absolutely correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">THE COURT: Not weeks later, or weeks before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4O\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">THE COURT: And I don\u2019t think there was any evidence of, he was in immediate and impending danger of death or serious bodily harm if he did not participate in this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXK\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I would beg to differ on that. Even the Detective\u2019s testimony, I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">THE COURT: The Detective\u2019s testimony I think was that \u2014 and I can be wrong, but my recollection was it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>only after the fact where they were threatening him not to tell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No. No. His testimony was, he talked about, \u201cYou felt compelled to do it. You felt compelled.\u201d And then the Detective actually said, \u201cYou thought you would be dead if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s at the time of the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANW\">THE COURT: Then he changed his story after that. I mean, that was just to get the Defendant to give a statement, and then the Defendant\u2019s ultimate statement was different than that. But the bottom line is, in order for duress to occur, there has to be a situation in which someone is, in effect, holding a gun to his head at the time that he commits the crime, and that didn\u2019t happen. There is no evidence that happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree, Your Honor, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">THE COURT: And the testimony, even taken in the light most favorable to the Defendant, is what it says here as the defense of duress is not established by proof that the Defendant had been threatened with violence at an earlier time. So the mere fact that he was threatened\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m not arguing that at all, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 not to participate, doesn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Only right at the scene. The Detective said, \u201cYou felt compelled. You would be dead if you didn\u2019t do it,\u201d and his\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">THE COURT: But that was the Detective\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVX\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. And my client\u2019s response was, \u201cYes, they killed everybody,\u201d basically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">THE COURT: But that isn\u2019t \u2014 there was no \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in the statement that says that anybody was threatening him at that moment, that he actually had\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adj\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that\u2019s exactly what the testimony was. And that\u2019s why I cross-examined and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>showed him on the video because he couldn\u2019t remember saying the word \u201ccompelled\u201d as far as \u201cYou would be dead if you didn\u2019t.\u201d There\u2019s no need for the gun there because, obviously, he knows these people are bad people....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">THE COURT: [T]here\u2019s no evidence that at that very moment of the commission of the crime, anyone was threatening to harm the Defendant. I think the Defendant\u2019s own statements don\u2019t say, \u201cThey dragged me up to the front door and forced me to talk to the man.\u201d No \u2014 there is no indication that is what happened. The fact that someone said, \u201cHarm will come to you afterwards if you don\u2019t participate,\u201d isn\u2019t enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I think that\u2019s a factual\u2014 that\u2019s a fact. Those are the facts in evidence that I can argue to the jury as far as his intent. Plus, it goes even further, because I mean, we have an aiding and abetting which requires, one of the elements is willful participation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">THE COURT: Okay. So, you\u2019ve got the aiding and abetting, so we\u2019ve already covered that. As far as I\u2019m concerned, aiding and abetting is already covered. Whether or not the jury finds that he was a voluntary participant. If they find he wasn\u2019t a voluntary participant, then they can say that they found that he did not aid and abet the murder of Mr. Haiss. And that is where it will go. But\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVXv\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">THE COURT: \u2014 and they may also feel that he was not a willing participant in the robbery. And if they do, then they will find him not to be guilty of the offense. But that \u2014 I think those are the arguments you can make. I\u2019m not going to give them the separate instruction on duress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Just so the record is clear\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">THE COURT: You may take exception to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 because of the underlying felony of robbery, duress would be usable in that. Had Mr. Haiss not died, the duress would be available under underlying robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">THE COURT: Under your theory. And I\u2019ve just said, no, I feel that it\u2019s entirely covered by the aiding and abetting instruction, which covers the voluntariness issue. I do not find that this case has any evidence that rises to the point of duress as an element, and I\u2019m not going to instruct the jury . .to that extent. You may note your exception at this time. I will not give the duress instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Pursuant to its earlier ruling, the court did not propound a duress instruction. As to aiding and abetting, the court gave the following instructions, without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">Now the Defendant is charged with the crime of murder. A person who aids and abets in the commission of a crime is as guilty as the actual perpetrator, even though he did not personally commit each of the acts that constitute the crime. A person aids and abets the commission of a crime by knowingly associating with the criminal venture with the intent to help commit the crime, being present when the crime is committed, and seeking, by some act,- to make the crime succeed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">In order to prove that the Defendant aided and abetted the commission of a crime, the State must prove: That the Defendant was present when the crime was committed; and <em>that the Defendant willfully participated with the intent to make the crime succeed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\"><em>Willful participation means voluntary and intentional participation in the criminal act. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">As to reasonable doubt, the court instructed as follows, without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">The State has the burden of proving the guilt of the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden remains on the State throughout the trial. The Defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>not required to prove his innocence. However, the State is not required to prove guilt beyond all possible doubt or to a mathematical certainty. Nor is the State required to negate every conceivable circumstance of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">A reasonable doubt is a doubt founded upon reason. <em>It is not a fanciful doubt, a whimsical doubt or a capricious doubt. </em>Proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires such proof as would convince you of the truth of a fact to the extent that you would be willing to act upon such belief without reservation in your own business or personal affairs. However, if you are not satisfied of the Defendant\u2019s guilt to that extent, then reasonable doubt exists and the Defendant must be found not guilty.

We quote a portion of his closing remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">Why would they say, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you here with the old man\u201d? My understanding of all that is, my client testified that \u201cI\u2019m being threatened to go there.\u201d And the officer says, \u201cSo you felt compelled to go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">Now, all that is <em>threats at the time when this is all happening. </em>Because my client\u2019s statement, no matter how many times he lied to get to what Detective Nelson felt was, you know, a usable statement on him, <em>his statement is, that they had, forced him and needed to use him to get Mr. Haiss to open the door </em>.... And his response was, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re killing everybody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">So, he knew. He didn\u2019t say they had a gun to his head.

He concedes that the evidence of duress was \u201cslim and inconclusive,\u201d and was contradicted by other evidence, including some of his own statements during the interrogation. Nevertheless, he insists that his pre-trial statements were sufficient to entitle him to the instruction. In particular, he points to his affirmative response to Detective Nelson\u2019s comment that if he (appellant) had not participated in Haiss\u2019s robbery, he would \u201cprobably be dead right now.\u201d In his view, a jury could reasonably have chosen to credit his claim that he was coerced to participate, and thus the evidence sufficed to overcome the minimal evidentiary threshold required for the duress instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">At the outset, the State questions whether a duress instruction would be available to appellant under any circumstance, given that appellant was charged with murder. Quoting <em>Frasher v. State, 8 </em>Md.App. 439, 260 A.2d 656, <em>cert. denied sub nom. McLaughlin v. Director, Patuxent Inst., </em>400 U.S. 959, 91 S.Ct. 360, 27 L.Ed.2d 269 (1970), a narcotics case, the State claims that duress \u201cis a defense as to all crimes except taking the life of an innocent person----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447. According to the State, this principle \u201csuggests that the defense is not available for first degree felony murder, and that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>court properly denied McMillan\u2019s request for the instruction____\u201d Moreover, the State observes that appellant \u201cdoes not cite any Maryland authority for the proposition that the defense of duress is available for an underlying felony under the felony murder doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In his reply brief, appellant insists that duress is available as a defense to felony-murder. He cites <em>Wentworth v. State, 29 </em>Md.App. 110, 349 A.2d 421 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 735 (1976), as well as several cases from other jurisdictions, in support of that proposition. <em>See, e.g., People v.

The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 226-27, 867 A.2d 1095:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cAt common law one whose conduct brought about an unintended death in the commission or attempted commission of a felony was guilty of murder.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 14.5 (2d ed.2003). The modern felony-murder rule is \u201cintended to deter dangerous conduct by punishing as murder a homicide resulting from dangerous conduct in the perpetration of a felony, even if the defendant did not intend to kill.\u201d <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 262, 786 A.2d 706 (2001). The doctrine recognizes that in society\u2019s judgment, \u201can intentionally committed [felony] that causes the death of a human being is qualitatively more serious than an identical [felony] that does not.\u201d Crump <em>&amp; </em>Crump, <em>In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine, </em>8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 359, 363 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In <em>State v. Allen, </em>387 Md. 389, 875 A.2d 724 (2005), the Court recognized that, under the modern view of felony-murder, the commission of the underlying felony or its attempt do not \u201c \u2018simply <em>imply </em>malice; it is rather the case that they <em>are </em>malice by definition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 875 A.2d 724 (quoting Charles E. Moylan, Jr., Criminal Homicide Law \u00a7 5.1 at 105 (2002) (\u201cMoylan\u201d) (Moylan\u2019s emphasis)). What the Court said in <em>Watkins v. State, </em>357 Md. 258, 267, 744 A.2d 1 (2000), is also relevant (internal citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">Under Maryland common law, a homicide arising in the commission of [a dangerous] felony is murder \u201cwhether death was intended or not, the fact that the person was engaged in such perpetration or attempt being sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>supply the element of malice.\u201d That substituted form of malice represents, in a way, a vertical extension of the normal requirement that, for a homicide to constitute murder, the defendant must intend to kill the victim. It has also long been established that, under the felony-murder doctrine, a participating felon is guilty of murder when a homicide has been committed by a co-felon in furtherance of the underlying felony. That extension, which invokes the rule of accomplice liability, is, in essence, a horizontal one, making culpable other persons, who did not actually commit the homicide and who may, in fact have earnestly desired that it not have happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><em>See also Moylan, </em>\u00a7 5. 1, at 106; <em>Evans v.

The General Assembly\u2019s \u201cdelineation of] murder into degrees for purposes of punishment, did not alter the common law felony-murder doctrine.\u201d <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 231 n. 12, 867 A.2d 1095.

On the other hand, \u201c[i]f the felony should be one of the residual felonies under the common law felony-murder doctrine and not one of those listed in [C.L. \u00a7 2-201(a)(4) ], the guilt of all participants would then be murder in the second degree, under the common law felony-murder doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>681 A.2d 628.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Once the felony-murder doctrine \u201c \u2018has already operated,\u2019 \u201d C.L. \u00a7 2 \u2014 201(a)(4) is triggered to determine whether \u201c \u2018the <em>already established murder </em>shall be punished as murder in the first degree,\u2019 \u201d because of the involvement of one of the felonies specifically designated in the statute. Moylan, \u00a7 5.1 at 106 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the defense of duress, which was explicated in <em>Frasher, supra, </em>8 Md.App. at 447, 260 A.2d 656. There, Chief Judge Orth explained for the Court that \u201cit is a defense as to all crimes except taking the life of an innocent person that the defendant acted under a compelling force of coercion or duress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 260 A.2d 656. Distilling the requirements of the defense, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">In order to constitute a defense, <em>the duress by another person on the defendant must be present, imminent, and impending, and of such a nature as to induce well grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily injury if the act is not done. It must be of such a character as to leave no opportunity to the accused for escape. </em>Mere fear or threat by another is not sufficient nor is a threat of violence at some prior time. The defense cannot be raised if the apprehended harm is only that of property damage or future but not present personal injury. However, there appears to be accord that the defense cannot be claimed if the compulsion arose by the defendant\u2019s own fault, negligence or misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 449, 260 A.2d 656 (emphasis added; internal citations and footnote omitted); <em>see also Williams v. State, </em>101 Md. App. 408, 412-26, 646 A.2d 1101 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 90, 651 A.2d 855 (1995); <em>Wentworth, </em>29 Md.App. at 118, 349 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>A.2d 421. Nevertheless, \u201cthe question of what acts are sufficient to constitute duress is a matter for the determination of the jury.\u201d <em>Frasher, </em>8 Md.App. at 449-50, 260 A.2d 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions (\u201cMPJICR\u201d) provide the following instruction on duress in MPJI-CR 5:03:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">You have heard evidence that the defendant acted under the influence of an overpowering force. This is called duress. Duress will excuse an act that would otherwise be criminal. You are required to find the defendant not guilty \u2019 if all of the following four factors are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">(1) the defendant actually believed that the duress placed [him] [her] in immediate and impending danger of death or serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">(2) the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">(3) the defendant had no reasonable opportunity for escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">(4) the defendant committed the crime because of the duress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">The defense of duress is not established by proof that the defendant had been threatened with violence at an earlier time. [He][she] must have been under a present threat at the time of the actual commission of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">In order to convict the defendant, the State must prove that the defendant did not act under duress. This means that you are required to find the defendant not guilty unless the State has persuaded you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one of the four factors of duress was absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">As noted, appellant and the State dispute whether duress can be a defense to felony-murder. The State cites <em>Wentworth, supra, </em>29 Md.App. 110, 349 A.2d 421, for the proposition that \u201cthe law, as a matter of social policy, has declared that the defense of duress may not extend to the taking of an innocent person\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118-19, 349 A.2d 421. In his reply brief, appellant accuses the State of selective quotation from <em>Wentworth, </em>and argues that the State\u2019s position is, in fact, foreclosed by <em>Wentworth\u2019s </em>holding. Although the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ments from <em>Wentworth </em>upon which appellant relies were dicta, we agree with appellant that <em>Wentworth </em>supports the proposition that duress may be a defense to felony-murder, and we adopt that proposition. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In <em>Wentworth, </em>stating that \u201cthe law is now clear,\u201d we quoted the following passage from Professors LaFave and Scott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cIt has been held that duress cannot justify murder \u2014 or, as it is better expressed (since duress may justify the underlying felony and so justify what would otherwise be a felony murder), duress cannot justify the intentional killing of (or attempt to kill) an innocent third person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">29 Md.App. at 119, 349 A.2d 421 (quoting LaFave <em>&amp; </em>Scott, Criminal Law 376 (1972)) (\u201cLaFave\u201d). Appellant further quotes LaFave, at 377:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">The law properly recognizes that one is justified in aiding a robbery if he is forced by threats to do so to save his life; he should not lose the defense because his threateners unexpectedly kill someone in the course of the robbery and thus convert a mere robbery into a murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Although the <em>Wentworth </em>Court discussed duress in the context of murder, felony-murder was not at issue in that ease, and the Court\u2019s elucidation of the application of the duress defense to felony-murder was dictum. Other than <em>Wentworth, </em>we have not uncovered any reported Maryland decision that has addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Among the states that retain the common law felony-murder doctrine<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and have considered whether duress may relieve a defendant of liability for felony-murder by operating as a defense to the underlying felony, a majority of jurisdictions have determined that duress is available as a defense. <em>See People v. Hinton, </em>37 Cal.4th 839, 38 Cal.Rptr.3d 149, 126 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>981, 1015 (2006) (citing <em>Anderson, supra, </em>122 Cal.Rptr.2d 587, 50 P.3d at 379), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 581, 166 L.Ed.2d 434 (2006); <em>People v.

As the basis for their decisions, several of these courts have explicitly adopted Professor LaFave\u2019s reasoning, as quoted in <em>Wentworth. See, e.g., Anderson, </em>122 Cal.Rptr.2d 587, 50 P.3d at 379; <em>Hunter, </em>740 P.2d at 568; <em>Tully, </em>730 P.2d at 1210; <em>Pugliese, </em>428 S.E.2d at 26. Additionally, in some states, duress may be a defense to any crime, including murder. <em>See, e.g., MacKool v. State, </em>363 Ark. 295, 213 S.W.3d 618, 623 (2005); <em>State v. Heinemann, </em>282 Conn. 281, 920 A.2d 278, 290 (2007). <em>But cf. People v. Moseler, </em>202 Mich.App. 296, 508 N.W.2d 192, 194 (1993) (rejecting duress defense to involuntary manslaughter), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 Mich. 919, 519 N.W.2d 899 (1994). Moreover, the state courts that have rejected the proposition that duress may be a defense to felony-murder have done so on the basis of state statutes that explicitly limit the scope of the duress defense, a situation that does not obtain in Maryland. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ellison, </em>213 Ariz. 116, 140 P.3d 899, 914 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 506, 166 L.Ed.2d 377 (2006); <em>State v.

Rumble, </em>680 S.W.2d 939, 942 (Mo.1984); <em>State v. Ng, </em>110 Wash.2d 32, 750 P.2d 632, 636 (1988).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As appellant observes, \u201cMaryland does not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>such a law\u201d; duress remains a common law defense in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">At common law, the rationale for barring the duress defense in a prosecution for murder was that a person \u201cought rather to die himself than escape by the murder of an innocent.\u201d 5 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries 30. This rationale disappears when the sole ground for the murder charge is that the defendant participated in an underlying felony, under duress, and the defendant\u2019s co-felons unexpectedly killed the victim, thereby elevating the charge to felony-murder. We conclude that if duress would serve as a defense to the underlying felony, it is also available as a defense to a felony-murder arising from that felony, assuming the criteria for such a defense are otherwise satisfied. Therefore, we shall proceed to consider whether, under the circumstances of this case, appellant was entitled to a jury instruction as to the defense of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The responsibility of a judge to instruct the jury in a criminal trial is governed by Maryland Rule 4-325 (2008), which provides: \u201cThe court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law....\u201d But, \u201c[t]he court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d On review, we \u201c \u2018must determine whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law; whether it was applicable under the facts of the case <em>[i.e., </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to generate the desired instruction]; and whether it was fairly covered in the instructions actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Janey v.

First, appellant contends that the court \u201cusurped the jury\u2019s role as factfinder\u201d by purporting to resolve the conflicts in his statements to police and \u201cignoring] Mr. McMillan\u2019s statements ... concerning the threats against his life because Mr. McMillan \u2018changed his story\u2019 during the overnight investigation.\u201d Second, appellant argues that the trial court erred to the extent that it based its ruling on the ground that \u201cthe issue of voluntariness was \u2018entirely covered by the aiding and abetting instruction.\u2019 \u201d Finally, he insists that the trial court erred \u201cin concluding that it was legally impossible for the jury to conclude that Mr. McMillan was under an imminent threat of harm at the time he participated\u201d in Haiss\u2019s robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>While noting that appellant\u2019s statement was \u201crife with inconsistencies,\u201d the State does not rely on the inconsistency of appellant\u2019s statement to support its position. Instead, it argues: \u201cEven in the light most favorable to McMillan, this evidence failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of duress.\u201d The State maintains that, at the requisite point in time, there was no evidence that appellant was in fear of \u201cimmediate and impending\u201d danger of death or serious bodily harm. MPJICR 5:03(1). It asserts: \u201cThe <em>detective\u2019s </em>statement to McMillan \u2014 that he must have felt \u2018pressured\u2019 to knock on the door or he would probably be dead right now \u2014 and McMillan\u2019s response \u2014 that he would <em>\u2018probably </em>be dead\u2019 \u2014 is no substitute for the required evidence [of] imminent threat of death or serious physical injury.\u201d The State argues: \u201cAt most, McMillan was afraid of being hurt by \u2018S.O.\u2019 in the future, but he did not describe a fear of imminent harm at the time of the act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Moreover, the State insists that, even if appellant were in fear of death or serious harm, there was no evidence to support the element that his fear was \u201cwell grounded,\u201d <em>Frasher, 8 </em>Md.App. at 449, 260 A.2d 656, or, in the words of the pattern instruction, \u201creasonable.\u201d MPJI-CR 5:03(2). \u201cIndeed,\u201d comments the State, \u201cthere was <em>no </em>evidence regarding the nature of the alleged threat or how it might be carried out, only that they told McMillan they needed him to knock on the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In addition, the State maintains that appellant failed to adduce evidence supporting the third element, i.e., that he \u201chad no reasonable opportunity to escape.\u201d MPJI-CR 5:03(3). In this regard, claims the State, appellant did not provide any reason to explain why he could not have run from S.O. and Vel. The State suggests that a particular avenue of escape might have been the home of appellant\u2019s aunt and uncle, who lived next door to Haiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Finally, the State rejects appellant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s reliance on the aiding and abetting instruction was misplaced. It reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The jury was instructed that the State must prove that the defendant was \u201cpresent when the crime was committed; and that the Defendant <em>willfully participated </em>with the intent to make the crime succeed.\u201d As the trial judge pointed out, because the jury was required to find that McMillan was a voluntary participant, it could find that \u201che was not a willing participant in the robbery. And if they do, then they will find him not to be guilty of the offense.\u201d (Quoting trial court; State\u2019s emphasis).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">As noted, appellant was merely required to adduce \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the instruction. In explaining the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard, the Court in <em>Dykes </em>was clear: \u201cIt is of no matter that the ... claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied upon by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim ... the defendant has met his burden.\u201d <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 217, 571 A.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Here, the trial judge commented on the inconsistencies in appellant\u2019s statement. Regarding appellant\u2019s assertion that he would \u201cprobably be dead\u201d had he not participated in the robbery, the judge observed: \u201cThen he changed his story after that.\u201d The court also alluded to appellant\u2019s inconsistent statements after defense counsel referred to appellant\u2019s statement that \u201cthey\u2019re killing everybody.\u201d The judge commented: \u201cAnd that was midway through what he said....\u201d It does not appear, however, that the judge relied on the inconsistencies in ruling on appellant\u2019s request. In particular, the judge stated: <em>\u201cBut the bottom line is, </em>in order for duress to occur, <em>there has to be a situation in which someone is, in effect, holding a gun to his head at the time that he commits the crime, </em>and that didn\u2019t happen. There is <em>no evidence </em>that happened.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court continued: \u201cAnd the testimony, <em>even taken in the light 'most favorable to the Defendant, </em>is what it says here as the defense of duress is not established by proof that the Defendant had been threatened with violence at an earlier time.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remainder of the colloquy between court and counsel focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>on whether there was any evidence that the putative threat to appellant was imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We are satisfied that, despite the court\u2019s references to appellant\u2019s contradictory statements, the court properly focused on whether appellant adduced \u201csome evidence\u201d of imminent threat. Therefore, appellant\u2019s claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Even if the court had erroneously considered the contradictions, reversal would not be compelled. It is well established that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">where the record in a case adequately demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was correct, although on a ground not relied upon by the trial court and perhaps not even raised by the parties, an appellate court will affirm. In other words, a trial court\u2019s decision may be correct, although for a different reason than relied on by that court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxP\"><em>Robeson v.

We shall discuss appellant\u2019s entitlement, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Appellant also complains that the trial court erred when it said that appellant\u2019s duress argument was \u201centirely covered by the aiding and abetting instruction, which covers the voluntariness issue.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>If [the jurors] find he wasn\u2019t a voluntary participant, then they can say that they found that he did not aid and abet the murder of Mr. Haiss ... and they may also feel that he was not a willing participant in the robbery. And if they do, then they will find him not to be guilty of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Thereafter, in accordance with MPJI-CR 6:01, the court instructed the jury that one of the elements of aiding and abetting was \u201cthat the Defendant wilfully participated with the intent to make the crime succeed.\u201d It added: \u201cWillful participation means voluntary and intentional participation in the criminal act.\u201d The State argues that, \u201ceven if it were generated, an instruction on duress was not required in this case because it was fairly covered by the aiding and abetting instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Maintaining that the trial court erred in relying on the aiding and abetting instruction to communicate the concept of duress, appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">The common law draws a sharp distinction between the presence of the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to commit or aid an offense and the existence of duress. It is entirely possible for a defendant to possess the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to aid and abet a crime and nevertheless to have provided such aid under duress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Once again, appellant directs our attention to <em>Wentworth, </em>29 Md.App. 110, 349 A.2d 421. There, we again quoted LaFave at 374-75, stating, 29 Md.App. at 117-18, 349 A.2d 421 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cOne who, under the pressure of an unlawful threat from another human being to harm him (or to harm a third person), commits what would otherwise be a crime may, under some circumstances, be justified in doing what he did and thus not be guilty of the crime in question. The requirement for this defense of duress is that a threat of a human being which operates upon the defendant\u2019s mind, rather than of the pressure of a human being which operates upon his body (as where A pushes B against C, causing C to fall over the cliff where the three are standing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>admiring the view). <em>The rationale of the defense is not that the defendant, faced with the unnerving threat of harm unless he does an act which violates the literal language of the criminal law, somehow loses his mental capacity to commit the crime in question. Rather, it is that, even though he has the mental state which the crime requires, his conduct which violates the literal language of the criminal law is justified because he has thereby avoided a harm of greater magnitude. </em>If A, armed with a gun, threatens B, a taxi driver, with death unless B drives him to the scene of a robbery planned by A, B is not guilty of the robbery which A commits at the scene, because it is better for society as a whole that B[do] the lesser harm (aid A in the robbery) than that B\u2019s life be lost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Although <em>Wentworth </em>is instructive, it did not involve felony-murder. In the context of felony-murder, we have not located any Maryland case that has spoken directly to the interplay between duress and the \u201cwillful participation\u201d or \u201cvoluntariness\u201d element of aiding and abetting. To be sure, the State\u2019s position, apparently shared by the trial judge, is not devoid of logic. Indeed, in <em>Frasher </em>the Court seemed to equate \u201cvoluntariness\u201d with lack of duress when it said, 8 Md.App. at 447-48, 260 A.2d 656 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">It is essential to a crime that the defendant committed a voluntary act. Voluntariness in this context has a limited meaning.... <em>The voluntary requirement of the criminal act relates directly to compulsion; </em>it is a defense as to all crimes except taking the life of an innocent person that the defendant acted under a compelling force of coercion or duress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Nevertheless, we cannot endorse the proposition that the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d component of an aiding and abetting instruction suffices, for purposes of Maryland Rule 4-325(a), to \u201cfairly cover\u201d the concept of duress. Thus, in factual circumstances that could support a duress defense, an instruction as to aiding and abetting would not relieve the trial court from its obligation to \u201cinstruct the jury as to the applicable law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Were we to conclude otherwise, we would essentially render the duress instruction superfluous whenever a defendant\u2019s guilt is premised on accomplice liability, even in factual circumstances akin to the paradigmatic \u201cgun to the head\u201d example. Accordingly, we conclude that the aiding and abetting instruction is not a substitute for a duress instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In the context of this case, the aiding and abetting instruction could not substitute for the duress instruction for yet another reason. Appellant was not charged separately with robbery. When the court instructed the jury as to aiding and abetting, it prefaced the instruction by saying, \u201cNow the Defendant is charged with the crime of <em>murder\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court also said: \u201cThe Defendant is charged with the crime of robbery only as an essential element of felony murder.\u201d Therefore, in the context of the instruction given to the jury, the \u201cintent to help commit the crime\u201d and \u201cwillful participation] with the intent to make the crime succeed\u201d were presented only with respect to the charge of murder, not robbery. Put another way, the jury was instructed as to the intent requirement of aiding and abetting only with respect to the intent to kill; it was not instructed as to the intent requirement for aiding and abetting a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Yet, the jury acquitted appellant of premeditated first-degree murder and second-degree murder, thereby necessarily rejecting the proposition that appellant acted with the intent to kill Haiss, either as principal or aider and abettor. But, he was convicted of felony-murder. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the aiding and abetting instruction could suffice to explain the concept of duress in some cases, in this case we cannot know whether the jury understood that appellant would not have been guilty of felony-murder if he was a coerced participant in the robbery, because the court did not separately instruct the jury on aiding and abetting with respect to robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">A Florida case helps to illustrate the difficulty attendant here. In <em>Wright, supra, </em>402 So.2d 493, Wright was convicted of premeditated first-degree murder. Wright and her co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>defendant planned to kill a co-worker, because the co-worker \u201cknew too much\u201d about a \u201ccontract\u201d Wright\u2019s co-defendant had to kill yet another intended victim. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95. Wright and her co-defendant lured their co-worker to an isolated area, where first Wright and then the co-defendant shot the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 495. On appeal, Wright contended she did not intend to kill the victim, and that the initial shot she fired at the victim was not the fatal wound. <em>Id. </em>at 496. Her argument as to intent was that she acted under duress from her co-defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 497. Despite the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as to duress, the appellate court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>The court observed that Wright was guilty as an aider and abettor even if she did not fire the fatal shot, <em>id., </em>and that \u201cduress is not a defense to an intentional homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. In a footnote, however, the court distinguished the analysis of intent and duress with respect to premeditated murder and felony-murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">Wright was charged with ... first degree murder by premeditated design, which, of course, involves an intent to kill. Where duress is offered as a defense to first degree murder under a felony murder charge, a different question is presented, since duress is a recognized defense to the underlying felony, and the rationale of the rule prohibiting the duress defense in the crime of homicide appears inapplicable----We note, however, that in the case of intentional homicide, duress is no more available to an aider and abettor than it is to the principal, since <em>the intention of the aider and abettor to participate in the homicide </em>must be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 498-99 n. 8 (emphasis added; internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">As with the court\u2019s putative error in denying the duress instruction on the basis of appellant\u2019s conflicting statements in his interrogation, the court did not necessarily commit <em>reversible </em>error in denying the duress instruction on the ground that the concept of duress was fairly covered by the aiding and abetting instruction. Again, \u201ca trial court\u2019s decision may be correct, although for a different reason than relied on by that court.\u201d <em>Robeson, </em>285 Md. at 502, 403 A.2d 1221. The success <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of appellant\u2019s assignment of error depends on whether, in the light most favorable to him, the factual circumstances indeed gave rise to a duress defense as a matter of law. It is to that determination that we now attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The State contends that, even in the light most favorable to appellant, the evidence failed to support three of the required elements of a duress defense: (1) that the threat of death or serious bodily harm was imminent at the time the crime was committed; (2) appellant\u2019s fear was reasonable; and (3) appellant had no reasonable opportunity to escape. In response, appellant insists that \u201c[t]he threat in this case may reasonably be inferred from the totality of the circumstances, construed in the light most favorable\u201d to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We do not discern that appellant was entitled to a duress instruction. To reiterate, MPJI-CR 5:03 indicates that duress consists of four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">(1) the defendant actually believed that the duress placed [him] [her] in immediate and impending danger of death or serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">(2) the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">(3) the defendant had no reasonable opportunity for escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">(4) the defendant committed the crime because of the duress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Appellant was required to adduce at least \u201csome evidence\u201d as to each element in order to generate the instruction. <em>See Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251; <em>Marquardt, </em>164 Md.App. at 131, 882 A.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Appellant\u2019s statement to Detective Nelson that he would \u201cprobably be dead because they killing everybody\u201d plainly did not suffice to meet appellant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>burden. As the Court explained in <em>Martin, supra, </em>329 Md. 351, 619 A.2d 992, in the related context of self-defense, the issue is generated \u201c[o]nly if the record reflects, from whatever source, that, <em>at that time, </em>the defendant subjectively believed that he or she was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363, 619 A.2d 992 (emphasis added). Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>lant\u2019s statement, made a month after Haiss?s murder, during a police interrogation, to the effect that he \u201cprobably\u201d would be dead had he not cooperated with Haiss\u2019s assailants, says nothing as to whether appellant \u201cactually believed,\u201d at the time he knocked on Haiss\u2019s door, that he was in danger of death or serious bodily harm. Moreover, appellant\u2019s statement that he \u201cprobably\u201d would be dead did not address whether he believed that the threatened death or injury was imminent or impending at the time of the offense if he did not cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Similarly, we reject appellant\u2019s resort to the after-the-fact threats that S.O. allegedly made against him to ensure his silence after the murder occurred. Appellant suggests that these threats are \u201ccircumstantial evidence that indicates that [appellant] may not have voluntarily participated and had done so only under the duress of similar threats.\u201d But, under <em>Martin, </em>such <em>post hoc </em>statements cannot substitute for evidence that appellant was actually under duress at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Appellant\u2019s account of S.O.\u2019s statements to him as they drove toward Haiss\u2019s house presents a closer issue. In the interrogation, appellant informed Detective Nelson that when he initially told S.O. that he wanted \u201cnothing to do\u201d with S.O.\u2019s plan to rob Haiss, S.O. told him, \u201cman, it\u2019s GBA [guilt by association], you get down or you lay down, you gonna be with that old man in the house or you gonna leave out the house with us, which one you wanna do?\u201d In appellant\u2019s account, this statement from S.O. led him to cooperate in the robbery by knocking on Haiss\u2019s door. Taken in the light most favorable to appellant, this statement could arguably be \u201csome evidence\u201d that S.O. placed appellant in reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm if he did not cooperate, and that appellant\u2019s cooperation in Haiss\u2019s robbery was the result of this duress. In light of appellant\u2019s account, it could also be inferred that appellant had no reasonable opportunity to escape from the time S.O. made that statement until the point that S.O. and Vel entered Haiss\u2019s house, because appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>lant was under the immediate supervision of S.O. and Yel during that time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Critically, however, even according to the version of the facts most favorable to appellant, he was not under duress <em>throughout the crime. </em>According to appellant, his only role was to knock on Haiss\u2019s door. At that point, S.O. and Vel entered the house, assaulted Haiss, and left appellant outside, where (depending on which of his accounts to Detective Nelson is to be believed) appellant either ran home or waited until S.O. and Vel emerged. By his own account, the crime was ongoing, and appellant continued to aid and abet it by failing to take any step to stop it.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cA mere change of heart, flight from the crime scene, apprehension by the police, or an uncommunicated decision not to carry out his part of the scheme will not suffice\u201d to allow an aider or abettor to escape liability and withdraw from a crime. LaFave, \u00a7 13.3(d), at 691 (4th ed.2003) (footnotes omitted). Rather, \u201cit is necessary that he (1) repudiate his prior aid, or (2) do all that is possible to countermand his prior aid or counsel, and (3) do so before the chain of events has become unstoppable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). <em>Accord Sheppard v. State, </em>312 Md. 118, 124, 538 A.2d 773 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 284 &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>293-94, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). Appellant did none of these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Stated another way, even if appellant was under duress until the point that S.O. and Yel entered Haiss\u2019s house, once they did so there was no imminent or impending threat to appellant. S.O. and Vel left him outside, free to flee and to call the police. If appellant had done so, he might have cut short the robbery and averted Haiss\u2019s senseless murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Several other states require, as an explicit element of a duress defense, that the defendant\u2019s fear of imminent death or serious injury \u201c \u2018must have continued throughout the commission of the crime----\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Caine, </em>746 N.W.2d 339, 356 (Minn.2008) (citation omitted). <em>See also, e.g., Williams v. State, </em>937 So.2d 771, 772 (Fla.App.2006) (an element of duress is that \u201cthe defendant ceased the criminal conduct as soon as the necessity or apparent necessity for it ended\u201d); <em>State v. Getsy, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 180, 702 N.E.2d 866, 885 (1998) (\u201cThe force used to compel the actor\u2019s conduct must remain constant, controlling the will of the unwilling actor during the entire time he commits the act .... \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 U.S. 1042, 119 S.Ct. 2407, 144 L.Ed.2d 805 (1999); <em>State v. Davis, </em>256 Kan. 1, 883 P.2d 735, 740 (1994) (for duress defense to apply \u201cthe compulsion must be continuous\u201d). To date, Maryland courts have not addressed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The facts of this case lead us to conclude that continuity ought to be an element of the duress defense. As Professor LaFave states: \u201cThe rationale of the defense of duress is that the defendant ought to be excused when he \u2018is the victim of a threat that a person of reasonable moral strength could not fairly be expected to resist.\u2019 \u201d LaFave, \u00a7 9.7, at 491 (4th ed.2003). Although a person may be justified in participating in a felony under the threat of death or serious physical harm, the rationale for the defense of duress does not apply when the threat ceases but the felony continues. In such a situation, \u201cperson[s] of reasonable moral strength\u201d would and should take every available opportunity to stop the felony that was aided by their coerced participation. Perhaps because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>appellant\u2019s failure to do so, Hermann Haiss is dead. Appellant is not entitled to a duress defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As an additional ground for reversal of his conviction for felony-murder, appellant contends that his indictment was jurisdietionally defective because it did not charge felony-murder or the predicate felony of robbery. The indictment issued on January 12, 2006 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">The grand jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Prince George\u2019s County, on their oath do present that Nathaniel Paul McMillan on or about the 16th day of [November]<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark> Two Thousand and Five, in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland feloniously, willfully and with deliberately premeditated malice killed and murdered Hermann Sigman Haiss, against the peace, government and dignity of the State. (MURDER).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">In appellant\u2019s view, by charging that he killed Haiss \u201cfeloniously, willfully <em>and with deliberately premeditated malice </em>\u201d (appellant\u2019s emphasis), the indictment exclusively charged first-degree premeditated murder, of which appellant was acquitted by special verdict. Because the indictment did not charge felony-murder, appellant maintains that the court lacked jurisdiction to try him for that crime. According to appellant, he was convicted \u201cof a crime, felony-murder, for which he was not indicted and over which it consequently lacked jurisdiction. Mr. McMillan\u2019s sentence is therefore illegal, and this Court should vacate both his conviction and sentence despite his attorney\u2019s failure to object at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The language of appellant\u2019s indictment was drawn from C.L. \u00a7 2-208, which provides a statutory \u201cshort form\u201d for an indictment for murder or manslaughter. C.L. \u00a7 2-208 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u00a7 2-208. Charging document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">(a) <em>Contents. </em>\u2014 An indictment for murder or manslaughter is sufficient if it substantially states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201c(name of defendant) on (date) in (county) feloniously (willfully and with deliberately premeditated malice) killed (and murdered) (name of victim) against the peace, government, and dignity of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">(b) <em>Manner or means of death. </em>\u2014 An indictment for murder or manslaughter, or for being an accessory to murder or manslaughter, need not set forth the manner or means of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Appellant acknowledges that in both <em>Ross v. State, supra, </em>308 Md. 337, 519 A.2d 735 (1987), and <em>Wood v. State, </em>191 Md. 658, 62 A.2d 576 (1948), the Court of Appeals upheld convictions for felony-murder on first-degree murder indictments that used the statutory short-form language and did not specifically allege felony-murder. He insists, however, that neither <em>Ross </em>nor <em>Wood </em>forecloses his argument, because, according to appellant, the Court of Appeals did not directly address in either decision the argument he makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Further, appellant concedes that, under <em>Ross </em>and <em>Wood, </em>\u201ca general indictment for first-degree common-law murder, alleging that the defendant killed someone with a malevolent state of mind and without justification, would be constitutionally adequate to allow him to be prosecuted under any theory of first-degree murder.\u201d But, he argues that \u201c[t]he <em>Ross </em>Court never stated ... that the State may affirmatively <em>lie </em>to the defendant about the nature of the charges against him by indicting him specifically for premeditated murder and then also proceeding under a felony murder theory.\u201d He posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\">Allowing the State to remain silent about its specific theory of murder does not permit the State to go a step further and deceive the defendant. If the State chooses to specify a particular theory of the case by indicting a defendant specifically for premeditated murder and alleging that he acted with premeditation, then a court may not try the defendant for felony murder also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Moreover, appellant argues that, even if <em>Ross </em>and <em>Wood </em>would otherwise foreclose his argument, their footing in Maryland constitutional law should be reevaluated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although he concedes that federal jurisprudence on the sufficiency of indictments does not directly control in state prosecutions, appellant asserts that, as we held in <em>Bridges v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 113, 126, 695 A.2d 609 (1997), \u201c[t]he list of rights protected by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Federal Sixth Amendment are identical.... Generally speaking, those entire respective packages of rights should be construed <em>in pari maten a.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Quoting <em>Whittlesey v. State, </em>326 Md. 502, 526, 606 A.2d 225, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 894, 113 S.Ct. 269, 121 L.Ed.2d 198 (1992), appellant notes that \u201cMaryland courts repeatedly have recognized that \u2018[t]he underlying felony is an essential ingredient of felony murder.\u2019 \u201d Appellant maintains that the indictment did not set forth any of the elements of the felony he was accused of intending to commit. He observes: \u201c[I]t does not even alert the defendant that the State intends to show that he intended or attempted to commit some other unspecified offense.\u201d Further, he asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">Particularly under the <em>Apprendi </em>standard, this Court presumably would not hesitate to invalidate an indictment that alleged only that the defendant committed the offense of \u201cFelony,\u201d where that term could refer to arson, burglary, carjacking, escape, kidnapping, mayhem, rape, robbery, sexual offense, sodomy, or crimes involving destructive devices. Such a document would not give the defendant, the court, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the public any notice as to the actual nature of the pending charges, and does not identify the elements that the State will attempt to prove at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The State counters that appellant\u2019s argument is not preserved. It points out that appellant does not contest the indictment\u2019s sufficiency to charge premeditated murder, and observes that appellant was tried (although acquitted) on that offense. Therefore, the State contends that the locus of any putative error is not in the indictment, but in the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to consider felony-murder, its submission of a verdict sheet including felony-murder, or its acceptance of the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on felony-murder, all of which occurred without any objection from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Alternatively, the State posits that appellant\u2019s argument fails on the merits. It contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">[A] simple comparison of the indictment returned against McMillan with the form set out in [C.L. \u00a7 ] 2-208, demonstrates that the indictment properly followed the statutory short form for murder. The State was not required to set out the \u201cmanner and means\u201d by which the murder was committed. The short form indictment did, in fact, properly charge McMillan with first degree murder, and one of its forms is first degree felony murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Citing <em>Wood, supra, </em>191 Md. 658, 62 A.2d 576, as well as <em>Dishman, supra, </em>352 Md. 279, 721 A.2d 699, the State argues that \u201cthe statutory short form indictment is sufficient to charge first degree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder, second degree murder, and manslaughter.\u201d In its view, \u201cthe language of the particular type of first degree murder sought to be proved need not be inserted in a given case.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Conceding that he did not raise this purported defect at trial, appellant cites <em>State v. Chaney, </em>304 Md. 21, 25, 497 A.2d 152 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1067, 106 S.Ct. 824, 88 L.Ed.2d 796 (1986), for the proposition that \u201ca claim that an indictment fails to charge or characterize a crime is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time.\u201d Appellant invokes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>fundamental principle that <em>\u201c\u2018a </em>court is without power to render a verdict or impose a sentence under a charging document which does not charge an offense within its jurisdiction prescribed by common law or by statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edmund v. State, </em>398 Md. 562, 570, 921 A.2d 264 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Appellant is correct that \u201cjurisdictional challenges may be made at any time.\u201d <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 661, 837 A.2d 944 (2003). Under Maryland Rule 4-252(d) (2008), \u201c[a] motion asserting failure of the charging document to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense may be raised and determined at any time.\u201d <em>See also Williams v.

But, not every defect in a charging document is jurisdictional. The flaw in appellant\u2019s argument is that he conflates the jurisdictional and notice purposes served by an indictment. Despite appellant\u2019s attempt to cast the purported defects in his indictment as jurisdictional, the alleged defects pertain only to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim of a jurisdictional defect is grounded in his contention that \u201cthe only offense for which he was indicted in this case was premeditated murder.\u201d His assertion rests on a misunderstanding of the short-form indictment language.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">As we have seen, \u201c[mjurder is the killing of one human being by another with the requisite malevolent state of mind and without justification, excuse, or mitigation.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>308 Md. at 340, 519 A.2d 735. The <em>Ross </em>Court also observed: \u201cCourts and commentators have used the term \u2018malice\u2019 as a type of legal shorthand to embrace the elements of 1) the presence of the required malevolent state of mind, and 2) the absence of legally adequate justification, excuse, or circumstances of mitigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340 n. 1, 519 A.2d 735. <em>Ross </em>made clear that \u201ca conviction of first degree murder may be proved [in various ways,] <em>either </em>by showing deliberation, wilfullness and premeditation (premeditated murder), or by showing a homicide committed in the perpetration, or attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ed perpetration, of one of the enumerated felonies (felony murder). <em>There is but one offense </em>\u2014 murder <em>in the first degree </em>\u2014 but <em>that offense may be committed in more than one way.\u201d Id. </em>at 341-42 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Notably, C.L. \u00a7 2-208 specifically provides that the short-form indictment is \u201csufficient\u201d to charge \u201cmurder or manslaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, the short form \u201cis not the exclusive mode of pleading----This form \u2018may, but need not, be used in lieu of the common law forms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edmund, </em>398 Md. at 572, 921 A.2d 264 (citation omitted). <em>See also In re Roneika S., </em>173 Md.App. 577, 591-93, 920 A.2d 496 (2007) (discussing constitutional sufficiency of notice provided by indictment using statutory short form). If an indictment or other charging document \u201csufficiently characterize^]\u201d a crime, it is not jurisdictionally defective, even if the charging document does not \u201caver [the] essential elements\u201d of the crime. <em>Williams, </em>302 Md. at 793, 490 A.2d 1277. So long as the crime charged is plain from the \u201ccommon parlance\u201d of the charging document, the court is \u201cinvested ... with jurisdiction to try the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In <em>Wood v. State, supra, </em>191 Md. 658, 62 A.2d 576, as in this case, a criminal defendant who was convicted of murder on a felony-murder theory argued that his indictment, which \u201cfollowed precisely the language set out\u201d in the statutory short form, <em>id. </em>at 663, 62 A.2d 576, \u201ccharge[d] only premeditated murder, as distinguished from murder committed in the perpetration of a robbery____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665, 62 A.2d 576. The <em>Wood </em>Court rejected the argument,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>It is suggested ... that the parentheses around the words: \u201c(wilfully and of deliberately premeditated malice aforethought)\u201d and the words \u201c(and murder)\u201d, in [the short form], are merely illustrative, and contemplate that the language of the particular type of first degree murder, sought to be proved, should be inserted in a given case. The section, however, covers \u201cany indictment for murder or manslaughter, or for being an accessory thereto,\u201d and we think the correct explanation of the parentheses is that they were intended to indicate how the \u201cformula\u201d should be modified if the indictment is designed to cover murder in the first or second degrees [on the one hand], or manslaughter [on the other]. <em>We do not construe [the statute] to require the fact of robbery to be incorporated in an indictment as part of the crime charged </em>....

State, supra, </em>352 Md. 279, 721 A.2d 699 (1998), upon which the State relies, also provides guidance. In <em>Dish-man, </em>the Court considered whether the statutory short-form indictment provided by C.L. \u00a7 2-208 properly charged manslaughter, when it included the optional parenthetical language indicting the defendant for premeditated murder.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court observed that the purpose of the short-form indictment was to \u201c \u2018escape the excessive formalism of the common law, which formerly made the conviction or acquittal of one charged with crime so often turn upon some technical quibble rather than upon the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 721 A.2d 699 (citation omitted). Moreover, it \u201c \u2018looked with favor upon the general trend of relaxing the formal requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>indictments to avoid the prolix and often overly technical rules of common law pleading in favor of the shorter and simpler forms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 721 A.2d 699 (quoting <em>Ross, </em>308 Md. at 346, 519 A.2d 735).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The <em>Disfaman </em>Court cited several cases, including <em>Wood, </em>in which it had upheld convictions of manslaughter or non-premeditated murder based on indictments that conformed to the short form, 352 Md. at 287-89, 721 A.2d 699, and said: \u201cWhile some of these cases refer to second degree murder and manslaughter as lesser offenses of first degree murder, the language makes clear that an indictment under [the short form] alleging first degree murder also <em>charges </em>second degree murder and manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 721 A.2d 699 (emphasis in original). Declaring that any \u201cambiguity should [be] laid to rest,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 288, 721 A.2d 699, the Court stated: \u201c \u2018It is well settled that under an indictment pursuant to the statutory formula, <em>even though it spells out murder in the first degree, </em>the accused may be convicted of murder in the first degree, of murder in the second degree, or of manslaughter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 721 A.2d 699 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>State v.

The Court observed that \u201c[m]alice is, of course, an essential ingredient of murder; its presence, either directly or inferentially, must be established to sustain a conviction for the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, the Court emphasized, \u201cin ascertaining the existence of jurisdiction in the circuit court, we consider the indictment in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 497 A.2d 152. It also said: \u201cThe indictment in this case does not contain all the language set forth in [the statutory short form] for charging murder; the words \u2018felonious,\u2019 \u2018malice aforethought,\u2019 and \u2018murder\u2019 are missing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 497 A.2d 152. Nevertheless, the Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that the indictment was not jurisdictionally defective because, \u201c[i]mplicit in [its] language is that the killing was unlawful,\u201d and the indictment specifically cited the first-degree murder statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">As appellant notes, Maryland courts have occasionally observed that \u201cpremeditated murder and felony murder must be treated as separate offenses, with distinct elements, <em>for some purposes.\u201d Hagans v.

We said, <em>id. </em>at 691, 262 A.2d 69:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">[T]he fact that a murder occurred during the perpetration of one of the felonies enumerated in [the statute] determines only the degree of the crime and the penalty to be imposed. Proof of facts showing that a robbery was committed is only one of the elements of proof necessary to establish the crime of first degree murder. In effect, there is no difference between proving the felony and proving willfulness, deliberateness and premeditation in a first degree murder case under [the statute].... There is no necessity for the State to indict and convict the accused of the underlying felony of robbery to sustain a conviction of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Several of appellant\u2019s contentions are actually grounded in the notice purposes served by an indictment, as opposed to jurisdiction. Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights speaks to notice. It guarantees \u201c[t]hat in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accusations against him.... \u201d But, Article 21\u2019s command is not concerned with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A charging document may be attacked on notice grounds, \u201cfor it may ... be deficient in failing to fully inform the accused of the specific conduct with which he is charged----\u201d <em>Williams, </em>302 Md. at 793, 490 A.2d 1277. Of import here, because, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s Federal and State Constitutional rights to fair notice\u201d are not jurisdictional impediments, a notice claim may be waived by failure to file a timely motion under Rule 4-252. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 659-62, 837 A.2d 944. Under Maryland Rule 4-252(a)(2), \u201c[a] defect in the charging document other than its failure to show jurisdiction in the court or its failure to charge an offense\u201d is waived unless filed within 30 days of the first appearance of the defendant or his counsel. What the Court said in <em>Denicolis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>378 Md. at 661-62, 837 A.2d 944 (citations and footnote omitted), is apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">The argument made by petitioner in this appeal does not directly charge, much less establish, any ... jurisdictional defect ... but rather complains about the confusion that ensued from the failure of the criminal information to identify the intended victim(s). The gravamen of ... the current complaint seems to be the lack of fair notice of the nature of the charges. Unquestionably, a charging document that fails to give adequate notice of the charges is deficient and subject to dismissal. That kind of deficiency is the proper subject of a motion under Rule 4-252(a). It does not necessarily translate into the failure to show jurisdiction or to allege a criminal offense, however.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We need not decide whether the indictment gave appellant constitutionally adequate notice that he was facing a charge of felony-murder, because appellant did not object below on notice grounds. \u201cWhere the claimed defect is not jurisdictional, it must be seasonably raised before the trial court or it is waived.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>302 Md. at 792, 490 A.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Even if a notice argument were preserved, its merit is doubtful. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In <em>Ross, supra, </em>308 Md. 337, 519 A.2d 735, the Court rejected a challenge, on notice grounds, to a conviction of first-degree felony-murder on an indictment that alleged premeditated first-degree murder using the statutory short form. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 519 A.2d 735. In that case, the defendant \u201cmoved for a judgment of acquittal on the murder count on the grounds that the evidence was legally insufficient to show ... premeditated murder, and that he could not be convicted on a theory of felony murder because he was charged only with premeditated murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Morever, he \u201cinterposed a timely objection\u201d to a jury instruction on a theory of felony-murder. <em>Id. </em>In rejecting Ross\u2019s argument, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 345, 519 A.2d 735 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>A defendant charged in the statutory language employed in this case is clearly apprised that he is being charged with the crime of murder and that he may be convicted of murder in either degree, or manslaughter. That defendant is also told when and where the homicide occurred, and the identity of the victim. <em>He is not told whether the State mil proceed upon one or another, or upon several theories concerning the particular malevolent state of mind alleged to have been present, but neither is he entitled to this information as a matter of constitutional due process.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The <em>Ross </em>Court also addressed the argument that \u201cthe error is one of commission as well as omission because the indictment specifically charges the premeditated species of murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 519 A.2d 735. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 347, 519 A.2d 735:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">In this case, where there can be no doubt that the accused was aware that he was charged with murder in the first degree, and where it has been the clear and unchanged law of this State for more than 80 years that a charge of murder in this form may be made out by proof of premeditated murder or proof of felony murder, it cannot be said that Ross was misled____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Ross </em>is distinguishable, however. Unlike appellant, Ross was charged with the underlying felony of robbery, which led to his felony-murder conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 519 A.2d 735. Arguably, he had some notice that he faced liability for felony-murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Finally, although we need not address further the substance of appellant\u2019s unpreserved argument, an observation concerning <em>Apprendi </em>is in order. Appellant cites <em>Apprendi </em>for the proposition that all the elements of an offense must be charged in an indictment. <em>Apprendi </em>does not stand for that proposition, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\"><em>Apprendi </em>involved a challenge to New Jersey\u2019s \u201chate crime\u201d law, which provided, when a defendant was convicted of an underlying crime, for an \u201c \u2018extended term\u2019 of imprisonment if the trial judge [found], by a preponderance of the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that \u2018[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u2019 \u201c <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 468-69, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting statute). The Court invalidated the statute, <em>id. </em>at 491-92, 120 S.Ct. 2348, concluding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that, in state prosecutions, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The <em>Apprendi </em>Court made clear that its holding did not address indictments in state courts. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 477 n. 3, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The statements regarding indictments in <em>Apprendi </em>on which appellant relies, are quotations from <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), which was a federal prosecution. After <em>Apprendi </em>in <em>Evans v. State, </em>389 Md. 456, 886 A.2d 562 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1219, 126 S.Ct. 1442, 164 L.Ed.2d 141 (2006), the Court rejected a contention that a capital defendant\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated when he was sentenced to death after being indicted for murder via a statutory short-form indictment under C.L. \u00a7 2-208, because it did not contain the \u201caggravating factors\u201d supporting his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 472-80, 886 A.2d 562. Addressing the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi, </em>the <em>Evans </em>Court said, <em>id. </em>at 474-75, 886 A.2d 562:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">The simple answer is that, although the general requisites implicit in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment are applicable to the States through the comparable clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, any requirement implicit in the Fifth or Sixth Amendment that elements of a criminal offense be alleged in a presentment or indictment returned by a Grand Jury has been found inapplicable to State prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The <em>Apprendi </em>Court made expressly clear that it was not addressing that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>See also Baker v. State, </em>367 Md. 648, 683, 790 A.2d 629, <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1050, 122 S.Ct. 1814, 152 L.Ed.2d 817 (2002) (rejecting a challenge to a capital murder indictment on the grounds that it did not allege the death-qualifying aggravating factors that the State intended to prove).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Neither <em>Evans </em>nor <em>Baker </em>directly addressed the question of whether Article 21 requires that all elements of a crime must be articulated in a charging document. We have no occasion to pursue the question further, as appellant did not preserve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial judge\u2019s jury instruction on reasonable doubt violated the Court of Appeals\u2019s command in <em>Ruffin v. State, </em>394 Md. 355, 906 A.2d 360 (2006), that trial courts \u201cmust closely adhere to the approved pattern instruction on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, MPJI-CR 2:02.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 906 A.2d 360. Specifically, appellant points to the following sentence from the jury instructions: \u201cIt [i.e., reasonable doubt] is not a fanciful doubt, a whimsical doubt, or a capricious doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">In <em>Ruffin, </em>the trial judge deviated from the pattern instruction in several ways, among them the inclusion of the \u201cfanciful ... whimsical ... capricious\u201d sentence at issue here. <em>Id. </em>at 360-62, 906 A.2d 360.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, in 1999 the Maryland State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Bar Association\u2019s Standing Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions deleted that sentence from Maryland\u2019s pattern instruction on reasonable doubt, \u201cafter receiving numerous complaints that the language was confusing to jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 906 A.2d 360. <em>See also </em>MPJI-CR 2:02 at 18.1 (1999 Supp.) (comment to instruction explaining: \u201cIn response to concerns raised by numerous judges regarding confusion caused by this language, the committee removed this sentence from the instructioh.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The <em>Ruffin </em>Court did not directly address the propriety of the \u201cfanciful ... whimsical ... capricious\u201d sentence, or the other allegedly erroneous instructions propounded to the jury in that case. Rather, the Court declined to \u201crest [its] decision upon the particular instruction given by the trial court.\u201d 394 Md. at 363, 906 A.2d 360. Instead, the Court reevaluated its prior precedent concerning instructions on reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence, <em>id. </em>at 371-72, 906 A.2d 360, and determined: \u201cUniformity in defining those terms for the jury, by giving the pattern jury instruction, ensures that all defendants will equally receive an appropriate definition.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 906 A.2d 360. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cin every criminal jury trial, the trial court is required to [give an] instruction to] the jury on the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard of proof <em>which closely adheres to MPJI-CR 2:02. Deviations in substance will not be tolerated.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) Notably, the Court explained that its holding represented \u201ca change in a Maryland common law principle and not an overruling of prior cases on the ground that they were erroneously decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373 n. 7, 906 A.2d 360. Therefore, the Court instructed that its holding \u201cshall be applied only prospectively. In other words, today\u2019s holding \u2018applies to the instant ease[ ] ... and to all [criminal] trials commencing and trials in progress on or after the date this opinion is filed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Significantly, the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ruffin </em>was filed on August 31, 2006, and a corrected opinion was filed on September 7, 2006. The mandate was issued on October 2, 2006. The trial in the case <em>sub judice </em>began one day later, on October 3, 2006. Thus, the rule announced in <em>Ruffin </em>was applicable to this case, because the trial \u201c \u2018commenc[ed] ... on or after the date [the] opinion [in <em>Ruffin </em>was] filed,\u2019 \u201d i.e., September 7, 2006. <em>Ruffin, </em>394 Md. at 373 n. 7, 906 A.2d 360 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Appellant concedes that his trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s deviation from the pattern instruction. But, he argues that \u201cthis Court nevertheless should exercise its discretion to recognize this plain error ... and reverse his conviction.\u201d We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Ordinarily, we will not undertake appellate review of a defect in jury instructions unless a timely objection is made to the instruction. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-325(e).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <em>Ayers v. State, </em>335 Md. 602, 627-28, 645 A.2d 22 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1130, 115 S.Ct. 942, 130 L.Ed.2d 886 (1995), the Court said: \u201c[A] party who fails to object to a jury instruction at trial may not later raise the issue.... \u201d Indeed, the Court \u201chas been ... rigorous\u201d in \u201cadhering steadfastly to the preservation requirement.\u201d <em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 508, 837 A.2d 248 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 Md. 618, 846 A.2d 402 (2004). <em>See, e.g., Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 166-67, 729 A.2d 910 (noting that defendant\u2019s complaint about jury instruction was not preserved because of failure to object), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999); <em>State v. Rose, </em>345 Md. 238, 245, 691 A.2d 1314 (1997) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>general rule is that the failure to object to a jury instruction at trial results in a waiver of any defects in the instruction, and normally precludes further review of any claim of error relating to the instruction.\u201d); <em>Walker v. State, </em>343 Md. 629, 645, 684 A.2d 429 (1996) (\u201cMaryland Rule 4-325(e), as well as a multitude of cases in this Court, make it clear that the failure to object to a jury instruction ordinarily constitutes a waiver of any later claim that the instruction was erroneous\u201d); <em>Bowman v. State, </em>337 Md. 65, 67, 650 A.2d 954 (1994) (\u201c[RJeview of a jury instruction will not ordinarily be permitted unless the appellant has objected seasonably....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The policy behind the preservation rule is clear. The trial court cannot correct errors of which it is not informed. Only if a party takes exception to an error in the jury instruction does the court have the opportunity to correct it. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>310 Md. 681, 686, 531 A.2d 675 (1987). Indeed, one of the \u201ckey virtues of the preservation requirement\u201d is that it enables the trial court \u201cto correct an easily correctable mistake.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>153 Md.App. at 509, 837 A.2d 248; <em>see Bowman, </em>337 Md. at 69, 650 A.2d 954; <em>Thomas v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 97, 116, 792 A.2d 368, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 573, 801 A.2d 1033 (2002). Put another way, considerations of fairness and judicial efficiency generally require that all challenges that a party wishes to make to a trial court\u2019s ruling, action, or conduct \u201cbe presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the challenge.\u201d <em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 468, 918 A.2d 506 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">To be sure, when a defendant fails to object, an appellate court possesses \u201cplenary discretion to notice plain error material to the rights of a defendant, even if the matter was not raised in the trial court.\u201d <em>Danna v. State, </em>91 Md.App. 443, 450, 605 A.2d 150, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 627, 612 A.2d 257 (1992). But, \u201cthere are some limitations on the affirmative act of noticing error. 1) There must be error. 2) It must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>plain. 3) It must be material.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>153 Md.App. at 507 n. 1, 837 A.2d 248 (internal citations and quotations omitted). <em>See also Jones-Harris v. State, </em>179 Md.App. 72, 96-97, 943 A.2d 1272, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 Md. 64, 949 A.2d 652 (2008); <em>Stockton v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 395, 398, 668 A.2d 936 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 116, 673 A.2d 707 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">An appellate court\u2019s discretion to notice plain error is properly invoked only when the circumstances are \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980). <em>See Walker, supra, </em>343 Md. at 649, 684 A.2d 429. Several factors are pertinent to whether an appellate court should exercise its discretion to review plain error. These factors include the opportunity to use an unpreserved contention as a vehicle for illuminating an area of law; the egregiousness of the trial court\u2019s error; the impact of the error on the defendant; and the degree of lawyerly diligence or dereliction. <em>Morris, </em>153 Md.App. at 518-24, 837 A.2d 248. <em>See also Austin v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 267-72, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992). However, we need not provide \u201cjustification [ ] or explanation\u201d when we decline to take cognizance of plain error. <em>Morris, </em>153 Md.App. at 507, 837 A.2d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">None of the factors identified above moves us to exercise our discretion in this case. In <em>Morris, </em>prior to embarking on an illuminating seventeen-page exegesis on the topic of plain error review, 153 Md.App. at 507-24, 837 A.2d 248, Judge Moylan, writing for this Court, declined to take cognizance of plain error where a trial judge made an inadvertent slip of the tongue and had told the jury, without objection, that \u201cthe State is not required to prove guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506, 837 A.2d 248 (emphasis omitted). Although an appellate court may exercise its discretion to overlook non-preservation \u201csimply to seize the occasion as a vehicle to communicate a desired message to bench and bar that might otherwise go unsent,\u201d <em>Stockton, </em>107 Md.App. at 396-97, 668 A.2d 936, <em>Ruffin </em>clarified the law on the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>able doubt instruction. Therefore, this case presents no need for us to revisit the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In any event, the trial court\u2019s use of the phraseology at issue was not an egregious error. Although appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction constitutes plain error because it clearly and indisputably violates <em>Ruffin </em>by materially deviating from Pattern Instruction 2:02,\u201d the <em>Ruffin </em>Court declined to analyze the \u201cfanciful ... whimsical ... capricious\u201d sentence. Therefore, it did not hold that such phraseology alone constitutes a \u201c[d]eviation[ ] in <em>substance </em>\u201d from the approved text. <em>Ruffin, </em>394 Md. at 373, 906 A.2d 360 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Moreover, while the trial court\u2019s instruction deviated from the revised pattern instruction, it conformed to an earlier version that had been in use for many years. The sentence of which appellant complains was a part of the sanctioned text of the pattern instruction until 1999, and countless juries have convicted criminal defendants after being so instructed. Although the sentence was removed from the pattern instruction due to concern that it was confusing to juries, the Court made clear that its opinion in <em>Ruffin </em>was prospective, signaling that the revised text constituted an improvement. Notably, the Court did not determine that the sentence misstated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">What we said in <em>Stockton, </em>107 Md.App. at 397-98, 668 A.2d 936, is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">The appellant offers us no good reason why defense counsel should not have been expected to be just as current on the Maryland case law as defense counsel now suggests the trial judge should have been. It is our reliance on the professional expertise of lawyers, after all, that causes us to make such a fetish out of a defendant\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel. The defense attorney should be far better prepared on a case than the trial judge, who frequently sees it fresh on the morning of trial. With criminal defense attorneys, moreover, frequently being specialists in their field while trial judges are required to be generalists, one could argue that there is an even greater demand that counsel be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>alert to the latest nuances and oscillations in the law. There certainly should not be less demand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Appellant cites <em>Squire v. State, </em>280 Md. 132, 135, 368 A.2d 1019 (1975), as an example of a case in which Maryland courts have overlooked an attorney\u2019s failure to raise an argument at trial when it is based on a new principle of law contained in a case decided shortly before trial, and argues that we should notice plain error here because \u201c[attorneys should not be charged with knowledge of cases before they even are binding and while they are subject to reconsideration,\u201d nor should appellant be \u201cpenalize[d] ... for his attorney\u2019s lack of such knowledge.\u201d We do not see <em>Squire </em>as analogous to this situation. The trial judge in <em>Squire </em>instructed the jury, in accordance with previously controlling law and applicable jury instructions, that the defendant had the burden of proof on the issue of self-defense. The instruction was propounded mere days after the Supreme Court unequivocally decided, in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), that the prosecution is constitutionally required to negate self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In contrast, it was readily apparent at the trial in this case that the court\u2019s instruction deviated from the pattern instruction; the offending sentence was removed from the pattern instruction in 1999 \u2014 several years prior to the trial in 2006. We perceive no basis to disturb appellant\u2019s conviction on the basis of the trial court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

The DVD recording of the interview was entered into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 12. However, the portions of the DVD that were played for the jury were not transcribed by the court reporter. Instead, the trial transcript contains notations of the exact start and end times of the portions that were played for the jury. By Order issued March 3, 2008, this Court ordered that the record on appeal be supplemented with a copy of the DVD. In our factual summary, we have included certain portions of appellant\u2019s statement, gleaned from the DVD entered into evidence.

At present, there is no definitive answer under Maryland law as to which unenumerated felonies may elevate a homicide to second-degree murder. <em>See generally </em>Moylan, \u00a7 5.1 at 107-114. But, there is at least an \"arguable requirement that a felony must be \u2018dangerous to human life\u2019 in order to qualify for the common law felony-murder doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. <em>See Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706 (2001). In any event, so-called \u201csecond-degree felony-murder\u201d is not invoked here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">. Several stales have abolished the felony-murder doctrine altogether, either by statute or judicial decision. <em>See generally </em>W.E. Shipley, <em>Judicial Abrogation of Felony-Murder Doctrine, </em>13 A.L.R.4th 1226 (1982, 2008 Supp.). Maryland has not done so, and appellant does not question the vitality of the felony-murder doctrine in Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\">. Several other jurisdictions have recognized the issue, some with favorable dicta on the proposition that duress may be a defense to felony-murder, but have not definitively resolved the issue. <em>See, e.g., Wright, supra, </em>402 So.2d at 498 n. 8; <em>State v. Proctor, </em>585 N.W.2d 841, 844 (Iowa 1998); <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 415 N.E.2d 805, 813 n. 14 (1981); <em>State v.

To be sure, an appellate court should be cautious when deploying this precept. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994), the Court commented that an appellate court\u2019s \"discretion\u201d to overlook a lower court's error \"should be exercised only when it is clear that it will not work an unfair prejudice to the parties or to the court.\u201d <em>See also id. </em>at 189 n. 5, 638 A.2d 107. We discern no unfair prejudice here. Among other things, although the trial court did not give a duress instruction, the defense was permitted to argue a duress-like theory to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\">. We observe that the form of S.O.'s statement to appellant that \u201cyou gonna be with that old man in the house or you gonna leave out the house with us,\u201d if it is understood as a threat, significantly undercuts a duress defense because it equivocates between the harm that S.O. intended would come to Haiss, and the threatened harm that S.O. would inflict on appellant if he did not cooperate. If the statement is understood as a threat to appellant that he would suffer death or serious bodily injury if he did not cooperate, it must also be understood as a statement that S.O. intended to kill or seriously injure Haiss. If appellant participated in Haiss\u2019s robbery knowing that his co-felons intended to kill Haiss, the defense of duress would be unavailable. Nevertheless, it is possible to understand the statement as a threat that Haiss would be seriously injured, and that appellant would be seriously injured as well if he did not cooperate. Thus, while the form of S.O.\u2019s statement undercuts a duress defense, it does not necessarily negate the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[15]\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">15.
