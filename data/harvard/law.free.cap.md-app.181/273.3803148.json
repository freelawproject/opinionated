Walter (\u201cRobert\u201d) challenges a ruling by the Circuit Court for Frederick County granting indefinite alimony, incident to a limited divorce, to Susan L. Walter (\u201cSusan\u201d), his wife, and awarding Susan attorneys\u2019 fees. He poses four questions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for review, which we have consolidated and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>I. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion by granting indefinite alimony to Susan in a proceeding for limited divorce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">II. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Susan?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">For the following reasons, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court on indefinite alimony and remand the case to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion; and we shall vacate the attorneys\u2019 fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Robert and Susan were married on November 24, 1979. Their marriage produced two children: Alison, born in 1982, and Sophia, born in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Before marrying, the parties each had attended college and earned a bachelor of science degree in marketing. For the first eight years of their marriage, the parties moved from state to state, depending upon the job market. Robert had a number of jobs that he lost. Although Susan was working as well, Robert was earning more money than she was, so the couple\u2019s moves usually were determined by Robert\u2019s job opportunities. Robert\u2019s jobs first were in teaching and then were in chemical sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In 1987, Robert\u2019s job brought the family to Frederick, Maryland, where they settled and stayed. During some periods when the children were young, Susan remained at home; for the most part, however, she worked outside the home in marketing and furniture sales. She also worked in the insurance industry for a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">In 1994, Robert formed his own company, AntiEntropics, Inc. Since the company\u2019s inception, it has been run from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>family home. Robert spends most of his work time out of the house at clients\u2019 work sites.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">During the marriage, the parties lived a comfortable lifestyle. They purchased a house in a nice suburban neighborhood. They accumulated some stocks. Each has an IRA, although the record is scanty on that point. The parties do not have any savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">It was undisputed that, in 1996, Susan accused Robert of abusing the children (then ages 14 and 9), and made a report to that effect to the local child welfare authorities. The authorities conducted an investigation and determined that there had been no abuse. The abuse allegation against Robert was closed as \u201cruled out.\u201d Susan acknowledged in her testimony that, from then on, there was a rift between the parties \u201cthat\u2019s really never been cured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In 2005, Robert admitted to Susan that he had had a number of extramarital affairs, beginning in 2001. He claimed to have started to engage in that behavior after Susan told him repeatedly that she did not want to stay married to him. Susan acknowledged in her testimony that the parties had discussed getting divorced on a number of occasions before they separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">On June 18, 2005, the parties separated, by agreement. Susan moved to Logodi, Indiana, where she has extended family. She started working as a sales associate at Englert\u2019s, a furniture store. She moved into a two-bedroom house, with a yard. Robert remained in the family home. By then, Alison was 23 and no longer living at home. Sophia was 18. She chose to continue living in the family home with Robert. She moved out of the family home in September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">On June 20, 2005, two days after moving, Susan filed a complaint for limited divorce on the ground of voluntary separation. She requested alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>indefinite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>alimony, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Robert filed a timely answer. The case proceeded through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Since the separation, Robert has paid the mortgage, taxes, and insurance on the family home and all of the expenses related to the home\u2019s upkeep. That total cost is $2,534.97 per month. Prom June 2005 through March 2006, Robert sent Susan $500 per month. The parties sought to achieve an amicable divorce, by negotiation through counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In March 2006, the parties reached an impasse in their efforts to achieve a settlement. Robert stopped sending money to Susan at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On November 9, 2006, the case went to a merits hearing on the issues of limited divorce, alimony, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Both parties testified. Only one witness was called to corroborate the parties\u2019 voluntary separation. The parties each introduced into evidence a Rule 9-203(a) financial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In addition, Susan moved into evidence checking account statements for AntiEntropics, from January 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006; a typed list of deposits made into that account during the same time period; checking account statements for Robert from June 22, 2005, through September 20, 2006; a typed list of the deposits made into that account during that same time period; Susan\u2019s pay stub from Englert\u2019s for the week ending October 29, 2006; joint checking account statements for Robert and Susan from December 9, 2004, through January 10, 2006; and a typed list of the deposits made into that account during that same time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">After the evidence was closed and the lawyers had presented argument, the trial judge ruled from the bench. She granted Susan a limited divorce, on the ground of voluntary separation; awarded Susan indefinite alimony of $1,500 per month, retroactive to April 6, 2006; established an alimony arrearage of $10,500, entered as a judgment against Robert; and awarded Susan $6,425.92 in attorneys\u2019 fees. On December 2, 2006, the court entered a judgment memorializing its ruling. Robert noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>We shall include additional facts as relevant to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\n<em>Alimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Robert challenges the trial court\u2019s award of indefinite alimony to Susan on three bases: a) the court \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d and made clearly erroneous factual findings when considering his financial resources and needs; b) the court erred and abused its discretion by awarding indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce; and c) the court\u2019s \u201cunconscionable disparity\u201d finding was clearly erroneous. Because we agree with Robert\u2019s first argument, that the court made certain clearly erroneous factual findings, we shall vacate the alimony award and remand the matter for further proceedings. We shall address Robert\u2019s second argument for guidance on remand. The nature of the error we have found is such that we need not address the third basis for Robert\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\n<em>Assertions of Clear Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 2006 RepLVol., 2007 Supp.), section 11 \u2014 106(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d), in deciding whether to make an award of alimony and, if so, in what amount, a circuit court must consider \u201call factors necessary for a fair and equitable award,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">(1) the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">(2) the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">(3) the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-14\">(4) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>(5) the contributions, monetary and non-monetary, of each party to the wellbeing of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(6) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(7) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(8) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(9) the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">(10) any agreement between the parties; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(11) the financial needs and resources of each party, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">(i) all income and assets, including property that does not produce income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">(ii) any award made under \u00a7\u00a7 8-205 and 8-208 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">(iii) the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">(iv) the right of each party to receive retirement benefits....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">\n<em>Id</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>3</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">Ever since the adoption of the Maryland Alimony Act in 1980, alimony may be awarded either for a fixed term (often called rehabilitative alimony) or for an indefinite term. When alimony is awarded, the law prefers that the award be for a fixed term. <em>See Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 391, 614 A.2d 590 (1992); <em>Whittington v. Whittington, </em>172 Md.App. 317, 336, 914 A.2d 212 (2007). The court has discretion, however, to award indefinite alimony in exceptional cases when one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>two circumstances described in subsection (c) of FL section 11-106 has been shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">(1) due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot reasonably be expected to make substantial progress toward becoming self-supporting; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">(2) even after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"><em>See Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 195-96, 857 A.2d 1109 (2004); <em>Whittington, supra, </em>172 Md.App. at 337-38, 914 A.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In the case at bar, the court ruled from the bench and made findings with respect to all of the applicable FL section 11-106(b) factors. The particular findings that Robert contests on appeal, and that are pertinent to his argument, relate to factors (9) and (11). Specifically, Robert argues that, on the court\u2019s own factual findings, he does not have the financial resources to enable him to take care of his own needs and pay the alimony that was awarded to Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The evidence at trial was undisputed that Robert\u2019s income from AntiEntropics is and was highly variable and not always sufficient to meet the family\u2019s needs. For example, in 2000, the business did poorly, and in 2001 it did especially poorly, losing over $50,000. The latter year was so bad financially that the family had to \u201ccut back\u201d on a number of personal and household expenses and depend upon Susan\u2019s income, which at that time was $33,000 annually. It also was undisputed that, although AntiEntropics performed well in 2003 and very early 2004, business \u201cdried up\u201d for the rest of 2004. Performance improved in 2005 and 2006. The court found that the stresses of living with financial uncertainty contributed to the problems in the parties\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Robert testified that at the time of trial he was earning a little more than $30,000 per year from AntiEntropics. The judge rejected that evidence, upon a finding that, in order to be paying the $2,500+ per month in housing costs that he in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>fact was paying, Robert had to be <em>netting </em>at least $30,798 per year in income; and that would mean he likely was <em>grossing </em>at least $48,000 in yearly income. The court imputed an additional $26,000 in yearly gross income to Robert, above and beyond the $30,000+ annual gross income figure he had testified to, and found his current annual gross income from AntiEntropics to be $56,000. That figure translates into a monthly gross income of $4,667.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The court found that Susan\u2019s present gross income from her job in furniture sales is $21,400 per year. On that finding, Susan\u2019s monthly gross income is $1,798.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">There was no testimony about the amount of income Robert had earned in the years in which AntiEntropics performed well. Robert was not asked questions about his past income on direct examination, cross-examination, or by the court. He testified that, in 2004, the company\u2019s gross receipts were between $300,000 and $400,000. There was no evidence presented about the relationship between the company\u2019s gross receipts and Robert\u2019s earnings. During her ruling, the trial judge commented that the deposits into AntiEntropics\u2019s checking account were $168,122.35, in 2005, and $127,280.94, in the first nine months of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">On the expense side, the court found, as stated above and as was undisputed, that Robert pays slightly more than $2,500 per month for the debt, taxes, and upkeep for the family home, and will continue to do so during the period of limited divorce, however long that shall be. The court made no mention of any other expenses for Robert, nor did it reference his financial statement, which was in evidence, and which listed all of his monthly expenses. The court expressly considered Susan\u2019s living expenses, which totaled $4,209 per month, as set forth in her financial statement, which also was in evidence. (Susan testified that some of her expenses were listed based upon what she actually was spending but some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>were listed based upon what she used to spend.) The court eliminated or reduced several of Susan\u2019s listed expenses. For example, Susan\u2019s financial statement estimated her food consumption at $600 per month. The court reduced that figure to $400 per month (which was the same figure Robert had given monthly for food in his financial statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Several of the court\u2019s FL section ll-106(b) findings are not challenged on appeal: that the parties had been married 27 years; that Robert is 49 and Susan is 50; that the parties are in good mental and physical health; that there was no agreement between the parties; that Susan\u2019s present annual income of $21,400 makes her \u201cpartly self-supporting\u201d; and that Robert made significant monetary and non-monetary contributions to the marriage and Susan made significant non-monetary contributions to the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The court also found that Robert\u2019s financial resources are such that he can afford to pay alimony of $1,500 per month (the amount requested by Susan\u2019s counsel) while meeting his own needs. Robert maintains that that finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Apparently as part of its decision about the period of time in which to award alimony, if at all, the court made findings about the parties\u2019 earnings <em>potentials. </em>Based upon Susan\u2019s past earnings history, the court found that she has the potential to earn $40,000 per year, and that, with that income, she will be \u201clargely self-supporting.\u201d The court found that Robert has the potential to earn between $100,000 and $120,000 per year from AntiEntropies. Robert also challenges the latter finding for clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\n<em>1. Robert\u2019s ability to pay $1,500 in alimony per month to meet Susan\u2019s needs while meeting his own needs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We agree with Robert that the court\u2019s own calculation of his current yearly income did not support a reasonable finding that he is able to pay $1,500 per month in alimony to Susan and at the same time meet his own needs. As explained above, the court found, by imputation, that Robert was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>earning $ 56,000 annually, which is a gross monthly income of $4,667, and that Susan\u2019s current yearly income was $21,400, which is a gross monthly income of $1,798.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">It further found that Robert pays $2,500+ per month to maintain the family home, which is the parties\u2019 primary marital asset. Of Robert\u2019s remaining approximately $2,167 in gross monthly income, the court ordered him to pay $1,500 per month in alimony to Susan. Robert\u2019s remaining gross monthly income was $667.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">There was some evidence about the sources, other than AntiEntropics, of Robert\u2019s deposits into his checking account, but none that would support a finding that he was regularly receiving income greater than the $56,000 determined by the court. Those income sources were money withdrawn from an IRA, a $8,000 home equity loan, and a gift of $10,000 from Robert\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">For purposes of this issue we shall assume that the trial court\u2019s finding imputing a total yearly income for Robert of $56,000 was factually correct. As Susan points out, the court also found that some of Robert\u2019s monthly expenses are paid for by his company, as they are in whole or in part business expenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even excluding those expenses (such as the cost of gas, telephone, automobile, and other business-related expenses), however, on the court\u2019s factual findings on income, Robert must meet all of his remaining ordinary living expenses \u2014 such as food, clothing, prescriptions \u2014 with $667 per month. And, again, that sum is a gross income amount that does not account for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Viewed otherwise, the alimony award as fashioned by the court produced a $38,004 yearly gross income for Robert and a $39,576 yearly gross income for Susan. At the same time, the court directed that Robert continue to bear full responsibility for paying $30,000+ per year to maintain the marital home. These figures make plain that the court\u2019s finding that Robert can pay $1,500 in alimony to Susan per month and still meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>his needs is clearly erroneous. The competent and material evidence in the record does not support such a finding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>2. Robert\u2019s potential future annual income of $100,000 to $120,000.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Robert also complains that the court clearly erred in finding as a matter of fact that he has the potential to earn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>$100,000 to $120,000 annually. That finding was made in the course of the court\u2019s ruling that the alimony award would be indefinite. We agree with this assertion of clear error as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The court\u2019s reasoning respecting Robert\u2019s potential income was as follows. As noted, the bank deposits for AntiEntropics were $168,122.35 for 2005 and $127,280.94 for the first nine months of 2006. The court extrapolated the 2006 deposits from 9 months to 12 months, and then roughly divided the yearly deposits for AntiEntropics by the present income figure it already had ascribed to Robert \u2014 $56,000 per year. On that basis, the court found that Robert annually earns in income approximately one-third of the amount of the money deposited to AntiEntropics in a given year. The court then applied that one-third percentage to the gross receipts Robert had testified about for 2004 (between $300,000 and $400,000), and arrived at an annual potential income figure for him of $100,000 to $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">These findings, including the ultimate potential income finding, are flawed in several respects. First, there was no competent material evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s threshold finding that, because Robert was paying expenses of $2,500+ per year, he could not be earning the $30,000 yearly he had testified to and he had to have been earning at least $48,000 yearly. The evidence established, as we have mentioned, that, during the pertinent time frame, Robert had certain non-recurring sources of income not connected to his earnings from AntiEntropics: a gift from his father; a withdrawal from his IRA; and the proceeds of a home equity loan. Any or all of those sources of income could account for Robert\u2019s ability to pay the monthly $2,500 + expenses associated with the family home notwithstanding his stated income. The finding the court relied upon to impute income to Robert beyond the $30,000 yearly income he was claiming was not supported by record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Second, given the absence of factual support for that threshold finding about present income, the evidence could not rationally support the court\u2019s further finding that Robert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>yearly earnings equal about one-third of the sum that AntiEntropics receives annually in deposits. And, third, a projected income finding, as required for purposes of determining whether an alimony award shall be made indefinite, <em>see Roginsky v. Blake-Roginsky, </em>129 Md.App. 132, 146, 740 A.2d 125 (1999) (cited with approval in <em>Solomon, supra, </em>383 Md. at 195 n. 15, 857 A.2d 1109), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 Md. 164, 747 A.2d 645 (2000) ),.is not necessarily equal to a party\u2019s prior highest past earnings. The court was required to determine, based on the evidence and not on speculation, what Robert had earned in the past and was earning presently, and to project forward, using all of the past and present evidence, not by using only one part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">As we shall discuss in the next section of this opinion, we are remanding this case to the circuit court for further proceedings. At that time, the parties may introduce additional evidence on the issue of both of their earnings, past and present, including evidence that is up-to-date. If, from that evidence, the court can make findings about current and projected income for the parties that is not speculation or guesswork, then it may exercise its discretion to make an alimony award. It is incumbent that the party seeking alimony, whether rehabilitative or indefinite, move forward with evidence to allow the court to make the factual findings necessary to an alimony determination. <em>Francz v. Francz, </em>157 Md.App. 676, 692, 853 A.2d 839 (2004); <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>147 Md.App. 350, 389, 809 A.2d 18 (2002). The state of the record in this appeal is not such as to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings about current and projected or potential income for Robert. For this reason, and the reason discussed above in subsection 1, we shall vacate the court\u2019s indefinite alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\n<em>Indefinite Alimony Incident to the Grant of a Limited Divorce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Robert argues that the trial court erred in granting indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce. As we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>explain, we conclude that a circuit court is authorized to grant indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce. We reject, however, Susan\u2019s argument that not only may indefinite alimony be awarded incident to a limited divorce but also an award of indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce continues, automatically, beyond the time of a later-granted absolute divorce, unless the recipient spouse makes a showing of hardship, as required to modify an alimony award. We hold instead that, when indefinite alimony is granted incident to a limited divorce, and the parties then obtain an absolute divorce, all issues of alimony, including the length of any award, must be decided <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In Maryland, divorce is and always has been a creature of statute. Until 1841, only the General Assembly had the power to grant a divorce. That year, the legislature enacted the first law conferring authority upon the courts (specifically, equity courts) to grant divorces, both absolute and limited. 1841 Md. Laws, Chap. 263.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">An absolute divorce (a <em>vinculo </em>matrimonii) terminates the marriage, severing all legal ties between the parties that are a function of marriage and entitling \u201ceither of the parties, or both to remarry.\u201d <em>Ricketts v. Ricketts, </em>393 Md. 479, 487, 903 A.2d 857 (2006). By contrast, a limited divorce (a <em>mensa et </em>thoro) does not end the marriage. It is a divorce only \u201cfrom bed and board,\u201d that is, a legal acknowledgment that the parties, although married, are living apart. <em>Id. See </em>John F. Fader, II &amp; Richard J. Gilbert, Maryland Family Law, \u00a7 4-2 at 4-3 (4th ed.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As divorce of any kind exists in Maryland only by statute, a court is limited in granting a divorce to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>grounds enumerated in the law. <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>294 Md. 605, 610, 451 A.2d 1215 (1982). For almost a century after Maryland equity courts became empowered to grant divorces, all grounds for divorce, whether absolute or limited, were fault-based.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In 1937, with respect to absolute divorce, the legislature first enacted a ground that was not fault-based: voluntary separation for five years, without cohabitation and with no reasonable hope of reconciliation. 1937 Md. Laws, Chap. 396. In 1961, the legislature reduced the voluntary separation period to 18 months, 1961 Md. Laws, Chap. 104, and, in 1969, it adopted as a new ground for absolute divorce what became known as \u201cinvoluntary separation\u201d <em>(ie., </em>separation not by consent) for five years, also without cohabitation and with no reasonable hope of reconciliation. 1969 Md. Laws, Chap. 656. In 1973, the time period for obtaining an absolute divorce by voluntary separation was reduced to one year and by involuntary separation to three years. 1973 Md. Laws, Chap. 699.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ultimately, the involuntary separation period was reduced to two years. 1984 Md. Laws, Chap. 296, \u00a7 2; ch. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">With respect to limited divorce, until 1973, all grounds were fault-based. That year, the legislature added voluntary separation, without cohabitation and with no reasonable hope of reconciliation, as a ground for a limited divorce. It did not impose a minimum separation period for that ground. 1973 Md. Laws, Chap. 95.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Unlike the power to grant a divorce, which was not judicially authorized until 1841, Maryland equity courts always have had the power to grant alimony. <em>See Galwith v. Galwith, 4 </em>H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>&amp; McH. 477, 478 (1689) (holding by Provincial Court of Maryland that alimony was recoverable either in \u201cChancery or in a Court of the Ordinary\u201d). Maryland\u2019s first alimony statute, adopted by the Acts of 1777, Chap. 22, merely confirmed the previously existing inherent authority of equity courts over alimony. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>294 Md. at 614, 451 A.2d 1215. So, after judicial divorces were authorized in 1841, a wife continued to be able to obtain an award of alimony,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> even though no divorce was being sought. The Court of Appeals subsequently held, under the alimony statute, that, to obtain alimony, a spouse must be able to show facts that would entitle him or her to an absolute or limited divorce, even if a divorce were not being sought. <em>Bender v. Bender, </em>282 Md. 525, 529-30, 386 A.2d 772 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In 1980, upon the recommendation of the Governor\u2019s Commission on Domestic Relations Law, legislation was enacted that revamped the law of alimony in Maryland. It changed the focus of alimony away from providing a \u201clifetime pension\u201d and instead toward \u201ceas[ing] the transition ... from the joint married state to [the parties\u2019] new status as single people living apart and independently.\u201d <em>Tracey, supra, </em>328 Md. at 391, 614 A.2d 590. <em>See also Whittington, supra, </em>172 Md.App. at 336, 914 A.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Under the new Alimony Act, the circuit courts were granted statutory authority to award alimony either on a complaint for alimony or as part of a decree granting an annulment, a limited divorce, or an absolute divorce. FL \u00a7 ll-101(a). Before granting any form of alimony, however, the court would have to consider the non-exclusive list of factors enumerated in FL section 1 l-106(b). <em>Simonds v. Simonds, </em>165 Md.App. 591, 604-05, 886 A.2d 158 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The year after passage of the Alimony Act, the legislature revamped the law of marital property, also upon the recommendation of the Governor\u2019s Commission on Domestic Relations Law. Before the new Marital Property Act was enacted, the property of the spouses was distributed by title upon divorce. Also, prior to the change in the law, the court, in granting a limited divorce, had \u201cfull power to award to the wife such property or estate as she had when married, or the value of the same, or of such part ... as the court may deem reasonable.\u201d 1841 Md. Laws, Chap. 262, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">By enacting the new Marital Property Act, the legislature recognized in Maryland the concept of \u201cmarital property\u201d and provided for equitable distribution of marital property upon divorce. It also changed the law with respect to distribution of property at the time of a limited divorce. Pursuant to the new law, the court may distribute marital property only in connection with an annulment or absolute divorce, and not in connection with a limited divorce. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 8-203(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Due to the timing of the various statutory changes in the law of divorce, alimony, and property distribution, there was a period, from 1973 to 1979, when a spouse could immediately obtain a limited divorce on the ground of voluntary separation and at the same time be granted permanent alimony and a distribution of property. After the Alimony and Marital Property Acts were passed, however, the court no longer had the authority to make a distribution of property upon the grant of a limited divorce. It retained authority to award alimony upon the grant of a limited divorce but its decision had to be made in accordance with the factors set forth in FL section 11 \u2014 106(b) (formerly Md.Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol.) Article 16, \u00a7 1), and the new focus upon encouraging rehabilitation instead of providing a lifetime pension. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 11-101(a)(2)(h) (alimony may be awarded pursuant to a limited divorce); <em>Whittington, supra, </em>172 Md.App. at 336, 914 A.2d 212 (alimony determination must consider law\u2019s preference for rehabilitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Since 1980, there has been a dearth of published opinions in Maryland in which alimony was sought or granted incident to a limited divorce.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The likely reason is that, under the newly revised Alimony and Marital Property Acts, not only were the courts no longer authorized to make property distributions upon the grant of a limited divorce but also the judicial decision-making about whether to award alimony, and if so, what form of alimony, became intertwined with the judicial decision-making about equitable distribution of marital property. The statutory factors for each such award include consideration of whether the other award has or is being granted. Indeed, it is for that very reason that the cases are legion holding that, when a Maryland appellate court vacates an alimony award and remands the matter for further proceedings, it also should vacate any marital property award, and vice versa, as the two are inextricably linked. <em>See, e.g., Caccamise v. Caccamise, </em>130 Md.App. 505, 524, 747 A.2d 221, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 29, 753 A.2d 2 (2000); <em>Campolattaro v. Campolattaro, </em>66 Md.App. 68, 75, 502 A.2d 1068 (1986); <em>Cotter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>v. Cotter, </em>58 Md.App. 529, 542, 473 A.2d 970, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 794, 481 A.2d 239 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In the case at bar, Robert maintains that the circuit court lacks authority to award indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce because the two are conceptually incompatible. As we have explained above, however, the judicial authority to grant indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce is expressly conferred, in general terms, by FL section ll-101(a). Moreover, the particular statute authorizing the grant of a limited divorce states that such a divorce may be \u201cfor a limited time or for an indefinite time,\u201d FL \u00a7 7-102(c). (Unlike an absolute divorce, a limited divorce may be revoked upon the joint application of the parties. FL \u00a7 7-102(d).) A limited divorce and an award of indefinite alimony attendant to it are not incompatible concepts. In the family law context, \u201cindefinite\u201d does not mean \u201cpermanent.\u201d Rather, it means only that the award is not \u201cfixed term\u201d or rehabilitative, that is, for a defined (\u201cdefinite\u201d) period of time. <em>See Long v. Long, </em>129 Md.App. 554, 585-86, 743 A.2d 281 (2000) (indefinite alimony is not \u201cetched in stone. At best, it is written in chalk on slate, subject to being erased by the appropriate court order.\u201d (Quoting <em>Hofmann, supra, </em>50 Md. App. at 245, 437 A.2d 247.) Thus, an award of alimony during a limited divorce can be indefinite, in that it is not for a fixed period that is a subset of the entire period of the limited divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Although the circuit court indeed is authorized to award indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce, we see no merit in the argument Susan advances, which is that, once indefinite alimony is awarded in that context, it necessarily continues beyond the point at which an absolute divorce is granted unless the paying party can prove that he or she is entitled to modification, under FL section 11-107, or termination, under FL section 11-108. Because this issue has been addressed by the parties on appeal and surely will resurface on remand, we shall decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>As explained, when granting a limited divorce, a circuit court is not empowered to distribute the spouses\u2019 marital property. FL \u00a7 8-203(a) (division of marital property authorized only upon annulment or absolute divorce). The equitable distribution of property decision, pursuant to FL sections 8-201 <em>et seq., </em>only can be made in tandem with a grant of an annulment or an absolute divorce, and involves findings, such as valuations, that must be fixed to the time of the annulment or absolute divorce. FL \u00a7 8-204(a); <em>see Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 348, 664 A.2d 453 (1995).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> FL section 8-205(b) lists the factors a court must consider in deciding how to dispose of marital property, including whether to grant a monetary award to adjust the equities of the parties, to transfer an ownership interest in a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or, subject to the consent of lienholders, family use personal property and/or real property jointly owned and used as the parties\u2019 principal residence during the marriage. Those factors include \u201c(3) the economic circumstances of each party at the time the [monetary] award [if any] is to be made\u201d; \u201c(10) any award of alimony ...; and (11) any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award [or transfer of an interest in a pension or retirement account].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Just as the FL section 8-205(b) factors make express reference to any companion decision about alimony, the factors that must be considered in deciding whether to grant an alimony award, listed in FL ll-106(b), likewise include \u201c(11) the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including ... (ii) any award made under \u00a7 [ ] 8-205 ... of this article[,]\u201d which is a monetary award that only can be made in conjunction with the grant of an annulment or absolute divorce. As we already have said, it is because the equitable distribution/monetary award decision and the alimony decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>are interdependent that the vacation of one on appeal ordinarily will require the vacation of the other. <em>See Campolattaro, supra, </em>66 Md.App. at 75, 502 A.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Whether a paying party is seeking to modify an award of alimony, under FL section 8-107, or to terminate it, under FL section 11-108, that party bears the burden of proof on the modification or termination question. <em>See Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 516, 784 A.2d 1086 (2001), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 539, 873 A.2d 1122 (2005); <em>Ridgeway v. Ridgeway, </em>171 Md.App. 373, 384, 910 A.2d 503 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 Md. 526, 914 A.2d 769 (2007). In other words, the alimony award will continue in the amount and for the time awarded (including indefinitely) unless the paying party moves successfully for modification or termination. <em>See Long, supra, </em>129 Md.App. at 585-86, 743 A.2d 281. Given that that is the case, it would defy logic, and the harmonious interpretation of the Family Law Article statutes we just have discussed, for an award of indefinite alimony, in conjunction with a limited divorce, to continue in effect after the court has granted the same parties an absolute divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The caselaw is clear that a party seeking an alimony award upon the grant of an absolute divorce bears the burden of proof. If an alimony award granted incident to a limited divorce were to continue automatically, beyond the period of the limited divorce, unless the paying party met his or her burden to prove that a modification or termination should be granted, the burden of proof would no longer be on the seeking/payee party. Rather, in conjunction with an absolute divorce, the paying party would bear the burden of proving that alimony should not be granted, or that a lesser amount of alimony should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Susan\u2019s modification/termination argument would undermine the clear legislative intent behind those provisions in FL sections 8-205 and 11-106 that require the circuit court to consider rulings on equitable disposition/monetary award when deciding whether to grant alimony, and vice versa. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>impossible for a court to consider equitable distribution/monetary award rulings when granting alimony incident to a limited divorce, as the court has no power to decide those property disposition issues at that juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Accordingly, for these reasons we hold that an award of indefinite alimony incident to a limited divorce must terminate when the limited divorce has ended upon the grant of an absolute divorce; and a decision to grant alimony incident to the grant of an absolute divorce, after a period of limited divorce that included an indefinite alimony award, is not to be made by means of a modification or termination standard, but by consideration of the factors set forth in FL section 11-106, with the burden of proof on the party seeking alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\n<em>Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Because we are vacating the circuit court\u2019s indefinite alimony award, made incident to the grant of a limited divorce, and remanding the matter for further proceedings, we also shall vacate the court\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee award. <em>See Freedenburg v. Freedenburg, </em>123 Md.App. 729, 742, 720 A.2d 948 (1998) (because an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is so \u201cinterrelated and intertwined\u201d with an award of property or alimony, vacation of the alimony award ordinarily requires vacation of the attorneys\u2019 fee award); <em>Doser, supra, </em>106 Md.App. at 335-36 n. 1, 664 A.2d 453.

Robert also complains that the court committed clear error in its findings about the standard of living the parties established during the marriage and about the reasons for the estrangement of the parties. With respect to the former, the court found from the testimony that \"these parties enjoyed a very comfortable and probably what would be colloquially characterized as a[sic] upper-middle class standard of living.\u201d Later in her opinion, the court stated, \"Until [Susan] left the home in June of 2005, ... [the couple] did enjoy a very nice and comfortable standard of living, that they together established during the marriage.\u201d Robert takes issue with the finding that the parties\u2019 standard of living was \"upper-middle class.\u201d From our review of the record, we cannot say that the court\u2019s findings about the parties\u2019 standard of living were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">With respect to the reasons for the estrangement of the parties, the court\u2019s findings were somewhat abstruse.

On appeal, Robert complains that the court ignored the fact that Susan had reported him to the authorities for child abuse in assessing the reasons for the break-down of the marriage, even though the evidence was uncontested and Susan acknowledged that the abuse report caused a rift between the parties that never was bridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">It is not clear to us, from the ruling as quoted above, whether the court was taking that evidence into account in its discussion of Robert\u2019s extra-marital relationships. His assignment of error, however, is of no moment given our vacation of the court\u2019s ruling and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">. In England, divorce was not recognized in the common law, but the ecclesiastical courts were empowered to grant limited divorces and support attendant to a limited divorce.

We agreed with the assertion of clear error and vacated the child support award. The husband also challenged the alimony award.
