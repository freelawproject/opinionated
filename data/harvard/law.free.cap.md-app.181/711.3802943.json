EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Michael Worsham, appellant, appeals from the grant of various motions to dismiss<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his amended complaint in favor of Robert Ehrlich (\u201cEhrlich\u201d), James Reilly (\u201cReilly\u201d), David Craig (\u201cCraig\u201d), and Rudolph Giuliani (\u201cGiuliani\u201d), appellees, in the Circuit Court for Harford County. The amended complaint alleged violations of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227, <em>et. seq. </em>(\u201cTCPA\u201d), and the Maryland Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Maryland Code (2005 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-3201 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cMDTCPA\u201d), and sought damages and injunctive relief. The alleged violations of the TCPA and the MDTCPA were based upon prerecorded political campaign calls soliciting votes, made by or on behalf of appellees, which calls failed to contain the telephone number of the business or entity responsible for the call, in violation of the TCPA. On appeal, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in (1) dismissing the suit because there was no dispute that the calls were made, and that they failed to include the required disclosure, and (2) granting appellee Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding a hearing pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-311(f), after one was requested by appellant. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">On November 6, 2006, appellant filed a complaint in the circuit court against Ehrlich, Kristen Cox,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reilly, Craig, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Common Sense Ohio. The complaint alleged that during October and November of 2006, the various defendants, each of whom were at that time candidates for public office, or were promoting candidates for public office, initiated unsolicited pre-recorded telephone calls to appellant\u2019s residence on their behalf as part of their political campaigns. The caller ID system connected with appellant\u2019s telephone did not disclose the point of origin of several of the calls, and none of the calls contained the telephone number of the person or entity responsible for the call. Appellant sought statutory damages under both the TCPA and the MDTCPA, as well as injunctive relief under the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">On December 6, 2006, Reilly and Craig filed motions to dismiss. Appellant responded on December 27, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">On January 9, 2007, appellant filed an amended complaint, adding Giuliani and Freeeats.com, Inc. as defendants, and attached as an exhibit Verizon \u201ccall trace\u201d phone records from the \u201cVerizon Unlawful Call Center,\u201d which indicated the phone numbers from which the various calls were initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">On January 16, 2007, appellant filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and again attached the aforementioned exhibit, and in addition attached an \u201cAffidavit of Michael Worsham.\u201d On January 29, 2007, appellee Ehrlich filed an opposition to that motion, as well as his own motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">On March 22, 2007, appellant filed a notice of dismissal with prejudice as to Common Sense Ohio and Freeeats.com, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">On April 6, 2007, Craig and Reilly filed a supplemental motion to dismiss, and on April 7, 2007, appellant filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">On April 16, 2007, appellant filed another motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">On May 1, 2007, appellee Giuliani filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The same day, a hearing was held on Ehrlich, Craig, and Reilly\u2019s motions to dismiss, and on appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. At the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>appellant conceded that the calls in question were political in nature, and not commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On May 16, 2007, appellant responded to Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss, and requested a hearing on the motion. On June 18, 2007, appellant filed a second request for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On June 25, 2007, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court implicitly acknowledged that it was considering matters outside of the pleadings, i.e., the exhibits to appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, when it set forth the law relating to the conversion of a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The court, in its well-reasoned opinion, addressed the various arguments made by the parties and provided numerous alternative grounds for dismissal. The court ruled that it had personal jurisdiction over appellee Giuliani; that injunctive relief was not available because the political campaigns were over, further calls were unlikely, and appellant sustained no irreparable harm; that it had no subject matter jurisdiction as to appellees Giuliani, Craig, and Reilly, because the aggregate damage claims against each was below the circuit court\u2019s threshold jurisdictional requirement of $5,000;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the individual candidates were not proper parties, and that the entities responsible for the calls were the proper parties; that the statutes and regulations did not violate the First Amendment by unduly restricting political speech; that the phone calls were not commercial in nature pursuant to C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(a), implementing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b), and that pursuant to C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(b), implementing 47 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u00a7 227(d), there was no private right of action; and, that the MDTCPA requires a violation of the federal TCPA, and the Maryland statute can not create a private right of action where none exists under the federal statute because it is preempted by the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">On July 5, 2007, appellant filed a motion to alter and amend the June 25 opinion and order, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court failed to provide a hearing on Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss, as is required when one is requested pursuant to Rule 2 \u2014 311(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">On August 7, 2007, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying appellant\u2019s motion to alter and amend, ruling that an additional hearing on Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 2-311(f) would have been pointless as the court had already heard and considered legal argument on appellant\u2019s opposition to the motions to dismiss at the May 1 hearing, and an additional hearing on Giuliani\u2019s motion would serve only to hear the same positions reargued.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">As we shall explain below, we need not address each of the circuit court\u2019s conclusions to reach our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">A. <em>Parties\u2019 Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXH\">1. Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Initially, appellant observes that pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(B), \u201cCongress banned the initiation of <em>all </em>prerecorded voice phone messages,\u201d (emphasis in original) to a residential telephone line, without the consent of the called party, unless exempted by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), pursuant to the authority given to it by TCPA to promulgate regulations. Appellant contends that the Commission, pursuant to the regulation appearing at 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(b)(2) \u2014 which provides that all prerecorded messages shall state the telephone number of the business or entity responsible for the call-prohibited all calls not in compliance. Relying on <em>Oklahoma ex rel. Edmondson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>Pope, </em>505 F.Supp.2d 1098 (W.D.Ok.2007), appellant explains that \u00a7 64.1200(b)(2) \u201capplies to <em>all </em>prerecorded messages and does not exempt non-commercial, \u2018political calls,\u2019 or any other type of prerecorded calls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Appellant also argues that subject matter jurisdiction was proper in the circuit court as to Giuliani, Craig, and Reilly, regardless of whether the amount in controversy exceeded the statutory minimum of $5,000, because he was seeking injunctive relief, and only a court of equity can provide the remedy of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Appellant next argues that the individual candidates were proper parties because the calls were made on their behalf, and the TCPA establishes strict liability and strict vicarious liability. Further, appellant avers that the TCPA is a remedial consumer protection statute that should be liberally construed. Because we shall conclude that no private right of action exists under the statute upon which appellant\u2019s claim is based, we need not reach this issue, and we shall not discuss appellees\u2019 positions in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Appellant acknowledges that the MDTCPA makes a violation of the TCPA a violation of Maryland law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and argues that he \u201calleged a proper violation and claim under the [MDTCPA] ... [thus, he] can maintain a private action for any violation of the federal TCPA or related FCC regulations.\u201d Appellant acknowledges that although \u201cconsumers do not have a private right of action arising under the federal TCPA \u00a7 227(d), because \u00a7 227(d) does not contain a private right of action, such as TCPA \u00a7 227(b) and \u00a7 227(c) ... have,\u201d the MDTCPA \u201ccreates its own private right of action for any violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>federal TCPA,\u201d including \u00a7 227(d) and any regulations promulgated thereto; thus, although a \u00a7 227(d) violation is not actionable directly under federal law, it is actionable under the MDTCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is that the court erred in dismissing the amended complaint against Giuliani without holding a hearing, when a hearing was requested pursuant to Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 311(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">2. Appellees</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Appellees Ehrlich and Giuliani contend that, as the circuit court found, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(b)(2), the regulation serving as the basis for appellant\u2019s claim, was not promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 227(b), as appellant argued below,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but rather, was promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 227(d), which does not provide for a private right of action. Thus, according to Ehrlich and Giuliani, in the absence of a private right of action in the first place, the court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Next, appellees argue that, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, when there is no private right of action under the federal TCPA, the MDTCPA does not create its own private right of action because the MDTCPA is preempted by the TCPA, and the MDTCPA can not establish an independent private right of action for violations of the federal TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Appellees, who do not consider appellant\u2019s claim for injunctive relief as a question of subject matter jurisdiction, next aver that appellant\u2019s request for injunctive relief is moot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>because he had <em>no </em>private right of action to begin with and, moreover, that the conduct at issue had ceased. With regard to subject matter jurisdiction, appellees assert that the circuit court correctly concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over appellee Giuliani because the monetary damages attributable to Giuliani could not be aggregated to meet the amount in controversy requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Finally, appellees contend that the court did not err in failing to hold an additional Rule 2 \u2014 311(f) hearing on Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss, as the legal arguments raised in Giuliani\u2019s motion and appellant\u2019s opposition thereto had already been fully considered at the May 1 hearing, and that in any event, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Appellees Craig and Reilly argue that the calls in question were not commercial in nature; thus, the identifying information was not required, and moreover, C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(b), promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 227(d), does not provide for a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Next, appellees contend that because the federal TCPA preempts the MDTCPA, and because there no private right of action under the federal law, there is no foundation for a state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Appellees also assert that we should affirm the circuit court on the basis of \u201cmisjoinder of parties, conduct and alleged separate acts and conduct in the same [cjount without setting out factual allegations to establish probable cause of a conspiracy created and joinder by each [djefendant therein.\u201d We shall not address this contention, as it was not decided by the circuit court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, it is unnecessary for us to address it because of our disposition of the issues properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKU\">Ordinarily, in reviewing the dismissal of a complaint on a motion to dismiss, \u201cwe look only to the allegations in the complaint and any exhibits incorporated in it and \u2018assume the truth of all well-pled facts in the complaint as well as the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those relevant and material facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 103-04, 928 A.2d 795 (2007) (quoting <em>Ricketts v. Ricketts, </em>393 Md. 479, 491-92, 903 A.2d 857 (2006)) (quoting in turn, <em>Porterfield v. Mascari II, Inc., </em>374 Md. 402, 414, 823 A.2d 590 (2003)). As acknowledged by the circuit court in its written opinion, Maryland Rule 2-322(c) provides, however, that if, on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Maryland Rule 2-501, which governs motions for summary judgment. Maryland Rule 2-322(c). Thus, Maryland Rule 2-322(c) gives the trial court discretion to convert a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment by considering matters outside the pleading. <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hosp. Ctr., Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 784-85, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992). If matters outside the pleading are excluded by the trial court, then it must decide the motion based on the legal sufficiency of the pleading. <em>Id. </em>at 782, 614 A.2d 1021. If, on the other hand, the trial judge does not exclude such matters, then the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment. <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 177, 757 A.2d 118 (2000). In the event that a trial court decides to treat a motion as one for summary judgment, it must provide the parties with a reasonable opportunity to present, in a form suitable for consideration on summary judgment, additional pertinent material. <em>Antigua Condominium Assoc. v. Melba Investors Atlantic, Inc., </em>307 Md. 700, 719, 517 A.2d 75 (1986). That is because a non-moving party may be prejudiced if a trial court treats a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment by considering matters outside the pleading, but does not give the non-moving party a reasonable opportunity to present material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>that may be pertinent to the court\u2019s decision, as required by Maryland Rule 2-501. <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 502, 735 A.2d 1039 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In the present ease, appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss did not present matters outside the pleadings, but, as indicated above, appellant attached extraneous material, i.e., the affidavit, to his motion for partial summary judgment, and argued his position in support of that motion at the May 1 hearing. Generally the introduction of affidavits of fact will operate to convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Beyond Systems, Inc. v. Realtime Gaming, 388 </em>Md. 1, 12 n. 10, 878 A.2d 567 (2005); <em>Green, </em>355 Md. at 501, 735 A.2d 1039. There is no indication on the record that the court excluded the facts submitted to it through the exhibit in ruling on the motions to dismiss; thus, we must assume that they were considered. As appellant did present material to the court in the form of the motion and attached exhibits, there is no danger that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s treatment of the motion as one for summary judgment. Accordingly, we shall treat the court\u2019s ruling as a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Livesay v. Baltimore, </em>384 Md. 1, 9, 862 A.2d 33 (2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Maryland Rule 2-501(f). On appeal, the appellate court will review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party. <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520 (2006). In reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Wells Fargo Home Mont</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>gage, Inc. v. Neal, </em>398 Md. 705, 714, 922 A.2d 538 (2007) (quoting <em>Livesay, </em>384 Md. 1, 9-10, 862 A.2d 33 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">We note that there are no disputes of material fact at issue before us, as appellees do not dispute that the calls were made and that they did not contain the telephone number of the person or entity responsible for them; thus, we shall turn directly to whether appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">C. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">As a preliminary matter, with respect to subject matter jurisdiction, as noted by appellant, the circuit court determined that when appellant\u2019s damage claims were aggregated as to each defendant, only appellant\u2019s damage claims against Ehrlich reached the amount in controversy requirement for the circuit court to maintain subject matter jurisdiction over him. In its opinion, the court also discussed the remedy of injunctive relief, and the standard for granting such relief, and concluded that appellant\u2019s claim for injunctive relief was moot because the elections were over, campaigning had ceased, and injunctive relief is not aimed at remedying past wrongs. The court did not consider the claim for injunctive relief as a basis for subject matter jurisdiction. Because of our ultimate disposition that no cause of action existed for appellant\u2019s claims, we need not discuss the merits of the claim for injunctive relief. As we shall explain briefly, however, because appellant sought injunctive relief, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over all appellees, regardless of the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy. Pursuant to Maryland Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4-402(a) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 4-401 and 4-404 of [subtitle 4, Civil Jurisdiction], the District Court does not have equity jurisdiction.\u201d Section \u00a7 4-401 lists matters over which the District Court has exclusive original jurisdiction. Pursuant to that section, injunctive relief, except with respect to landlord/tenant disputes and certain other property matters, is not a remedy within the province of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Court. Section 4-404 provides the District Court with concurrent jurisdiction over matters involving domestic violence. Thus, because the District Court does not have general equity jurisdiction, it could not have granted injunctive relief to appellant. Therefore, without regard to the merits of appellant\u2019s claims, he would only have been able to seek injunctive relief in circuit court, providing the circuit court with subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">D. <em>Merits of the TCPA and MDTCPA claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQ9z\">1. TCPA</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The federal TCPA, U.S.C. \u00a7 227, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApB\">(b) Restrictions on use of automated telephone equipment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">(1) Prohibitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">(B) to initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party, unless the call is ... exempted by rule or order by the Commission under paragraph (2)(B)t]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">(2) Regulations; exemptions and other provisions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">The Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement the requirements of this subsection.

The telephone number provided may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges. For telemarketing messages to residential telephone subscribers, such telephone number must permit any individual to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Pursuant to the language of the statute, \u00a7 227(b) deals with unsolicited calls, not deficient or improperly identified calls. Section (b)(1)(B) <em>prohibits unsolicited calls </em>using an artificial or prerecorded voice to a residential phone line, unless the calls are exempted by the Commission pursuant to the authority given it by \u00a7 227(b)(2)(B). The Commission, in turn, using language almost identical to the language used in the statute, exempted non-commercial calls in the regulations prescribed by it, specifically C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(a)(2)(ii). Section 227(b)(3) creates a private cause of action for violation of that subsection, i.e., subsection (b), and the regulations implementing that subsection. <em>See Adler v. Vision Lab Telecommunications, Inc., </em>393 F.Supp.2d 35, 38 (D.D.C.2005) (\u201cBased on the plain language of the [TCPA] .... [t]he private right of action established by \u00a7 227(b)(3) limits the right to \u2018an action based on a violation of <em>this subsection\u2019 </em>[i.e., subsection (b) ] or the regulations prescribed under <em>this subsection.\u201d </em>(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(3)) (emphasis in original)). As conceded by appellant, the calls in question were political in nature; thus, non-commercial, and therefore not prohibited pursuant to subsection (b). It follows then, that as the calls were not prohibited, no private cause of action existed pursuant to that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Section 227(d), on the other hand, does not prohibit calls, but rather <em>prohibits deficient, improperly identified calls, </em>or calls \u201cthat [do] not comply with the technical and procedural standards prescribed under this subsection,\u201d i.e., subsection (d). In other words, subsection (d) provides the \u201ctechnical and procedural standards\u201d that non-prohibited calls must comply with, specifically, that all artificial or prerecorded telephone messages shall state the identity and telephone number of the person or entity initiating the call. Subsection (d)(3) vests the Commission with the authority to prescribe regulations implementing subsection (d). C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(b), promulgated by the Commission pursuant to that authority, and incorporating language similar to, but broader than, the language in (d)(3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>provides that all artificial or prerecorded telephone messages identify the entity responsible for the call and state the telephone number of that entity. Subsection (d) does not provide for a private right of action. <em>See </em>\u00a7 227(d); <em>Boydston v. Asset Acceptance, LLC, </em>496 F.Supp.2d 1101 (N.D.Cal.2007) (\u201cIn contrast to section 227(b)(3), the remedy for violations of the procedural and technical standards confers no private right of action.\u201d); <em>Adler, </em>393 F.Supp.2d 35, 39 (\u201cSection 227(b) deals with unsolicited [calls], not improperly identified [calls]. A private right of action exists only with respect to the former.\u201d); <em>Klein v. Vision Lab Telecomms., Inc., </em>399 F.Supp.2d 528, 540 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (\u201c[U]nder the TCPA, it is the province of the state attorneys general and the F.C.C. to sue ... for technical violations.\u201d); <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Construing appellant\u2019s complaint liberally, he alleges violations of either \u00a7 227(b) or \u00a7 227(d) of the statute. As we have explained, however, the calls were not prohibited pursuant to (b) because they were exempt as non-commercial calls by the regulations implementing the statute. Although the calls were exempt, thus not prohibited, they were required to comply with the technical and procedural standards under (d), and the regulations implementing that section. Although the calls did not comply with the technical and procedural standards and were therefore improperly identified calls, there is no private right of action under \u00a7 227(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We note briefly that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Pope </em>is misplaced. <em>Pope </em>did not involve a private right of action, but rather involved an action brought by the state attorney general\u2019s office under \u00a7 227(f). 505 F.Supp.2d 1098,1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">2. MDTCPA</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Appellant contends that a violation of any provision of the TCPA is actionable under the MDTCPA, even if not actionable directly under the TCPA. According to appellant, even though \u00a7 227(d) does not provide for a private right of action, the Maryland statute provides a private right of action under that section. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>As pointed out above, TCPA \u00a7 227(b) restricts the use of automated telephone equipment. Section 227(b)(3) provides that a private cause of action will lie in state courts \u201cif otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State.\u201d The MDTCPA does not describe conduct that constitutes a violation of the Maryland statute. It references whatever constitutes a violation of the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In <em>R.A. Ponte Architects, Ltd. v. Investors\u2019 Alert, Inc., </em>149 Md.App. 219, 815 A.2d 816 (2003), filed on January 29, 2003, we held that the General Assembly had not accepted the jurisdiction conferred through the TCPA, and thus, no private cause of action could be brought in State courts under that act. The MDTCPA was enacted in 2004, effective June 1 of that year. In <em>R.A. Ponte Architects, Ltd. v. Investors\u2019 Alert, Inc., </em>382 Md. 689, 857 A.2d 1 (2004), filed August 26, 2004, the Court of Appeals reversed this Court and recognized that a private cause of action under the TCPA can be pursued in State courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Given the above scenario, it is likely that the General Assembly enacted the MDTCPA merely to enable a private right of action under the TCPA, not to create new causes of action. If the intent were otherwise, on the facts of this case, the new cause of action would be preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">Effect on State law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">1) State law not preempted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\"><em>Except for the standards prescribed under subsection (d) of this section </em>and subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, nothing in this section or in the regulations prescribed under this section shall preempt any State law that imposes more restrictive intrastate requirements or regulations on, or which prohibits\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">(B) the use of automatic telephone dialing systems;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">(C) the use of artificial or prerecorded voice messages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>(D) the making of telephone solicitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 227(e) provides that the States may create their own more restrictive standards than the federal TCPA, <em>except with regard to subsection (d). </em>As explained above, appellant\u2019s only potential claim was under subsection (d), which provides for no private right of action, and subsection (e) makes it clear* that states can not create a private right of action under subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">E. <em>Rule 2-311(f) hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">As noted above, appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erred in failing to provide a hearing on Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss, as is required when one is requested pursuant to Rule 2 \u2014 311(f). Appellant\u2019s motion was denied, and we review the denial of a motion to alter or amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Hartley, </em>150 Md.App. 581, 586-87, 822 A.2d 587 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Maryland Rule 2-311(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">Hearing \u2014 Other motions. A party desiring a hearing on a motion, other than a motion filed pursuant to Rule 2-532, 2-533, or 2-584, shall request the hearing in the motion or response under the heading \u201cRequest for Hearing.\u201d Except when a rule expressly provides for a hearing, the court shall determine in each case whether a hearing will be held, but the court may not render a decision that is dispositive of a claim or defense without a hearing if one was requested as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">As appellant asserts, despite his request for a hearing on Giuliani\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint, no hearing was held on that motion. We agree wdth appellant that it was error for the court not to hold a hearing, but the error was harmless. Appellant brought the same claims against Giuliani as he did against the other appellees, and his arguments were purely questions of law. Appellant had a full and fair opportunity to present his arguments with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>law at the motions hearing on May 1. <em>See, e.g., Vinogradova v.
