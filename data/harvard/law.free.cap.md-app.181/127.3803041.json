A jury found in her favor on the discrimination claim she asserted pursuant to the Howard County Human Rights Code (\u201cHCHR Code\u201d). The school argues that its motion for judgment, as well as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, should have been granted because the evidence was insufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find that the parent\u2019s latex allergy imposed a substantial restriction upon a major life activity. We agree with the appellants that their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In 1997, Lisa Meade, the appellee, was diagnosed with a latex allergy. Health care workers often develop these allergies due to their frequent exposure to latex. The recommended treatment for a latex allergy is to avoid exposure to latex. Exposure triggers an allergic reaction such as itchy skin, asthma symptoms, and, in extreme cases, respiratory arrest. There is also a cumulative effect caused by repeated exposures, such that each additional exposure can increase the patient\u2019s sensitivity to latex.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Latex is found in household products such as balloons and gloves. Powdered latex gloves are more dangerous for people allergic to latex than non-powdered gloves, because the powder picks up latex particles from the gloves and then travels through the air, where it can be breathed into the lungs. In addition to direct exposure from touching latex products or breathing the powder from latex gloves, patients can experience secondary exposure from food or clothing that has come into contact with latex.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Meade enrolled her older son, James, at the Children\u2019s Manor Montessori School from 1994 to 1997. The school is owned by the appellants. Dr. Pradip K. Ghosh is the head administrator at the school. While James attended Children\u2019s Manor, Meade participated in activities at the school and talked to James\u2019s teachers in his classroom. She did not have any allergic reactions as a result of latex exposure at the school during that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">In 1999, however, when Meade enrolled her two-year-old son, Andrew, at Children\u2019s Manor, she noticed that some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the teachers were using powdered latex gloves when they changed the children\u2019s diapers. Concerned about her possible exposure to latex, Meade asked the teachers to use the less dangerous non-powdered latex gloves, and asked her son\u2019s teacher to use non-latex gloves, which Meade offered to provide. Meade also spoke with Ghosh about her allergy in September of 1999, and asked him to switch to using non-powdered gloves throughout the school. Ghosh told her he would look into it. Meade followed up by asking her physician, Dr. Golden, to send Ghosh a letter explaining her allergy. Dr. Golden did so on September 3, 1999, and Ghosh admitted at trial that he had read the letter. Meade also asked Dr. Voight, an occupational physician who worked for her employer, to call Ghosh.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Meade testified that, while she was waiting for a response from Ghosh, she spent as little time as possible in the school. Meade said she \u201cwould have liked to have been more a part of ... my son\u2019s pre-school experience ... [by] participating] in the activities .... and [meeting] with his teachers to learn about his progress.\u201d But, because she did not want to expose herself to latex, she felt that she could not participate in Andrew\u2019s school experience. Meade admitted, however, that she had never had an allergic reaction while at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">When Meade spoke to Ghosh about the issue again, he told her he would not switch to a different type of gloves. According to Meade, Ghosh did not want to be bothered with the issue. Ghosh claimed that he never explicitly refused to make the switch, although he admitted that he was reluctant to change suppliers. Ghosh did, however, tell his staff to stop using latex gloves when changing Andrew. Ghosh also allowed Meade to pick Andrew up at the front desk rather than coming into the classroom, as the other parents were required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Not satisfied with these accommodations, Meade provided Ghosh with more information about her allergy in October 1999. She also met with him in November to discuss the issue. According to Ghosh, Meade was very angry and threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ened to sue Mm when he told her that he did not consider her allergy a handicap. Meade wrote Ghosh a letter on November 29, 1999, in a final attempt to persuade him to switch to non-latex gloves. In this last letter, she provided \u201cinformation regarding [her] latex allergy and [her] rights under the law,\u201d including information about the Americans with Disabilities Act. Due to the perceived threat of litigation and Meade\u2019s health concerns, Ghosh invoked a provision in their contract that allowed him to \u201cask any pupil to withdraw, at any time, for any reason the administration feels provocation is sufficient.\u201d By letter dated December 2, 1999, Ghosh asked her to withdraw Andrew from the school, and gave Meade one month to find alternative care for Andrew. Meade chose to remove Andrew from the school immediately, and eventually enrolled him at Bandereare at a higher cost. The Bandereare facility had already discontinued use of powdered latex gloves to accommodate another child attending that school. After Andrew attended Bandereare for seven months, Meade withdrew him from that school and enrolled him at another facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">As a result of these events, Meade filed a complaint with the Howard County Office of Human Rights, alleging that she had been discriminated against in the provision of public accommodations on account of her handicap, namely, her latex allergy. The HCHR Code provides in Subtitle 2, Sec. 12.210 II: \u201cIt shall be unlawful if, because of discrimination [on account of handicap], an owner or operator (or his/her agent) of public accommodations denies any person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges of such public accommodations.\u201d The term \u201chandicap\u201d is defined in Sec. 12.201 IX to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">With respect to an individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">(a) A physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of the individual\u2019s major life activities; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">(b) A record of having such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">(c) Being regarded as having such an impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The Howard County Office of Human Rights concluded that Meade had \u201cestablished a prima facie case of disability accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>modation[s] discrimination when she alleged that she has a disability which affects the major life activity of breathing.\u201d The Office of Human Rights concluded that there was reasonable cause to believe that the school had failed to accommodate Meade\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">After the Office of Human Rights issued its finding of reasonable cause, Meade filed suit against Children\u2019s Manor Montessori School in the Circuit Court for Howard County on April 26, 2001, contending that Ghosh had discriminated against her based on her latex allergy in violation of \u00a7 12.210 of the Howard County Human Rights Code. Meade also alleged that when Ghosh asked Andrew to withdraw from Children\u2019s Manor he was retaliating against her for requesting an accommodation, in violation of \u00a7 12.213. The only defendant named in Meade\u2019s original complaint was Children\u2019s Manor Montessori School, but Meade later amended her complaint to add as defendants Shangrila Limited Partnership, which owns the school, and Shangrila Enterprises, Inc., which is Shangrila Limited Partnership\u2019s general partner. Ghosh is the administrative head of Children\u2019s Manor, a limited partner in Shangrila Limited Partnership, and a shareholder in Shangrila Enterprises. It was not disputed that the defendants would be liable to Meade if Ghosh violated the HCHR Code provisions prohibiting discrimination on account of handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">One of the contested issues at trial was whether Meade\u2019s latex allergy constituted a handicap under the law. Throughout the jury trial, Meade\u2019s counsel argued that her allergy was a handicap because the allergy substantially limited one of her major life activities, specifically, breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">At the close of all the evidence, the defendants moved for judgment, but the trial court deferred ruling on the motion until after the jury returned a verdict. The jury found in favor of Meade and awarded her $1,683 in economic damages, $5,000 in non-economic damages, and $22,800 in attorney\u2019s fees. On February 23, 2006, the court delivered an oral opinion denying the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>oral motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict (JNOV). Judgment was entered against each of the defendants in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. Defendants then filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied on August 15, 2006. The three defendants timely noted this appeal on September 14, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Although appellants raised two questions in their brief, the first question is dispositive. Appellants\u2019 question is whether the circuit court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment and for JNOV. Although the defendants originally made a motion for judgment at the close of all evidence, the trial court reserved ruling on that motion until after the jury had rendered its verdict. Maryland Rule 2-532(b) provides: \u201cIf the court reserves ruling on a motion for judgment made at the close of all the evidence, that motion becomes a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict if the verdict is against the moving party.\u201d The standard of review for a ruling on a motion for JNOV is whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>See, e.g., Shabazz v. Bob Evans Farms, Inc., </em>163 Md.App. 602, 643, 881 A.2d 1212 (2005). The motion tests the sufficiency of the evidence, which we must view, along with \u201cthe reasonable inferences to be drawn from it[,] ... in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Impala Platinum Ltd. v. Impala Sales (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 327, 389 A.2d 887 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Section 12.210 of the HCHR Code makes it unlawful for any public accommodation to deny \u201cany person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges of such public accommodations\u201d \u201cbecause of discrimination.\u201d Section 12.213 provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to: (a) Retaliate against another person ... because the person has (1) Lawfully opposed any act or failure to act that is in violation of this subtitle; or (2) In good faith, filed a complaint, testified, participated or assisted in any way in a proceeding pursuant to this subtitle.\u201d The HCHR Code provides that the \u201c[w]ords and phrases used in this subtitle shall have their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>usual meaning, except as defined below: ----\u201d The terms \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d and \u201chandicap\u201d are all defined in the HCHR Code \u00a7 12.201.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Most pertinent to the issue on appeal is the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d in Section 12.201, quoted above, which defines the term using language virtually identical to the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in the Americans -with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, et seq. The ADA defines \u201cdisability\u201d as follows in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102: \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; [or] (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d Because there is no significant difference between the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d under the HCHR Code and \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA, and because there is no case law interpreting the HCHR Code, both parties agreed that we should look to federal law interpreting the ADA for guidance. <em>Cf. Ridgely v. Montgomery County, </em>164 Md.App. 214, 232, 883 A.2d 182 (looking to federal decisions interpreting the ADA for guidance in interpreting similar provisions in the Montgomery County Code), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 286, 888 A.2d 342 (2005). We agree that, because of the virtually identical language in the two definitions, the two statutes should be construed in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Supreme Court has held that the determination of whether someone is \u201cdisabled,\u201d as that term is used in the ADA, is a three part analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">First, we consider whether [the condition] was a physical impairment. Second, we identify the life activity upon which respondent relies ... and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity under the ADA. Third, tying the two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZO\"><em>Bragdon v. Abbott, </em>524 U.S. 624, 631, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 195, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002): \u201cMerely having an impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA. Claimants also need to demonstrate that the impairment limits a major life activity.\u201d (Citation omitted). And, \u201c[t]o qualify as disabled, a claimant must further show that the limitation on the major life activity is \u2018substantial!].\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Applying this three-step analysis to Meade\u2019s case, the first question is whether her latex allergy constitutes an impairment, which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission defines as a \u201cphysiological disorder, or condition ... affecting one or more of the following body systems: ... respiratory----\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h). There is little dispute that Meade\u2019s allergy is a physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The more difficult questions are whether the impairment impinges upon activities that the law recognizes as major life activities, and whether any such impingement is great enough to be considered a \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d upon those activities. Throughout the trial and closing arguments of this case, Meade specifically claimed that breathing is the major life activity that is significantly impaired by her latex allergy, and that the restriction of her breathing is the reason she is protected as a person suffering from a handicap. It is clear that breathing qualifies as a major life activity. <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 480, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (\u201c \u2018[m]ajor [l]ife [activities means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i)). <em>Accord Watson v. Hughston Sports Med. Hosp., </em>231 F.Supp.2d 1344, 1349 (M.D.Ga.2002) (\u201cBreathing is obviously a \u2018major life activity\u2019 under anyone\u2019s definition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">But cases interpreting the definition of a disability under the ADA have excluded numerous claims based on the third step in the analysis, concluding that although an impairment affects a major life activity, the impairment does not constitute a substantial limitation on the major life activity. In the <em>Toyota Motor </em>case, the Supreme Court elaborated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>meaning of the phrase \u201csubstantially limits\u201d in the ADA, and stated, 534 U.S. at 196-97,122 S.Ct. 681:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201c[Substantially\u201d in the phrase \u201csubstantially limits\u201d suggests \u201cconsiderable\u201d or \u201cto a large degree.\u201d ... The word \u201csubstantial\u201d thus clearly precludes impairments that interfere in only a minor way with the performance of manual tasks from qualifying as disabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">(Internal citations omitted.) The Court further observed in <em>Toyota Motor </em>that \u201cthese terms need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197,122 S.Ct. 681. Accordingly, the Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">We therefore hold that to be substantially limited in performing [the pertinent major life activity], an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people\u2019s daily lives. The impairment\u2019s impact must also be permanent or long term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In <em>Watson, supra, </em>231 F.Supp.2d at 1350, the court focused upon the issue of substantial limitation when it considered whether an allergy satisfies the definition of a disability if the symptoms can be managed by changes in the individual\u2019s lifestyle. In that case, a hospital refused to hire a nurse because the nurse was allergic to latex. Although the nurse claimed that the hospital had discriminated against her because of her <em>disability </em>\u2014 i.e., her latex allergy \u2014 the court concluded that her allergy did not substantially limit her in such major life activities as breathing and working. The court granted summary judgment for the hospital. With respect to the nurse\u2019s claim that her allergy substantially limited her breathing, the court stated, <em>id. </em>at 1349-50:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">Breathing is obviously a \u201cmajor life activity\u201d under anyone\u2019s definition. However, applying the above factors to determine whether Plaintiffs breathing has been \u201csubstantially limited\u201d by her allergy, the Court must conclude that Watson has no such substantial limitations and is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>not disabled for ADA purposes. First, the evidence reveals that, while the RAST blood test shows that Watson has a latex sensitivity of four on a scale of five, her reactions thus far have not been severe. Furthermore, the only restriction placed upon her as a result of the allergy is to avoid contact with latex at work and at home. Moreover, Plaintiffs allergy, while permanent, is dormant unless activated by exposure to latex. In other words, her \u201cimpairment\u201d does not restrict her from engaging in the major life activity of breathing. It simply has the possibility of doing so if she exposes herself to latex. Just as people who are allergic to bees are not in danger of a reaction until they are stung, Watson does not suffer any adverse effects because of her allergy to latex unless and until she comes in contact with it. Similarly, the permanent or long term impact of Watson\u2019s allergy to latex appears minimal, as long as she avoids contact with the substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">Perhaps the most persuasive evidence that Watson is not substantially limited in the life activity of breathing is the undisputed evidence that she currently works both full-time and part-time as a registered nurse, a job which not only requires \u201cbreathing\u201d but requires one to engage in strenuous \u201cmajor life activities.\u201d Watson described only a few occurrences where she has had trouble breathing because of her latex allergy as opposed to her pre-existing asthma. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds as a matter of law that Watson\u2019s latex allergy does not substantially limit her ability to breathe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Similarly, in <em>McLorn v. Comty. Health Servs., </em>456 F.Supp.2d 991 (S.D.Ill.2006), the court rejected the ADA claim of a person who alleged he had been terminated because of the fact that his latex allergy affected his work. The employee\u2019s job as a hospital janitor required him to wear a protective suit and gloves made of synthetic latex whenever he was handling biohazardous materials. The employee had not realized he had the allergy when he was hired, but experienced an oozing rash and sores after he wore the latex garments at work. After the employer terminated the employee for reasons the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>employer alleged were unrelated to the latex allergy, the employee filed suit under the ADA, claiming that he was disabled because the allergy limited \u201chis ability to perform manual tasks, sleep, breathe and work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 996. The employer moved for summary judgment, arguing that the employee could not show that his latex allergy imposed a substantial limitation on a major life activity. The employer argued \u201cthat even a severe and permanent allergy does not substantially limit a major life activity where an allergic reaction is dormant and is only triggered by exposure to a specific allergen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court agreed that the employee\u2019s latex allergy was not an impairment that rendered him \u201cdisabled,\u201d and entered summary judgment for the hospital, explaining, <em>id. </em>at 996-97:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">There is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that McLorn\u2019s allergy to synthetic latex substantially impairs any of his major life activities. The evidence shows that McLorn\u2019s allergic reaction is somewhat severe, but not life-threatening. However, he experiences this reaction only when he comes into contact with synthetic latex, which he has apparently only done while working at [the hospital]. Although it took some time after leaving [the hospital] for his allergy symptoms to go away \u2014 maybe as much as several months \u2014 they did go away, and they did not reappear. In fact, McLorn testified at his deposition that he was fine once the symptoms went away, and the record shows that he was able to obtain later employment in the cleaning/janitorial, painting and auto repair fields. Rather than demonstrating a substantial impairment of a major life activity, the evidence demonstrates mere periodic episodes of allergic reactions that occurred only when McLorn was in direct contact with latex. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 944, 952 (7th Cir.2000) (intermittent flare-ups may not render a condition a \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA); <em>Land v. Baptist Med. Ctr., </em>164 F.3d 423, 424-25 (8th Cir.1999) (peanut allergy did not substantially impair major life activity because breathing was only restricted during allergic reactions).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Land v. Baptist Med. Ctr., </em>164 F.3d 423, 424 (8th Cir.1999), summary judgment was granted in favor of a day care center that had excluded a child after the child suffered two allergic reactions to peanuts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the child\u2019s ability to breathe was not substantially limited, because her \u201cability to breathe is generally unrestricted, except for the limitations she experienced during her two allergic reactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425. The court concluded: \u201c[Although [the child\u2019s] allergic reaction to peanut-laden foods affects her eating and breathing, her allergy does not substantially or materially limit these major life activities within the definition of disability under the ADA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the instant case, Meade testified that she can control her latex allergy by avoiding certain products. For example, she testified that she stopped using latex gloves at work, and her employer stopped using powdered latex gloves. When asked if she \u201cchanged any other aspects of [her] life as a result of the diagnosis,\u201d Ms. Meade said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">Yes; ... latex is in many areas of our environment. Balloons are latex; I cannot touch or have balloons in my home. Erasers on pencils are latex; I have to use special \u2014 or, my children have to use special erasers for their schoolwork. Rubber bands are latex; I can\u2019t have rubber bands or touch a rubber band. I use another kind of product called a plastic band as a substitute. Cleaning gloves for doing routine housework cannot be \u2014 the typical yellow latex gloves, because those are latex. Those are a few examples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Ms. Meade also described the few times she had accidentally been exposed to latex after she learned of her allergy. These incidents occurred as a result of: eating at a restaurant in which the employees use latex gloves to handle the food, visiting her mother at a hospital, taking her son to the dentist, hugging her husband after he came home from the dentist, and having her blood drawn. But these instances of accidental exposure were relatively infrequent, and on none of those occasions was her reaction serious enough that she had to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to the hospital. Instead, she simply treated the allergic reaction with an inhaler. There was no evidence that Meade\u2019s breathing was at all limited when she was not exposed to latex. Meade admitted that she never experienced any allergic reactions to latex while actually at the Children\u2019s Manor school. Viewing all of this evidence in a light most favorable to Meade, she did not prove that her allergy imposed a substantial limitation upon her breathing that rendered her disabled or handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Sutton, supra, 527 </em>U.S. at 482-83, 119 S.Ct. 2139:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">A \u201cdisability\u201d exists only where an impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity, not where it \u201cmight,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d or \u201cwould\u201d be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken. A person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by medication or other measures does not have an impairment that presently \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity. To be sure, a person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by mitigating measures still has an impairment, but if the impairment is corrected it does not \u201csubstantially limi[t]\u201d a major life activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Indeed, when the trial court announced its ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment and motion for JNOV, the court concluded: \u201c[I]f the question of whether the plaintiff was handicapped[ ] required the jury to consider only the major life activity of breathing, then the defendant would be entitled to a judgment.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">But the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motions because the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find a substantial limitation on the major life activities of socialization and parenting. In reaching this conclusion, the court erred for two reasons. First, the case had not presented that alternative theory of liability to the jury. Second, even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that socialization and parenting are major life activities, the evidence failed to show that Meade\u2019s latex allergy had caused a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>substantial limitation in her ability to engage in either socialization or parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Meade\u2019s amended complaint, upon which the case was tried, alleged: \u201cPlaintiff has an allergy to latex that affects major life activities including breathing.\u201d The complaint did not allege that the allergy also impaired the major life activities of parenting and socialization. During opening statements, Meade\u2019s counsel argued that Meade\u2019s \u201clatex allergy affects, among other things, her breathing.\u201d Not only did Meade fail to produce sufficient evidence to show that her ability to socialize and parent were substantially limited, these major life activities were never mentioned to the jury by Meade\u2019s counsel during closing arguments. In his closing argument, Meade\u2019s counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">You\u2019re going to be called upon to apply the law to the facts. You\u2019ve heard me summarize the facts. Let\u2019s talk about how it applies to the law. She has [a] handicap \u2014 is [sic] her latex allergy. It affects a major life function. Her breathing. There are many major life functions. Walking. Talking. Being able to move about uninhibited. Being able to hear, being able to see. And being able to breathe. I don\u2019t know if I could characterize one as more important than the other, but I would certainly characteriz[e] breathing as a major life function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Counsel went on to discuss the fact that Meade was unable to participate in activities at Children\u2019s Manor the way she had when her older son James was enrolled there. But the argument was that her use of the facilities was limited because she was trying to avoid exposure to latex. Counsel did not contend that Meade\u2019s inability to use this particular school\u2019s facilities was itself a limitation upon some other major life activity. Meade\u2019s counsel also pointed out that Andrew was enrolled at another school. Counsel said nothing, however, about any limitation upon Meade\u2019s ability to engage in the major life activities of socialization or parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">During his rebuttal argument, Meade\u2019s counsel reemphasized that the major life activity relied upon was Meade\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>breathing. Counsel stated: \u201cMajor life activity. The major life activity is breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">We fail to see how the jury could reasonably have concluded that the major life activities that supported Meade\u2019s claim of being handicapped were the activities of socialization and parenting. But even if the jury had been sufficiently creative to consider such alternative possibilities, the evidence of any limitation upon Meade\u2019s activities was even more sparse with regard to socialization and parenting. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Toyota Motor, supra, </em>534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681, quoted above, in order for a person to be considered disabled, the limitation upon the pertinent major life activities must be more than a series of inconveniences. Instead, <em>\u201can individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts </em>the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people\u2019s daily lives. The impairment\u2019s impact must also be permanent or long term.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Meade presented no evidence that would have permitted the jury to find that her allergy had \u201cprevented] or severely restricted]\u201d her socialization or parenting. Consequently, the trial court erred in basing its denial of the motion for JNOV on the possibility that the jury made a finding that a major life activity other than breathing was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY IS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
