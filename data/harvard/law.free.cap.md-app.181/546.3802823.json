In the complaint, appellants alleged that Zi\u2019Tashia was exposed to chipping, peeling, and/or flaking lead-based paint, while residing at 1233 Cliftview Avenue and at 706 Mt. Holly Avenue. The rental units are located in Baltimore City and are owned, managed, and/or operated by the appellees. Appellants further claimed that Zi\u2019Tashia sustained severe and permanent brain injuries, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits, as a result of Zi\u2019Tashia\u2019s exposure to lead-based paint at both properties. Appellants alleged that appellees violated the CPA and were negligent in failing to properly maintain and safeguard the properties against the presence of chipping, flaking, and/or peeling paint. Ms. Jackson also brought her own claim against the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">On March 13, 2003, appellants filed a First Amendment by Interlineation. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, and, on March 14, 2003, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Judge M. Brooke Murdock presiding, denied the motion to allow for further discovery. On March 25, 2003, the appellees filed an answer to the amendment. On November 2, 2006, after extensive discovery, appellees filed a second motion for summary judgment and a memorandum in support thereof. Appellants opposed this motion by filing three memoranda of their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>On November 30, 2006, the State of Maryland, Department of the Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d), filed a Memorandum of Law of <em>Amicus Curiae. </em>On December 5, 2006, appellants filed an opposition to appellees\u2019 second motion for summary judgment, along with a memorandum of points and authorities, in support thereof. On the same date, appellees filed an opposition to appellants\u2019 motion concerning the application and/or constitutionality of the Statute. On December 13, 2006, appellees filed a reply to appellants\u2019 opposition to appellees\u2019 second motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">A hearing on all open motions was held on December 19, 2006. The trial court, Judge Robert B. Kershaw presiding, held the matter <em>sub cu\u00f1a </em>and issued a memorandum opinion and order on February 1, 2007, granting appellees\u2019 second motion for summary judgment, in part, and denying it, in part. The court determined that the Statute was constitutional and found that (1) the Statute did not violate appellants\u2019 right to a jury trial; (2) the Statute did not impermissibly restrict appellants\u2019 right to access the courts, nor did it restrict appellants\u2019 right to remedy; (3) the Statute did not violate Maryland\u2019s constitutional mandate on separation of powers; and (4) the Statute did not violate appellants\u2019 right to equal protection under the law. Furthermore, the court found that the Statute applies to persons with an EBL level under 25 |xg/dl and that the Statute barred actions brought pursuant to the CPA, where property owners were in full compliance with the Statute\u2019s edicts. Lastly, the court ruled that there was a dispute of fact with regard to appellees\u2019 compliance with the Statute, during certain periods of time, and, therefore, denied appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment in that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The case was called to trial on July 7, 2007, and the parties agreed to proceed by stipulated facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>tion was put on the record at a pre-trial motion hearing before the circuit court, Judge Gale E. Rasin presiding. As part of the pre-trial motion hearing, appellees\u2019 second motion for summary judgment, which had been previously denied, was renewed. After hearing arguments, the court ruled that appellees\u2019 filings were timely and that appellees were fully compliant with the Statute, thereby affording them protection from suit. Accordingly, on June 18, 2007, final judgment was entered in appellees\u2019 favor on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On July 17, 2007, both parties filed a joint motion to alter or amend, to correct clerical errors that, technically, prevented the entry of a final judgment for purposes of this appeal. The court granted the joint motion on August 1, 2007, and appellants filed this timely appeal on August 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Zi\u2019Tashia Jackson was born on January 12, 1997. At the time of her birth, her mother, Tameka Jackson, was living at 1904 E. Lanvale Street in Baltimore City. When Zi\u2019Tashia was one year old, she and Ms. Jackson moved to 1233 Cliftview Avenue (\u201cCliftview\u201d). The tenants of record at Cliftview, during appellants\u2019 residency, were Takia and Tasha Jackson, Zi\u2019Tashia\u2019s maternal aunts. Appellants lived at Cliftview for approximately one year before they moved to 706 Mt. Holly (\u201cMtHolly\u201d). The tenants of record at Mt. Holly, during appellants\u2019 residency, were Ms. Jackson and Dia Lawrence (\u201cMr.Lawrence\u201d), Zi\u2019Tashia\u2019s father. Appellants and Mr. Lawrence lived at Mt. Holly for approximately six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">I. 1233 CLIFTVIEW AVENUE</p>\n<p id=\"Adh\">Pursuant to \u00a7 6-811 of the Statute, appellees initially registered Cliftview with MDE on March 24, 1995. On February 19, 1997, pursuant to \u00a7 6-815 of the Statute, the interior and exterior of Cliftview underwent a full risk-reduction and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>spection, whereby it was determined that the property met certification criteria and the standards mandated by the Statute. Pursuant to \u00a7 6-818 of the Statute, the full risk-reduction and inspection was conducted by an independent licensed inspector, who was accredited by the State of Maryland. The inspector determined that the interior and exterior paint, the window sashes, jambs, wells, and sills were in satisfactory condition. Consequently, an inspection certificate was submitted to MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On March 27, 1997, Zi\u2019Tashia\u2019s aunts executed a lease for a month-to-month tenancy at Cliftview, to commence April 1, 1997. The lease included a lead paint disclosure form, lead poisoning information packets (as required by \u00a7 6-823 of the Statute), and notices of tenant\u2019s rights (as required by \u00a7 6-820 of the Statute). Before executing their lease, Zi\u2019Ta shia\u2019s aunts were required to inspect the property and identify, in writing, any defective conditions that were present, including any chipping, flaking, and/or peeling paint. Zi\u2019Tashia\u2019s aunts executed the leases, and they did not reference any chipping, flaking, or peeling paint. They did, however, list Zi\u2019Tashia as one of the children residing or frequently visiting Cliftview.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">While residing at Cliftview, appellants allege that Zi\u2019Tashia was lead-poisoned. Zi\u2019Tashia had a blood lead level of 21 |jLg/dl on October 22,1998, and 16 \u00a1xg/dl on November 18,1998. Appellees, however, never received a notice of defect/notice of EBL level regarding Zi\u2019Tashia. Thus, appellees believed that, pursuant to \u00a7 6-819 of the Statute, corrective measures at the property \u2014 such as modified risk reductions \u2014 were not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">II. 706 MT. HOLLY AVENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 6-811 of the Statute, appellees registered Mt. Holly with MDE on March 24, 1995. On January 8, 1999, pursuant to \u00a7 6-815 of the Statute, the interior and exterior of Mt. Holly underwent a full risk-reduction and inspection, wherein it was determined that the property met certification criteria and complied with the standards mandated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Statute. Pursuant to \u00a7 6-818 of the Statute, the full risk-reduction and inspection was conducted by an independent licensed inspector, who was accredited by the State of Maryland. The inspector determined that the interior and exterior paint, the window sashes, jambs, wells, and sills were in satisfactory condition. As such, an inspection certificate was submitted to MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On January 29, 1999, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Lawrence executed a lease for a month-to-month tenancy at Mt. Holly, to commence February 1, 1999. The lease included a lead paint disclosure form, lead poisoning information packets (as required by \u00a7 6-823 of the Statute), and notices of tenant\u2019s rights (as required by \u00a7 6-820 of the Statute). Before executing their lease, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Lawrence were required to inspect the property and identify, in writing, any defective conditions that were present, including any chipping, flaking, and/or peeling paint. Ms. Jackson and Mr. Lawrence executed the leases, and they did not reference any chipping, flaking, or peeling paint. They did, however, list Zi\u2019Tashia as one of the children residing or frequently visiting Mt. Holly.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Zi\u2019Tashia and her family were evicted from Mt. Holly on August 12, 1999. While residing at Mt. Holly, appellants allege that Zi\u2019Tashia was lead-poisoned. Zi\u2019Tashia had a blood lead level of 15 qg/dl on February 5, 1999, and 9 |ig/dl on January 21, 2000. Appellees, however, never received a notice of defect/notice of EBL level regarding the appellant. Thus, appellees believed that, pursuant to \u00a7 6-819 of the Statute, corrective measures at the property \u2014 such as modified risk reductions \u2014 were not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all counts. This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Todd v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>373 Md. 149, 154, 816 A.2d 930 (2003) (citations omitted). The proper scope of appellate review turns on whether the court below was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Lo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>pata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24 (1998). If no material facts are disputed, we determine whether the circuit court correctly granted judgment as a matter of law. <em>Todd, </em>373 Md. at 155, 816 A.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act is codified primarily in Title 6, Subtitle 8 of,the Environment Article. Enacted by the 1994 General Assembly, it became effective on February 24, 1996. The Statute was intended \u201cto reduce the incidence of childhood lead poisoning, while maintaining the stock of available affordable rental housing.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 6-802.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The Statute is based on recommendations made by the Lead Paint Poisoning Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), which was established by the Legislature in 1992 to comprehensively examine childhood lead poisoning and recommend a legal framework. Members of the Commission included property owners, health and child advocates, housing experts, and representatives of other interest groups. In December 1993, the Commission presented its draft report (\u201cCommission Report\u201d) to the General Assembly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission Report identified childhood lead poisoning as the number one preventable environmental disease affecting children in the United States and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">1) One of the most important sources of exposure to lead paint is lead-contaminated dust in older housing with deteriorated lead paint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">2) the practice of ordering full abatement after identification of a lead-poisoned child residing in the property has not been an effective solution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">3) a preventive approach is needed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">4) owners of low and moderate income rental housing generally cannot afford to make the expenditures necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>to entirely remove lead hazards from all of their properties without substantially increasing rents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">5) tenants cannot absorb significant rent increases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">6) performance of lead hazard reduction treatments that fall short of full abatement would be considerably less costly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">7) the current tort system, in which landlords are subject to costly lawsuits and the threat of litigation, discourages landlords from renting to families with children, particularly those with elevated blood lead;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">8) the general unavailability of liability insurance covering lead risks has decreased the marketability of older rental properties, thereby preventing property owners from obtaining financing to perform abatements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">9) the most important component of successfully treating lead poisoning is to remove the child from the leaded environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\"><em>See </em>Report of the Lead Paint Poisoning Commission, 3-7 (May 5, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">The Statute implemented the Commission\u2019s recommendations. It has four principal components. First, it establishes a mandatory lead hazard risk-reduction standard for all residential rental properties built before 1950 (\u201cAffected Property\u201d). Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-815, 6-817, 6-819. Second, the Statute provides a compensation mechanism for children under the age of six and pregnant women (\u201cPersons at Risk\u201d) living in Affected Properties that are in compliance with the law but who, nonetheless, suffer from EBL levels. Envir. \u00a7 \u00a7 6-828-6-842. Third, the Statute provides an incentive for property owners to comply by affording them the opportunity to limit their liability to Persons at Risk. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-835, 6-836. Fourth, the Statute requires insurers to provide lead hazard liability coverage to compliant property owners. Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.) \u00a7\u00a7 19-701 <em>et seq. </em>of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Owners of Affected Properties that are not certified as lead-free must comply with all applicable provisions of the Statute by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>1) registering the properties with MDE and renewing the registration annually; Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-811, 6-812.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">2) bringing the properties into compliance -with the full risk-reduction standard at the first change in occupancy after February 23, 1996, and at every change in occupancy thereafter; Envir. \u00a7 6-815(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">3) bringing the properties into compliance with the modified risk-reduction standard within 30 days following receipt of a notice of defect, or receipt of notice that a Person at Risk with an EBL level of 15 [xg/dl or more prior to February 24, 2006, or 10 gg/dl or more on or after February 24, 2006, resides in the unit; Envir. \u00a7 6-819; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">4) providing the tenant, by verifiable method, a copy of the current verified inspection certificate, a lead poisoning informational packet, and a Notice of Tenant\u2019s Rights package. This must be done at the inception of each tenancy and every two years thereafter. Envir. \u00a7 \u00a7 6-820, 6-823.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">By February 24, 2001, property owners were required to have at least fifty percent of their Affected Properties in compliance with the full risk-reduction standard, regardless of whether there was a change of occupancy. Envir. \u00a7 6-817. On and after February 24, 2006, property owners were required to have one hundred percent of their Affected Properties in compliance with a risk-reduction standard. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-817, 6-819(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The Statute bars Persons at Risk from filing civil suits for damages as a result of alleged ingestion of lead paint while residing in an Affected Property that is in compliance with the Statute at the time of the alleged ingestion. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-828, 6-836. If a Person at Risk is diagnosed with an EBL level of (1) 25 (xg/dl or more, on or after February 24, 1996; (2) an EBL level of 20 (xg/dl or more, on or after February 24, 2001; (3) or an EBL level of 15 (xg/dl or more, on or after February 24, 2006, a property owner must make the Person at Risk a qualified offer (within 30 days of receiving written notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the EBL), to maintain limited liability protection. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-828, 6-831. This qualified offer must cover relocation expenses, up to $9,500.00, to allow the family of the Person at Risk to move to lead-safe housing. Envir. \u00a7 6-840. Relocation expenses include a rent subsidy of up to 150% of the tenant\u2019s existing monthly rent, for the period until the Person at Risk reaches the age of 6 years, or, in the case of a pregnant woman, until the child born as a result of that pregnancy reaches the age of 6 years. <em>Id. </em>Relocation expenses also include incidentals that may be incurred by the household, such as transportation and child care fees. <em>Id. </em>The property owner\u2019s qualified offer must also pay for all medically necessary, uninsured medical expenses associated with treatment of the EBL, either up to $7,500.00, or until the child reaches the age of 18. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-839, 6-840. Furthermore, the qualified offer must include the owner\u2019s certification that he has complied with registration, risk-reduction, and tenant notification requirements. Envir. \u00a7 6-839(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Acceptance of the qualified offer releases a property owner from all further liability to the Person at Risk, with regard to the EBL allegedly caused by ingestion of lead in the Affected Property. Envir. \u00a7 6-835. Rejection of the qualified offer also releases an owner from liability, if the property owner complied with the Statute. Envir. \u00a7 6-836. On the other hand, a tenant may reject the qualified offer and file suit, if the property owner was not in compliance with the Statute during the time of the alleged ingestion. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-836, 6-838. In an action for damages by a Person at Risk, the property owner\u2019s failure to comply with risk-reduction or distribution of educational materials creates a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Envir. \u00a7 6-838.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">I. The Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act is Constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Appellants contend that the Statute violates the constitutions of the United States of America and of the State of Maryland. Specifically, appellants argue that the Statute (1) violates their right to a jury trial and access to courts under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and under Articles 5, 20, and 23 of the Maryland Constitution Declaration of Rights (\u201cDeclaration\u201d); (2) violates their right to access courts and remedies under Article 19 of the Declaration; (3) violates due process and equal protection of the law, under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 24 of the Declaration; and (4) violates Article 8 of the Declaration, which addresses Separation of Powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We disagree and discuss those issues, in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">A. <em>The Right to a Jury Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Appellants argue that the Statute violates their right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Seventh Amendment, however, \u201cdoes not apply to the states.\u201d <em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 189, 874 A.2d 919 (2005) (citing <em>Md. Aggregates Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. State, </em>337 Md. 658, 681 n. 14, 655 A.2d 886 (1995)). Thus, the Seventh Amendment cannot be the basis of a challenge to the constitutionality of the Statute\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Next, appellants argue that the Statute violates their right to a jury trial under Articles 5, 20, and 23 of the Declaration. Article 5 of the Declaration provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">That the Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England, and the trial by Jury, according to the course of that Law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes ... and also of all Acts of Assembly ... except such as may have since expired, or may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution; <em>subject, nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legislature of this State ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>(Emphasis added). Therefore, Maryland is \u201csubject to the common law, except where it has been changed or modified by legislative action.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Glickman, </em>45 Md.App. 718, 727, 415 A.2d 625 (1980). In other words, the right to a jury trial exists only to the extent that it has not been abrogated by the Legislature. In this case, the General Assembly removed the right to trial by jury by enacting the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellants attempt to strengthen their argument by citing Article 20 of the Declaration, which states: \u201cThat the trial of facts, where they arise, is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties and estate of the People.\u201d Article 20 has primarily been treated as a venue provision. <em>See, e.g., Greco v. State, </em>307 Md. 470, 474, 515 A.2d 220 (1986); <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>302 Md. 691, 707, 490 A.2d 1228 (1985), <em>vacated on other grounds by </em>475 U.S. 1078, 106 S.Ct. 1452, 89 L.Ed.2d 711 (1986), <em>on remand, </em>307 Md. 233, 513 A.2d 299 (1986), <em>and cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1086, 106 S.Ct. 1469, 89 L.Ed.2d 725 (1986). Thus, the circuit court did not violate the appellants\u2019 rights with regard to Article 20, because the trial was, in fact, held in Baltimore City \u2014 where Zi\u2019Tashia\u2019s alleged injury arose. Furthermore, the parties agreed to proceed by stipulated facts, rendering a \u201ctrial of facts\u201d unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument, rooted in Article 23,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> also fails, for this reason. While Article 23 guarantees the right to a trial by jury in civil proceedings, the right applies, specifically, to all <em>issues of fact. </em>In this case, no material facts were disputed at trial, so there was no issue for the jury. Instead, the question of limited liability under the Statute became an <em>issue of law. </em>Furthermore, there was no violation of Article 23 because the Legislature, by enacting the Statute, abrogated the common law cause of action. In <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 372, 601 A.2d 102 (1992), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Where, however, the General Assembly has provided that a matter shall not be resolved in a judicial proceeding, by legislatively abrogating or modifying a cause of action, no question concerning the right to a jury trial arises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">As such, in this case \u201cthere is no cause of action [and] ... nothing to which the right of trial by jury can attach.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Adams, </em>66 Md.App. 779, 798, 505 A.2d 930 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">B. <em>The Right of Access to Courts and Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">Appellants argue that Section 6-828(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Statute violates Article 19 of the Declaration, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">That every man, for any injury done to him in his person or property, ought to have remedy by the course of the Law of the land, and ought to have justice and right, freely without sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay, according to the Law of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\u201cThe \u2018law of the land\u2019 in Article 19 is the same due process of law required by the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 298, 385 A.2d 57 (1978) (citing <em>In re Easton, </em>214 Md. 176, 187, 133 A.2d 441 (1957)). \u201cA statutory restriction upon access to the courts violates Article 19 only if the restriction is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 365, 601 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>A.2d 102 (citations omitted). In this case, we hold that the restriction imposed by the Statute is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In enacting the Statute, the Legislature\u2019s goal was to reduce childhood lead poisoning, while maintaining the stock of affordable rental housing. Based upon the Commission Report, the Legislature reasonably concluded that capping liability and limiting exposure to costly litigation (for landlords who comply with the statute) would provide an incentive to bring older rental properties into compliance with the law, thereby reducing lead hazards, without restricting housing stock. It was also reasonable for the Legislature to conclude that the provisions of the Statute and the terms of a qualified offer, if applicable, would result in Persons at Risk having safe housing, prompt relocation, and medical care if, in spite of the landlord\u2019s compliance, lead exposure occurs. Furthermore, the Legislature\u2019s decision to set decreasing levels of EBL through time was a reasonable restriction of access to courts because it was based on data presented by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Next, appellants assert that the Statute restricts their access to remedy. The Court of Appeals has upheld statutes that abrogate or limit causes of action when they bear a reasonable relationship to legitimate legislative goals. For example, in <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 691, 705, 501 A.2d 27 (1985), the Court upheld an amendment to a statute of limitations governing medical malpractice actions in which a cause of action had accrued prior to the amendment, finding that it did not violate Article 19. The Court held that, if rights have vested in a case, the Legislature cannot enact \u201ca statute of limitations applicable to an existing cause of action in such a way as to preclude any opportunity to bring suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 501 A.2d 27 (citing <em>Allen v. Dovell, </em>193 Md. 359, 363-64, 66 A.2d 795 (1949)). The Court further noted that because \u201ccommon law is subject to legislative change, there is no vested right in any common law rule.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>304 Md. at 703, 501 A.2d 27 (citing <em>Munn v. Illinois, </em>94 U.S. (4 Otto) 113, 134, 24 L.Ed. 77 (1876)).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Likewise, \u201c[sjeveral restrictions upon traditional remedies or access to the courts have been upheld under Article 19 as reasonable.\u201d <em>Piselli v. 75th St. Med., </em>371 Md. 188, 206, 808 A.2d 508 (2002). For example, the Court of Appeals indicated that \u201cthe Legislature may reasonably limit the amount of damages recoverable in tort cases for non-economic damages without violating Article 19.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 808 A.2d 508 (citing <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. at 366, 601 A.2d 102). The Court of Appeals has also held that \u201cthe Legislature may ordinarily substitute a statutory remedy, including a statutory administrative and judicial review remedy, for a common law remedy without violating Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 446-47, 788 A.2d 636 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\u201cWhere a person clearly has a right to money or property under a statute or common law principle, <em>and no statute specifically provides for a remedy, </em>Article 19 guarantees a common law remedy to enforce the right.\u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 206, 808 A.2d 508 (citing <em>Robinson, </em>367 Md. at 444, 788 A.2d 636) (emphasis added). In this case, appellants argue that, under the Statute, remedy is provided only to the injured child\u2019s parents and \u201cthere is no remedy actually given <em>to the injured child.\u201d </em>We disagree and hold that the Statute specifically provides several remedies to the injured child. First, the Statute allows the plaintiff to pursue existing remedies if the Property Owner does not comply with the Statute. Second, the Statute gives Persons at Risk the benefit of living in compliant housing by having Property Owners perform inspections regularly. Third, the Statute gives Persons at Risk the benefit of getting immediate lead-reduction treatments, so long as they notify the Property Owner, in writing, of defective conditions. Fourth, Persons at Risk are entitled to qualified offers that include relocation and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Because the restrictions on access and remedy imposed by Section 6-828(b) of the Statute are reasonable, we hold that the Statute does not violate Article 19 of the Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>C. <em>Dm Process and Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOh\">Appellants argue that the Statute violates their right to equal protection, as guaranteed by the Declaration, Article 24.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In so arguing, appellants contend that the Statute creates two statutory classifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">1) a division between children injured, specifically, by lead paint and all other injured children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">2) a division between children who suffer from an EBL level above 25 p.g/dl and children who suffer from an EBL level below 25 jxg/dL</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 353-54, 601 A.2d 102, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">Although the Maryland Constitution contains no express equal protection clause, it is settled that the Due Process Clause of the Maryland Constitution, contained in Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights, embodies the concept of equal protection of the laws to the same extent as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">[W]e have consistently taken the position that the Maryland equal protection principle applies in like manner and to the same extent as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, United States Supreme Court opinions concerning the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are practically direct authorities with regard to Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anu\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">In reviewing classifications challenged under equal protection guarantees, we consider the three standards that have evolved in Maryland: (1) strict scrutiny, (2) intermediate scrutiny,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) rational basis. <em>Id. </em>at 355-58, 601 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>First, \u201c[e]qual protection analysis requires strict scrutiny of a legislative classification when the classification impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 593, 601, 380 A.2d 1052 (1977). \u201cLaws which are subject to this demanding review violate the equal protection clause unless the State can demonstrate that such laws are necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. of Md. v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 706, 426 A.2d 929 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Second, \u201cclassifications which have been subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny than the traditional and deferential rational basis test, but which have not been deemed to involve suspect classes or fundamental rights and thus have not been subjected to the strict scrutiny test,\u201d are reviewed under intermediate scrutiny. <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 357, 601 A.2d 102. In order to be sustained, this type of classification \u201cmust serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\u201d <em>Craig v. Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976). \u201cThere is no brightline diagnostic, annunciated by either [the Court of Appeals] or the U.S. Supreme Court, by which a suspect or quasi-suspect class may be recognized readily.\u201d <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 277, 932 A.2d 571 (2007). The Court of Appeals, however, has adopted \u201ccriteria used by the Supreme Court in assessing claims of a new suspect or quasi-suspect classification.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 279, 932 A.2d 571. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">(1) whether the group of people disadvantaged by a statute display a readily-recognizable, obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define the group as a discrete and insular minority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">(2) whether the impacted group is saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(3) whether the class of people singled out is subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities to contribute meaningfully to society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 278, 932 A.2d 571 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Third, \u201c[i]n most instances when a governmental classification is attacked on equal protection grounds, the classification is reviewed under the ... \u2018rational basis\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 355, 601 A.2d 102. \u201cGenerally under that test, a court will not overturn the classification unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that the court can only conclude that the governmental actions were irrational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cThe Supreme Court, in applying this test, has been willing to uphold the constitutionality of an enactment when \u2018any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 707, 426 A.2d 929 (quoting <em>McGowan v. State of Md., </em>366 U.S. 420, 426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In this ease, analysis of the Statute under a strict scrutiny standard is improper because the Statute neither interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, nor does it operate to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class. \u201cIf a statutory classification constitutes a reasonable restriction upon access to the courts under Article 19, the fact that the classification may implicate access to the courts does not require that heightened scrutiny be applied in equal protection analysis.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 367, 601 A.2d 102. Furthermore, the Statute does not burden a \u201csuspect class\u201d because it is neutral on its face and it applies evenhandedly to all children under the age of six, regardless of race or national origin. Appellants assert that the Statute has \u201ccreated a <em>de facto </em>racial classification\u201d because \u201c[p]oor and minority children are poisoned from lead-based paint in a disproportionate number.\u201d The assertion that the law may disproportionately affect members of one racial group, even if true, is not enough to overturn an otherwise valid law. <em>See Jefferson v. Hackney, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>406 U.S. 535, 548-49, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972) (holding that the state\u2019s system for allocating its fixed pool of welfare money did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, despite a statistically disproportionate impact on African-and Mexican-Americans). Instead, any challenge to a racially neutral law must show that the law was created, or is maintained, for a racially discriminatory purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 549, 576, 92 S.Ct. 1724. In this case, there is nothing in the record to demonstrate that the Maryland Legislature enacted the Statute with a racially discriminatory intent or purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In addition, review under strict scrutiny is improper because low economic status is not recognized as a \u201csuspect class.\u201d Legislative actions that burden poor people as a class are subject to the rational basis test. <em>See Dandridge v. </em>Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970) (\u201cIn the area of economics and social welfare ... statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u201d (citation omitted)). This is true even if a legislative act has the effect of burdening access to the courts by indigent citizens. <em>See U.S. v. Kras, </em>409 U.S. 434, 446, 93 S.Ct. 631, 34 L.Ed.2d 626 (1973) (\u201c[Bankruptcy legislation is in the area of economics and social welfare ... [thus] the applicable standard, in measuring the propriety of Congress\u2019 classification, is that of rational justification.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Analysis of the Statute under intermediate scrutiny is also improper, in this case. Appellants, in their brief, compare the children affected by the Statute to \u201call other persons negligently exposed to toxins.\u201d After making the same comparison, we hold that the children with increased EBL levels do not display a readily-recognizable, obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristic that defines them as a discrete and insular minority. <em>Compare Cleburne, </em>473 U.S. at 435, 438, 105 S.Ct. 3249 (holding that mental retardation is not a \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d classification to be assessed under intermediate scrutiny; instead, \u201ca lesser standard of scrutiny is appropriate\u201d), <em>with Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 372, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (finding that \u201c[a]liens as a class are a prime example of a discrete and insular minority\u201d) (citing <em>U.S. v. Carolene Prods. Co., </em>304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n. 4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938)). We further hold that the affected children have not been subjected to a history of purposeful, unequal treatment, nor have they been relegated to a position of political powerlessness, so as to command extraordinary protection. <em>Cf. Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 313, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (finding that \u201csuch persons, unlike ... those who have been discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin, have not experienced a \u2018history of purposeful unequal treatment\u2019 or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities\u201d). Moreover, we do not believe that the affected children have been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Appellants contend that intermediate scrutiny is warranted because \u201cthe duty of the courts to protect the legal rights of children and the \u2018best interest of the child doctrine\u2019 mandates heightened scrutiny.\u201d Neither of the cases that appellants cite, however, is relevant to determining the level of scrutiny required by this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants also contend that the Statute \u201cwarrants heightened scrutiny in that it significantly interferes with an important fundamental right.\u201d This argument fails because, as we previously stated, \u201cthe fact that the classification may implicate access to the courts does not require that heightened scrutiny be applied in equal protection analysis.\u201d <em>Murphy, supra, </em>325 Md. at 367, 601 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Because strict and intermediate scrutiny are inappropriate in this case, we apply the rational basis standard of review. As stated above, the Legislature enacted the Statute with the intent \u201cto reduce the incidence of childhood lead poisoning, while maintaining the stock of available affordable rental housing.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 6-802. At the time it was enacted, the Legislature concluded, based on the Commission Report, that lead paint was widespread, in relation to the general stock of low and moderate-income rental housing. As a result, the unlimited civil liability of property owners in lead paint cases diminished the availability of such housing. Relying on the Commission Report, the Legislature also concluded that, based upon the number and severity of EBL levels in Baltimore City and statewide, requiring a qualified offer would reduce lead poisoning while maintaining a stock of safe, affordable housing. The Legislature further found that limiting exposure to civil actions would create an incentive for landlords to bring properties into compliance with risk-reduction standards. At the same time, qualified offers would result in prompt relocation of lead-poisoned children to safe housing, and in payment of uncovered medical expenses. In review, we hold that the Legislature\u2019s actions were rational and that they were related to the legitimate purpose of reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning while maintaining the stock of available affordable rental housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Appellants next contend that the limited liability provisions of the Statute are illogical because the law presumes that a child can be lead-poisoned while residing in a property that is in compliance with the Statute. The Legislature, however, did not intend to completely eliminate lead poisoning; it merely intended to \u201creduce the incidence\u201d of EBL. <em>See </em>Envir. \u00a7 6-802. In this case, lead hazard reduction treatments are a legitimate means to reduce the presence of lead-contaminated dust in properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Appellants further argue that the Commission Report presented the Legislature with \u201canecdotal \u2018evidence\u2019 \u201d and that, in fact, \u201cthere is no evidence that lead poisoning actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>are the main ... determinant of the availability of affordable housing.\u201d The Supreme Court, however, has previously held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjW\">A legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data. A statute is presumed constitutional, and the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative [sic] every conceivable basis which might support it, whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record. Finally, courts are compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature\u2019s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. A classification does not fail rational-basis review because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality. The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations-illogical, it may be, and unscientific.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXx\"><em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320-21, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (citations omitted). Therefore, under a rational basis analysis, a court is not free to second-guess the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. For these reasons, we hold that the Statute does not violate Article 24 of the Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">D. <em>Separation of Powers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Appellants argue that the Statute violates Article 8 of the Declaration, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Specifically, appellants point to Section 6-818(b) of the Statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and contends that it \u201ctakes away fact finding powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>from the jury\u201d and \u201ccreates a \u2018conclusive\u2019 presumption that so long as a report is submitted to the Department, there is \u2018conclusive\u2019 proof that the owner has complied with the risk reduction standard.\u201d Appellants continue by asserting that \u201cthere is no rational connection between the fact proved (the submission of the report) and the fact presumed (proof that the owner is in compliance with the risk reduction standard).\u201d According to appellants, this violates their right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The Court of Appeals has previously held that \u201cthe courts cannot review the wisdom of projects which elected bodies undertake, nor can courts substitute their judgment for the judgment of the people in authority who make the decisions.\u201d <em>City of Bowie v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>260 Md. 116, 122, 271 A.2d 657 (1970). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s role in reviewing the constitutionality of a legislative enactment is more fundamental; it is limited to addressing whether the legislative enactment conflicts with the Constitution.\u201d <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Schmoke, </em>63 F.3d 1305, 1312 (1995) (citing <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). Accordingly, the Statute does not violate Separation of Powers under Article 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">As for the presumption created by the Statute, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court \u201chave held that under certain circumstances[,] statutes that create <em>conclusive, irrebuttable </em>presumptions may violate due process.\u201d <em>Owens v. State, </em>352 Md. 663, 673, 724 A.2d 43 (1999) (emphasis added). A \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d is one \u201cthat cannot be overcome by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>additional evidence or argument.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1223 (8th ed.2004). In this case, the relevant portion of the Statute provides that \u201c[a] report submitted to the Department ... that certifies compliance for an affected property with the risk reduction standard shall be conclusive proof that the owner is in compliance with the risk reduction standard.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 6 \u2014 818(b). The report, however, must show that an accredited and independent inspector performed the test for lead-contaminated dust. <em>See </em>Envir. \u00a7 6-818(a). Thus, any presumption created by the Statute would not arise \u201cout of the thin air\u201d and would, therefore, be valid. <em>Cf. Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 88, 48 A.2d 600 (1946) (invalidating a conclusive presumption that stated that a positive drug test of a horse shall be conclusive evidence either that there was knowledge of the fact on the trainer\u2019s part or that the trainer was guilty of carelessness).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Section 6 \u2014 818(b) states that the filed report shall be conclusive proof of compliance <em>\u201cunless </em>there is\u201d (1) proof of actual fraud, (2) proof that the inspection was not performed by an accredited worker, or (3) proof that the owner failed to respond to a complaint regarding the property. Envir. \u00a7 6-818(b) (emphasis added). Again, evidence of any of those three instances can serve to overcome the presumption created by the statute. As a result, we hold that the presumption is rebuttable and that the Statute is a constitutional exercise of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">II. Appellees did not fully comply with the Statute and, thus, are not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Appellants next argue that the trial court erred in ruling that appellees complied with the Lead Risk in Housing Act, Section 6-812, which states, in relevant part, that an owner who has registered an affected property shall \u201c[r]enew the registration of the affected property on or before December 31 of each year.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 6 \u2014 812(a)(1). Under Section 6-813, an owner who fails to renew registration \u201cis not in compliance \u2022with respect to that affected property,\u201d for purposes of Section 6-836, protection from liability. Envir. \u00a7 6-813(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>During trial, the parties stipulated that for calendar years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, appellees sent registration renewals to MDE on or before December 31 of those years. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge ruled that a registration renewal is effective upon mailing, instead of upon receipt by MDE. We believe that the trial court erred and hold that registration renewal is complete not when a property owner sends the form, but when the form is actually marked as \u201creceived\u201d and date-stamped by MDE.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The trial court interpreted Section 6-812 to require that the registration renewal be mailed prior to December 31. In its view, a property owner could be compliant even if MDE never received a renewal form, so long as the property owner alleged that he mailed said form. In this case, the mailbox rule<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Previously, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">If a statute has more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous.

We avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.

Meanwhile, renewal has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">The act of renewing or reviving.

The relevant part of that section states that, \u201c[o]n <em>or before December 31, </em>1995, the owner of an affected property shall register the affected property with the Department.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 6-811(a)(l) (emphasis added). In order to register, the Department must acknowledge receipt of the registration form. Thus, the form must be received on or before December 31, 1995. If \u201crenewal\u201d revives and recreates the original registration, it then follows that the renewal form, too, must be received by the Department on or before December 31 of each successive year at a minimum. There is no requirement for an acknowledgment but that does not change the requirement for renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Furthermore, we note that there are numerous other sections of the Annotated Code of Maryland in which the Legislature dictates the renewal process for various documents and specifies that it can be done by mail. For example, Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-404.1(c) of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\"><em>Renewal </em>\u2014 In <em>general. </em>\u2014 At least 90 days before a certification expires, the applicant shall <em>mail </em>to the Secretary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">(1) a renewal application form;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">(2) the amount of the renewal fee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">(3) the amount of any late fee, as determined by the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">(Emphasis added). Similarly, Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-115(e) of the Transportation Article states that, \u201c[i]f a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>licensee is absent from this State for cause ... and is unable to renew his license in the manner required by this section, the licensee <em>may renew by mail </em>to the Administration.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, had the Legislature intended to rule that registration renewal is effective upon mailing, instead of upon receipt by MDE, we believe that it would have specified that specific language.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Finally, it is worth noting that MDE, through its Brief of <em>Amicus Curiae, </em>has made clear that it interprets the Statute as we do. MDE\u2019s interpretation and application of the Statute is entitled to considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>See Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999). \u201c[W]e accord a degree of deference to the position of the administrative agency in our review of the administrative agency\u2019s legal conclusion, especially when the statutory language of the statute at hand is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 612-13, 937 A.2d 242 (2007); <em>see also Singley v. County Comm\u2019rs of Frederick County, </em>178 Md.App. 658, 675, 943 A.2d 636 (2008) (holding that this Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual decisions in the light most favorable to the agency, with deference to the knowledge and expertise of those people who constitute the agency). For these reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and hold that the appellees did not fully comply with the Statute. This portion of the decision is prospective only.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">III. The Statute applies to Persons at Risk who have EBL levels below 25 frg/dl.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Appellants assert that the trial court erred in ruling that the Statute applies to claims in which a child\u2019s EBL level does not reach 25 |xg/dl. In appellants\u2019 view, Persons at Risk with EBL levels below those set by Section 6-828(b) <em>(see supra </em>n. 5), retain all common law causes of action, regardless of whether the property owner was in compliance with the Statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">This Court has previously held that \u201c[a] statute must be read as a whole, so that all provisions are considered together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and, to the extent possible, reconciled and harmonized.\u201d <em>Bennett v. State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation, </em>143 Md.App. 356, 369, 795 A.2d 124 (2001) (citing <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 172, 638 A.2d 93 (1994) and <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753 (1993)). Thus, in reading Section 6-828(b), we must consider the applicability of Section 6-827 which states that \u201c[tjhis part applies to <em>all potential bases of liability </em>for alleged injury or loss to a person caused by the ingestion of lead by a person at risk in an affected property.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 6-827 (emphasis added). In so doing, we hold that the provisions of Section 6-828(b) do not set threshold EBL levels that trigger the property owners\u2019 right to invoke limited liability protection. Instead, these provisions impose an additional obligation on property owners, beyond compliance with the Statute, to make a timely qualified offer to a Person at Risk, who has an EBL level above those specified in Section 6-828(b). Our interpretation is consistent with Section 6-827, which does not refer to any threshold EBL levels as a condition of limited liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Our interpretation is also consistent with Legislative intent. According to the Commission Report, one of the primary components of the Commission\u2019s proposal was \u201cliability and insurance reforms which define and limit the potential liability of property owners based upon performance of the recommended measures, and when applicable, the making of a \u2018qualified offer\u2019 to the representative of a lead poisoned child.\u201d Report of the Lead Paint Poisoning Commission, <em>supra, </em>at 7. Thus, the provisions of Section 6-828(b) impose an <em>additional </em>obligation on property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Furthermore, nothing in the legislative history indicates any intent by the legislature to allow civil suits by Persons at Risk with EBL levels below those stated in Section 6-828(b). In its Brief of <em>Amicus Curiae, </em>MDE notes that this issue (regarding the application of limited liability to claims by Persons at Risk with EBL levels below the threshold levels) was raised during the legislative session. According to the MDE, in an informal advice letter, Kathryn M. Rowe, Assistant Attorney General, opined that Envir. \u00a7 6-828(b) bars legal proceedings by Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sons at Risk with EBL levels below the levels eligible for a qualified offer. <em>See </em>Letter from Kathryn M. Rowe, Assistant Attorney General, to The Honorable Kenneth C. Montague, Jr., Delegate (March 4, 1994). This opinion supports the interpretation that the Legislature intended to subject Persons at Risk with EBL levels below the threshold levels to the Statute\u2019s limited liability provisions, if the property was in compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">IV. When a property owner is in full compliance with the Statute, claims under the Consumer Protection Act, against said owner, are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In their complaint, appellants alleged that they were injured by a \u201cdeceptive practice,\u201d prohibited by the CPA. In granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that the Statute provides appellees with immunity from liability under the CPA. Appellants now assert that the court erred and that its decision should be reversed. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The CPA, codified at Md.Code (2005 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), includes \u201clessee\u201d as a \u201cconsumer.\u201d CL \u00a7 13 \u2014 101(c)(1). It also allows a tenant to recover damages, in a private cause of action against a landlord, for injuries caused by \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practice.\u201d CL \u00a7\u00a7 13-303, 13 -408. Indeed, it is not uncommon for plaintiffs in lead paint poisoning cases to seek damages under the CPA. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Goodman, </em>117 Md. App. 378 (1997) (tenant brought personal injury claim against two landlords, alleging that he suffered brain injury due to lead paint poisoning during residency in landlords\u2019 houses).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Appellants contend that the language of Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-828, 6-835, and 6-836 reflects the fact that the Statute applies only to actions in tort. Appellants contrast this with the CPA and claims that \u201ca landlord\u2019s violation of the CPA is not\u201d in the nature of a tort. Appellants are clearly mistaken, as this Court has previously held \u201cthat violations of the Consumer Protection Act are in the nature of a tort action.\u201d <em>MarryCLE, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>LLC v. First Choice Internet, Inc., </em>166 Md.App. 481, 528, 890 A.2d 818 (2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Furthermore, in reading Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-828, 6-835, and 6-836, we again emphasize that the Statute must be read together, as a whole. For example, Section 6-835 provides that acceptance of a qualified offer \u201cdischarges and releases all potential liability of the offeror,\u201d while Section 6-836 provides that a compliant owner \u201cis not liable, for alleged injury or loss caused by ingestion of lead\u201d to a Person at Risk who rejects the qualified offer. Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-835, 6-836. Taken together with Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 6-827 and 6-828, we believe that the Legislature intended limited liability in its broadest sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Statute\u2019s legislative history also supports a broad reading of its liability protection, as the Commission\u2019s recommendations to the Legislature proposed that liability protection be afforded \u201cto all potential bases of liability and to all asserted bases of recovery\u201d in lead paint poisoning actions. Report of the Lead Paint Poisoning Commission, <em>supra, </em>at App. B-47. Lastly, we note that a broad reading is consistent with the language and objective of the Statute. The limited liability provisions serve as an incentive for property owners who take certain risk reduction measures to comply with the Statute. 82 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 180 (Md.1997). In turn, their compliance is a benefit to tenants by providing safe, affordable housing. This intended result would be undermined if the limited liability provisions were interpreted to permit actions under the CPA, wherein tenants could seek, essentially, the same relief as they would in a tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.
