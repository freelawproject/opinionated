T. Austin and Morris Dick each received the same number, and that no person has received a higher number of votes cast for that office, it is ordered that a special election be held in said supervisor district number three on the first day of December, 1892, for the purpose of electing one supervisor for said district, and that an election proclamation be issued and published calling such special election.\u201d The court found this allegation in the answer to be true, and yet proceeded to find that at such election one vote was wrongly counted for Dick, which, if deducted from the votes counted for him, \u201cwill reduce the number of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>legal votes below the number of legal votes given to said contestant, J. T. Austin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The court, however, refused by its judgment to declare contestant elected, and this appeal is taken to obtain a modification and correction of the judgment in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">But the finding that no one was declared elected is upon a matter of jurisdiction. The proceeding is entirely statutory, and is to obtain a re-canvass of the votes cast at an election in which some person was declared elected, and the contest is simply over the right of the person \u201cdeclared elected.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It is not, and cannot be made, a proceeding to determine the right of claimants to an office where one claims a right not depending upon that election, and the statute has not authorized the re-canvass of the votes in the case, where the election has been declared to have resulted in the election of no one. In such case a new election must be called, although it may be that a candidate may question the correctness of the canvass in a different proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Dick was elected at the special election called after it was determined that there had been no election at the general election. Ho fault is found with that election in the complaint. It is in fact wholly ignored. Perhaps it may be now claimed that the special election was illegal because there was then no vacancy. But this is a question which cannot be tried in this proceeding. There is hardly a section in the title in regard to this contest which does not show that the inquiry is limited to an examination of the right of the person declared elected at the election, the canvass of which is questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The finding, therefore, that no one had been declared elected was a finding to the effect that the court had no jurisdiction of the matter. This present appeal does not affect the rights of said Morris Dick, who it seems has also taken an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The relief demanded should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Belcher, C., and Vanclief, 0., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the relief demanded is denied, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AHf\">McFarland, J., De Haven, J., Fitzgerald, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
