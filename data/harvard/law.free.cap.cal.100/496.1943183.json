that from their negligence in conducting a specified action, certain other sums and interest were lost to the estate; that an order making a family allowance to the widow was collusively consented to by the executors, and that she threatens to enforce the payment of the same by legal proceedings; that the probate court had improperly set apart a homestead to the widow out of property conveyed and trusted to the executors; \u00bfhat the executors intend to appropriate other large sums for their future commissions; that their waste of the estate is willful, and that the executors are insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">A demurrer was interposed to the complaint, specifying among other grounds \u201cthat the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the action, and that the probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>proceedings upon the will of the deceased were pending and undetermined and not in a condition to be closed.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">The superior court sustained the demurrer, and entered a judgment dismissing the bill, from which this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">Further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-7\"><em>Fox &amp;

A bill in equity can be filed for that purpose at any time after the will is probated and recorded in the proper court of probate, if the testament upon its face, upon an inspection of it as recorded, shows a testamentary disposition by the testator of his property by a lawful will. <em>(Deck </em>v. <em>Gerke, 12 </em>Cal. 433-37; 73 Am.

(Const., art. 6, sec. 5; Code Civ.

Walkerly, openly asserts that she will commence legal proceedings against the other defendants as trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>under the will, to compel them to pay her out of the trust estate the further sum of twenty-one thousand dollars, does not give to plaintiffs any cause of action against her or the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">It is unnecessary to attempt any synopsis of the voluminous complaint filed in this action, or to notice more particularly its several allegations. We do not understand from the complaint that the executors, who are also the trustees under the will of the deceased, have failed \u201cto annually distribute the residue of the rents and profits of the trust estate\u201d among the nephews and nieces of the deceased, as directed by the will, or that this is an action to enforce this particular duty of the defendants, who are named as executors and trustees under the will, and we express no opinion upon the question whether such an action could be maintained in a court of equity prior to the distribution of the estate under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Fitzgerald, J., McFarland, J., Garoutte, J., Paterson, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
