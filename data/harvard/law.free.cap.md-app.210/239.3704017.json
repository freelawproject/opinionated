Balt. City Code, art. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 60-1(d)(1), 60-(f), 60-3(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee, Adrian Phillips, a convicted gun offender, was charged in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with failure to register. The circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge because: (1) the Commissioner did not file regulations as required by the Act; and (2) the Act is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">On appeal, the State raises the following issues for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">1. Did the circuit court err in dismissing the charge based on its finding that the Police Commissioner failed to comply with regulatory filing provisions of the Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">2. Did the circuit court err in finding the Act void for vagueness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Appellee raises three additional issues as grounds to uphold the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">3. Does the Act violate Equal Protection principles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">4. Does the Act violate separation of Powers principles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-15\">5. Is the Act void because the State has preempted the field?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">THE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Before discussing the details of this case, a brief summary of GORA is warranted. The Act requires that a \u201cgun offender,\u201d a person convicted of a gun offense in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City or the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City, register with the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City or his or her designee. Balt. City Code, art. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 60 \u2014 1(d)(1), 60 \u2014 1(f), 60-3(a). The registrant must specify the gun offender\u2019s name, any other name by which he or she has been legally known, and a list of all aliases he or she has used, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 60 \u2014 5(b)(l),(4)\u2014(5), as well as a description of the crime for which he or she was convicted, the date of conviction, his or her residence, and \u201cany other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner under this subtitle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60 \u2014 5(b)(2)\u2014(3),(7)\u2014 (8). An offender must register within 48 hours of either release from prison, if the conviction included imprisonment, or the date that the sentence was imposed, if the conviction did not include imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6CM:(a)(l)-(2). Baltimore City residents have additional verification requirements, including updating the contents of their registration every six months for three years from the date of the initial registration. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60 \u2014 6(a)\u2014(c); \u00a7 60-7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The Act created a misdemeanor crime for the failure to register, and for City residents, the failure to verify their registration information as required. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u00a7 60-10. Prohibited conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">No gun offender may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">(1) knowingly fail to acknowledge in writing his or her duty to register under this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>(2) fail to register as required by this subtitle or the rules and regulations adopted under it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">(3) fail to verify information as required by this subtitle or the rules and regulations adopted under it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">(4) provide false information in the registration or verification required by this subtitle or the rules and regulations adopted under it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u00a7 60-11. Penalties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">(a) <em>In general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">Any gun offender who violates any provision of \u00a7 60-10 of this subtitle is guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction, is subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 12 months or both f\u00edne and imprisonment for each offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">(b) <em>Each day is a separate offense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">Each day that a violation continues is a separate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Pertinent to the issues raised in this case, and discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the Act gives discretionary regulatory authority to the Police Commissioner to adopt rules and regulations regarding \u201cthe form and content of the registration requirement.\u201d The ordinance states that \u201c[a] copy of all rules and regulations adopted under this subtitle must be filed with the Department of Legislative Reference before they take effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60 \u2014 2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">On June 24, 2010, appellee was charged with failing to verify his registration pursuant to \u00a7 60-10 of the Act. According to the Statement of Charges, on December 1, 2008, appellee was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of armed robbery and wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. As a result, he became a \u201cgun offender\u201d subject to the Act\u2019s registration requirements. Balt. City Code, art. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 60-1(e)(1)(i) (listing wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun pursuant to Md.Code (2002) \u00a7 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), as a gun offense pursuant to the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The Application for Statement of Charges stated that, after appellee\u2019s conviction, he was advised of his requirement to register, and he \u201csigned and dated a copy of the Gun Offender Registration Requirements form[,] which was forwarded to the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit.\u201d This form, which is referred to as the \u201cAcknowledgment Form,\u201d advised: \u201cIn accordance with the provisions of the Baltimore City Code, Article 19 \u00a7 60, this is to notify you that you must register as a gun offender with the Baltimore City Police Department.\u201d It also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">By signing below I acknowledge that I have a duty to register and that the following requirements were explained to me:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">A) I must personally appear at the Baltimore Police Department Gun Offender Monitoring Unit, 2100 Guildford Avenue, Room # 111, Baltimore, MD 21218, within 48 hours of my release, if I am imprisoned, or within 48 hours after sentence is imposed, if I am not imprisoned. I must verify my address and provide other information that the Baltimore Police Department requires and I may be photographed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">B) I am required to appear in person at the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit, 2100 Guildford Avenue, Room # 111, Baltimore, MD 21218, within 20 days of each 6-month anniversary of my initial registration date for a period of three years to update my registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">C) If I move from one address to another within the City of Baltimore <em>or </em>move into the City of Baltimore from outside the City of Baltimore, I must personally appear at the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit, 2100 Guildford Avenue, Room # 111, Baltimore, MD 21218, within 10 days to verify and update my address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">D) Before I move from an address within the City of Baltimore to an address outside of the City of Baltimore, I must personally appear at the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit, 2100 Guildford Avenue, Room # 111, Baltimore, MD 21218 to provide my new address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The form further stated that violation of the Act \u201cis a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1000, or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. Each violation ... is a separate offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The record reflects that, on December 3, 2009, appellee completed his initial registration at the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit. A form, entitled The Baltimore Police Department Gun Offender Registration (the \u201cRegistration Form\u201d), was signed by appellee. The form contained various fields of information, including: name, date of birth, address, phone number, information relating to physical description, date of registration, next registration date, \u201cGang Affiliation/Source of Information,\u201d and \u201cAdditional Information.\u201d Given appellee\u2019s registration date, and that he was a resident of Baltimore City, appellee was required to verify and update his registration by June 23, 2010. Balt. City Code, art. 19, \u00a7 60-6(a)-(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">According to the Statement of Charges, the police made efforts to ensure that appellee complied with the re-registration requirement. On June 4, 2010, a detective called appellee and left a voice mail message reminding him to re-register. On June 7, 2010, appellee \u201ccontacted the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit and advised [an officer] that he would respond to the office on [June 9, 2010] to re register.\u201d A detective subsequently went to the Baltimore City address appellee provided on his initial registration to advise him of his requirement to re-register. A woman who lived there informed the officers that appellee had not lived at the residence since his arrest for the gun charge in July 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On June 10, 2010, appellee contacted the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit and stated that, due to an injury, he was unable to go to the office. He also stated that he was living with his grandmother, and he provided that address. On June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>15, 2010, officers went to the residence of appellee\u2019s grandmother, who stated that appellee was not staying with her, she had not heard from him, and she was not aware that he had been in an accident. The officers also contacted appellee\u2019s probation officer and his stepfather in an attempt to locate him. On June 21, 2010, a detective left a final voice mail message for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On June 24, 2010, appellee was charged with the failure to register pursuant to Baltimore City Code art. 19 \u00a7 60-10, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On December 9, 2010, appellee was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On January 24, 2011, appellee requested a jury trial, and his case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On February 16, 2011, appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss and Request for Hearing. In his motion, appellee argued that the Act was \u201cwithout force or effect as the authority of local government entities to regulate in the area of firearms is specifically pre-empted by state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">On March 7, 2011, after the State filed a response to appellee\u2019s motion, arguing that the Act was not preempted by State law, appellee filed an answer to the State\u2019s response. In this answer, appellee raised additional reasons to dismiss the charge: (1) the Act was unconstitutionally vague; (2) it violated constitutional protections against self-incrimination; (3) it violated separation of powers; (4) it imposed a cruel and unusual punishment; (5) it violated the equal protection clause; and (6) it lacked legal effect because the Police Commissioner failed to file accompanying rules and regulations with the Department of Legislative Reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">On March 9, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellee argued that the Act violated the Fifth Amendment because it required that a person submit to \u201cany questions the police officers might have for them\u201d while in a \u201ccustodial situation.\u201d He asserted that the Act was vague because it required the registrant to give \u201c[a]ny other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner under this sub title.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>argued that the registrant was subject to a \u201cfull trilemma,\u201d explaining: \u201cYou can\u2019t remain silent. If you say something it will be used against you. And if you lie you will be charged too because providing false information is also a crime. Also a violation of the statute. And on top of that you also have no lawyer.\u201d Finally, appellee argued that the Act violated the separation of powers doctrine because the \u201ccommissioner is acting as a defacto legislature,\u201d and it violated equal protection principles because Baltimore City residents were subject to treatment different from non-city registrants under the Act, resulting in \u201csentencing enhancements on a state law that punishes people who live in the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The State argued that the court should deny the motion to dismiss. It asserted that the Act was not vague because it is clear \u201cwhat he needs to do as far as reporting. What information he needs to provide. And how often and where he needs to report.\u201d It further argued that the Act did not violate the Fifth Amendment because the registrant is \u201cnot in a custodial situation.\u201d Regarding the separation of powers argument, the State maintained that \u201cthe Police Commissioner is enforcing the law that is set out by the City Council,\u201d and regarding equal protection, it asserted that \u201cthe Supreme Court has reasoned that residence is not a fundamental constitutional right nor is it a classification that the Court has listed for areas of heightened scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">On April 8, 2011, after the parties filed additional memoranda, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion. It gave \u201cthree basic reasons\u201d for its ruling: (1) the Police Commissioner had failed to comply with the requirement that all regulations must be filed with the Department of Legislative Reference (\u201cDLR\u201d); (2) \u201cthe citizens of Baltimore City have not been given constitutionally] sufficient notice of the substance of the regulations;\u201d and (3) the Act was \u201cunconstitutionally vague and awfully broad\u201d and \u201clacks the specificity of regulatory language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In a Memorandum Opinion issued the same day, the court, as discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>elaborated on these state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ments. The court additionally discussed appellee\u2019s arguments based on preemption, equal protection, and protection against self-incrimination, rejecting these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">On April 27, 2011, the State timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">When we review a circuit court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, \u201c \u2018our task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Menefee v. State, </em>417 Md. 740, 747, 12 A.3d 153 (2011) (quoting <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 618, 994 A.2d 411 (2010)). \u201c[W]e assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and allegations in the complaint, as well as the reasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Forster v. Office of Pub. Defender, </em>426 Md. 565, 579, 45 A.3d 180 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">THE ACT\u2019S FILING REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The State\u2019s first issue involves the circuit court\u2019s finding that the charges should be dismissed because the Police Commissioner did not comply with the provisions of the Act providing that regulations must be filed with DLR. Section 60-2 of the Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">a) <em>Commissioner may adopt.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">The Police Commissioner may adopt rules and regulations to carry out this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">b) <em>Scope.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-15\">These rules and regulations may govern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">(1) the form and content of the registration required under this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-17\">(2) the documentation required to verify the content of the registration required under this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(3) the maintenance, use, and availability of the information that is collected by the Police Commissioner under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">c) <em>Filing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">A copy of all rules and regulations adopted under this subtitle must be filed with the Department of Legislative Reference before they take effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Recognizing that the language \u201cmay\u201d in a statute usually connotes discretion, whereas the word \u201cmust\u201d is viewed as \u201crequired or obliged by law,\u201d <em>Gazunis v. Foster, </em>400 Md. 541, 565, 929 A.2d 531 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 113, 956 A.2d 202 (2008), both parties agree that the ordinance gives the Police Commissioner discretion whether to adopt regulations, but if the commissioner exercises that discretion and adopts such regulations, it is mandatory that they be filed with DLR. The issues here are: (1) whether the Commissioner exercised his discretion and adopted regulations pursuant to \u00a7 60-2; and (2) if so, whether that requires dismissal of the charges against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Appellee\u2019s argument in this regard is based on \u00a7 60-5, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">(a) <em>In general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">The registration must be in the form and contain the information that the Police Commissioner requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">(b) <em>Specific information.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">The registration must specify:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">(1) the gun offender\u2019s name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">(2) a description of the crime for which he or she was convicted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">(3) the date the gun offender was convicted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-17\">(4) any other name by which the gun offender has been legally known;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-18\">(5) a list of all aliases that the gun offender has used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(6) identifying factors of the gun offender, including a physical description;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(7) the gun offender\u2019s residence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(8) any other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Appellee argues that \u201c[t]he existence of a detailed acknowledgment form that offenders must sign and the existence of an equally detailed registration form that police must fill out indicate that the Police Commissioner exercised the discretion given to him ... [and] adopted rules and regulations to carry out the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The circuit court agreed, finding that \u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s registration forms are the embodiment of regulations and subject to the filing requirements of \u00a7 60-2(c),\u201d stating that they are \u201cenforcement devices that affect the substantive penal rights of prescribed gun offenders and possess both a general application and future effect.\u201d The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">within the forms, the Commissioner requires all sorts of additional information from the offender that was not specifically enumerated in the ordinance, e.g., the name, address, and phone number of the nearest relatives and friends, their relationship with the offender, the offender\u2019s occupation, vehicle information, and \u201cGang Affiliation/ Source of Information.\u201d All, arguably, pursuant to the regulatory authority given to the Commissioner by GORA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The court further found that, if the mandatory filing \u201cdoes not occur, the rules and regulations do not take legal effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqF\">The State contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the Police Commissioner \u201chad issued de facto regulations without filing the same with DLR, rendering GORA without legal force and effect, and thus requiring dismissal of the charging document.\u201d The State advances several arguments in this regard. First, it asserts that appellee \u201chas suffered no injury relating to, and thus has no standing to challenge, his allegations of error.\u201d Second, addressing the substance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>appellee\u2019s claim before the circuit court, the State argues that, \u201cin the relevant period, the Police Commissioner did not issue regulations implicating the regulatory filing requirement relied upon by appellee.\u201d Third, the State contends that, even if the forms issued by the Police Commissioner did amount to de facto regulations, \u201cthe administrative filing requirement contained in GORA does not preclude a regulation, let alone the law itself, from being in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Appellee argues that the circuit court properly granted his Motion to Dismiss. He asserts that \u201cthe Gun Offender Registration Act is without legal effect because the Police Commissioner failed to file a copy of \u2018All Rules and Regulations\u2019 with the [DLR] as required by the Act.\u201d He contends that he \u201chas standing to challenge the Act on the grounds that the Police Commissioner did not comply with the Act\u2019s filing requirement\u201d because he \u201cdid in fact suffer injury or harm arising from the Commissioner\u2019s blatant disregard of the Act\u2019s requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The State asserts that, because appellee was \u201con notice of both the location of the GORA Office and the form and contents of the registration form,\u201d he did not suffer any injury or harm from the Police Commissioner\u2019s failure to formally issue or file the forms as regulations. It argues, therefore, that appellee has no standing to pursue his claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Appellee argues that he does have \u201cstanding to challenge the Act on the grounds that the Police Commissioner did not comply with the Act\u2019s filing requirement.\u201d He asserts that he did suffer injury or harm from the Police Commissioner\u2019s failure to properly file regulations in accordance with \u00a7 60-2(c). Specifically, he contends that, because \u00a7 60-5 of the Act \u201cstates that offenders will be required to provide \u2018any other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner under this subtitle,\u2019 \u201d and because the Commissioner failed to file any regulations, he was \u201cleft to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>speculate as to what information might be required from him at re-registration,\u201d and therefore, he was prevented \u201cfrom seeking the advice of counsel as to whether he could refuse to answer certain questions,\u201d and prevented \u201cfrom making a reasoned decision about whether he should comply with the re-registration process.\u201d He argues that his awareness of the contents of the Registration Form that was used at his initial registration \u201cdoes not change this conclusion\u201d because: (1) the form contained a section captioned \u201cadditional information\u201d; and (2) he had \u201cno assurance that the same form and the same questions would be used at his re-registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The circuit court rejected the State\u2019s argument that appellee had no standing to contest the Police Commissioner\u2019s failure to file the registration form with DLR because he had notice of the re-registration requirements, and therefore, he suffered no harm. The court stated that appellee \u201cwas unable to balance his constitutional rights, e.g., privilege against self-incrimination, without knowing the substance of the regulation beforehand,\u201d and he \u201crightfully argues that he does not know or have notice of when, where or how he could inspect the registration form, etc., to make an informed decision on how to proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">As this Court recently explained, \u201c[standing is a threshold issue; a party may proceed only if he demonstrates that he has a real and justiciable interest that is capable of being resolved through litigation.\u201d <em>Norman v. Borison, </em>192 Md.App. 405, 420, 994 A.2d 1019 (2010), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>418 Md. 630, 17 A.3d 697 (2011). \u201cIn order to have standing, a party must demonstrate an \u2018injury-in-fact,\u2019 or \u2018an actual legal stake in the matter being adjudicated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hand v. Mfrs. &amp; Traders Trust Co., </em>405 Md. 375, 399, 952 A.2d 240 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Here, we agree with the State that appellee has no standing to argue that the Acknowledgment Form constituted a regulation. To be sure, this form listed the location of the GORA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the State notes, however, and appellee does not dispute, it is clear that appellee \u201cwas repeatedly informed of, and did in fact know,\u201d the location of the place to register. Thus, even if the Acknowledgment Form did constitute a regulation, appellee was not harmed by the Police Commissioner\u2019s failure to file it with DLR, and he has no standing to challenge any such failure to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The main argument in this case involves the Registration Form, and whether it constitutes a regulation by containing fields to obtain information other than that set forth in \u00a7 60 \u2014 5(b)(1)\u2014(7). As indicated, appellee argues that he was injured in this regard because he did not know what information he would be asked at re-registration, and therefore, he could not ask counsel if he could refuse to answer questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Although the State is correct that the Acknowledgment Form presented to appellee when he completed his initial registration provided him with notice that he was required to re-register, neither that form, nor the Registration Form itself, indicated what information he would be required to provide upon verification of his registration after six months. Appellee has standing to challenge whether the Registration Form constituted a regulation specifying the \u201cother information\u201d required. Thus, we turn to the merits of the argument, whether regulations were adopted, and if so, the effect of the failure to file such regulations with DLR.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The State contends that, \u201cin the relevant period, the Police Commissioner did not issue regulations implicating the regulatory filing requirement\u201d set forth in \u00a7 60-2(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that the form upon which the Baltimore City Police Department conducts registrations and re-registrations is \u201cnot a de facto regulation requiring formal issuance and filing.\u201d Rather, it asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">The registration form is an internal [Baltimore City Police Department] office document upon which the Gun Offender Monitoring Unit collects information and has gun offenders review and verify that information\u2019s accuracy. Reflective of the fact that the registration form does not require the issuance of a regulation is that the form itself is a creature of the ordinance: \u201c[t]he registration must be in the form and contain the information that the Police Commissioner requires,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 60-5(a); \u201c[t]he registration must be signed and dated by the gun offender,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 60-5(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In any event, the State argues, \u201cthe administrative filing requirement contained in GORA does not preclude a regulation, let alone the law itself, from being in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Appellee argues that the \u201cexistence of a detailed acknowledgment form that offenders must sign and the existence of an equally detailed registration form that police must fill out, indicate that the Police Commissioner exercised\u201d his discretion pursuant to \u00a7 60-2(a) of the Act and \u201cadopted rules and regulations to carry out the Act.\u201d He asserts that, because the Police Commissioner failed to file these regulations with DLR in accordance with the mandatory language of \u00a7 60-2(c), the Act is \u201cwithout legal effect,\u201d and the circuit court properly granted his motion to dismiss the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In determining the meaning of the term \u201cregulation,\u201d we apply well settled principles of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body, and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 490, 61 A.3d 794 (2013) (quoting <em>Doe v. Montgomery County Bd. of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 712-13, 962 A.2d 342 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In light of these principles, we start by looking to the language of the Act itself and whether it provides a definition of \u201cregulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 61 A.3d 794. The Act does not define the term. Thus, we turn to a dictionary to seek guidance on the meaning of the word regulation. <em>See id. </em>(looking to a dictionary definition to help determine the meaning of a statutory term). Regulation is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201c[a] rule or order, having legal force, [usually] issued by an administrative agency.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1311 (8th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We also find instructive the definition of the term in the Maryland Annotated Code, noting that the State Government Article defines the term \u201cregulation\u201d as \u201ca statement or an amendment or repeal of a statement that (i) has general application; (ii) has future effect; [and] (iii) is adopted by a unit\u201d to \u201c(1) detail or carry out a law that the unit administers; (2) govern organization of the unit; (3) govern the procedure of the unit; or (4) govern practice before the unit.\u201d A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>regulation can be \u201cin any form,\u201d including: (1) a guideline; (2) a rule; (3) a standard; (4) a statement of interpretation; or (5) a statement of policy. Md.Code (2009 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-101(g) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d). A regulation does not include, however, a statement that \u201cconcerns only internal management of the unit\u201d and \u201cdoes not affect directly the rights of the public or the procedures available to the public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Applying these definitions, we agree with the State that the Registration Form is not a \u201cregulation.\u201d The form does not constitute a statement, rule, or order. Rather, it merely is an internal document to assist the police in complying with the provisions of the ordinance. <em>See Wacha v. Kandiyohi County Welfare Board, </em>308 Minn. 418, 242 N.W.2d 837, 839 (1976) (Bulletin that was \u201cmerely a restatement of existing welfare policy and a directive concerning internal management\u201d that \u201cwas intended merely to implement existing law\u201d was \u201cnot a rule within the definition of a rule in the [Minnesota] Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">To be sure, as appellee notes, the form included \u201cother information\u201d as specified in \u00a7 60-5(b), such as \u201cgang affiliation.\u201d There is no evidence in the record, however, that this information was asked of registrants, much less required by the police. Indeed, as counsel for the State noted at oral argument, it can be inferred that the Registration Form contains fields clearly intended only for internal management, such as the \u201ccc #,\u201d which the State advised was the central complaint number, information unlikely to be asked of a registrant. The record does not support a finding that the form was a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">As indicated, the Police Commissioner has now filed regulations, which state that they are to \u201cestablish procedures to carry out the registration\u201d as set forth in the Act. With respect to the information that a gun offender must supply, the regulations provide that the gun offender will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">3. provide the following information which will be recorded on the Gun Offender Registration (Attachment 2):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>(A) the gun offender\u2019s name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">(B) a description of the crime for which the gun offender was convicted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">(C) the date that the gun offender was convicted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">(D) any other name by which the gun offender has been legally known;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">(E) a list of all aliases that the gun offender has used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">(F) identifying factors of the gun offender, including a physical description to include date of birth, sex, height, weight, eye color, hair color, any scars, and any visible tattoos; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(G) the gun offender\u2019s residence and home and cellular phone numbers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">In addition to the above information, the Gun Offender Registration will also contain the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">(A) the gun offender\u2019s date of registration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-14\">(B) the gun offender\u2019s next six month verification date; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\">(C) the date that the gun offender\u2019s duty to register expires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">Regs. Balt. City Code art. 19 \u00a7 60 (2011) (filed with Baltimore City Department of Legislative Reference).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This statement, which sets forth the rules that the police will follow, constitutes a regulation. The mere form at issue here, which does not even indicate what information a registrant must supply, is not a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">In any event, even if the Registration Form could be considered a regulation, the failure to file the form with DLR does not necessarily justify dismissal of the charges against appellee. The State argues that \u201c[t]he filing requirement in GORA does not operate to delay a regulation\u2019s effective date but rather serves as an independent administrative dictate aimed at insuring that the City possesses copies of all agency regulations at a centralized location.\u201d It further contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that, \u201ceven assuming that a regulation is not effective until filed, there is no basis to thus conclude that the entire ordinance, validly enacted by the City Council and clear on its face, is rendered inoperative until an implementing regulation is filed with DLR.\u201d \u201c[T]here is absolutely no articulable reason to accept Appellee\u2019s contention that the entire unambiguous and detailed ordinance is rendered inoperative until a regulation is filed.\u201d The State asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">Appellee was charged with failing to appear and re-register; this obligation \u2014 and thus Appellee\u2019s violation \u2014 is entirely separate and apart from the alleged regulations at issue in this case. Appellee\u2019s legal duty to re-register is created by the plain text of the ordinance itself and is not dependent on any action or inaction by the Police Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Appellee argues that \u00a7 60-2(c) of the Act plainly states: \u201cA copy of all rules and regulations adopted under this subtitle <em>must </em>be filed with the [DLR] <em>before </em>they take effect.\u201d Because the Act could not be implemented if the regulations that were adopted to carry it out were not in effect, appellee argues, the Act was without legal effect at the time he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We agree with the State that, even if forms did constitute regulations, they did not invalidate the Act or appellee\u2019s duty to re-register pursuant to the Act. Appellee asserts that the Act provides that gun offenders have to provide \u201c\u2018any other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7 60 \u2014 5(b)(8), but if regulations are not filed, they have no way to determine what information they must provide. Our reading of the Act, however, is that a gun offender must provide the specific information listed in the Act, as well as other information set forth in regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner. If regulations listing additional information to be provided are not adopted and filed, a gun offender could refuse to give the information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under those circumstances, a gun offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>would have an argument that he did not violate the statute. That, however, did not happen here. Appellee simply failed to re-register, as required. The Commissioner\u2019s failure to file the forms, if they constituted regulations, had no effect on appellee\u2019s duty to re-register, and it did not justify the court\u2019s dismissal of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">VAGUENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The State next contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the Act was \u201cvoid for vagueness in violation of the United States and Maryland Constitutions.\u201d It asserts that the Act \u201cclearly and unambiguously spells out the law\u2019s requirements, the prohibited conduct, and the potential penalties for non-compliance,\u201d and the Act\u2019s \u201cdelegation of regulatory authority to the [Police Commissioner] does not create an unconstitutionally vague enforcement regime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Appellee contends that the court properly determined that the charges against him should be dismissed because \u201cthe Act is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>In </em>support, he points to subsection \u00a7 60 \u2014 5(b)(8) of the Act, which, as indicated, requires a gun offender to provide, in addition to seven specified items of information, \u201cany other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner.\u201d Appellee argues that this provision fails to give \u201cfair notice\u201d of the information a gun offender might be required to provide, asserting that the \u201cAct provides absolutely no guidelines, either explicit or implicit,\u201d on what the police might seek, and it provides no limitations on what the police might ask.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>In its reply brief, the State argues that \u00a7 60 \u2014 5(b)(8), a provision that it deems \u201ccommonplace,\u201d does not render the law, or any portion of it, vague. In support of this argument, the State points to other federal and state statutes that contain similar language and have not been found to be unconstitutionally vague. <em>See e.g. </em>Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16914(a)(7) (2006) (\u201cThe sex offender shall provide the following information ... (7) Any other information required by the Attorney General\u201d); Gun Offender Registration Act, Admin. Code of New York City, \u00a7 10-603(c)(6) (2013) (\u201cA gun offender shall ... provide the following information to the department: ... Any other information deemed pertinent by the department.\u201d). It further contends that, even if the regulatory provisions of the Act are void because they are unconstitutionally vague, this Court should sever those provisions and uphold the remaining valid parts of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">This Court recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">In deciding the constitutionality of a statute, we begin with the presumption that the statute is valid. <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 610, 781 A.2d 851 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1547, 152 L.Ed.2d 472 (2002). We will not find a statute unconstitutional if, \u201c \u2018by any construction, it can be sustained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611 [781 A.2d 851] (quoting <em>Beauchamp v. Somerset County, </em>256 Md. 541, 547, 261 A.2d 461 (1970)). When the challenge to a statute is based on vagueness, the burden of establishing unconstitutionality is on the party attacking the statute. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\"><em>Livingston v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 553, 568, 995 A.2d 812 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">When considering whether a law is void for vagueness, courts consider two criteria. <em>McFarlin v. State, </em>409 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>391, 411, 975 A.2d 862 (2009). \u201cThe first criterion is that a statute must be \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them hable to its penalties.\u2019\u201d <em>Livingston, </em>192 Md.App. at 568, 995 A.2d 812 (quoting <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 458-59, 569 A.2d 604 (1990)). The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c[t]he standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is \u2018whether persons of \u201ccommon intelligence must necessarily guess at [the statute\u2019s] meaning.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 8, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992)). A statute does not fail for vagueness \u201csimply because it requires conformity to an imprecise normative standard,\u201d nor is it vague \u201cif the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, <em>if </em>they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Livingston, </em>192 Md.App. at 569, 995 A.2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The second criterion pertains to enforcement of the statute, and it requires \u201c \u2018that criminal statutes provide \u201clegally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615-16, 781 A.2d 851). \u201cTo survive analysis, a statute must \u2018eschew arbitrary enforcement in addition to being intelligible to the reasonable person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615-16, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 9, 616 A.2d 1275). \u201c[A] statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 781 A.2d 851. Rather, \u201c[i]t is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As indicated, appellee argues that \u00a7 60-(b)(8) is unconstitutionally vague because it does not provide adequate notice \u201cof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>what information a gun offender might be required to provide.\u201d The circuit court agreed, stating that \u201conly after the gun offender arrives at the place designated by the Police Commissioner is he/she told the rules and requirements\u201d of the Act. The court stated: \u201cThe rules and regulations are not simply unclear, they are unknown and unreviewable outside of the walls of the Police Department. Gun offenders are left with no fair notice on how to proceed.\u201d The court stated that the practice \u201centrusts the Police Department to create, apply and modify regulations not only in secret but in a wholly arbitrary fashion\u201d and it \u201cgives the police the discretion to transform the registration process from an information-gathering document to an interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We disagree with the circuit court\u2019s decision to dismiss the charges on the grounds of vagueness for several reasons. First, we note that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, the application of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is based on the application of the statute to the \u2018facts at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 616, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 122, 389 A.2d 341 (1978)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, we look to whether the Act is impermissibly vague as applied to appellee\u2019s conduct. In that regard, we note that appellee was not charged with failing to give \u201cother information\u201d requested by the police, but rather, he was charged with failing to appear to re-register, as required. The Act is not impermissibly vague as applied to appellee\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Second, even if appellee is permitted to challenge the Act on it face, we hold that the Act is not unconstitutionally vague. Section 60-5(b)(8) of the Act sets forth specific information that a gun offender must provide, as well as \u201cany other information required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Police Commissioner under this subtitle.\u201d As we have indicated, if no regulations are filed, the gun offender is required to give only the listed information. If the regulations are filed, there is a way for a gun offender to determine what information will be required upon registration. The Act provides \u201cfair notice\u201d of its requirements and provides adequate guidelines for the enforcement of the law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Third, even if \u00a7 60-5(b)(8) was unconstitutionally vague, dismissal of the charges would not be warranted because only that provision would be severed and the remainder of the statute would remain. As the Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cThere is a strong presumption that if a portion of an enactment is found to be invalid, the intent is that such portion be severed.\u201d <em>Board of Supervisors of Elections v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 245-46, 608 A.2d 1222 (1992). <em>Accord Sugarloaf Citizens Assoc. v. Gudis, </em>319 Md. 558, 574, 573 A.2d 1325 (1990). This presumption applies to bills enacted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the General Assembly and to local ordinances. <em>Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54, 83, 344 A.2d 422 (1975), and it \u201capplies even in the absence of an express clause declaring the drafters\u2019 intent that the enactment be severed if a portion is found to be invalid.\u201d <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, </em>290 Md. 553, 575, 431 A.2d 663 (1981). Moreover, \u201c[i]n addition to this general presumption, it is a settled principle that \u2018[w]hen the dominant purpose of an enactment may largely be carried out notwithstanding the [enactment\u2019s] partial invalidity, courts will generally hold the valid portions severable and enforce them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>327 Md. at 246, 608 A.2d 1222 (quoting <em>O.C. Taxpayers v. Ocean City, </em>280 Md. 585, 601, 375 A.2d 541 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Accordingly, even if the part of the Act identified by appellee was void for vagueness, the remainder of the Act was valid. Appellee was still obligated to re-register and verify his name, address, and other information as enumerated in \u00a7 60-5(b)(1)-(7). The charges against appellee for failure to do so were improperly dismissed on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague. <em>See Santos v. State, </em>284 Ga. 514, 668 S.E.2d 676, 680 (2008) (decision rendering unconstitutional the address registration requirement as applied to homeless sex offenders with no street address does not exempt such offenders from reporting other information required under the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellee contends that, even if we disagree with the circuit court\u2019s rationale for granting the motion to dismiss, we should uphold the ultimate ruling dismissing the charges on any of three grounds. His first contention in this regard is that the Act violates equal protection principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The circuit court rejected appellee\u2019s equal protection argument. That does not, however, preclude us from considering this issue. As the Court of Appeals recently explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cIn the interest of judicial efficiency, we may affirm the judgment of a trial court to grant a motion to dismiss on a different ground than that relied upon by the trial court, as long as the alternative ground is before the Court properly on the record.\u201d <em>Forster, </em>426 Md. at 580-81, 45 A.3d 180. <em>Accord State v. Rush, </em>174 Md.App. 259, 289, 921 A.2d 334 (2007) (This Court may \u201caffirm the circuit court\u2019s decision on any ground adequately shown by the record.\u201d), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>403 Md. 68, 939 A.2d 689 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Appellee\u2019s equal protection contention is premised on the distinctions in the Act based on residence. He notes that a gun offender is defined as a person convicted of a gun offense in a Baltimore City court. He further notes that \u201c[g]un offenders who are residents of Baltimore City are subject to additional requirements.\u201d He explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">Specifically, those offenders are required to report to the designated office every six months for a period of three years \u201cto verify and update, as appropriate, the contents of the registration.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 60-6(b) <em>&amp; </em>60-7. Additionally, a Baltimore City gun offender must personally appear at the designated office \u201cwithin 10 calendar days after moving from one residence in Baltimore City to another residence in Baltimore City.\u201d \u00a7 60-6(c)(2). He must also appear \u201cbefore moving from a residence in Baltimore City and assuming a new residence out of Baltimore City.\u201d \u00a7 60-6(c)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">The Act, therefore, imposes different requirements on different categories of people. First, the Act distinguishes between those who are convicted of a gun offense in a Baltimore City [cjourt and those who are convicted of a gun offense elsewhere. If a Baltimore City resident is convicted of a gun offense in a neighboring jurisdiction, he is not required to register. If a County resident is convicted of a gun offense in a Baltimore City [cjourt, he is required to register. Second, among offenders who are subject to the registration requirement, the Act distinguishes between offenders who live in Baltimore City and those who do not. If a Baltimore City resident is convicted of a gun offense in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Baltimore City [cjourt, he is required to register with the Police Commissioner every six months for three years. He is also required to notify the Commissioner whenever he moves. If a County resident is convicted of a gun offense in a Baltimore City [c]ourt, he is only required to register once, and he is not required to report changes in residence. Both sets of distinctions violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Appellee asserts that, in reviewing the constitutionality of the Act on equal protection grounds, we should apply strict scrutiny because the Act \u201cinfringe[s] on fundamental rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The State disagrees. It asserts that appellee\u2019s argument \u201crelies on classifications concerning jurisdiction of residence and jurisdiction of conviction,\u201d and \u201c[bjecause these classifications do not involve a suspect class like race or gender, and do not infringe on any fundamental rights,\u201d the proper standard of review is rational basis. Applying rational basis review, the State contends, results in a finding that the Act does not violate principles of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The Court of Appeals has explained that there are \u201cthree levels of constitutional scrutiny employed in our jurisprudence when a legislative enactment is challenged under either [ ] due process or equal protection concepts.\u201d <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 272, 982 A.2d 571 (2007). The three classifications are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201c[T]he top tier of [constitutional] review contemplates that when a statute creates a distinction based upon clearly \u2018suspect\u2019 criteria, or when that enactment infringes upon personal rights or interests deemed to be \u2018fundamental,\u2019 then the legislative product must withstand a rigorous, \u2018strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d When utilizing this most-demanding standard of constitutional review, we deem unconstitutional a challenged legislative classification unless the distinction formed by it is \u201cnecessary to promote a compelling government interest.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">In contrast, we generally employ the least exacting and most deferential standard of constitutional review when the legislative action under review neither interferes significantly with a fundamental right nor implicates a suspect classification. Under this \u201crational basis\u201d level of scrutiny, the classification will pass constitutional muster so long as it is \u201crationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d In other words, we will uphold the statute under rational basis review \u201cunless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that [the court] can only conclude that the [governmental] actions were irrational.\u201d Statutes reviewed pursuant to this level of scrutiny are presumed constitutional, \u201cand will be invalidated only if the classification is clearly arbitrary.\u201d \u201c[A] classification [subject to rational basis review] having some reasonable basis need not be made with mathematical nicety and may result in some inequality\u201d so long as the [S]tate can produce any conceivable \u201cstate of facts\u201d to justify the distinction. A statute subject to rational review often passes constitutional muster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">A third level of review has arisen to leaven the rigid two-tiered constitutional framework by which courts review the constitutionality of government action. A \u201cheightened\u201d level of scrutiny, otherwise known as \u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d is triggered when the challenged action creates a classification \u201cwhich ha[s] been subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny than the traditional and deferential rational basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>test, but which ha[s] not [yet] been deemed to involve suspect classes or fundamental rights.\u201d This middle-tier scrutiny may be implicated to review a \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d classification. In order to survive this intermediate level of scrutiny, the statute in question \u201cmust serve important government objectives and must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><em>Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v.

GORA does impose additional requirements on gun offenders who reside in Baltimore City following release from jail, but this distinction is entirely reasonable: the Mayor and City Council may have concluded that gun offenders living in other jurisdictions pose a less serious or immediate threat to the safety of City residents. GORA also imposes no registration requirements on persons who are convicted of qualifying gun crimes in jurisdictions other than Baltimore City, but this, too, is a reasonable choice: the Mayor and City Council may have concluded that, regardless of residence, the administrative burdens affiliated with registering such offenders outweighed the benefit, or that persons who commit firearm offenses outside of the City are less likely to be involved with criminal activity inside the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Initially, with respect to the Act\u2019s applicability only to people convicted of gun crimes in Baltimore City, we note that the Act, as a local ordinance, is properly limited to crimes committed in Baltimore City. <em>See Chairman of the Bd. of Tr. of Employees\u2019 Ret.

Kriss, </em>191 Md. 568, 573, 62 A.2d 568 (1948)). Moreover, with respect to the additional provisions related to residents of Baltimore City, it is well-established that crime prevention is a legitimate governmental interest. <em>See McDowell v. State, </em>407 Md. 327, 333-34, 965 A.2d 877 (2009) (weighing the government\u2019s interest in crime detection against other concerns); <em>Rojas v.

We agree with the State that the geographic distinctions in the Act are rationally related to the Act\u2019s crime prevention purpose. Accordingly, we hold that appellee has not met his burden of establishing that the Act violates the guarantees of equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">SEPARATION OF POWERS</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Appellee\u2019s next contention is that the Act violates separation of powers principles. He contends that, even though this issue was not addressed by the circuit court, dismissal of the charges against him can be upheld on this ground. <em>See Forster, </em>426 Md. at 580-81, 45 A.3d 180 (appellate court may affirm circuit court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss on a ground different from that relied on by the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Appellant relies on Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides: \u201cThat the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of the Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d Md. Decl. of Rights art. 8. Although acknowledging that the legislature \u201cmay grant an executive branch agency rulemaking authority and that the executive branch agency may use that authority to issue rules and regulations,\u201d appellee argues that the City Council\u2019s delegation of authority to the Police Commissioner \u201cto determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>what information a gun offender is required to provide at the time of registration or re-registration\u201d \u201cfar exceeds the scope of permitted rulemaking\u201d because it \u201ceffectively granted the Commissioner the power to enact a criminal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The State contends that the delegation of authority in the Act does not violate separation of powers principles, but rather, it \u201creflects a considered, careful, and commonplace judgment by the City Council and Mayor.\u201d It asserts that \u201cthe regulatory model adopted by [the Act] is a hallmark of the American legal system: the legislative branch sets forth the law while the executive branch establishes the framework and operational details necessary' to carry it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We find instructive the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Christ v. Maryland Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 441, 644 A.2d 34 (1994). In that case, the Court noted that Md.Code (1993 Supp.) \u00a7 8-704 of the Natural Resources Article, encompassed within the \u201cState Boat Act\u201d subtitle, provided: \u201cThe Department may adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this subtitle\u201d and \u201cshall adopt regulations governing the ... operations of any vessels subject to this subtitle so that each vessel complying with the regulations may be operated with equal freedom or under similar requirements on all waters of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431 n. 2, 644 A.2d 34. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources enacted a regulation, COMAR 08.18.02.05A, that prohibited \u201cthe operation of personal watercraft in Maryland waters by any individual who is less than 14 years old.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 431, 644 A.2d 34. Mr. Christ, who was under the age of 14, challenged the regulation, arguing, in part, that the regulation violated the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches because \u201can age restriction for operating a particular type of vessel involves a \u2018fundamental policy making decision\u2019 that \u2018can only be done by the General Assembly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 644 A.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the regulation did not violate the separation of powers. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 644 A.2d 34. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">Of course, the General Assembly cannot constitutionally delegate to another body its \u201cfundamental decision making authority\u201d in the sense that it cannot delegate a function which the Constitution expressly and unqualifiedly vests in the General Assembly itself. Thus the General Assembly could not delegate to an administrative agency its power to impeach, to propose constitutional amendments, or to enact statutes. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan [v. Board of License Com\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s </em>County] 293 Md. [113] at 124 [442 A.2d 558 (1982) ] (\u201cManifestly, the power delegated to an administrative agency to make rules is not the power to make laws\u201d); <em>Comm\u2019n On Med. Discipline v.

Nevertheless, when the General Assembly enacts a statute, embodying its policy decision or decisions, the Legislature often must delegate significant authority to the executive branch which is vested with the constitutional responsibility of administering the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">As previously discussed, this authority delegated to executive branch agencies may include a broad power to promulgate legislative-type rules or regulations in order to implement the statute. Such rules or regulations will often, of necessity, embody significant discretionary policy determinations. Nonetheless, this Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of administrative regulations reflecting policy determinations which have been just as \u201cfundamental\u201d as the age restriction embodied in COMAR 08.18.02.05A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asl\"><em>Id. </em>at 444-45, 644 A.2d 34. <em>See also Lussier v.

It further contends that the Act \u201cdoes not govern the ownership or sale of firearms,\u201d but rather, it \u201cfocuses on the post-conviction status of persons who have been found guilty of certain gun-related crimes.\u201d It continues: \u201cWhile State law prohibits such persons from owning or possessing guns,\u201d the Act \u201cimposes certain registration and verification requirements on those persons. This legal and policy area is not touched upon by State law and there is accordingly no basis upon which to find preemption of any sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c \u2018state law may preempt local law in one of three ways: 1) preemption by conflict, 2) express preemption, or 3) implied preemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montrose Christian Sch.

A form is attached to this regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">. We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that a regulation is effective even if not filed. The plain language of the Act states: \u201cA copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of all mies and regulations adopted under this subtitle must be filed with the [DLR] before they take effect.\u201d \u00a7 60-2(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\">. Appellee also points to \u00a7 60-5(e), which provides: \"The Police Commissioner may require the gun offender to provide documentation that verifies the contents of the registration,\u201d in asserting that the Act is void for vagueness. This contention was not addressed by the circuit court, which is understandable because it was not adequately raised as an issue below. Although there was a reference to this subsection in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>pleadings, it was a fleeting reference, raised for the first time in the appellee's reply to the State's surrebuttal to appellee\u2019s motion. Under these circumstances, the contention is not sufficiently preserved for this Court\u2019s review. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">. A different rule governs, however, where the statute intrudes on \"fundamental constitutional liberties, particularly the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and assembly.\u201d <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 122, 389 A.2d 341 (1978). \"Because of the potential 'chilling effect\u2019 that vagueness can have on First Amendment liberties, permitting a defendant to challenge a statute on its face for vagueness becomes a \u2018rule of standing which allows a defendant to challenge the validity of a statute even though the statute as applied to the defendant is constitutional.\u2019 \" <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 617, 781 A.2d 851 (2001) (quoting <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>State, </em>335 Md. 602, 625, 645 A.2d 22 (1994)), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1547, 152 L.Ed.2d 472 (2002). Here, appellee has not asserted any First Amendment issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. Indeed, as the State notes, there are many other federal and state registration statutes, particularly sex offender registration statutes, that have a similar requirement. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16914(a)(7) (\"sex offender shall provide the following information ...

Proc. Ann. art. \u00a7 62.051(c)(8) (2012) (a sex offender registering in Texas must provide listed information and \"any other information required by the department\u201d); Gun Offender Registration Act, Admin. Code of New York City, \u00a7 10-603(c)(6) (2013) (\"A gun offender shall ... provide the following information to the department: ...
