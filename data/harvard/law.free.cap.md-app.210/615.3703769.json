Following an eight-day trial, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City returned a verdict in favor of appellee for a total of $5,100,000, including $900,000 in economic damages for lost earning capacity and $4,200,000 in non-economic damages. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>post-trial motion, the circuit court reduced the non-economic damages award to $350,000 in accordance with the cap on non-economic damages, thereby reducing the total award to $1,250,000. After the denial of other post-trial motions and imposition of sanctions in the amount of $10,135.45 against appellant and in the amount of $10,000 against appellant\u2019s counsel, William C. Parler, Jr., appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">On appeal, appellant presents nine issues, which we consolidate and quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">I. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion when it[: (1) ] erroneously denied [a]ppellant\u2019s motions to exclude the testimony of Dr. Eric Sundel despite Dr. Sundel\u2019s complete lack of experience in treating patients with lead exposure, diagnosing injuries based on lead exposure, or determining the source of an alleged exposure ... [; and (2) ] disregarded, in violation of Maryland Rule 5-702, the fact that Dr. Sundel had no factual basis upon which to base his opinions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">II. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion in denying [a]ppellant\u2019s motions to exclude Christopher White as an expert regarding the testing conducted by A[rc] Environmental given that Mr. White was not present for the testing, had limited experience with the equipment used, and was unable to operate the equipment when challenged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">III. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion when it allowed the reports of A[rc] Environmental into evidence despite the known flaws regarding the equipment used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">IV. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion when it denied [a]ppellant\u2019s motion to amend or alter the jury verdict regarding economic damages despite the fact that there was no legal or factual basis for the award and the award was not reduced to present value as required by Maryland law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>V. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion when it denied [appellant\u2019s motion to amend or alter the jury verdict and allowed the verdict to exceed the liability insurance amount carried by [appellant, a charitable organization with immunity under Maryland law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">VI. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion by violating [appellant\u2019s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights when it ordered post-trial sanctions against [appellant in the amount of $10,135.45?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">VII. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion when it ordered sanctions against [appellant\u2019s counsel in the amount of $10,000 for failure to produce documents responsive to discovery requests in violation of [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">VIII. Whether the [circuit] court committed legal error or abused its discretion when it quashed [appellant\u2019s subpoena to obtain the records of the jury commissioner and denied [appellant\u2019s motion for new trial challenging the admittance of an unqualified and biased juror onto the panel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer questions I, VI, and VII in the affirmative. In light of our answer to question I, we do not address questions III, IV, V, or VIII, and briefly address question II for guidance. We vacate the circuit court\u2019s imposition of sanctions against appellant in the amount of $10,135.45 and against William C. Parler, Jr. in the amount of $10,000. We, therefore, reverse and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Appellee was born November 23, 1990. Appellee resided at 4 North Stockton from July 1993 through 2000, where she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>allegedly exposed to lead paint. Having purchased the property on December 30, 1986, appellant owned 4 North Stockton during the period in which appellee resided at the property. Appellee\u2019s blood-lead levels were tested and reported on seven separate occasions \u2014 on October 8, 1992, April 8, 1993, July 16, 1993, August 16, 1994, April 18, 1995, July 17, 1995, and November 3,1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">(1) Pretrial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"AlWe\">(a) Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">On May 28, 2009, appellee filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellant and Barry Mankowitz, the person who \u201cmanaged, maintained, operated and controlled the property at 4 N. Stockton Street.\u201d In the complaint, appellee alleged: (1) Negligence against appellant; (2) Unfair Trade Practices against appellant; (3) Negligence against Mankowitz; and (4) Unfair Trade Practices against Mankowitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">(b) Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">On August 6, 2010, appellee filed an Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial against appellant, Mankowitz, Helen H. Hunt, and the Estate of Helen H. Hunt. In the amended complaint, appellee alleged that appellant owned property located at both 4 North Stockton and 6 North Stockton Street (\u201c6 North Stockton\u201d), and that Mankowitz managed both properties. Appellee alleged that Hunt owned and managed property located at 1606 Lemmon Street (\u201c1606 Lemmon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">As to appellee\u2019s residency history, appellee alleged: from 1990 to 2000, she resided with her parents at 4 North Stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ton;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from 1990 to 1998, she visited 6 North Stockton, where her grandfather leased property; and from 1990 to 1998, she resided at 1606 Lemmon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee alleged that, at each of the three properties, she was exposed to \u201cchipping, peeling, and flaking lead-based paint powder and dust[.]\u201d In the amended complaint, appellee alleged: (1) Negligence against appellant concerning 4 North Stockton; (2) Unfair Trade Practices against appellant concerning 4 North Stockton; (3) Negligence against Mankowitz concerning 4 North Stockton; (4) Unfair Trade Practices against Mankowitz concerning 4 North Stockton; (5) Negligence against appellant concerning 6 North Stockton; (6) Unfair Trade Practices against appellant concerning 6 North Stockton; (7) Negligence against Mankowitz concerning 6 North Stockton; (8) Unfair Trade Practices against Mankowitz concerning 6 North Stockton; (9) Negligence against Hunt concerning 1606 Lemmon; (10) Unfair Trade Practices against Hunt concerning 1606 Lemmon; (11) Negligence against the Estate of Helen H. Hunt concerning 1606 Lemmon; and (12) Unfair Trade Practices against the Estate of Helen H. Hunt concerning 1606 Lemmon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>(c) Designation of Experts: Dr. Eric Sundel and Christopher J. White</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">On April 12, 2010, appellee\u2019s counsel sent a letter to appellant\u2019s counsel designating, inter alia, Dr. Eric Sundel and Christopher J. White as expert witnesses. As to Dr. Sundel, appellee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">Dr. Sundel is a pediatrician who will review records and reports and is expected to render an opinion that the deficits of [appellee] are related to [her] exposure to lead paint at the [subject] properties, and that [s]he has permanent brain damage and a loss of Intelligence Quotient points as a result of that lead exposure. Dr. Sundel\u2019s opinions are based upon his review of the medical, environmental and school records, Answers to Interrogatories, Deposition testimony, photographs and any other documents related to this case and also upon the numerous medical studies that link cognitive deficiencies and IQ loss to early childhood exposure. Further, Dr. Sundel relies upon his medical education, training and experience in reaching his conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">As to White, appellee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Christopher J. White, A[rc] Environmental Inc., Program Manager.... Based upon review of the testing of the subject property, Mr. White will render an opinion regarding the presence of lead-based paint on the interior and exterior of the property at the time of testing, as well as the time [appellee] lived at the subject property. Mr. White\u2019s conclusions will be based upon the Federal ban on the use of lead based paint in residential housing in 1978, the Baltimore City Housing Code, the age of the dwelling, the condition of the dwelling at the time of testing the results of the testing performed, his education, training and experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>(d) Motion to Strike Arc Environmental Report</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">On October 26, 2010, appellant filed a Motion to Strike Arc Environmental Report, alleging that appellee failed to provide notice of lead testing occurring at 4 North Stockton on August 19, 2010, in violation of a scheduling order issued by the circuit court. Appellant contended that it was deprived of the opportunity to attend the lead testing, and thereby \u201cnot afforded an opportunity to ascertain what equipment was used for the testing, ... [and] to confirm that testing protocols for the lead samples were adhered to[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Appellant requested that the circuit court strike a report prepared by White dated September 2, 2010, for 4 North Stockton titled \u201cLead-based Paint Survey Report (Exterior Only)\u201d (the \u201cSeptember 2nd Report\u201d). White prepared the report based on a lead-based paint testing data sheet completed by Arc technician Timothy Wilton as a result of the August 19, 2010, testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On November 12, 2010, appellant filed a Line withdrawing the motion to strike filed on October 26, 2010. On November 15, 2010, appellant filed a second Motion to Strike September 2, 2010 Arc Environmental Report, raising the same arguments made in the earlier motion. On November 30, 2010, appellee filed an opposition to the motion to strike the September 2nd Report, contending that the motion was moot as appellant permitted testing at 4 North Stockton \u201cfor the existence of lead paint on November 2, 2010[,] and [a] representative from [appellant\u2019s Counsel was present for the interi- or and exterior lead tests of [4 North Stockton] on November 2, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Attached to the opposition was a report dated November 5, 2010, prepared by White-based on technician Timothy Wilton\u2019s lead-based paint testing data sheet \u2014 for 4 North Stockton titled \u201cLead-based Paint Survey Report\u201d (the \u201cNovember 5th Report\u201d). In the November 5th Report, White reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYO3\">Lead-based paint was detected above the Maryland standard (&gt; 0.7mg/cm<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) on the following components in this property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\n<em>Room Component</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aid\">front exterior basement door jamb; door jamb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azl\">living room window casing; baseboard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbFU\">1st floor hallway door casing and jamb; baseboard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9A\">kitchen door casing and jamb; window sill</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5f\">lsh-2nd floor stairs stair stringer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARM\">bathroom window casing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ada-\">2nd floor hallway baseboard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abmg\">2nd floor rear bedroom window casing; doorjamb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoaO\">2nd floor front bedroom window casing; baseboard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiu\">2nd-3rd floor stairs stair stringer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arb\">3rd floor front bedroom window casing; closet door casing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEB\">3rd floor rear bedroom door jamb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2pV\">rear exterior door jamb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">In the November 5th Report, White stated that Wilson used an \u201cLPA-1 x-ray fluorescence (\u2018XRF\u2019) spectrum analyzer, serial # 1373, manufactured by Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD)\u201d to perform the survey. White stated that \u201c[c]alibration check readings [were conducted] to ensure that [the] XRF instrument [was] within acceptable precision and accuracy levels throughout the entire inspection process.\u201d A handwritten note by Wilton stated that \u201ca representative for defense counsel was present during testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">On January 24, 2011, the circuit court issued an Order denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the September 2nd Report as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">(e) Motions to Exclude Experts and for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b647-20\">On April 8, 2011, appellant and Mankowitz filed a \u201cMotion to Exclude [Appellee]\u2019s Experts and Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d As to Dr. Sundel, appellant and Mankowitz contended that Dr. Sundel \u201cshould be precluded from testifying as to the source of [appellee]\u2019s alleged injuries or as to medical causation, as he lacks the qualifications and the factual basis to do so required by Md. Rule 5-702.\u201d Appellant and Mankowitz argued that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to opine as to the source of appellee\u2019s alleged lead exposure or the cause of appellee\u2019s alleged injuries. Appellant and Mankowitz argued that there were numerous reasons why Dr. Sundel was not qualified to render an opinion as to the source of lead expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>sure, including that he was not a Maryland certified risk assessor, he had not conducted a full risk assessment, he had not examined or spoken with appellee, he \u201cformulated his opinions solely based on the records selected and submitted to him by [appelleej\u2019s counsel[,]\u201d he had not published any articles concerning lead or been involved in any studies related to lead, he had treated only one patient suffering from lead exposure, and he lacked \u201cthe ability to determine whether declining lead levels are indicative of previously ingested lead being redistributed or newly ingested lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Appellant and Mankowitz maintained that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to testify as to the source of appellee\u2019s injuries because he \u201cdid not have training or experience in determining whether lead exposure was the source of a patient\u2019s injuries[,]\u201d and did \u201cnot follow a reliable methodology when formulating his opinions regarding [appelleej\u2019s IQ loss [because] he \u2018extrapolate[d]\u2019 from studies[.J\u201d Appellant and Mankowitz asserted that Dr. Sundel lacked a \u201cbasic understanding of the relevant studies and surveys regarding lead exposure and medical causation.\u201d Appellant and Mankowitz maintained that Dr. Sundel lacked a sufficient factual basis to opine that 4 North Stockton was a substantial contributing factor to appellee\u2019s alleged injuries because his opinion was based solely on the \u201cinadmissible testimony of [ ] White, and the fatally flawed and inadmissible Arc Environmental tests[,J\u201d and the age of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">As to Arc Environmental, appellant and Mankowitz argued that the \u201creports [prepared] by Arc Environmental, and any testimony related to the reports, should be excluded as the ARC XRF test results are unreliable, unverifiable, and thus, inadmissible.\u201d Appellant and Mankowitz asserted that, at a deposition taken on January 18, 2011, White testified that he has never been accepted as an expert by a trial court nor testified at any trial, and that Timothy Wilton \u2014 not White\u2014 conducted the lead testing at 4 North Stockton for Arc Environmental. As White did not perform and was not present for the testing at 4 North Stockton, appellant and Mankowitz asserted that White would be unable to offer an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>opinion as to: (1) the condition of the equipment used; (2) the calibration of the XRF machine performed before and after testing at 4 North Stockton; (3) where the XRF machines were placed during the testing; or (4) the exact areas of the property that were tested. Appellant and Mankowitz alleged that, without knowing where the tests were performed at 4 North Stockton, they were unable to duplicate the tests \u201cto ascertain the reliability of [appelleej\u2019s test results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Appellant and Mankowitz contended that the September 2nd and November 5th Reports were inadmissible for two reasons: (1) the XRF machines used \u201cdetect other sources of lead and, therefore, the results of the A[rc] Report are unreliable, unverifiable and unfairly prejudicial\u201d; and (2) the Arc Environmental testing \u201cwas not a full risk assessment and thus, the results cannot be relied upon.\u201d Specifically, appellant and Mankowitz alleged that the XRF machines tested more than the top layer of a given surface for lead, and instead \u201cw[ould] test positive if there is lead within the substrate itself[,]\u201d <em>ie. </em>\u201clead well beneath the surface of the exterior layer of paint produces a positive result, even if no lead paint existed on the surface.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant and Mankowitz contended that a full risk assessment \u2014 which includes tests of the water or soil at a property as well as a questionnaire completed by a plaintiffs family \u2014 was not performed, and that trial courts have excluded test results in circumstances where a full risk assessment is not conducted. Appellant and Mankowitz asserted that Arc Environmental performed only a \u201cLawyer 40 shot survey,\u201d in which the inspector completes forty readings, with one test on each surface, and faded to perform the more comprehensive full risk assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On April 26, 2011, appellee filed an Opposition to the motion to exclude and for summary judgment, contending that Dr. Sundel was qualified as an expert in pediatrics as a result of his knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that \u201chis testimony is appropriate on the particular subject of lead poisoning.\u201d Appellee argued that an expert\u2019s knowledge may come from many sources, and that Dr. Sundel\u2019s knowledge came \u201cfrom his experiences and observations as a medical student and pediatrician[,] and his review of medical literature concerning lead paint poisoning.\u201d Appellee asserted that because Dr. Sundel is an expert in pediatrics, it was permissible for him \u201cto testify that 4 N[orth] Stockton [ ] was, more likely than not, a source of [her] exposure to lead paint and consequent injuries.\u201d Appellee maintained that there was a sufficient factual basis for Dr. Sundel\u2019s opinions that lead exposure occurred at 4 North Stockton and substantially contributed to her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">As to the September 2nd and November 5th Reports, and White\u2019s expert testimony, appellee contended that the reports \u201care reliable and fall within a hearsay exception, and [ ] White is qualified to render opinions within his realm of expertise: lead inspection and lead risk assessment.\u201d According to appellee, White is Timothy Wilton\u2019s \u201cdirect supervisor at A[rc] Environmental[,]\u201d the Program Manager at Arc Environmental, and a Maryland licensed and accredited Lead Inspector/Risk Assessor \u201cqualified to interpret, review and explain to the jury how [ ] Wilton tested [4 North Stockton] and the results of said testing.\u201d Appellee argued that XRF testing is reliable and verifiable and has been used for years, and that the reports were not inadmissible hearsay as they are records of regularly conducted business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">On May 13, 2011, appellant and Mankowitz filed a Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, reiterating the arguments for exclusion of the September 2nd Report, the November 5th Report, and Dr. Sundel\u2019s and White\u2019s testimony. On May 23, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion to exclude and for summary judgment. On May 31, 2011, the circuit court issued an order denying the motion to exclude appellee\u2019s experts \u201cand/or exclude reports of Dr. Eric Sundel and Christopher White[,]\u201d and the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(f) Appellant\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">On May 26, 2011, appellant and Mankowitz began filing numerous pretrial motions, including a \u201cMotion in Limine to Exclude [Appelleej\u2019s Expert Dr. Eric Sundel and/or Request for Frye-Reed Hearing.\u201d Appellant and Mankowitz argued that Dr. Sundel lacked the qualifications necessary to offer an opinion as to the source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure and the cause of appellee\u2019s alleged injuries. On May 27, 2011, appellant and Mankowitz filed a \u201cMotion in Limine to Exclude [Appelleej\u2019s Expert Arc En[ Jvironmental Services and its Designee, [ ] White,\u201d arguing that the results of the September 2nd Report and November 5th Report and any testimony related thereto be ruled inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On June 7, 2011, appellant and Mankowitz filed a Line withdrawing the previously filed pretrial motions, including the motions in limine to exclude Dr. Sundel\u2019s and White\u2019s testimony and the September 2nd Report and November 5th Report, indicating that the motions would be \u201cre-filed at the appropriate time on or before\u201d trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On August 5, 2011, appellant re-filed the \u201cMotion in Limine to Exclude [Appelleej\u2019s Expert Arc En[ Jvironmental Services and its Designee, Christopher White\u201d and \u201cMotion in Limine to Exclude [Appelleej\u2019s Expert Dr. Eric Sundel and/or Request for Frye-Reed Hearing.\u201d On August 22, 2011, appellee filed an opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude Dr. Sundel, White, and the Arc Environmental Reports, arguing, in part, that appellant and Mankowitz had filed \u201cidentical motions on April 8, 2011, couched as motions for summary judgment[,]\u201d which had already been denied by the circuit court following a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">On August 24, 2011, the circuit court held a pretrial motions hearing. As to the motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Dr. Sundel, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s request for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing concerning Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony, and held the matter <em>sub curia, </em>ruling from the bench, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">I will tell you at least as a preliminary matter that I\u2019m not inclined to grant a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing because I\u2019m not hearing any dispute consistent with Blackwell about an issue with the scientific evidence that [appellee] through [her] experts expect[s] to present. The theory, the process of addressing IQ loss measured against blood lead levels at particular times, at particular stages of life, the, the technique or the methodology of engaging in ... that exercise, that\u2019s[] not new stuff that warrants a <em>Frye-Reed, </em>hearing .... It does appear to me that there\u2019s a significant issue as to how Dr. Sundel[ ] himself in this case on the facts and on the published authorities applied the methodology ... and I remained concerned about Dr. Sundel[]\u2019s rook[ie] status in applying or misapplying the methodology. I am as I said going to take the motion under advisement. I\u2019m letting you know that I don\u2019t contemplate a ... <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing in the circumstances____In subpart 1 of 5-702, in making a determination about the admissibility of an expert\u2019s testimony, I shall determine whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education. It\u2019s troubling that [Dr.] Sundelf] is without experience, pediatric treatment experience in a lead paint context. It\u2019s troubling when ... the testimony out of his deposition is, is parsed and he doesn\u2019t come off sounding or reading very, very well and I\u2019m not of a mind to just pass off the deposition as being a rook[ie]\u2019s combination of mistakes or misstatements. It\u2019s a concern [to] me, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>word \u201cor\u201d in addressing his qualifications by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education and the more recent [ajppellate authorities give me great pause about striking rookie Sundel[ ] from testifying based on qualifications, but I\u2019m going to take it under advisement and make sure that I get myself back up to speed[.J ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">[A]s to the factual basis for his testimony, [ ] I\u2019ll take that under advisement as well, but I\u2019m not going to address causation issues i.e., the factual basis for causation and Sundel[ J\u2019s prospective testimony about that until or unless I hear the trial testimony.

I am going to wait until I hear the factual premises and [ ] the reliance testimony by Dr. Sundel[ ] to revisit the motion[.J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfX\">So, what you\u2019ve got is ... that I\u2019m denying the motion in pertinent part and have taken into, and taken under advisement, will call it the qualifications piece, 5-702 subpart 1 after I revisit current authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">As to the motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude White\u2019s testimony and the September 2nd Report and November 5th Report, the circuit court held the matters <em>sub curia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">(2) Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">From August 26, 2011, to September 1, 2011, and September 6, 2011, to September 8, 2011, the circuit court conducted a civil jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">(a) Mankowitz\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">As a witness for appellee, Mankowitz, the president of appellant, testified that appellant purchased 4 North Stockton in 1986, and that appellee\u2019s mother signed a lease for the property on July 6, 1993. Mankowitz testified that he was certified to operate an XRF machine, which tests for the presence of lead-based paint. According to Mankowitz, in the 1990s, Scientific Testing, a company owned by an individual named Tony Smelgas, conducted testing for lead at appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>properties. Mankowitz testified that it was appellant\u2019s practice to place test results in \u201ca folder for that particular property.\u201d According to Mankowtiz, if there was no document in a file of test results from Scientific Testing, then Scientific Testing did not conduct such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">According to Mankowitz, appellant began participating in studies with the Kennedy Krieger Institute, and, at some point prior to 1993, appellant \u201ctried to send all the children seven and under for their protection to Kennedy Krieger to have their blood drawn and see if they had any ... elevated lead in their blood.\u201d Mankowitz testified that appellee was tested at Kennedy Krieger Institute on July 16, 1993, and, at that time, had a blood lead level of 16 |xg/dL. Mankowitz testified that, after appellant received the test results from Kennedy Krieger Institute, it did not inspect 4 North Stockton for lead hazards and did not move appellee or her family out of the property to remediate or repaint the house. Mankowitz testified that appellant depended on Kennedy Krieger Institute, \u201cwhich was renowned in lead paint problems with young childrenf,] to give [them] the course of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">(b) Appellee\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">On her own behalf, appellee testified that she recalled the baseboards and areas around the windows and windowsills on the first and second floors at 4 North Stockton had \u201c[c]racked up[,]\u201d or chipping, paint. Appellee testified that she remembered her mother complaining that the house at 4 North Stockton needed to be painted and she recalled her mother painting in the house after scraping the walls. Appellee acknowledged that, at deposition, she testified that, as a child, she moved back and forth a couple of times between 4 North Stockton and 1606 Lemmon, where she resided for a couple of months at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">(c) Dr. Sundel\u2019s Voir Dire and Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">As a witness for appellee, during voir dire, Dr. Sundel testified that he was currently employed at the Baltimore-Washington Medical Center and served as chairman of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Department of Pediatrics from 2004 until January 2011. Dr. Sundel testified that he is a board-certified pediatrician licensed to practice medicine in Maryland. Dr. Sundel described his medical training as follows: he attended Boston University School of Medicine for four years, and completed a pediatric internship and pediatric residency \u2014 a total of three years \u2014 at Bayview Hospital Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. Dr. Sundel testified as follows as to the evaluation and treatment of a child with lead poisoning during his internship and residency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">So we were, it is a large children\u2019s, baby\u2019s hospital so there would be cases where a child would have a very elevated lead level and he would require something called chelation. Which is, chelation is using a special medicine to try to remove some of the lead from the body, especially to try to remove it from the brain. So we would have children who would be admitted to the hospital for intravenous chelation. They would get an IV placed and then they would require several days of daily doses of a special medication to try to reduce the level of lead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Dr. Sundel testified that, after his internship and residency, he was an attending pediatrician for one year at Lincoln Hospital in New York City. After leaving Lincoln Hospital, Dr. Sundel completed a pediatric fellowship for two years at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Dr. Sundel testified that the pediatric fellowship entailed teaching medical students and young doctors, and learning how to conduct clinical research.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Dr. Sundel\u2019s curriculum vitae listed publications, which Dr. Sundel acknowledged did not concern the topic of childhood lead poisoning. Dr. Sundel testified, however, that as a pediatrician, he keeps current with childhood lead poisoning issues because, working in the pediatric emergency department, he needs to be able to understand the \u201cdifferent things that can cause\u201d illnesses he tries to treat. Dr. Sundel explained that, for example, lead poisoning or lead toxicity can cause seizures, encephalatrophy, acute mental status changes, and abdominal pain. Dr. Sundel testified that he is familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>with the Centers for Disease Control (the \u201cCDC\u201d) and its articles and documents concerning lead poisoning, including a 1991 article and a 2005 article, both entitled \u201cPreventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children.\u201d Dr. Sundel testified that he is familiar with the American Academy of Pediatrics (the \u201cAAP\u201d) and its statement concerning childhood lead poisoning. Appellee\u2019s counsel asked what information, if any, the CDC and AAP publications contained concerning a pediatrician making an inquiry into a source of lead exposure, and Dr. Sundel responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">So one of the things that\u2019s recommended to pediatricians is to try to review with parents environmental risk factors for lead exposure which again, for most children in the United States, is basically a function of living in older homes when lead-based paint was still very widely used and if the paint is in proper condition or not, if there\u2019s deterioration of paint and whether there\u2019s any chipping, or flaking, or peeling of paint because that\u2019s, that\u2019s in the United States the main way that young children are exposed to lead-based paint with their, what little kids do, hand-mouth, they put everything in their mouth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Dr. Sundel testified that he is familiar with Nelson\u2019s Textbook on Pediatrics, which covers the issue of childhood lead poisoning and discusses potential sources of exposure to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Dr. Sundel testified that, based on his review of the literature, as well as his training and experience, pediatricians are trained to inquire about the potential sources of lead exposure as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">So it\u2019s a number of questions about where ... the children spend their time within the house, outside of the home, whether they engage in sort of mouthing behaviors. So most young children, of course, put everything in their mouth. Some young children put non-food particles in their mouth.... So that\u2019s to be asked about and addressed. And then the ... condition [and] the age of the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Appellee\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Sundel if there was any significance to there being flaking and chipping paint in an older <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>house with a child who may have a tendency to put non-food particles in their mouth. Dr. Sundel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">So the older houses in the United States usually have lead-based paint. The overwhelming majority of them have lead-based paint in the interior of the home. If the paint is in, if it\u2019s flaking, peeling, chipping, then it\u2019s going to fall to the ground, it\u2019s going to be in dust, it\u2019s going to be in microscopic particles. It may not be visible, it might be visible. And then little kids, what they do is they explore their environment. They crawl and they start to walk around and they touch everything. And they put then-hands in their mouths and they put their toys in their mouths and food. Obviously when they eat there\u2019s a possibility that some of that flaking, chipping, peeling paint is going to fall into areas where food is stored. Um, so that\u2019s the main way that children are exposed to lead in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Dr. Sundel acknowledged that he is not a certified lead risk assessor. Dr. Sundel testified that he has appeared and testified previously in court as an expert in a case involving child abuse, but conceded that he had never testified in court as an expert in a lead paint poisoning case. Thereafter, appellee\u2019s counsel offered Dr. Sundel as an expert in the field of pediatrics, including childhood lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">During voir dire cross-examination, Dr. Sundel admitted that he was not a psychologist or neuropsychologist, and that he does not administer IQ or achievement tests. Dr. Sundel acknowledged that his one instance of involvement with chelation therapy occurred in the mid-1980s when he was a first or second year resident, and that, since that time, he could not recall being involved with any children receiving chelation therapy. Appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Dr. Sundel regarding deposition testimony, in which he admitted that, after being asked by appellee\u2019s counsel to testify as an expert, he went back to the literature to \u201cbone up,\u201d but, when questioned, could not recall the articles he had read or reviewed. Dr. Sundel agreed that he did not have any accreditations or certifications related to lead inspection or lead assessments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>and that he had never been involved in any Baltimore City tests of drinking water and soil for lead nor involved in any Maryland Department of the Environment studies on lead in the soil. Dr. Sundel acknowledged that he was not involved with the lead testing of 4 North Stockton, and had never visited the property. Dr. Sundel agreed that he was not aware of any peer reviewed medical or scientific literature stating that an expert may opine as to a source of lead ingestion by reviewing records, and that he had not published any articles related to lead, been involved in any studies related to lead, or delivered lectures on the topic of lead or lead ingestion. When asked by appellant\u2019s counsel whether, during the course of his career as a pediatrician, he had ever treated a child for symptoms or problems related to lead ingestion where he \u201cdetermined that the child was injured or had some issue related in any way to lead[,]\u201d Dr. Sundel responded: \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d Dr. Sundel conceded that he had not taken a medical or nutritional history of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">According to Dr. Sundel, a differential diagnosis is \u201csort of trying to consider the different possible causes of a chief complaint, the reason that someone is sick.\u201d Dr. Sundel testified that he could not remember having performed a differential diagnosis on a pediatric patient in which he had determined that the symptoms were due to lead ingestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">After voir dire of Dr. Sundel, the jury was excused, and appellant\u2019s counsel objected pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-702(1) and (3) to Dr. Sundel being accepted as an expert. The circuit court overruled the objection, ruling, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">The [C]ourt [of Appeals] noted, and I\u2019ll quote here, ... that \u201ca witness is qualified to testify as an expert when he exhibits such a degree of knowledge as to make it appear that his opinion is of some value whether such knowledge has been gained from observation or from experience, standard books, maps, or recognized authority or any other reliable sources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>I listened attentively ... and observed while I was listening to Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony about his familiarity with the cited authorities and I find that the ... Radman case\u2019s reminder about the fundamentals of what it takes for me to exercise my discretion under [ ] Rule 5-702,1 am reminded, for example, when Radman says, ... that a witness may be competent to express an expert opinion if he is reasonably familiar with the subject under investigation regardless of whether the special knowledge is based upon professional training, observation, actual experience, or any combination of these factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">I revisited the so-called classic formulation on these points of concern in Radman, I also am reminded of the starting point under the Rule, as well as the articulation or explication in Radman, reminding us that what we\u2019re talking about is whether and how the expert, the proffered expert has such special knowledge on the subject on which he\u2019s to testify that he can give the jury assistance in solving a problem for which their equipment or average knowledge, their equipment of average knowledge is inadequate. It is sufficient if the court is satisfied that the expert has in some way gained such experience in the matter as would entitle his evidence to credit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">And of course ultimately, upon, even upon recognizing an expert for his opinion, the jury is ultimately going to be told that they can give such weight, or not, to the testimony of an expert. Give it as much value, or no value, as they in their experience determine appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">I am going to recognize, I am recognizing Dr. Sundel as an expert pediatrician, especially with the concentration or including the concentration on his research and experience in childhood lead paint because his testimony is reflective of his special knowledge derived not just, or not only, from his own experience but also from the experiments and reasoning of others, communicated by personal association or through books or other sources. That\u2019s out of the Radman case and of course you\u2019ve heard me read on a daily basis subpart (1) of Rule 5-702 and the use of the or, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>disjunctive to inquire whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">There are a couple of examples that were provided in Radman that I found useful to hark back on---- The witness was disqualified by the court because the witness could not qualify as an expert in the flooring trade as he had never previously laid a floor. A witness may qualify if he possesses special and sufficient knowledge regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained from study, observation or experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">A law professor ... may be an expert on trial procedure even though he has never tried a case.... That\u2019s an example, frankly, that is repeated ofttimes by the appellate authorities....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">Collectively, the cases and relying especially on <em>Radman v. Harold, </em>indicate that one doesn\u2019t have to be a specialist or even have to have personal experience dealing with a particular type of injury or a medical treatment or a procedure in order to qualify as an expert under 5-702. It seems to me that it\u2019s a broad standard for what [ ] constitutes \u201cqualified\u201d under 5-702. We are reminded of that by the Wantz case in particular as to whether and how I ought to be exercising my discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">I believe that Dr. Sundel\u2019s experience as a pediatric hospitalist along with his own training as he described it here today in lead poisoning, in his reading, in his reliance on the authorities that were cited, renders him qualified to testify on the causal relationship between ingestion of lead and [appelleej\u2019s alleged injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">After the ruling, Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony commenced. Dr. Sundel testified that he was provided records concerning appellee \u2014 including birth records, Kennedy Krieger Institute medical records, Baltimore City Health Department medical and environmental records, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene medical records, Maryland Department of the Environment medical records, school records, the Arc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Environmental reports, a neuro-psychological report, the State Department of Assessment and Taxation records for the residences where appellee resided listing the year the homes were built, and appellee\u2019s and her father\u2019s deposition testimony \u2014 which he reviewed prior to issuing a written report on November 28, 2010. Dr. Sundel testified that he reviewed the various records regarding appellee\u2019s blood lead levels, and that the levels remained elevated for several years. Dr. Sundel testified that his review of the records indicated that appellee resided at and visited 4 North Stockton frequently and that this was significant because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXIA\">tilt\u2019s well recognized that the main source of lead for young children almost always is the primary residence where they either live or visit often. And then more than, so the residence, when its an older home, so for example homes built before 1960 something like two-thirds of them or three-quarters of them have lead-based paint. So a big risk is older homes. And then if there\u2019s deterioration of the paint, that\u2019s where there\u2019s chipping, flaking, peeling, that\u2019s the way young children can get access to that lead-based paint and then unfortunately get into trouble by ingesting it and ending up with an elevated blood lead level and then o[f] course the blood goes everywhere [in the body]. So it\u2019s very important to know where the children, when they\u2019re young, in the first few years of life, where they spent the majority of their time. Where they lived, where they visited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Appellee\u2019s counsel asked the basis for Dr. Sundel\u2019s opinion as to where appellee may have been exposed to lead, thus resulting in elevated blood lead levels. Dr. Sundel responded that \u201cthe main source of exposure for the majority of children in the United States is the residence where they live or spend a lot of time[,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he older the home is, the more likely that lead-based paint was used.\u201d Dr. Sundel testified that a home built in 1900, like the residence at 4 North Stockton, would have a \u201chigher risk\u201d than a home built twenty, forty, or sixty years later. Dr. Sundel testified that \u201cwe know ... there was a lot of lead-based paint at 4 North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Stockton [ ] because [of] the ARC study ... [and] that there are multiple areas [ ] where the interior of the home seems not to have been in a good condition shortly after [appellee] moved into 4 North Stockton [ ].\u201d Dr. Sundel opined to a reasonable degree of medical probability that 4 North Stockton was the location where appellee was exposed to flaking and chipping lead-based paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Dr. Sundel testified that he reviewed appellee\u2019s school records and that appellee \u201cacademically [ ] had a lot of trouble.\u201d Dr. Sundel explained that elevated blood lead levels \u201ccause loss of IQ points\u201d as well as behavioral problems, such as hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, or aggressiveness. Dr. Sundel testified that appellee\u2019s IQ in verbal and non-verbal areas was \u201clower than one would wish.\u201d Dr. Sundel offered the opinion that appellee sustained an IQ loss of seven to ten IQ points as a result of her elevated blood lead levels. When asked by appellee\u2019s counsel why he provided a range of seven to ten IQ points, Dr. Sundel testified that \u201cthere are many studies that show loss of IQ points with lead[,]\u201d with one study showing that children whose blood lead levels were less than ten micrograms per deciliter sustained an IQ loss of seven IQ points and another study showing that children with blood lead levels above ten micrograms per deciliter sustained an IQ loss of more IQ points, \u201csomewhere around one [ ] to four, one to five, something in that range[,]\u201d for each additional ten micrograms per deciliter.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Dr. Sundel testified that, academically, appellee had difficulties with certain subjects and with other school performance issues, such as \u201cwith listening comprehension, with attending to task, with coping skills, with ability to handle frustration, ability to follow directions, [and] ability to follow classroom and school rules.\u201d Dr. Sundel opined to a reasonable degree of medical probability that lead exposure at 4 North Stockton was a substantial contributing factor to injuries appellee sustained, which he described as \u201c[cjognitively she sustained loss of IQ points. Behaviorally, she sustained damage in terms ... of aggressiveness, in terms of externalizing behaviors in terms of hyperactivity.\u201d Dr. Sundel offered the opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>lead exposure was a substantial contributing factor to appellee\u2019s \u201cbrain impairment[.]\u201d Dr. Sundel opined that \u201cthe permanent injuries\u201d appellee sustained resulted from exposure to flaking, chipping, lead-based paint at 4 North Stockton.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">On cross-examination, Dr. Sundel testified that he was first contacted by appellee\u2019s counsel by letter dated November 15, 2010, when he was asked to formulate opinions based on documents sent to him. Appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Dr. Sundel as to how appellee\u2019s counsel designated him as an expert and stated what his opinion would be in a letter dated April 12, 2010, months before he was contacted and received any records related to the case. Dr. Sundel responded that he did \u201c[n]ot really\u201d know how that occurred. Dr. Sundel admitted that appellee\u2019s case was his first lead paint case and the first time he ever had his deposition taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Dr. Sundel acknowledged that, prior to trial, he had no contact with appellee or her family, and had not examined appellee. Dr. Sundel agreed that he was not provided with a household questionnaire form completed by appellee\u2019s family and that he never requested that appellee or her family complete such a questionnaire form. Dr. Sundel conceded that he never met with appellee to conduct a medical history nor conducted soil lead tests at 4 North Stockton. Dr. Sundel testified that he never met with appellee\u2019s family to inspect the residences she visited or resided in or to ask questions as to whether appellee had access to or chewed on woodwork, furniture, and toys as a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Dr. Sundel admitted he had never administered an IQ test, and acknowledged that, during his deposition, he testified that appellee has lost three to five IQ points or four to ten IQ points. Dr. Sundel acknowledged that he does not know how to score an IQ test, and responded that he did not know whether the standard of error of measurement of the Weschler IQ test was plus or minus three points. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Sundel whether he would agree that, as a doctor looking at the results of a neuropsychological testing of appellee without knowing the child\u2019s history, he could not tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>from the test performance whether the child had a history of having elevated blood lead levels. Dr. Sundel agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">(d) White\u2019s Yoir Dire and Testimony and Admission of Arc Environmental Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">As a witness for appellee, White testified that he is the program manager for the lead-based paint group at Arc Environmental, which he described as an environmental consulting firm that, among other things, conducts lead surveys, mold testing, asbestos sampling, and indoor air quality testing. White testified that he is a licensed lead-based paint assessor in Maryland and several other jurisdictions, and has received training on the operation of XRF machines. White described the XRF machine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">[T]he XRF is a handheld device that\u2019s placed up against any painted component. There is a triggering mechanism that\u2019s pulled which then emits gamma radiation into the particular component that we\u2019re sampling. That gamma radiation excited the electrons and produces a numerical reading on the screen of the device, which is a concentration of lead on that particular component.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Wliite testified that he has used the XRF machine previously in conducting several hundred lead surveys. Wfiiite testified that he prepares reports describing the lead surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Appellee\u2019s counsel moved to have the circuit court accept White as an expert in lead risk assessment, and the parties voir dired White as to his qualifications. Out of the presence of the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that WTiite not be permitted to testify as an expert because he was not qualified to offer an opinion, did not conduct the testing, lead risk assessment or lead inspection of 4 North Stockton, was not present during the testing, and had no personal knowledge of the testing. The circuit court ruled from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">Mr. White\u2019s perspective testimony is on a very thin edge as to whether his testimony about the presence in 2010 of lead-based paint in the house would assist the jury to understand the evidence or to determine whether in the 1990s there was a lead paint hazard. But we haven\u2019t heard his substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>testimony on that subject____Right now I am compelled to find that [White] is qualified to offer an opinion as to lead risk assessment and/or lead inspection within the meaning of the CRF and/or HUD because ... White acknowledged his familiarity and his appreciation for what those regulations were, what they were intended to do and how they were normally expected to be applied or in what circumstances they were expected to be applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">He also testified on direct examination as to the certifications and licensures, his training, his supervisory responsibilities. I am prepared, and I do find that Mr. White is qualified as an expert in the field of lead risk assessment and/or lead inspection within the meaning of, and only within the meaning of, Rule 5-702(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">I have made no determination at this point in time whether the expert testimony that he\u2019s engaged to offer is appropriate, and I have made no determination as to whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The jury returned, and the circuit court announced that White had been accepted as an expert in lead risk assessment and lead inspection. White testified that Wilton conducted lead testing at 4 North Stockton on two separate occasions. White explained that the September 2nd Report contained the lead test results from an exterior testing conducted on August 19, 2010. Appellee\u2019s counsel asked White to explain how Wilton used the XRF machine and White responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">Sure, upon his arrival at the site, he would perform calibration checks with the machine to ensure that it is operating properly. He would take three readings from a known standard that we refer to that has a known concentration of lead. As long as those three readings fall within the acceptable range that\u2019s been described for this machine, we can assume that the machine is operating properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">He would have then proceeded to test, again in this case since it was only the exterior, any exterior painted components that were accessible to him at that time. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>completion of that testing he would again calibrate the machine in the same manner he did the first time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The following exchange occurred when appellee\u2019s counsel asked White questions about the procedures Wilton used when conducting the August 19, 2010, lead test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And then with regards to [Wilton\u2019s] training, how does he record the information that the machine reads with regards to any surfaces?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">[WHITE]: We utilize what we refer to as a lead-based paint testing data sheet that is included with our report. The data sheet includes all of the essential information as to which component was tested and the reading itself. On each line, as Mr. Wilton performs the testing, he records that information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And in Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 14 [the September 2nd Report] is the information that Mr. Wilton collected in the report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">[WHITE]: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And does Mr. Wilton also take photographs at the time[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">[WHITE]: Yes, he does ... to provide a current look of the property conditions while we\u2019re there performing the testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Is the job or Mr. Wilton or ARC Environmental to determine whether there are any lead-based hazards present at the time of the testing in August of 2010?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">[WHITE]: Again, we would simply be looking for the presence or absence of lead-based paint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what happens then when Mr. Wilton returns to the office after conducting the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3g\">[WHITE]: He would provide me with the photographs and the data sheet that he completed and then I would complete the report and it would be issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-14\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you review the information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>[WHITE]: Ido.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">White testified that the Scitec MAP4 machine was used to conduct lead testing on August 19, 2010, and that he was familiar with the machine and had been trained on the use of the machine. White testified that Wilton used the Scitec MAP4 machine by placing it against the component he was testing, pulling the trigger on the machine, and waiting for the machine to provide a digital reading. According to White, at the time of the August 19, 2010, lead testing, a positive lead reading was anything greater than 0.7 milligrams per centimeter squared, and that three of the nine readings taken on August 19, 2010, were classified as positive \u2014 the basement door jamb, the first floor door jamb, and the first floor door casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">As to the November 5th Report, White testified that Wilton conducted lead testing of the interior and exterior of 4 North Stockton on November 2, 2010, using an RMD LPA-1 machine. According to White, Wilton took forty readings during the testing on November 2, 2010. White described the calibration procedure for the RMD LPA-1 machine, and testified that the calibration readings were described in the November 5th Report. White testified that, according to the November 5th Report, twenty-two surfaces were found to contain lead-based paint, including the kitchen door casing and jamb, the kitchen window sill, the stair stringer from the first floor to the second floor, and the second floor hallway baseboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">As to the presence of lead paint on surfaces at 4 North Stockton, appellee\u2019s counsel asked White for his opinion in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Mr. White, based on your training, knowledge, and experience and your review of the two ARC reports of the testing that Mr. Wilton did at 4 North Stockton [ ], do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of scientific probability as to whether 4 North Stockton [] had lead paint on its wood surfaces in 2010?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB8\">[WHITE]: I would have the opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific probability that the components that we identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>fied on the interior of the property contained lead-based paint from at least, from when we performed the testing in 2010, from at least 1966 when lead-based paint was banned for interior use in the City of Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">In regards to the exterior components, I would again share the same opinion that, I would feel that lead-based paint was present on those components from at least 1978, when the use of lead-based paint was federally banned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8v\">The circuit court overruled appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection and motion to strike White\u2019s testimony regarding lead-based paint existing prior to 2010. White testified that, had additional readings been taken and tested negative, his opinion would remain unchanged \u201cas it pertains to the components that we did find to be positive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">During cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel requested that White set up the XRF machines \u2014 the Scitec MAP4 and the RMD LPA-1 \u2014 in the mode in which they were used when Wilton performed the testing at 4 North Stockton. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked that White demonstrate how the Scitec MAP4 is calibrated, and that after calibrating the machine, he take a test reading of a courtroom wall. As to the Scitec MAP4 machine, appellant\u2019s counsel asked whether the machine would detect lead \u201cregardless of whether the lead is in the outermost layer of the paint or all the way down to the bottom layer of many layers of paint[.]\u201d White responded \u201cyes[,]\u201d and testified \u201cthat\u2019s the standard for any XRF.\u201d White acknowledged that it is possible that the XRF could give a positive reading for lead of a door that had been painted with lead-based paint but subsequently painted with ten coats of unleaded paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">During the in-court demonstration, White had difficulty switching the Scitec MAP4 machine to the proper mode, stating: \u201cI\u2019m just trying to maneuver and it\u2019s giving me a problem.\u201d White testified that the RMD LPA-1 machine has different performance characteristics, although the calibration procedure is the same as that of the Scitec MAP4 machine. White performed three calibration testings with the RMD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>LPA-1 machine. With the jury excused, White was asked to perform a test reading of a courtroom wall using the RMD LPA-1 machine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">At the beginning of the next day of trial, appellee\u2019s counsel moved to admit Plaintiffs Exhibit Nos. 14 and 15, the September 2nd Report and the November 5th Report. The circuit court admitted the reports into evidence over appellant\u2019s objection and ruled that White\u2019s expert testimony was admissible, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">I\u2019ve read both reports____The \u201coverview\u201d closed quote of each report can be read as inconsistent with Mr. White\u2019s testimony even contradictory to cited standards whether it\u2019s COMAR or in the CFR. Nevertheless, that observation goes to the weight of the evidence and not the admissibility of Mr. White\u2019s opinions or the admissibility of the reports. [ ] I have [ ] referred to and focused on and will address [ ] why I have addressed [Maryland Rule] 5 \u2014 702[ ], allowing Mr. White to testify on XRF testing procedures generally as an expert on the subject and [Maryland Rule] 5-703 allowing him to testify as to the testing procedures specific as to 4 N. Stockton [ ] especially as the testing procedures were record on the reports themselves. [D]rawing on 5-703(a), I believe and find that Mr. White as an expert witness may interpret and draw his conclusions from reports prepared by Mr. ... Wilton [] so long as the reliance on those reports is reasonable.... I\u2019ve reviewed the authorities as to whether, why and how to permit Mr. White\u2019s testimony to proceed in front of the jury based on those reports and relying on those reports[.] ... I also referred to and I will quote from <em>Consolidated Mechanic [Mechanical </em>] <em>Contractors v. Ball, </em>... 263 Md. 328 [283 A.2d 154] (1971) decision of the Court of Appeals and here\u2019s the quote, \u201cAlthough an expert witness must base his opinions on facts in evidence, those facts need not be ascertained by him through physical examination of a patient, but rather maybe facts contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>reports or examinations by third parties.\u201d I find that it was reasonable and apt and appropriate for White to rely on the reports by Mr. Wilton in this case. \u201cAn expert may extrapolate from data and facts contained in other\u2019s reports and studies in order to form his expert opinion just as with any other facts relied on by an expert in forming his opinion, the facts contained in third party reports or examinations must be legally sufficient to sustain the opinion of the expert.\u201d That\u2019s coming out of the Keene Corp. v. Hall decision that I already cited.... And, of course, in addition to referring to 5-703(a), I have referred to Maryland Rule 5-702. I\u2019ve already quoted that rule at length and ... am now focusing on subparts 2 and 3, the appropriateness of White\u2019s testimony and the [ ] sufficiency of the factual basis, namely the reports to support his expert testimony. As to the scope of White\u2019s testimony concerning the XRF testimony \u2014 White regularly conducted XRF testing, testing and/or he is trained to do so as part of his job duties with ARC. 5-702 allows White to testify as to how the XRF testing is conducted generally and how an XRF machine is usually operated. That testimony is relevant and probative [] because a fact finder could infer that the XRF testing conducted at 4 N. Stockton was conducted in the usual [ ] manner. I\u2019ve already found White to be qualified to testify on XRF testing by virtue of his training or experience. As to appropriateness of his testimony and his reliance on the reports, I find that the testimony indeed may be helpful to the jury because it would allow them to assess the strengths and weaknesses of XRF testing generally which is something not within the knowledge of lay people and the jury may also infer that the XRF testing conducted at 4 N. Stockton comported with the usual standards of XRF testing notwithstanding the doubts inflicted upon Mr. White\u2019s testimony upon cross-examination. [R]eferring to the factual basis for Mr. White\u2019s testimony, his experience with XRF testing provides that factual basis together with the reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">The ARC Reports generated, Exhibit Nos. 14 and 15 do contain a record of how the testing at 4 N. Stockton was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>conducted. Rule 5-703 allows Mr. White to disclose and explain what that record indicates. The reports can be disclosed to the jury under 5-703(b). I\u2019m relying on Milton Company case as well <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty </em>at 409 Md. 565 [976 A.2d 300] (2009) decision by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">I am admitting Exhibit Nos. 14 and 15 for reasons stated under both rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">At the conclusion of White\u2019s testimony, appellant\u2019s counsel moved to strike the testimony, arguing that White had never been trained or certified in the operation of the Scitec MAP4 machine, and could not operate the machine in court, and that White had received minimal manufacturer training on the RMD LPA-1 in 2010. Appellant\u2019s counsel contended that the 40 shot surveys conducted by Arc Environmental do not constitute a lead risk assessment, and that the existence of lead paint is not violative of the city housing code or any state statute or regulation. Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that White\u2019s testimony was not probative and that White was not qualified to testify. Appellant\u2019s counsel maintained that the Arc Environmental Reports were unverifiable as White was unable to testify as to the location of the readings. The circuit court denied the motion to strike White\u2019s testimony, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">In the wake of [ ] cross-examination, there may well be jurors who are less than enthusiastic and less than impressed with the recognition of the expert qualifications of Mr. White, but the problems with Mr. White\u2019s testimony do go to the weight of the evidence as opposed to his qualifications and as opposed to the appropriateness of his testimony and addressing the existence in certain locations of lead or lead paint in the ... house and the outside of the house. His opinions were quite limited as to the presence of lead period and his qualifications make that determination unaffected by the reliability factors that have been pointed out by [appellant\u2019s counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">Again, the issues that [appellant\u2019s counsel] raises seem to me to relate to the weight of the evidence as opposed to his underlying qualifications. I will deny the motion to strike Mr. White\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>(e) Patrick Connor\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">As a witness for appellant, Patrick Connor, an environmental consultant and licensed lead risk assessor, testified that he is the president of a company known as Connor Environmental, which conducts environmental engineering and, specifically, forensic work in the area of lead-based paint. Connor testified that he is an accredited instructor for the State of Maryland for lead-based paint inspectors and a lead risk assessor. Connor was accepted as an expert in the field of lead risk assessment and identifying lead hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Connor testified that a full risk assessment consists of an \u201con-site investigation to determine the existence, nature, severity and location of lead-based paint hazards and the provision of a report by the individual or the firm conducting the risk assessment explaining the results of the investigation and options for reducing lead-based paint hazards.\u201d Connor described the process of conducting a lead-based paint inspection, and testified that a lead-based paint inspection differs from a full risk assessment because the inspection does not identify lead-based paint hazards and \u201ctypically does not have [ ] the interview that would occur because you\u2019re really just looking for the presence or absence of lead-based paint.\u201d Connor testified that the Arc Environmental reports were lead-paint surveys, not inspections or full risk assessments. According to Connor, the Niton machine has a depth indicator and can detect which layer or depth of the layer of lead-based paint. Connor opined that the Arc Environmental reports were unreliable because of the \u201clack of proper calibration checking, the lack of quality control, and a lack of evaluating the quality of the <em>XRF </em>test data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The following exchange occurred between appellee\u2019s counsel and Connor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: In this beginning of this trial Mr. Mankowitz said he believed there was lead paint in this house in 1993, do you agree with that? ... Do you agree with the opinion that Mr. Mankowitz held ... that in 1993 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>this house, 4 North Stockton, contained lead-based paint, based on everything you\u2019ve seen in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">[CONNOR]: The only thing I recall \u2014 may I look at my notes? ... A prior \u2014 well, it\u2019s close. December 29th, 1993, I have in my notes that there was a Kennedy Krieger Institute Inspection, but I have it as, \u201cNo inspector, no instrument, not calibration check,\u201d and they \u2014 that report identified positive locations. So I don\u2019t know if that was the foundation of [Mankowitz\u2019s] knowledge. I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know what \u2014 I don\u2019t know why he would have known, but I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">(Emphasis added). Connor testified that he had \u201cno reliable evidence of lead-based paint at 4 North Stockton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">(f) The December 29, 1993, Report</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">At the conclusion of Connor\u2019s testimony, appellee\u2019s counsel requested a bench conference, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: During the testimony of Mr. Connor, he revealed that he might have a document that reflects positive lead tests back in 1993 of 4 North Stockton. He even made reference that there was a Kennedy Krieger record. I believe this would have \u2014 based on just on my knowledge and experience \u2014 and I think that came having to do with an agreement that Mr. Mankowitz had with Kennedy Krieger, so it appears to be a document of a lead test that hasn\u2019t been produced. We weren\u2019t aware of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">We would ask \u2014 we would ask that Mr. Connor be directed, obviously outside of the presence of the jury, I\u2019m not asking that, to obtain that document and provide it to both counsel and the Court as soon as possible because it may be relevant to a future motion after the trial\u2019s over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">THE COURT: Do you have the documents that were provided \u2014 do you have counsel\u2019s copies of the documents provided to this witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: We may have counsel\u2019s copies. I know that I was personally the person that gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>everyone all of the records. Pat Connor \u2014 my recollection was that they were all subpoenaed records, but we might be able \u2014 I don\u2019t [know] whether or not we still have a copy of that CD, but I can certainly check with the staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">THE COURT: All right. During what ever passes for a lunch break you can make a call to inquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">Pm going to rely on counsel to produce the information knowing that they can get in contact with this witness. I\u2019m not going to order the witness to produce the document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJY\">Appellee\u2019s counsel informed the circuit court that appellant\u2019s counsel did not have a copy of the December 29, 1993, report-referenced by Connor, and appellee had been prejudiced by the failure to produce the document. The circuit court advised that it would appreciate appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \u201cbest efforts to get the materials to [appellee\u2019s counsel] as quickly as possible[,]\u201d and stated that \u201cthe motion for sanctions which remains open and under advisement is necessarily going to be the subject of briefing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">After the jury had begun deliberating but before a verdict was returned, the circuit court received a letter from Parler, appellant\u2019s counsel, via facsimile, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">We have reviewed our files and have found the document referenced by Patrick Connor in testimony. This Kennedy Krieger Institute document was contained in a City Homes file. We have confirmed that it was not produced to [appellee] in response to [appellee]\u2019s Request for Production of Documents to [ ] Mankowitz, although it appears that it was not formally requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">I have attached a copy of the subject document as well as a copy of Barry Mankowitz\u2019s Response to Request for Production of Documents for your review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">Both [appellant] and [appellee] were working with the universe of documents which had been produced in the Response to Request for Production of Documents as the case documents. While I was unaware that this record existed in my computer files, I believe this record would have helped [appellant] because it shows no peeling lead-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>based paint, with the exception of one area on a window jam (pg. 1, under the heading \u201cWindow\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\">I wish to meet with the [circuit c]ourt as soon as possible to discuss this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Attached to the letter, Parler provided an eleven-page report titled \u201cKennedy Krieger Institute Spectrum Analyzer\u201d for 4 North Stockton dated December 29, 1993. The report indicates that lead was detected on multiple surfaces, labeled as being in an \u201cintact\u201d condition, throughout 4 North Stockton, including on door frames, windows, and baseboards. One window jamb that was \u201cnon-intact\u201d tested positive for lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On September 8, 2011, prior to the return of a verdict, the circuit court briefly addressed the facsimile, noting that the Kennedy Krieger report \u201cappear[ed] to be a very thorough analysis room by room on December 29th, 1993, and there\u2019s some suggestion in the face of Mr. Parler\u2019s letter that this document wasn\u2019t formally requested by [appellee]. I just can\u2019t imagine ... any scenario where a study of ... 4 North Stockton and the identification of lead content in any of the rooms and windows and doors in December of 1993 would not have been a critically relevant document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">(g) Jury Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee, answering \u201cyes\u201d to the following four questions: (l)\u201c[D]o you find that there was flaking, loose, or peeling paint at 4 North Stockton [] at the beginning of [appellee\u2019s mother\u2019s] lease in July 1993[?]\u201d; (2) \u201cDo you find that flaking, loose, or peeling paint at the beginning of the lease in July 1993 at 4 North Stockton [] caused lead paint poisoning to [appellee]?\u201d; (3) \u201cDo you find that [appellant] was negligent as owner or operator of 4 North Stockton [ ] when [appellee] resided at or visited that address[?]\u201d; and \u201c(4) Do you find that [appellee] sustained injury caused by [appellant\u2019s negligence at 4 North Stockton [ ] when she resided at or visited that address[?]\u201d The jury awarded $5,100,000 in damages to appellee, including $900,000 in economic damages for lost earning capacity and $4,200,000 in non-economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>(3) Post-Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">(a) Motion for New Trial or to Alter or Amend the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On September 14, 2011, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for a New Trial or in the Alternative, Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment,\u201d requesting a new trial because Dr. Sundel \u201cwas neither qualified nor had a factual basis for his testimony\u201d as to the source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure, and Dr. Sundel was not qualified to testify as to the source of appellee\u2019s alleged injuries, <em>ie. </em>what caused appellee\u2019s injuries. In addition, appellant argued that: (1) the non-economic damages award must be reduced from $4,200,000 to $350,000 pursuant to the applicable statutory cap on non-economic damages; (2) the economic damages award must be reduced from $900,000 to $461,934, as Dr. Lurito testified that the present value of appellee\u2019s future lost earning capacity and appellee only sought future lost earning capacity in the amount of $461,934; and (3) its total liability as a charitable organization could not exceed $1,000,000, the limit of its liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On September 19, 2011, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for New Trial \u2014 Supplemental Submission,\u201d asserting that it was deprived of a fair trial because Juror Number Four was not qualified to serve on the jury as a result of prior criminal convictions. On September 21, 2011, appellant filed a \u201cSecond Supplemental Submission in Support of [Its] Motion for New Trial.\u201d In a footnote in the second supplemental submission, appellant noted that it had \u201cissued a subpoena to the [c]ircuit [c]ourt [ ] Jury Commissioner for the executed questionnaire[ ] for [J]uror [Number Four.]\u201d On September 29, 2011, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for New Trial \u2014 Third Supplemental Submission or, in the Alternative, Motion for New Trial Pursuant to Md. Rule 2 \u2014 535(c),\u201d alleging that: \u201cBeyond [Juror Number Four]\u2019s statutory lack of qualifications to serve as a juror, the nature of his convictions, all drug related, rendered him both disqualified and inherently biased to consider issues related to [appellee]\u2019s impairment due to drug use or abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>On September 30, 2011, appellee filed an opposition to the motion for new trial. Appellee contended that the issue of Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony was not appropriately raised in a motion for new trial as the issue had been raised and decided in connection with pretrial motions for summary judgment and <em>in limine. </em>On the merits, appellee contended that Dr. Sundel was qualified to testify as an expert in pediatrics and childhood lead poisoning, and that there was a strong factual basis underpinning his opinions. On October 24, 2011, appellant filed a Reply in support of its motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">(b) Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On September 16, 2011, appellant filed Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, reiterating that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to testify as to the source of lead exposure or causation, and that he did not have an adequate factual basis for his testimony. Appellant argued that \u201c[tjhere [was] no credible evidence that [appellee] ingested lead, or was injured due to lead, from 4 N[orth] Stockton [] or that [appellee] suffered any damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On October 4, 2011, appellee filed an opposition to the Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, arguing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">For the fourth time in this matter, [appellant] argues that [appelleejs medical expert, Eric Sundel, M.D., lacks both the qualifications and the factual basis to offer opinions about the cause of [appellee]\u2019s elevated blood lead levels and resulting injuries. This court has previously denied [appellant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion in Li-mine on this exact issue. [Appellant] has raised the identical argument in its Motion for New Trial, which is currently pending before this Court. [Appellant] has literally \u201ccut- and-pasted\u201d the same argument contained in those previous three Motions. There is not a single reference to Dr. Sundel\u2019s trial testimony. Rather, [appellant] quotes from Dr. Sundel\u2019s deposition testimony. There is simply no new ground broken here. This Court should not reconsider this issue for a fourth time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>(c) Motion to Quash</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">On September 21, 2011, appellant sent a Notice to Take Deposition Duces Tecum and Subpoena to Nancy Dennis of the Office of the Jury Commissioner for the Circuit Court for Baltimore City requesting a copy of the completed jury questionnaires for the six individuals who served on the jury, including Juror Number Four. On September 30, 2011, Jury Commissioner Nancy Dennis filed a Motion to Quash Subpoena and for Protective Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">On October 24, 2011, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Compel Discovery and Opposition to Jury Commissioner Dennis\u2019s Motion to Quash Subpoena and for Protective Order.\u201d In the motion to compel, appellant alleged that Juror Number Four \u201cwas in fact not qualified to serve as a juror as a result of a long history including multiple drug-related felony criminal convictions[,]\u201d and that it was of \u201cparamount\u201d importance for it to discover whether Juror Number Four had disclosed his criminal history in his jury questionnaire. On October 27, 2011, the Jury Commissioner filed an opposition to the motion to compel and a reply to the opposition to the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">(d) Motion for Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">On September 29, 2011, appellee filed a Motion for Sanctions, requesting that the circuit court sanction Parler. Appellee argued that Parler engaged in repeated misconduct throughout the trial. As to the seventh day of trial, appellee alleged the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">On the last day of trial, during the testimony of the last Defense expert, Patrick Connor, Mr. Connor disclosed that he had made a note that one of the documents that he reviewed for his testimony at trial was a lead paint test conducted by Kennedy Kr[ie]ger Institute (KKI) of the subject property, 4 N. Stockton [], while [appellee] had been residing in the property. Throughout the trial it was made known that [appellant] had a relationship with KKI and would have its tenants tested for lead. It was obvious that Mr. Connor must have received the document from [Parler] long before the trial. Mr. Connor did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>copy of the lead paint test with him at trial, and [Parler] claimed to not have a copy of it either. The document was not produced to the Court until after closing arguments and during the jury\u2019s deliberations the next morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">Upon the discovery of the existence of the lead paint test, the Court ordered [Parler] to provide a copy to the Court and [appellee]\u2019s counsel immediately. [Parler] faxed a copy to the Court on September 8, 2011. [Appellee]\u2019s counsel had contacted [Parler\u2019s] office on the morning of September 8th and was told that since the jury had announced that they had reached a verdict, they were not going to fax [ ] a copy that day. Rather, [Parler] placed [appellee]\u2019s copy in the mail on September 8th and it was not received by [appellee]\u2019s counsel until the next day, September 9, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">As to the December 29, 1993, lead report, appellee argued that Parler intentionally withheld the report, and that whether flaking and chipping lead based paint existed in 4 North Stockton was a contested issue. Appellee pointed out that Parler raised \u201cthe issue of insufficient factual bases of no lead paint hazard being present in 4 N. Stockton\u201d in various pretrial and post-trial motions, despite knowing he had the 1993 lead report that was \u201ccontemporaneous with [appellee]\u2019s tenancy reflecting deteriorated lead based paint.\u201d Appellee contended that, had the 1993 lead report been provided, she would not have been required to pay Arc Environmental to conduct two separate tests of 4 North Stockton nor would she have been required to retain White as an expert. Appellee attached, as exhibits to the Motion for Sanctions, invoices detailing fees and costs related to Arc Environmental totaling $10,135.45 as follows: testing for the September 2nd Report\u2014 $510; testing for the November 5th Report \u2014 $905; hourly review of reports and deposition preparation of White\u2014 $1,056.25; transcript of White\u2019s deposition testimony\u2014 $366.70; and trial preparation and trial appearance by White, including one day\u2019s lost revenue \u2014 $7,297.50. Appellee argued that, had she known of the report,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARY\">significantly less effort would have been needed to prove exposure of [appellee] to deteriorated lead based paint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The factual basis for the medical expert opinions would have been substantially stronger. Chances for a settlement and the avoidance of an 8-day trial would also have possibly increased and saved the Court a substantial amount of time and expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Appellee requested the following sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">In addition to the monetary reimbursement for the unnecessary expenses related to lead paint testing that was unnecessary, [appellee] is also demanding that [Parler] be ordered to pay [appellee]\u2019s counsel for the five (5) hours it has taken to prepare and file this Motion for Sanctions. Although [appellee]\u2019s counsel is a contingency fee attorney, a Court in Montgomery County has previously ordered payment of attorney fees at a rate of $300.00 per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">[Appellee]\u2019s counsel also requests that this Court impose other sanction that it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to reporting the conduct of [Parler] with Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">WHEREFORE, [appellee] respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant this Motion for Sanctions and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">1. Order that [Parler] is to pay [appellee]\u2019s counsel $10,135.45 as reimbursement for unnecessary expenses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">2. Order that [Parler] pay [appellee]\u2019s counsel $1,500.00 for attorneys fees related to preparing this Motion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">3. Report [Parleras conduct with Bar Counsel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">4. For such other relief as this Court shall deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">On October 19, 2011, Parler filed an Opposition to [the] Motion for Sanctions and a Request for Hearing. Parler argued that the motion for sanctions be denied because: (1) appellee failed to attach a copy of the relevant discovery request to the motion; (2) the discovery requests propounded by appellee did not create an obligation on the part of appellant to produce the 1993 report; and (3) the failure to produce the 1993 report was inadvertent. According to Parler, after Connor\u2019s testimony regarding the 1993 report at trial, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>conducted an investigation and located the 1993 report as a PDF file on his computer. Parler alleged he did not know how he obtained the 1993 test report, but \u201cthe most logical explanation is that [it] was among the documents obtained from [appellant] and it was scanned onto [his] computer, but it was inadvertently not included in the notebook [of documents produced to appellee].\u201d Parler contended that the 1993 report was not intentionally withheld, and argued that the document could have been helpful to rebut testimony about the presence of flaking paint in 4 North Stockton. As to who conducted the 1993 test, Parler alleged that the test was not performed by appellant or Mankowitz, but rather was performed by Smelgus, \u201cwho was affiliated with an independent testing company.\u201d Parler alleged that, had appellee deposed Connor, she could have obtained a copy of the 1993 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">(e) Post-Trial Motions Hearing and Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">On October 31, 2011, the circuit court held a post-trial motions hearing. As to the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony, the circuit court denied the motion, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">On reviewing my trial notes in the absence of a trial transcript, I did assume the truth of the credible evidence and all inferences reasonably deduced from Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony. I am reminded by a couple of appellate decisions and reiterate that if there is any competent evidence, however slight, to support [appellee]\u2019s right to recovery in this case, the motion for judgment JNOV should be denied. I denied the motion for judgment. I denied the motion in limine held sub curia. I am about to deny the motion for JNOY as to Dr. Sundel\u2019s qualifications and causation testimony. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">[O]ne doesn\u2019t have to be a specialist or even have personal experience dealing with a particular type of injury or medical treatment or procedure in order to qualify as an expert under [Maryland Rule] 5-702. The broad standard for what constitutes \u201cqualified\u201d encompasses Dr. Sundel\u2019s experience as a pediatric hospitalist, ... along with his own training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>and reading in the area of lead poisoning. All of that renders him qualified to testify on the causal relationship between the ingestion of lead and [appelleej\u2019s alleged injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">So, revisiting his trial testimony, revisiting his identification of qualifications, revisiting the evidentiary support upon which he relied to address causation issues, I will deny the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">It may be worth reiterating ..., but the inference is raised in the motion that ... in advance of the motion in limine ... a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing should have been held to address methodology, if not qualifications of Dr. Sundel to address methodology of measuring IQ loss. I will pause to note, based on his testimony, based on the authorities that he cites, including the American Association of Pediatrics, that his reference and his reliance on IQ loss methodology in the published literature is and was reliant on relevant scientific methodology and it was reliable given the state of the literature[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">As to the motion to quash and motion to compel discovery of the juror questionnaires, ruling from the bench, the circuit court granted the motion to quash and denied the motion to compel. As to the motion for new trial on the ground that Juror Number Four was disqualified, the circuit court denied the motion, ruling that appellant had an opportunity for voir dire and that, although appellant argued there was prejudice due to Juror Number Four\u2019s drug-related convictions \u201c[t]here is no further explanation that has been presented ... about the nature or extent of prejudice to [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">As to the motion for a new trial or to alter and amend the judgment on the ground that the non-economic damages exceeded the statutory cap, the circuit court granted the motion to amend the judgment as to the non-economic damages, reducing the award of $4,200,000 to $850,000. Concerning the economic damages, the circuit court denied the motion to alter or amend the judgment. As to the motion for a new trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the ground of charitable immunity, the circuit court denied the motion, \u201crelying on ... Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 5-406.\u201d The circuit court observed that it found \u201cno basis, looking at the answer, to construe or contrive a charitable immunity affirmative defense in the eircumstances[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">As to the motion for sanctions, the circuit court found that the 1993 lead test report \u201cwas relevant and disclosable[.]\u201d The circuit court commented on Parler\u2019s conduct, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">I will tell you that [appellee\u2019s counsel] is correct to remind us that I said that I was appalled at the nonproduction of the Kennedy Krieger test information in December of '93. It would also be correct to say how deeply disappointed I was in Mr. Parler\u2019s repeated failures to attend to what I refer to as the \u201cfundamentals of trial.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just a question of counsel taking liberties and engaging in sharp tactics. Mr. Parler\u2019s conduct throughout the entirety of the case was more than disappointing. Indeed, it was way over the ethical line[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The circuit court granted, in part, and denied, in part, the motion for sanctions, noting that it granted the motion for the reasons that appeared on the record, but that it would need to examine the record further to determine the amount of the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">On November 2, 2011, appellee\u2019s counsel sent a letter to the circuit court via facsimile to \u201cinform [the court] of a misstatement\u201d made during the October 31, 2011, hearing, stating, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">You may recall that I informed the Court that I believed that the December 1993 lead paint test results of 4 North Stockton [ ] were performed by Kennedy Krieger Institute and that the Kennedy Krieger Institute had an agency relationship with [appellant]. I\u2019ve come to learn from my colleagues in the lead paint bar that Mr. Barry Mankowitz has testified in other cases that [appellant] was the one who hired Mr. Smelgus to conduct lead paint testing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>properties. It was Mr. Smelgus who had placed the test results on a Kennedy Krieger Institute form. So, in fact, Mr. Smelgus was a direct contractor with [appellant]. This would be consistent with the reason why [appellant] had a copy of the lead paint test results since Mr. Smelgus was a direct contractor for [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">On November 10, 2011, in a letter to the circuit court, counsel for Parler advised that, after the 1993 lead paint test \u201ccame to light[,]\u201d Parler began investigating the test \u201cto determine if the test was in his possession and if so, how it came into his possession and why it had not been produced.\u201d Parler\u2019s counsel stated as follows concerning the investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEe\">From this investigation, [Parler] discovered that the document was in the computer version of his file, but it was not in the paper version and that his filed reflected that prior to the trial this test had not been the subject of any discussion or any correspondence between anyone in his office and Mr. Mankowitz, [appellant\u2019s] Insurer or any of the retained experts. This is confirmed by the attached affidavits of Patrick Connor [ ] and Mr. Mankowitz [ ] in which they both confirm that prior to the conclusion of the [ ] trial, neither of them discussed the 1993 test with any attorney, paralegal or staff of [Parler\u2019s law firm].[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Parler\u2019s counsel argued that the \u201creason why the 1993 test was not produced was not a determination that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>requested in the propounded discovery, but instead due to an inadvertent human error, it had been scanned into the computer file, but it had not been copied for the paper version of the file.\u201d Parler\u2019s counsel alleged that the 1993 test was performed on behalf of Kennedy Krieger Institute, not appellant, and that Mankowitz \u201cconfirmed he had no memory of requesting Mr. Smelgus on behalf of [appellant] test 4 N[orth] Stockton\u201d and Smelgus confirmed \u201cthat he was hired and paid by [Kennedy Krieger Institute], not [appellant] to perform the 1993 test.\u201d Parler\u2019s counsel urged the circuit court to deny the motion for sanctions because appellee \u201ccould not establish that the discovery requests\u201d required production of a document performed at the behest of Kennedy Krieger Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">On December 2, 2011, the circuit court issued an order resolving the post-trial motions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">1. William Parler, counsel of [appellant], must return all copies of jury lists to the Courtroom Clerk ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">2. Jury Commissioner Nancy Dennis\u2019s Motion to Quash Subpoena and for Protective Order [ ], opposed by [appellant], is GRANTED; and [Appellant\u2019s Motion to Compel Production of Juror Questionnaires [ ] is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">3. [Appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial \u2014 Supplemental Submission [], Second Supplemental Submission [], and Third Supplemental Submission [ ], opposed by [appellee], are DENIED with respect to any and all allegations of error related to juror disqualification (especially as to Jurors 2 and 4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">4. [Appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict [ ], opposed by [appellee], is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">5. [Appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial [ ], opposed by [appellee], is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">a. Pursuant to Maryland Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 11-108, which applies to place a $350,000 cap on any non-economic damages awarded in this case, the Motion [] is GRANTED IN PART and Judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>entered for [appellee] and Against [appellant] is amended to $1,250,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">b. [Appellant\u2019s Motion [] is DENIED in all other respects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On December 5, 2011, the circuit court issued a Post Trial Sanctions Opinion and Order. In the opinion, as to Parler\u2019s trial tactics, the circuit court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">As stated above, [appellee] had to prove there was flaking lead-based paint at 4 N. Stockton [ ] when she lived there in and following 1993. The 1993 inspection report, in [appellant\u2019s] file for 4 N. Stockton [ ], was relevant and discoverable but [appellant and Mankowitz] did not disclose these inspection records during discovery. Thus, at trial, [appellee] relied on other evidence, including Arc Environmental\u2019s testing results, to establish the presence of lead-based and flaking paint at the property. [Appellant and Mankowitz] had sought to strike or exclude Arc Environmental\u2019s testing results and White\u2019s testimony at every possible stage in this litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">With the advantage of hindsight, Parler\u2019s game plan comes into focus. Parler deprived [appellee] of the 1993 inspection records, and would seek to discredit or strike Arc Environmental\u2019s testimony. Without the 1993 inspections records, [appellee] would have to rely only on the Arc report and testimony about flaking paint at 4 N. Stockton [] during the relevant time period. [Appellee]\u2019s causation expert, Dr. Sundel, did not have and could not rely on the 1993 inspection records for his testimony. [Appellee] did not have and could not rely on the 1993 report to rebut Dr. Schuelein\u2019s testimony challenging Dr. Sundel\u2019s causation testimony. Parler would press for settlement and threaten mud-slinging impeachment of [appellee] and her father while withholding certain records, including a 2001 psychological assessment of [appellee].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">The 1993 inspection records essentially provide the nexus between three facts [appellee] absolutely had to prove: 4 N. Stockton [ ] contained lead paint, the condition of that paint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>was deteriorated (chipping, peeling, or flaking), and these conditions existed during the relevant time period (in and after 1993) when [appellee] was injured upon her exposure to lead. Parler\u2019s tactics would allow him to provoke settlement negotiations as [appellant] held greater advantage on the courthouse steps. No one would be the wiser about any-withheld documents, especially where [appellant\u2019s Pre-Trial Statement [] typically did not list trial documents or -witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">On August 26, 2011 [appellee]\u2019s counsel informed the Court that Parler made settlement-related threats to use documents in his possession that were \u201cextremely damaging\u201d to [appellee] and her father. When [appellee] moved to compel production of the \u201cdamaging\u201d documents, this Court relied on Parler\u2019s representation that any undisclosed documents were for impeachment, only. However, the Court instructed the parties promptly to exchange lists of trial exhibits and to make copies of exhibits available to counsel. The Court also read Rules 2-402(a) and 2-401(e) in open court both to admonish Parler and to provoke Parler\u2019s supplemental production of any substantive, recently discovered documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">(Footnote omitted). The circuit court set forth the following as to Parler\u2019s conduct and credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">Parler argues, conveniently, that his failure to disclose the 1993 inspection reports was a mistake. He also offers variable but dissembling arguments to justify the nondisclosure. Parler\u2019s arguments are not credible. This is especially apparent upon revisiting early trial proceedings, which reveal a pattern of concealment, half-truths, and bad-faith behavior. For example:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u2022 On August 26, 2011, Parler denied that there had been any document requests to [appellant], and claimed that document requests had been made only to Defendant Barry Mankowitz, individually, and not as a corporate designee. Parler was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u2022 On August 25, 2011, [Parler] pushed [appelleej\u2019s counsel to settle in view of a number of damaging documents challenging [appelleej\u2019s character and family history (her father\u2019s criminal background; her mother\u2019s abuse appearing in school records and psychological assessment; expulsion from cosmetology school for fighting). On August 26, Parler denied that those \u2018damaging\u2019 or recently discovered documents had been the subject of any requests for production. Parler was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">\u2022 On August 26, 2011, Parler exclaimed that some of the \u2018damaging\u2019 documents (referring to the school reeords/psychological assessment) were public [court] records and only recently discovered. The trial court invited and afforded Parler an opportunity to provide supplemental discovery responses. Parler did not do so. Parler urged, instead, that documents describing [appellee]\u2019s expulsion from cosmetology school, and [appelleej\u2019s upbringing as reflected in the Circuit Court paternity/family court file, need not be produced. Furthermore, Parler represented that \u201cthere are no more City Homes documents to produce,\u201d stating that \u201cI have quadruple checked the requests and [the 628 page notebook of scanned documents] are all the City Homes records and relevant documents produced to [appellee].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u2022 The trial court instructed Parler to exchange document lists and provide copies of trial exhibits to [appelleej\u2019s counsel. On August 29, 2011, Parler blamed power outages for not doing so, then insisted, \u201cWe sent them everything [even though] we got no requests for [appellant].\u201d Parler was wrong. The trial court had quoted and cited Rules 2-402(a) and 2-401(e) to require [appellant\u2019s supplemental disclosure of relevant documents, broadly defined, and taking it on faith that the documents of concern were only recently discovered. Parler\u2019s \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d on August 29 refused the invitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u2022 On August 29, Parler exclaimed that \u201cwe produced everything relevant in this case.\u201d Parler repeated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>representation made at the discovery deposition of Barry Mankowitz, that all documents that had been at the City Homes office had been scanned, copied into his 628 page notebook, and produced. Parler was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\u2022 During his opening statement to the jury (on August 26, 2011), Parler acknowledged an \u201caffiliation\u201d between [appellant] and Kennedy Krieger. On August 29, 2011, [appellee]\u2019s first trial witness was Barry Mankowitz, the founder of [appellant]. Mankowitz described [appellant\u2019s] relationship with Kennedy Krieger. Mankowitz also testified that \u2018we wanted to know where the lead was\u2019 at leased properties, that \u2018we used Smelgus of Scientific Testing\u2019 to do so, and that \u2018we didn\u2019t test all the properties.\u2019 He further testified that We keep documentation of lead paint tests; yes, every test we made, we kept a copy for that property,\u2019 \u2018If there is no copy of test document, there was no testing.\u2019 We did not test at 4 N. Stockton [ ], to the best of my knowledge.\u2019 Mankowitz\u2019s testimony was wrong, and Parler made no move to correct and produce the 1993 inspection records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u2022 Parler made no offer to disclose the 1993 inspection report during or after his experts[\u2019] testi[mony], or before the close of the evidence at trial. Instead, when the jury was deliberating on the morning of September 8, 2011, Parler revealed his ultimate and arrogant disdain for court orders, rules and procedures. [He] faxed [a] letter to the Court, belatedly copied to [appellee]\u2019s counsel, dated September 8, 2011[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">Parler did not alleviate the Court\u2019s disappointment or mitigate his errors in the course of post-trial motions, scheduled briefing on [appellee]\u2019s Motion for Sanctions, or in argument at hearing. Indeed, Parler compounds his errors. For example, Parler suggests that it was [appellee]\u2019s error not to discover the 1993 inspections records ... because of [appellee]\u2019s failure to depose defense experts Connor or Emmett____Parler ignores his obligations pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-402(g)(l)(A). The fact that Rule 2-402 permits expert depositions does not defeat or alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Parler\u2019s mandatory responsibility to disclose \u2018all reports, correspondence and curriculum vitae from any expert\u2019 as sought in [appelleej\u2019s document request [ ], or the substance of findings and opinions, and a summary of grounds for each expert opinion, all as required by this Court\u2019s lead paint case Scheduling Orders and Rule 2 \u2014 402(g)(1)(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">Parler\u2019s opposition to sanctions, distilled to its essence, simply urges that \u201cthere was not intent to deceive or withhold any duly requested documents.\u201d [] Parler is wrong. On successive occasions and without correction, Parler misled [appellee] and her counsel, and misled this Court. Parler, at best, shirked his responsibilities under applicable rules, and mocked his professional duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">The Court must now identify appropriate sanctions for Parler\u2019s discovery failure. Although Parler\u2019s non-disclosure did not necessarily affect the trial result, it likely affected the manner of [appellee]\u2019s proof of her claim, the parties\u2019 focused attention to trial preparation, their preparation for expert testimony, and any potential resolution of [appelleej\u2019s claims by settlement in advance of trial. Parler\u2019s lapses and misstatements to this Court certainly affected the fairness and quality of the trial of this case. The task of addressing sanctions for non-disclosure is complicated because [appellee]^ Motion for Sanctions reasonably addresses a succession of Parler\u2019s additional unseemly defense errors and sleazy trial tactics. The Court undertakes this task with vivid recollection of having lambasted Parler for his failure to attend to certain \u201cfundamentals\u201d of trial and pretrial practice (e.g., Parler\u2019s noncompliance with Rule 2-504.2). The Court also recalls chastising Parler after he attempted to display an enlargement of an inadmissible photo during his opening statement to the jury.

In this case, Parler did not appear to engage in spoliation.

The District Court judge imposed several sanctions on the defendants, including fining each defendant $5,000 and each defense attorney of record $500. <em>Id. </em>at 1541-42. The judge imposed these fines because he found that \u201cDefendants\u2019 actions have caused not only unnecessary delay and increased cost of ... litigation for the parties, but also an increased burden on the Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1542. The Circuit Court affirmed these fines as a valid exercise of the District Court\u2019s inherent authority to sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 1545.

Appellant asserts that appellee\u2019s counsel designated Dr. Sundel as an expert months before Dr. Sundel reviewed materials related to the case and formulated an opinion. Appellant maintains that the opinion \u2014 that 4 North Stockton was the source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure and injuries \u2014 was appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s opinion and not Dr. Sundel\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred and abused its discretion in permitting Dr. Sundel to testify as to causa<em>tion </em>\u2014 i.e. that appellee incurred injuries as a result of lead exposure at 4 North Stockton \u2014 as he lacked the qualifications to do so. Appellant argues that Dr. Sundel opined that appellant has a \u201ccognitive deficit resulting in a loss\u201d of IQ points, but Dr. Sundel has never administered an IQ test, does not know how to score an IQ test, and is not qualified to interpret IQ test results. Appellant asserts that, in calculating appellee\u2019s loss of IQ points allegedly resulting from lead exposure, Dr. Sundel engaged in impermissible speculation. Appellant asserts that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to render a differential diagnosis and opine that appellee\u2019s alleged injuries were caused by lead exposure at 4 North Stockton.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in permitting Dr. Sundel to testify because his testimony lacked a sufficient factual basis, as required by Maryland Rule 5-702(3). Appellant argues that Dr. Sundel relied solely on Arc Environmental reports concerning lead at 4 North Stockton and other general research, and failed to conduct independent investigation and research concerning the possibility of other sources of lead poisoning, appellee\u2019s medical and social history, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>potential causes for a cognitive deficit. Appellant maintains that Dr. Sundel lacked an adequate factual basis upon which to conclude that appellee suffered injury due to lead exposure at 4 North Stockton \u201cgiven that there were so many other potential sources\u201d of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Appellee responds that an expert\u2019s knowledge may come from a variety of sources, and that an expert need not be a specialist in a particular field nor be personally involved in the activity for which he is testifying. Appellee contends that Dr. Sundel\u2019s knowledge was derived from his experiences and observations as a medical student and pediatrician, as well as his review of medical journal articles concerning lead poisoning. Appellee argues that \u201cDr. Sundel\u2019s experience, as demonstrated through his discovery deposition and curriculum vitae, as well as his review of [her] relevant medical records, created the requisite basis necessary for him to offer causation and injury opinions[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Appellee contends that Dr. Sundel based his opinions on blood lead level readings taken during the time she resided at 4 North Stockton, the age of the property, reports by other experts, lead testing conducted at 4 North Stockton, and appellee\u2019s residence history. Specifically, appellee argues that Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony was supported by an adequate factual basis consisting of the following information: (1) appellee visited or resided in 4 North Stockton from 1990 to 2002; (2) appellee\u2019s blood lead levels rose to 21 |xg/dL after residing in 4 North Stockton for one year and remained elevated through 1998; (3) 4 North Stockton was built during or before 1920, and was more likely to contain lead-based paint; (4) appellee visited or resided 4 North Stockton at times when there was flaking and chipping paint, as appellee\u2019s father testified to during deposition; and (5) Arc Environmental lead testing revealed lead paint in both the interior and exterior of 4 North Stockton. Appellee contends that trial courts have routinely permitted experts, such as Dr. Sundel, to testify whether a property is more likely than not a source of lead exposure. Appellee argues that she was not required to prove a single source of lead exposure or a single cause for her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In a reply brief, appellant contends that the objection to Dr. Sundel was not \u201cthat he is a pediatrician or that medical experts cannot be used in lead paint cases, but that Dr. Sundel was not qualified and did not have the requisite factual basis upon which to base his opinion.\u201d Appellant reiterates that Dr. Sundel failed to consider that appellee lived at and visited other homes during the same time period that her blood lead levels were elevated, and that one of the other residences may have been a source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure. Appellant asserts that Dr. Sundel failed to consider other environmental sources of lead, such as water and soil. Appellant maintains that Dr. Sundel provided no testimony that would have assisted the jury with \u201cweighing the impact of [ajppellee\u2019s exposure at 4 N. Stockton Street (if any) with other sources of lead exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In <em>Taylor v.

At trial, Harold proffered an internal medicine specialist as an expert witness qualified to testify as to the standard of care required of a surgeon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>performing a hysterectomy. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ruled that the internal medicine specialist lacked the necessary qualifications to testify. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In <em>Radman, id. </em>at 169, 367 A.2d 472, the Court of Appeals stated that case law stood for the proposition that \u201ca witness may be competent to express an expert opinion if he is reasonably familiar with the subject under investigation, regardless of whether this special knowledge is based upon professional training, observation, actual experience, or any combination of these factors.\u201d The Court of Appeals expressed the \u201cclassic formulation\u201d concerning expert qualification as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">It is a familiar rule of evidence that a witness, in order to qualify as an expert, should have such special knowledge of the subject on which he is to testify that he can give the jury assistance in solving a problem for which their equipment of average knowledge is inadequate. It is sufficient if the court is satisfied that the expert has in some way gained such experience in the matter as would entitle his evidence to credit. It is not a ground for excluding the testimony of an expert that he bases his statements in whole or in part upon what he has read, provided that his reading can be assumed to constitute part of his general knowledge adequate to enable him to form a reasonable opinion of his own. A witness is qualified to testify as an expert when he exhibits such a degree of knowledge as to make it appear that his opinion is of some value, whether such knowledge has been gained from observation or experience, standard books, maps of recognized authority, or any other reliable sources. The knowledge of an expert in any science or art would be extremely limited if it extended no further than inferences from happenings within his own experience. His testimony is admitted because it is based on his special knowledge derived not only from his own experience, but also from the experiments and reasoning of others, communicated by personal association or through books or other sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Id. at </em>169-70, 367 A.2d 472 (citations omitted).

The Court of Appeals affirmed this Court\u2019s reversal and remand of the case, observing that the trial court needed to determine whether Harold\u2019s expert, based on his overall familiarity with the hysterectomy procedure, was qualified to testify as an expert. <em>Id. </em>at 176, 367 A.2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In <em>Giant Food, </em>152 Md.App. at 171, 831 A.2d 481, we held that \u201calthough [the] medical expert was qualified to render an opinion ... the expert\u2019s testimony lacked a sufficient factual basis, and the opinion was not the product of reliable principles and methods.\u201d As such, the circuit court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 190, 831 A.2d 481. Booker was exposed to Freon gas while employed at Giant Food and approximately fourteen months later, was diagnosed with adult on-set asthma. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 831 A.2d 481. Booker filed a claim alleging that exposure to Freon caused his asthma. <em>Id. </em>at 169-70, 831 A.2d 481. At trial, Booker\u2019s medical expert \u201cconceded that he had never read about, nor knew of, asthma being caused by exposure to Freon[,]\u201d yet the expert testified that the exposure to Freon caused Booker\u2019s asthma. <em>Id. </em>at 176, 178, 831 A.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In <em>Giant Food, id. </em>at 182-83, 831 A.2d 481, in examining Maryland Rule 5-702(3) and the use of expert testimony, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">[S]imply because a witness has been tendered and qualified as an expert in a particular occupation or profession, it does not follow that the expert may render an unbridled opinion, which does not otherwise comport with Md.

The witnesses had substantial training and experience, over many years, and had reviewed materials pertinent to th[e] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 14 A.3d 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In <em>Taylor, </em>207 Md.App. at 123, 141-42, 51 A.3d 743, a lead paint case, we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the plaintiffs medical expert\u2019s testimony as the expert\u2019s opinion that the subject property \u201ccontained lead-based paint [was] only supported by the age of the house and the presence of lead on one component of the exterior of the house.\u201d We further held that \u201cthe only evidence that [the plaintiff] was exposed to lead [at the property] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>was her elevated blood lead level while living at that property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 51 A.3d 743. The plaintiff resided at one property for approximately two and one-half years before moving to the property at issue, where she lived for just over a year before moving to a third property, where she resided for ten years. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 51 A.3d 743. On three different occasions spanning five years, the plaintiffs blood lead levels were elevated when tested, two of which occurred while living in the property. <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 51 A.3d 743. The plaintiff designated a doctor \u2014 a pediatrician \u2014 as one of her expert witnesses, stating that the doctor would opine that the plaintiff experienced permanent brain damage and a loss of IQ points as a result of lead exposure, and that the doctor\u2019s opinions were based \u201cupon her review of the medical, environmental and school records related to th[e] case[,] ... the numerous medical studies that link cognitive deficiencies and IQ loss to early childhood lead exposure!, and] her medical education, training and experience!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 51 A.3d 743. A lead paint test conducted during discovery demonstrated that only an exterior window apron on the front of the property, with intact paint, tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint. <em>Id. </em>at 128-29, 51 A.3d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The doctor submitted a \u201ccausation report\u201d offering the opinion that the plaintiff was exposed to lead at the first two properties she resided in, and basing her opinion on \u201cthe age of the dwellings, the described conditions of the [property], the detection of lead in an exterior window apron of this [property] and [the plaintiffj\u2019s blood lead levels while living at each dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129-30, 51 A.3d 743. The doctor further stated that the dwellings were located in an area \u201cknown to contain lead paint\u201d and of an age \u201cto most probably contain lead based paint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 51 A.3d 743. At her deposition, the doctor admitted that there was no blood lead level data for a period of a year and a half immediately preceding and following the time when the plaintiff moved into the property. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 51 A.3d 743. The doctor was unable to state whether the plaintiffs blood lead level rose while residing in the property, acknowledging that the \u201conly thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>[she] kn[e]w is that [the plaintiff] was living there when it was found to be up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 51 A.3d 743. The doctor agreed that the fact that the plaintiff had an elevated blood lead level while residing at the property was not proof that she was exposed to lead at the property as the lead could have been in her body \u201cfrom some other source prior to the time that she moved in[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 51 A.3d 743. Throughout the deposition, the doctor responded \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked questions by the defendant\u2019s counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 131-33, 51 A.3d 743. After the deposition, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the doctor\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because she lacked an adequate factual basis to support her opinion that the plaintiff was exposed to lead-based paint at the property. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 51 A.3d 743. After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion, ruling that the doctor lacked an adequate factual basis to say with \u201ca reasonable degree of medical certainty that [the property] was a substantial factor in contributing to Plaintiffs injury, nor is there a basis to say that [the property] was a lead source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 51 A.3d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In <em>Taylor, id. </em>at 142, 51 A.3d 743, we agreed and concluded that the trial court properly found that the \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d supporting the medical expert\u2019s opinion \u201camounted to no more than a possibility that [the plaintiff] was exposed to lead-based paint\u201d at the property. Of significance was the expert\u2019s inability to rule out other sources of lead or to conclude that the plaintiffs blood lead level rose while living at the property. <em>Id. </em>Notably, the plaintiff had alleged that she was exposed to lead-based paint at two properties, and there was insufficient evidence to prove that the property at issue in the case was the only possible source, especially in light of the medical expert\u2019s deposition testimony that the plaintiffs elevated blood lead level at the property \u201ccould have been the result of lead that was already in her body from a source prior to when she moved to\u201d the property. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 51 A.3d 743. As to the age of the property, this Court stated that age alone is not enough to support a conclusion that a house contains lead-based paint as there is no presumption that old houses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>contain lead-based paint. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 51 A.3d 743 (citation omitted). Indeed, we noted: \u201c \u2018[T]he mere fact that most old houses in Baltimore have lead-based paint does not mean that a particular old Baltimore house has a similar deficiency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis v. Goodman, </em>117 Md.App. 378, 393, 700 A.2d 798 (1997)). Ultimately, we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">In light of the facts before the circuit court, we cannot conclude that it abused its discretion when it ruled that [that doctor\u2019s] testimony was inadmissible because she lacked an adequate factual basis to support her conclusion that [the plaintiff] was exposed to lead-based paint at [the property]. [The doctor] testified at her deposition that she did not know if [the plaintiff\u2019s blood lead level rose while she lived at [the property], and that it was possible that [the plaintiff\u2019s elevated blood lead level, when she moved to [the property], was the result of a prior exposure. In fact, [the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that she had a prior exposure to lead-based paint at [another property]. Additionally, [the plaintiff\u2019s only evidence that [the property] contained lead-based paint was the age of the house and the presence of lead on one component of the exterior of the house. We conclude that, on the basis of [the doctor\u2019s testimony and the facts before the circuit court, a reasonable person could find that [the plaintiff\u2019s injuries could have been caused by exposure to lead-based paint at [the other property] rather than at [the property]. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in excluding [the doctor]\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgMV\"><em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 51 A.3d 743. <em>See also N.B.S., Inc. v.

For the reasons explained below, we agree with appellant that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to testify as an expert with a concentration in childhood lead poisoning, or to offer an opinion as to the source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure or as to causation, <em>i.e. </em>that appellee incurred injuries as a result of lead exposure, and that there was an insufficient factual basis for the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In an abuse of discretion, the circuit court found that Dr. Sundel was qualified to testify as an expert with a concentration in \u201cchildhood lead paint\u201d by virtue of \u201chis special knowledge derived not just, or not only, from his own experience but also from the experiments and reasoning of others, communicated by personal association or through books or other sources.\u201d A review of the record, with respect to Dr. Sundel\u2019s qualifications, however, reveals that, although he is a board-certified pediatrician licensed to practice medicine in Maryland, he has not received any specialized training nor does he have any experience in treating children with lead poisoning or in identifying the source of a child\u2019s lead exposure. During voir dire, Dr. Sundel testified that his only experience in evaluating and treating children with lead poisoning occurred during his internship and residency. Although Dr. Sundel testified children suffering elevated blood lead levels would be treated with chelation therapy, in which a medication is administered intravenously to remove lead from the body, Dr. Sundel acknowledged that his only involvement with chelation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>therapy occurred during the mid-1980s when he was a resident. Dr. Sundel could not recall being involved with any children receiving chelation therapy since that time. Dr. Sundel acknowledged that he has not evaluated and diagnosed children with lead poisoning, or monitored the progress of children diagnosed with lead poisoning. Indeed, when asked whether he has ever treated a child for symptoms related to lead ingestion where he \u201cdetermined that the child was injured or had some issues related in any way to lead[,]\u201d Dr. Sundel responded: \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Dr. Sundel has never testified as an expert in a lead paint poisoning case, has never been involved in any Baltimore City tests of drinking water and soil for lead nor involved in any Maryland Department of the Environment studies on lead in the soil, and acknowledged that he is not a certified lead risk assessor. In fact, Dr. Sundel testified that appellee\u2019s case was his first lead paint case and the first time he ever had his deposition taken. Dr. Sundel acknowledged that he has not published any articles related to lead, been involved in any studies related to lead, or delivered lectures on the topic of lead or lead ingestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Dr. Sundel testified that, as a pediatrician, he keeps current on childhood lead poisoning issues and is familiar with articles from the CDC and AAP as well as Nelson\u2019s Textbook on Pediatrics. Significantly, though, during deposition, when asked for the names of the articles he had read or reviewed concerning lead poisoning, Dr. Sundel was unable to recall the names of any articles. Dr. Sundel testified that pediatricians are trained to inquire about the potential sources of lead exposure. Dr. Sundel failed, nonetheless, to identify a single instance in which he had determined the source of a child\u2019s lead exposure. Dr. Sundel admitted that he could not recall having performed a differential diagnosis on a pediatric patient in which he had determined that the symptoms were due to lead ingestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Most troubling are Dr. Sundel\u2019s qualifications to render opinions concerning causation \u2014 for example, that appellee sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tained an IQ loss of seven to ten IQ points and that lead exposure was a substantial contributing factor to appellee\u2019s \u201cbrain impairment[.]\u201d Dr. Sundel admitted that he is not a board-certified psychologist or neuropsychologist, and that he does not administer IQ or achievement tests. Dr. Sundel conceded that he had not conducted a medical or nutritional history of appellee nor had he examined appellee. On cross-examination, Dr. Sundel admitted that, during deposition, he testified that appellee had lost three to five IQ points or four to ten IQ points. Dr. Sundel acknowledged that he does not know how to score an IQ test, and did not know the standard of error for the Weschler IQ test. Based on the record, it is patently clear that Dr. Sundel was simply not qualified to testify as to appellee\u2019s IQ or the loss of IQ points resulting from lead exposure or any alleged \u201cbrain impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">From the record and Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony, we discern no basis on which to conclude that Dr. Sundel had specialized knowledge concerning childhood lead poisoning, and specifically, the determination of the source of a child\u2019s lead exposure and causation. <em>Rodman, </em>279 Md. at 169, 367 A.2d 472 (\u201c[T]o qualify as an expert, [the witness] should have special knowledge of the subject on which he is to testify that he can given the jury assistance in solving a problem for which their equipment of average knowledge is inadequate.\u201d). Nothing about Dr. Sundel\u2019s work generally as a pediatrician leads to the conclusion that he was qualified to render the expert opinions he offered in this case on diminishment of IQ, causation, source of lead exposure, and brain impairment. We acknowledge that a witness need not be personally involved in the activity about which he or she is to testify, and that a witness may become qualified through \u201cobservation or experience, standard books, ... or any other reliable sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 367 A.2d 472. The record fails to substantiate that Dr. Sundel possessed specialized knowledge about lead poisoning from either his own observation, or any experience or training \u2014 which was extremely bare and lacking as to lead poisoning. Indeed, other than reviewing the limited records provided to him by appellee\u2019s counsel and stating that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>generally aware of certain publications \u2014 the names of which he could not recall when asked at deposition \u2014 Dr. Sundel did not identify any studies, publications, or sources that he relied upon in forming his opinions. As such, Dr. Sundel had no greater basis than any person would have had to determine the nature and extent of appellee\u2019s alleged lead exposure at 4 North Stockton. The circuit court abused its discretion in admitting Dr. Sundel as \u201can expert pediatrician, especially with the concentration or including the concentration on his research and experience in childhood lead paint because his testimony is reflective of his special knowledge!.]\u201d Simply put, the record does not support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">(b) Maryland Rule 5-702(3) \u2014 Sufficient Factual Basis</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Similarly, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion in permitting Dr. Sundel to testify because the record demonstrates that he lacked a sufficient factual basis for his opinions, as required by Maryland Rule 5-702(3). In <em>Wantz, </em>197 Md.App. at 684, 14 A.3d 1244, this Court observed that \u201cthere is a broad range of sources capable of forming the requisite factual basis!,] ... such as facts obtained from the expert\u2019s first-hand knowledge, facts obtained from the testimony of others, and facts related to an expert through the use of hypothetical questions.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The question before us is whether Dr. Sundel had an adequate factual basis to testify that: the property at 4 North Stockton was the source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure, appellee sustained an IQ loss of seven to ten IQ points based on exposure to lead, and lead exposure at 4 North Stockton was a substantial contributing factor to injuries appellee sustained, such as IQ loss, aggressiveness, hyperactivity, and brain impairment. We conclude that Dr. Sundel lacked the requisite factual basis for this testimony and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Dr. Sundel was not a treating physician, but rather was retained to review records and provide an opinion as to source and causation. Dr. Sundel had limited knowledge of appellee\u2019s medical history, appellee\u2019s current medical condition, or appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>lee\u2019s potential exposure to lead from other sources. Dr. Sundel indicated that he had not seen or questioned appellee or her family, and thus, his factual basis in the case boils down to his review of the records provided to him by appellee\u2019s counsel, appellee\u2019s trial testimony, and his knowledge obtained from his experience and training. Dr. Sundel opined that, based on the Arc Environmental reports, 4 North Stockton was a source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Sundel failed entirely, however, to consider the other properties where appellee visited and resided during her childhood, failing to rule out those other properties as well as environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>sources of lead such as the water and soil at 4 North Stockton or elsewhere as sources of lead exposure. A significant fact, not lost on this Court, is that Dr. Sundel acknowledged at trial that his opinion was disclosed in an expert designation letter of April 12, 2010, months before he received any materials related to the case or had an opportunity to formulate any opinion. As such, it is readily apparent that Dr. Sundel proceeded from the beginning on the assumption that 4 North Stockton was a source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure, rather than proceeding from the position that appellee was exposed to lead and searching for sources, ruling out possible alternatives as he went along.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In this case, appellee amended the complaint to identify other sources of lead exposure, including 6 North Stockton and 1606 Lemmon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellee contended she \u201cvisited the property located at 6 N. Stockton [owned by appellant] from approximately 1990 to approximately 1998.\u201d No information was provided to Dr. Sundel about lead at the property. As in <em>Taylor, </em>207 Md.App. at 146, 51 A.3d 743, appellee\u2019s elevated blood lead levels \u201ccould have been the result of lead that was already in her body from a source prior to when she moved to\u201d 4 North Stockton. Dr. Sundel failed to investigate other potential <em>sources </em>\u2014 ie. to determine whether lead had been found in other residences in which appellee had lived or visited \u2014 to gain insight into whether 4 North Stockton was a source of appellee\u2019s lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Dr. Sundel lacked an adequate factual basis to offer opinions concerning appellee\u2019s alleged loss of IQ points, aggressiveness, hyperactivity, and brain impairment. As to the loss of IQ points, although Dr. Sundel testified that he arrived at his opinion \u2014 that appellee sustained a loss of seven to ten IQ points as a result of lead exposure \u2014 based on his review of documents, including an IQ test report completed by a different doctor, and his knowledge and training, it is evident that Dr. Sundel\u2019s testimony amounted to no more than speculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>based on articles he read that correlated diminished IQ with lead exposure. When questioned as to how he arrived at the range of a loss of seven to ten IQ points, Dr. Sundel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0i\">So, the studies, there are many studies now that show loss of IQ points with lead. I think the exact number of points, there\u2019s some variation____ So for every additional ten micrograms per deciliter of elevated blood lead level, the loss of IQ points is somewhere around one to, one to four, one to five, something in that range.... So it seems that [appellee\u2019s] loss of IQ points would be somewhere, seven from the first ten micrograms per deciliter and then an additional few points above that, potentially even more, I\u2019m, I feel I\u2019m potentially being a little conservative and potentially there\u2019s a loss of more than seven to ten IQ points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMmE\">Thus, in addition to not being qualified to testify as to appellee\u2019s alleged loss of IQ points, the above testimony demonstrates that Dr. Sundel lacked an adequate factual basis for the testimony, <em>i.e. </em>his opinion that appellee sustained a loss of seven to ten IQ points was pure conjecture based upon general literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">As to the aggressiveness, hyperactivity, and brain impairment that Dr. Sundel attributed to lead exposure, the record reflects that Dr. Sundel reviewed psychological assessments, indicating appellee has an impairment of the brain, and school reports conducted and prepared by others, which indicated that appellee had \u201cgeneral behavioral problems, social skills, picking on others, aggressiveness, and fighting with others.\u201d Based on this information, Dr. Sundel opined that appellee had aggressiveness, hyperactivity, and a brain impairment, and that lead exposure at 4 North Stockton was a substantial contributing factor to the conditions. Significantly, Dr. Sundel failed to offer any basis for his opinion that lead exposure at 4 North Stockton was a substantial contributing factor to the conditions. For example, when asked whether he had an opinion \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical probability as to whether the exposure at 4 North Stockton [] was a substantial contributing factor to [appellee\u2019s] brain impairment[,]\u201d Dr. Sundel responded \u201cI do.\u201d When asked what that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>opinion was, Dr. Sundel testified: \u201cThat it was a substantial, the lead exposure was a substantial contributing factor. From [ ] testing, again, there was significant, there was significant cognitive regarding IQ. There was, there were problems in areas involving auditory and visual memory.\u201d In essence, when asked for his opinion, Dr. Sundel simply described the injuries and failed to provide any basis underlying the opinion \u2014 in other words, his testimony amounted to a \u201c \u2018because I think so,\u2019 or \u2018because I say so,\u2019 situation.\u201d <em>Giant Food, </em>152 Md.App. at 188, 831 A.2d 481. For all of the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion in permitting Dr. Sundel to testify as an expert as Dr. Sundel was not qualified and lacked a sufficient factual basis for his testimony as required under Maryland Rule 5-702(1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">White\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In light of our conclusion as to Issue I, we need not address Issue II. We make the following observations, however, for guidance. Although we do not necessarily agree with appellant that White was not qualified to testify as an expert in the field of lead risk assessment and inspection, we note that there were troubling aspects concerning the admission of White\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We observe that, at trial, White\u2019s expert testimony veered dangerously close to fact testimony \u2014 namely, White testified as to how Wilton used the XRF machine during lead testing at 4 North Stockton and how Wilton conducted lead testing, circumstances about which White would have no personal knowledge. Although White may have possessed knowledge about how an XRF machine is <em>generally </em>used during lead testing and how lead testing is <em>generally </em>conducted, as White was not present during the testing at 4 North Stockton and Wilton\u2019s testing data contains no information about how the tests were performed, White was unable to testify about how Wilton actually performed the tests. White\u2019s testimony as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>how Wilton performed a testing impressed us as exceeding the permissible bounds of expert opinion and entering the arena of fact testimony. Had appellee sought to elicit information as to how the XRF machine was used at 4 North Stockton or how testing was performed at 4 North Stockton, Wilton or another witness with knowledge of those facts was required to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">There is no dispute that an expert \u201cmay give an opinion based on facts contained in reports, studies or statements from third parties if the underlying material is shown to be of a type reasonably relied upon by the experts in the field.\u201d <em>Milton Co. v. Council of Unit Owners of Bentley Place Condo., </em>121 Md.App. 100, 120, 708 A.2d 1047 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>354 Md. 264, 729 A.2d 981 (1999); <em>see also Keene Corp. v. Hall, </em>96 Md.App. 644, 660-61, 626 A.2d 997, <em>cert. granted, </em>332 Md. 741, 633 A.2d 102 (1993) (\u201c[Although an expert witness must base his opinion on facts in evidence, those facts need not be ascertained by him through physical examination of a patient but rather may be \u2018facts contained in reports or examinations by third parties.\u2019 An expert may therefore extrapolate from data and facts contained in others\u2019 reports and studies in order to form his expert opinion.... \u2018[T]he facts upon which an expert bases his opinion must permit reasonably accurate conclusions as distinguished from mere conjecture or guess.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted)). That White was not present for testing at 4 North Stockton and, instead, relied upon testing data provided by Wilton in formulating his opinion does not present a problem. An expert\u2019s creation of a factual basis for his <em>testimony </em>\u2014 i.e. White providing information about the manner in which Wilton performed testing \u2014 is, however, not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Post-Trial Sanctions against Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court\u2019s imposition of sanctions violated due process as it was \u201cnot on notice that it was subject to being sanctioned, and, as a result, [ ] did not have an opportunity to present a defense to the claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>sanctions against it [were] warranted.\u201d Appellant argues that appellee sought sanctions against Parler only, and, therefore, it (appellant) did not file an opposition or present any argument at the hearing concerning the motion for sanctions. Appellant asserts that the circuit court may impose sanctions against a party only after the party is given notice and an opportunity to be heard, which did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Appellee responds that the sanctions issued against appellant are not properly before this Court for appellate review. Appellee argues that the sanctions award, issued after the entry of judgment, was not included in the judgment. In support of this argument, appellee asserts that appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the sanctions after it filed the notice of appeal, and that the circuit court improperly dismissed the motion for reconsideration. As to the merits, appellee concedes that she did not move for sanctions against appellant, but argues that reimbursement for her expenses for Arc Environmental\u2019s services constitutes an appropriate sanction that should have been assessed against Parler, not appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We are satisfied that the circuit court abused its discretion as to the imposition of sanctions against appellant. On brief, appellee acknowledged that it never requested sanctions against appellant. At oral argument, appellee stated that it would leave the issue of the propriety of the entry of sanctions against appellant to this Court\u2019s discretion. Sanctions were imposed against appellant for $10,135.45, the expenses appellee incurred in retaining Arc Environmental, when lead testing of 4 North Stockton had already been performed and documented in the December 29, 1993, report. Although, on brief, appellee argued the issue of sanctions against appellant is not properly before the Court, the matter has been fully briefed by the parties, and the parties agree that appellee did not request sanctions against appellant. In the circuit court, appellant had no notice that the court might impose sanctions. <em>See Griffin v. Bierman, </em>403 Md. 186, 197, 941 A.2d 475 (2008) (\u201c \u2018An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprize interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted)). It is pellucid that sanctions may not be imposed against a party without notice. We reverse the sanction of $10,135.45 against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Post-Trial Sanctions against Parler</p>\n<p id=\"AuR\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court improperly sanctioned Parler for an alleged discovery failure. Appellant argues that the circuit court does not have unlimited inherent authority \u201cto issue punitive sanctions without following proper procedures.\u201d Appellant asserts that the case law relied on by the circuit court in issuing sanctions against Parler \u201cdo[es] not stand for the proposition that it had the power to fine an attorney who engaged in a discovery violation in the absence of finding that the attorney was guilty of contempt following a hearing conducted pursuant\u201d to the Maryland Rules governing contempt. According to appellant, the circuit court failed to provide Parler notice that it was \u201ccontemplating the extraordinary sanction of a fine in the amount of $10,000,\u201d in violation of Parler\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Appellant maintains that the circuit court had only two options: (1) issue a sanction pursuant to the rules governing discovery or (2) initiate contempt proceedings and hold a hearing providing Parler with an opportunity to be heard. Appellant contends that the circuit court\u2019s sanction against Parler was, in essence, a finding that Parler was in direct criminal contempt. Appellant argues that the circuit court failed to follow the procedures governing contempt proceedings. Appellant asserts that Parler did not have notice that the circuit court intended to fine him and, therefore, did not present argument at the post-trial motions hearing regarding such a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Alternatively, appellant contends that the circuit court lacked authority to issue sanctions against Parler pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341 because there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Parler withheld the 1993 Kennedy Krieger Institute test in bad faith. According to appellant, the evidence presented in post-trial motions and at the post-trial motions hearing indicated only that the 1993 Kennedy Krieger Institute test was withheld inadvertently, not intentionally and in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Appellant argues that an explanation for the amount of the sanction levied against Parler \u2014 $10,000\u2014is not contained in the record. Appellant asserts that the circuit court failed to set forth any specific findings detailing how the court arrived at the $10,000 figure, and that, as such, the sanction against Parler is unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Appellee responds that the circuit court properly imposed sanctions against Parler. As an initial matter, appellee contends that Parler failed to properly appeal the sanction imposed against him as the notice of appeal filed by appellant did not clearly indicate that Parler was appealing too. As to the merits, appellee argues that the sanctions against Parler were \u201centirely appropriate\u201d given his pattern of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In <em>Schneider v. Little, </em>206 Md.App. 414, 432-33, 49 A.3d 333, <em>cert. granted, </em>429 Md. 303, 55 A.3d 906 (2012), this Court explained the standard of review governing the imposition of sanctions for discovery abuse, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">We review a trial court\u2019s finding of a discovery violation under the clearly erroneous standard. \u2018When reviewing the circuit court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for discovery abuse, we are bound to the court\u2019s factual findings unless we find them to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 193, 728 A.2d 727 (1999). \u201cOur scope of review is narrow and our function is not to substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder, even if we might have reached a different result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, we must \u201cdecide only whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. In making this decision, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>assume the truth of all the evidence, and of all the favorable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, tending to support the factual conclusions of the lower court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">(3) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">(a) Appeal of Sanctions by a Party\u2019s Attorney</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In <em>Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. 364, 382-83, 386, 550 A.2d 959 (1988), the Court of Appeals held that a notice of appeal filed by the plaintiff, signed by his attorney, concerning imposition of sanctions against the plaintiff and the attorney, could be read as including review of the sanctions against the attorney. In the case, the trial court granted the defendant doctor\u2019s request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff and his attorney initiated a claim before the Health Claims Arbitration Board without \u201cany investigation and/or in total disregard of the necessity to prove the applicable standard of care and/or a breach thereof or causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 550 A.2d 959. The trial court agreed with the defendant doctor that the plaintiffs lawsuit should never have been filed. <em>Id. </em>at 375, 550 A.2d 959. Accordingly, the trial court awarded the defendant doctor $21,165.05 in attorney\u2019s fees, which was reduced to judgments against the plaintiff in the amount of $10,583.53 and against the attorney in the amount of $10,583.52. <em>Id. </em>Within thirty days, a notice of appeal was filed signed by the attorney as \u201cAttorney for Plaintiff,\u201d stating: \u201cPlease enter an appeal on behalf of the Plaintiff to the Court of Special Appeals from the Judgment, in the above captioned matter, in favor of the Defendants, ... dated April 1, 1987 and entered on April 2, 1987.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 550 A.2d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In <em>Newman, id. </em>at 383, 550 A.2d 959, the Court of Appeals initially observed that the Maryland Rules, unlike the Federal Rules, \u201cdo not regulate the content of an order for appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d Conversely, the corresponding Federal Rule prescribed the content required in a notice of appeal, including that the notice of appeal specify \u201cthe party or parties taking the appeal[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals stated that had the attorney signed the notice of appeal, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>attorney for the plaintiff, and had the notice of appeal only read \u201c \u2018Please note an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals!,]\u2019 ... the legal effect would have been to bring up for appellate review all appealable judgments in the case!,]\u201d including the sanctions against the attorney. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that the \u201corder for appeal in the instant case does not operate to exclude [the attorney,]\u201d and that Maryland appellate courts \u201chave generally been quite liberal in construing timely orders for appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 550 A.2d 959. The Court of Appeals discussed several cases in which Maryland appellate courts have construed notices of appeal broadly to encompass the right of those not specifically named in the notices of appeal to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 550 A.2d 959. In addition, the Court of Appeals noted that, in response to the defendant doctor\u2019s motion for sanctions, both the plaintiff and attorney \u201cpresented a common defense!,]\u201d and that, after the imposition of sanctions against both, the attorney had the right to appeal as a \u201cparty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 550 A.2d 959. The Court of Appeals observed that there was no evidence contained within the record to demonstrate that the attorney waived his right to appeal or that the language he used in the notice of appeal was to serve as a \u201cdeliberate limitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the notice of appeal was sufficient to include review of the sanctions imposed against the attorney. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">(b) Maryland Rule 2-433</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Maryland Rule 2-433, entitled \u201cSanctions,\u201d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">(a) For certain failures of discovery. Upon a motion filed under Rule 2-432(a), the court, if it finds a failure of discovery, may enter such orders in regard to the failure as are just, including one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">(1) An order that the matters sought to be discovered, or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purpose of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>(2) An order refusing to allow the failing party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party from introducing designated matters in evidence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">(3) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceeding until the discovery is provided, or dismissing the action or any part thereof, or entering a judgment by default that includes a determination of liability and all relief sought by the moving party against the failing party if the court is satisfied that it has personal jurisdiction over that party....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">Instead of any order or in addition thereto, the court, after opportunity for hearing, shall require the failing party or the attorney advising the failure to act or both of them to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">(d) Award of expenses. If a motion filed under Rule 2-432 or under Rule 2-403 is granted, the court, after opportunity for hearing, shall require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorney\u2019s fees, unless the court finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">This Court has stated that, \u201c[implicit in [R]ule [2-433] is the requirement that the moving party[ ] include in the motion for sanctions a request for expenses ... and the amount of expenses requested supported by an itemization of those expenses[.]\u201d <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>97 Md.App. 1, 26, 627 A.2d 17 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>335 Md. 699, 646 A.2d 365 (1994) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Returning to the instant case, as an initial matter, we agree with appellee that the notices of appeal filed by appellant failed to indicate that Parler appealed the imposition of sanctions against him individually. The record reflects that Parler did not file his own notice of appeal nor his own brief, and has not otherwise identified himself as an appellant before this Court. Thus, the case is in the odd posture of appellant, on behalf of its attorney, appealing imposition of sanctions against said attorney. We, nonetheless, construe the notices of appeal broadly given the Court of Appeals\u2019s holding in <em>Newman. </em>Accordingly, although it may have been advisable for Parler to definitively indicate that he appealed the sanctions imposed against him either in appellant\u2019s notice of appeal or by filing a separate notice of appeal, and to file his own brief setting forth his arguments as to why the imposition of sanctions against him was improper, we shall not interpret the notices of appeal to \u201coperate to exclude\u201d Parler. <em>Newman, </em>314 Md. at 386, 550 A.2d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">As to the merits, in the motion for sanctions, appellee requested that the circuit court: (1) order Parler to pay $10,135.45 as reimbursement for expenses and $1,500 in attorney\u2019s fees for preparation of the motion for sanctions; (2) report Parler to Bar Counsel; and (3) grant \u201csuch other relief as this Court shall deem appropriate.\u201d Although appellee asked that the circuit court grant \u201csuch other relief\u2019 the court deemed appropriate, other than the request of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees, appellee did not seek a specific monetary sanction against Parler. Given our reversal of the award of sanctions against appellant as stated in Section VI, <em>supra, </em>and Maryland Rule 2-433\u2019s explicit authorization of sanctions in the form of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees against attorneys whose conduct necessitated the motion for sanctions, and in light of appellee\u2019s lack of a request that a separate monetary sanction \u2014 aside from expenses and attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 be imposed, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s imposition of sanctions against Parler and remand for additional consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>In imposing sanctions against Parler, the circuit court stated that it had \u201cinherent power to sanction\u201d and, in determining the amount of the sanction, relied, in part, upon the case of <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 197, 728 A.2d 727, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 Md. 612, 735 A.2d 1107 (1999), in which we held that trial courts \u201c \u2018have the power to sanction the destruction of evidence, whether that authority is derived from [the discovery sanctions rule] or from their inherent powers.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted) (alteration in original). The monetary sanctions requested by appellee \u2014 expenses and attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 for Parler\u2019s alleged discovery violations in this case may properly be resolved under Maryland Rule 2-433, which provides a vehicle for expenses and attorney\u2019s fees as sanctions in circumstances involving the failure to disclose discoverable evidence, without resort to the circuit court\u2019s inherent authority. We remand the case with instructions to the circuit court to determine whether sanctions pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-433 in the form of an award of expenses and/or attorney\u2019s fees against Parler are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
