Gordon, M.D., Larry Waskow, P.A., and Chesapeake Urology Associates, P.A. (\u201cChesapeake\u201d). Dr. Gordon is a board certified urologist; Waskow is a urology physician\u2019s assistant; and Chesapeake is the professional association employing both Dr. Gordon and Waskow. In his statement of claim, appellant asserted that appellees\u2019 negligent care in 2005 was the proximate cause of his subsequent kidney failure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) of the Act, appellant filed a Certificate of Qualified Expert from Stanley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>C. Jordan, M.D., who attested that appellees deviated from the standard of care by \u201c[flailing to include nephritis on the differential diagnosis for [appellant] when he presented to the emergency department\u201d complaining of blood in his urine in July of 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In response, appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment and argued that Dr. Jordan was not a \u201cqualified expert\u201d under the Act, because Dr. Jordan, a board certified nephrologist, was not in a \u201crelated specialty\u201d to appellees. At a hearing before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the court found that Dr. Jordan \u201cwas not qualified to say what a urologist was able to do,\u201d and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. The circuit court also denied appellant\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">1. Did the circuit court err when it concluded that appellant\u2019s medical expert was not qualified to testify under the Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">2. If the circuit court did not err in concluding that appellant\u2019s medical expert was not qualified, did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to appellees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">For the reasons we will explain, we answer the first question in the affirmative, and thus reverse the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>circuit court and remand the case to that court for further proceedings. Consequently, we do not reach appellant\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">On June 2, 2005, appellant presented to <em>(ie., </em>arrived at) the emergency department at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, complaining of blood in his urine. Urinalysis taken at the hospital verified that appellant had gross hematuria (blood in urine), as well as proteinuria (protein in urine). Following these test results, appellant was prescribed antibiotics for what was diagnosed as a urinary tract infection and sent home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On July 27, 2005, appellant, accompanied by his mother, again presented to the Sinai Hospital Emergency Department, complaining about blood in his urine. This time, appellant complained further of a fever, sore throat, and right flank pain. Waskow examined appellant. Waskow then called and spoke with Dr. Gordon to review appellant\u2019s presentation, and to discuss Waskow\u2019s examination, evaluation, and treatment plan. However, no <em>physician </em>ever conducted an in-person evaluation or examination of appellant for his symptoms that day. Again, appellant was sent home with antibiotics to treat a urinary tract infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Nearly two years later, on May 28, 2007, appellant presented to the Sinai Hospital Emergency Department, complaining that he was spitting up blood. Tests conducted at the hospital revealed that appellant\u2019s kidneys were no longer functioning. Physicians present noted that appellant had been doing \u201creasonably well\u201d up until a few weeks before his May 2007 presentation, when he began experiencing flu-like symptoms. A renal biopsy revealed that appellant had late-stage IgA nephropathy, a severe kidney disease that requires appellant to undergo hemodialysis three times a week. Doctors concluded that the kidney disease had \u201cprogressed too long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>without treatment,\u201d and that the failure of appellant\u2019s kidneys was irreversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">On April 17, 2009, appellant filed a Statement of Claim with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (\u201cHCA-DRO\u201d). In addition to his Statement of Claim, appellant also filed a Waiver of Arbitration. The HCADRO issued an Order of Transfer from its office to the circuit court on April 21, 2009. Appellant then filed a complaint in the circuit court on May 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Also accompanying appellant\u2019s April 17, 2009 Statement of Claim was Dr. Jordan\u2019s Certificate and attached report. Dr. Jordan is board certified in pediatric nephrology, pediatrics, and diagnostic laboratory immunology. In his Certificate, Dr. Jordan opined that appellees (among others) \u201cdeparted from the standards of practice among members of the same health professions with similar training and experience situated in the same or similar communities\u201d when they treated appellant in June and July 2005. In his report, which was attached to the Certificate, Dr. Jordan specifically stated that, in his professional opinion, appellees (among others) committed malpractice by \u201c[flailing to include nephritis on the differential diagnosis for [appellant]\u201d when he presented to the Sinai emergency room in June and July 2005. Dr. Jordan further opined that these deviations from standards of care proximately caused appellant\u2019s injuries and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Following the close of discovery, on July 30, 2010, appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment. In their motion, appellees argued, as relevant to this appeal, that Dr. Jordan was not a \u201cqualified\u201d expert, because he is not a board-certified urologist, and because he did not have relevant clinical or teaching experience in a \u201crelated field of health care\u201d to urology. After appellant filed an opposition and appellees a reply, the circuit court held a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion on August 23, 2010. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted appellees\u2019 motion, ruling that Dr. Jordan \u201cwas not qualified to say what a urologist was able to do.\u201d The following day, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">On September 1, 2010, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the circuit court\u2019s order. The circuit court held a hearing on the motion on November 22, 2010, and denied appellant\u2019s motion. On the same day, the court issued a written order denying the motion for reconsideration and entering a final judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The instant appeal involves appellant\u2019s claim for medical malpractice under the Act, CJP I \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 to 3-2A-10. Appellant asserts that the appellees breached the applicable standard of care by fading to include nephritis in a differential diagnosis for appellant when he presented himself to appellees. Because appellant\u2019s claims are based on breach of the standard of care, appellant was required to file a \u201ccertificate of qualified expert\u201d (\u201cCertificate\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within 90 days of the date of filing his claim. <em>See </em>CJP I \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In appellant\u2019s claim for medical malpractice, as in all claims \u201cfiled on or after January 1, 2005,\u201d the Certificate is only proper if it complies with the further, specific requirements of section 3-2A-02(c)(2). Subparagraph 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">1. In addition to any other qualifications, a health care provider who attests in a certificate of a qualified expert or testifies in relation to a proceeding before a panel or court concerning a defendant\u2019s compliance with or departure from standards of care:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>A. Shall have had clinical experience, provided consultation relating to clinical practice, or taught medicine in the defendant\u2019s specialty or a related field of health care, or in the field of health care in which the defendant provided care or treatment to the plaintiff, within 5 years of the date of the alleged act or omission giving rise to the cause of action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">B. Except as provided in subsubparagraph 2 of this subparagraph, if the defendant is board certified in a specialty, shall be board certified in the same or a related specialty as the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">2. Subsubparagraph IB of this subparagraph does not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">A. The defendant was providing care or treatment to the plaintiff unrelated to the area in which the defendant is board certified; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">B. The health care provider taught medicine in the defendant\u2019s specialty or a related field of health care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">CJP I \u00a7 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u201c[I]t is not necessary for a certifying or testifying expert witness in a medical malpractice case to be the same kind of health care provider as the defendant.\u201d <em>Hinebaugh v. Garrett Cnty. Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>207 Md.App. 1, 20, 51 A.3d 673 (2012). As the Act explains in subsubparagraphs 1A, IB, and 2B, an expert need only satisfy certain professional qualifications in \u201cthe same <em>or a related </em>specialty [or field]\u201d to submit a valid Certificate (subject to the remaining procedural requirements). CJP I \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii)1A, -IB, -2B (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Appellant contends that \u201c[t]he Circuit Court erred ... because Dr. Jordan was qualified under the Health Care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Malpractice Claims Act to express the opinion that [appellees] violated the standard of care in treating [appellant].\u201d Appellant asserts that \u201cspecializing in the same medical field [as the defendant(s) in a medical malpractice suit] is not required\u201d in order for an expert like Dr. Jordan to be qualified. Appellant then argues that \u201cDr. Jordan\u2019s Certificate of Qualified Expert, supporting Report, and deposition testimony established that nephrology and urology are \u2018related\u2019 specialties\u201d in the context of this case, because \u201c[n]ephrology and urology share the kidney as a common focus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In response, appellees argue that \u201c[t]he plain language of the [Act], and this Court\u2019s application of that language in <em>DeMuth v. Strong, </em>205 Md.App. 521, 45 A.3d 898 (2012), and Hinebaugh,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] ... demonstrate that, for Dr. Jordan\u2019s certificate to have been valid, Appellant[] bore the burden of showing that Dr. Jordan\u2019s specialty, pediatric nephrology, overlapped with the Appellees\u2019 specialty, urology, with regard to the diagnosis of nephritis in the emergency room setting.\u201d Appellees claim that \u201c[t]he evidence before [the circuit court] showed that no such overlap existed,\u201d because nephrologists \u201cdiagnose and treat nephritis,\u201d while urologists do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The Court of Appeals previously explained in <em>Carroll v. Konits, </em>400 Md. 167, 929 A.2d 19 (2007), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjM\">[t]he determination of whether a Certificate and report are satisfactory, like the determination of whether a complaint sufficiently states a legally cognizable claim, is a determination to be made as a matter of law. As such, the standard for determining whether a Certificate or report is legally sufficient is the same as determining whether a complaint is legally sufficient, i.e., dismissal is only appropriate if, after assuming the truth of the assertions in the Certificate and report, and all permissible inferences emanating therefrom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the requirements set forth in the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute are not satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 180 n. 11, 929 A.2d 19. \u201cIn sum, because we must deem the facts to be true, our task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u201d <em>Debbas v. Nelson, </em>389 Md. 364, 372, 885 A.2d 802 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The dispute between the parties in the instant appeal centers on whether nephrology and urology are \u201crelated\u201d fields under the circumstances of this case, as that term is used in subsubparagraphs \u00a7\u00a7 3 -2A-02(c)(2)(ii) 1A and IB of the Act. \u201c \u2018The meaning of statutory text is an issue we review as a matter of <em>law' </em>\u2014 ie., <em>de novo.\u201d DeMuth, </em>205 Md.App. at 535, 45 A.3d 898 (quoting <em>Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. v. Waldt, </em>411 Md. 207, 222, 983 A.2d 112 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In carrying out this review, we are guided by the following well-established principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">When undertaking an exercise in statutory interpretation, as in the present case, the goal is to \u201cascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d In attempting to discern the intent of the Legislature, courts \u201clook first to the plain language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, courts will give effect to the plain meaning of the statute and no further sleuthing of statutory interpretation is needed. If the sense of the statute is either unclear or ambiguous under the plain meaning magnifying glass, courts will look for other <em>clues </em>\u2014 e.g., the construction of the statute, the relation of the statute to other laws in a legislative scheme, the legislative history, and the general purpose and intent of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">It is well-settled that a court must read a statute in the context of its statutory scheme, ensuring that \u201cno word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory,\u201d and that any illogical or unreasonable interpretation is avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Breslin, </em>421 Md. at 286-87, 26 A.3d 878 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Because \u201c[t]he word \u2018related\u2019 is not defined in the Act,\u201d we have looked to dictionary definitions of the word and concluded that, as used throughout CJP I \u00a7 3-2A-02(c)(2), \u201crelated\u201d means \u201c \u2018being connected; associated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, 45 A.3d 898 (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 1473 (4th ed.2006)). In <em>DeMuth, </em>the patient presented to the defendant, a board certified orthopedic surgeon, in 2005, complaining of pain in his knees. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 45 A.3d 898. On February 14, 2008, with the patient\u2019s consent, the defendant performed total knee replacement surgery on the patient\u2019s left knee. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 45 A.3d 898. Immediately after this surgery, the patient complained of numbness and tingling in his left foot; the defendant\u2019s postoperative examination did not show any signs of a decrease in blood flow to the left leg. <em>Id. </em>The defendant diagnosed the patient\u2019s postoperative condition as neuropraxia, a non-serious condition that was not vascular (ie., related to blood flow) in nature. <em>Id. </em>The next day, after the patient was unable to move or bend upward his left toes, the defendant again reviewed the patient\u2019s notes and, again, concluded that this condition was neuropraxia. <em>Id. </em>at 526-27, 45 A.3d 898. Ultimately, after the patient\u2019s condition worsened, his left leg was amputated above the knee. <em>Id. </em>at 529, 45 A.3d 898. At the patient\u2019s trial for malpractice against the defendant, the patient called a vascular surgeon to testify that the defendant, as an orthopedic surgeon, breached the standard of care in several discreet and specific ways following the February 14 surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 529-31, 45 A.3d 898. The trial court permitted the vascular surgeon\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 45 A.3d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On appeal, this Court affirmed the decision of the trial court. In a case of first impression, we were faced with the issue of interpreting the meaning of \u201crelated\u201d as used in section 3-2A-02(c)(2) of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 45 A.3d 898. Judge Deborah Eyler, writing for this Court, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">the word \u201crelated\u201d in the sense of associated or connected, as used to modify \u201cfield of health care\u201d and board certification \u201cspecialty\u201d in subsubparagraphs 1A and IB, respective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ly, embraces fields of health care and board certification specialties that, in the context of the treatment or procedure in a given case, overlap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 544, 45 A.3d 898. The <em>DeMuth </em>Court adopted significant portions of the reasoning from the federal district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jones v. Bagalkotakar, </em>750 F.Supp.2d 574 (D.Md. 2010). See 205 Md.App. at 542-44, 45 A.3d 898. Specifically, we highlighted the passage of the Jones decision explaining that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">[i]f the procedure is one which both healthcare providers have experience with and the standard of care is purported to be similar, then the expert\u2019s qualifications satisfy the requirements of the Act. If a procedure is common to two specialties, an inference of relation is created between the two specialties. However, if the procedure is one [with] which the purported expert does not have experience or performs with a meaningfully different standard of care, then the expert does not qualify under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">205 Md.App. at 543-44, 45 A.3d 898 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>750 F.Supp.2d at 581) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Applying the above principles to the facts of <em>DeMuth, </em>we noted that the vascular surgeon was not being asked to give and did not give standard of care testimony about the performance of knee replacement surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 545. Instead, the vascular surgeon\u2019s \u201copinions focused solely on the postoperative care and treatment of patients who have undergone that surgery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the central standard of care issue in the case was \u201cthe proper postoperative diagnosis and treatment of possible vascular complications of orthopedic surgery,\u201d we concluded that there was an \u201coverlap\u201d between the specialties of vascular and orthopedic surgery, and therefore, vascular surgery and orthopedic surgery were \u201crelated specialties]\u201d under the board certification requirement in CJP I \u00a7 3-2A2(c)(2)(ii)1B. <em>Id. </em>at 546 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Later, in <em>Hinebaugh, </em>207 Md.App. at 22, 51 A.3d 673 we stated that <em>DeMuth </em>stands for the proposition that, where medical specialties overlap in the context of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>treatment or procedure, \u201cthere also is an overlap of knowledge of the treatments and procedures among those health care providers certified in either specialty.\u201d For example, where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">the treatment rendered is performed by both specialists and therefore is within the overlapping expertise of two board specialty areas, so that both board certified specialists should be equally knowledgeable and competent to testify about the prevailing standard of care for a health care provider board certified in either specialty, the specialties are \u201crelated\u201d....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 28, 51 A.3d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In <em>Hinebaugh, </em>the patient-appellant was hit in the face, absorbing injuries to his jaw and left cheek. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 51 A.3d 673. The appellant was examined by a family medicine doctor, who ordered x-rays to the appellant\u2019s facial bones. <em>Id. </em>Two radiologists evaluated these x-rays and concluded that there were no abnormalities to the appellant\u2019s cheek bones. <em>Id. </em>The appellant subsequently reported increasing pain and numbness in the cheek, and was seen by a second family medicine doctor, who ordered a CT scan. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 51 A.3d 673. Upon reading the CT scan, the second family medicine doctor diagnosed the appellant with a supraorbital fracture. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 51 A.3d 673. The appellant then filed suit under the Act against the first family medicine doctor and the radiologists, and sought to qualify a doctor of dental surgery, who specialized in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS), as an expert. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 51 A.3d 673. The OMS dentist attested that the first family medicine doctor and the radiologists breached the standard of care by failing to diagnose the appellant\u2019s condition (a supraorbital fracture) in a timely fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 51 A.3d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">On appeal, we held that the expert whom the appellant offered was not qualified, because \u201c[ujnder circumstances such as those in this case, the areas of knowledge and experience of board certified family medicine and radiology doctors do not overlap the areas of knowledge and experience of board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>certified OMS dentists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 51 A.3d 673. We framed the issue as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">whether the specialties of family medicine ... and OMS ... and the specialties of radiology ... and OMS ... are \u201crelated\u201d in the context of the diagnosing, on a front line basis, of the medical condition of a patient who has been hit in the face by another person and is experiencing pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap\"><em>Id. </em>at 23, 51 A.3d 673. We reasoned that an OMS specialist, like the appellant\u2019s expert, is only involved after the fracture is diagnosed; unlike family medicine doctors and radiologists, the OMS dentist\u2019s services are not \u201csought out by front line doctors presented with a complaint by a patient of being hit in the face when a simple x-ray does not reveal any fracture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 51 A.3d 673. We further explained that \u201cit is not proper for an OMS dentist ... to express an opinion about the standard of care that governs a family medicine doctor or a radiologist\u201d in \u201cthe diagnosis of facial fractures in initially presenting patients.\u201d Id. at 29, 51 A.3d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Jordan stated in his Certificate that he is board certified in nephrology, and in his deposition, he testified that he is certified in \u201cpediatric nephrology, pediatrics, and diagnostic laboratory immunology.\u201d Dr. Jordan testified that he is also a practicing nephrologist and had worked in that position for 24 years at the time of his deposition in April 2010. In addition, in his Certificate, Dr. Jordan attested that the appellees (among others) departed from the standard of care by \u201cfail[ing] to properly evaluate and/or diagnose and/or consider on their differential [sic] [appellant\u2019s] condition of nephritis on June 2, 2005 and again on or about July 27, 2005.\u201d In his report, which was attached to the Certificate, Dr. Jordan opined that appellees (among others) departed from the standard of care by \u201c[flailing to include nephritis on the differential diagnosis for [appellant] when he presented to the emergency department at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Inc.\u201d on both June 2 and July 27, 2005. The issue for this Court to decide, therefore, is whether the specialties of nephrology (Dr. Jordan) and urology (appellees) are \u201crelated\u201d under the Act in the context of developing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>differential diagnosis for a patient who presents to the emergency department with blood and protein in his or her urine. <em>Cf Hinebaugh, </em>207 Md.App. at 23, 51 A.3d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">As a preliminary matter, we agree with appellant that nephrology and urology share a common focus on the kidneys. Urology is \u201c[t]he medical specialty concerned with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases of the genitourinary tract.\u201d PDR Medical Dictionary 2076 (3d ed.2006) (\u201cPDR\u201d); Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 1917 (27th ed.2000) (same) (\u201cStedman\u2019s\u201d). Although these dictionaries do not strictly define \u201cgenitourinary tract,\u201d they do clarify that the urinary tract consists of \u201cthe passage from <em>the pelvis of the kidney </em>to the urinary meatus through the ureters, bladder, and urethra.\u201d PDR at 2012; Stedman\u2019s at 1856 (same) (emphasis added). Indeed, <em>Gray\u2019s Anatomy, </em>a textbook widely used in the medical profession, states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">[t]he urinary organs comprise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u2022 two <em>kidneys (renes) </em>producing urine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u2022 <em>ureters, </em>conveying it to the pelvic urinary viscera, namely</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u2022 the <em>urinary bladder (vesica urinaria) </em>for temporary storage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">\u2022 the <em>urethra </em>by which the bladder empties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Gray\u2019s Anatomy 1814 (38th ed.1995) (emphasis added). Nephrology, by comparison, is \u201c[t]he branch of medical science concerned with medical diseases of the kidneys.\u201d PDR at 1290; Stedman\u2019s at 1191 (same). Nephritis, the condition that appellant developed, is \u201c[inflammation of the kidneys.\u201d PDR at 1289; Stedman\u2019s at 1190 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Merely sharing a common organ, however, is not sufficient, by itself, to compel the conclusion that nephrology and urology are \u201crelated specialties]\u201d for purposes of qualifying Dr. Jordan as an expert under the Act. We must review the circumstances of this case and determine whether nephrology and urology \u201coverlap\u201d in the context of \u201cthe treatment or procedure\u201d at issue. <em>DeMuth, </em>205 Md.App. at 544, 45 A.3d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We conclude that nephrology and urology are \u201crelated\u201d in the case <em>sub judice, </em>because \u201cthe treatment rendered\u201d (a differential diagnosis at the time the patient presents to the emergency room) is \u201cperformed by both specialists\u201d (both Dr. Jordan and appellees). <em>See Hinebaugh, </em>207 Md.App. at 23, 51 A.3d 673. A differential diagnosis is \u201cthe determination of which of two or more diseases with similar symptoms is the one from which the patient is suffering, by a systematic comparison and contrasting of the clinical findings.\u201d PDR at 531; Stedman\u2019s at 491-92. Of particular significance to this case, a differential diagnosis requires the physician to consider the diseases \u201cthat are <em>possibly responsible </em>for the patient\u2019s illness.\u201d Attorney\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary, at D20 (Ida G. Dox et al. eds., West 1997) (emphasis added). Thus Dr. Jordan opined, in effect, that appellees breached the standard of care by failing to consider nephritis as a disease that was \u201cpossibly responsible\u201d for the blood and protein in appellant\u2019s urine.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The record reveals that Dr. Jordan personally participated in the same kinds of \u201con-call services for emergency departments\u201d as the treatment appellant received in the instant case from appellees. During his deposition, Dr. Jordan had the following exchange with appellees\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Q: In your current practice over the last 10, 20 years, have you ever provided on-call services for emergency departments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">Q: Describe your experience in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">A: Well, in my role as director of nephrology and \u2014 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and director of the kidney transplant program, we\u2019re actively involved with the emergency room at our hospital on a day-to-day basis with any \u2014 with consults regarding matters related to medical kidney diseases or patients with transplant problems who may come to our emergency room. We have a 24/7 service available in our group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">Q: And you personally participate in taking call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>A: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Thus, unlike the OMS dentist who sought to be qualified in <em>Hinebaugh </em>\u2014 and like family medicine doctors, radiologists, and general urologists \u2014 Dr. Jordan, as a nephrologist who is actively involved in emergency room consults, is a \u201cfront line health care provider[ ].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Hinebaugh, </em>207 Md.App. at 28-29, 51 A.3d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Later in his deposition, Dr. Jordan further explained the nature of his responsibilities when performing an emergency room consult:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">Q: Have you ever had occasion \u2014 have you had occasion, when you see patients in an emergency department as a consultant, to refer patients to other specialists?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">Q: When\u2019s the last time you did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">A: Oh, we do it all the time. We have patients who come in that have \u2014 that are \u2014 that we \u2014 patients that we are taking care of, for example, our kidney transplant patients, the patients may have a urinary tract obstruction, we would refer that to the urologist. That probably happens three or four times a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">Patients may have other medical issues that we would refer to infectious disease or neurology. It\u2019s a \u2014 we have a very big, busy practice, both nephrology and kidney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>transplant. We\u2019re referring patients multiple times a week. And we do have a lot\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">[W]e refer a lot of patients to urologists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">Q: And what are the types of things you refer these patients to urology for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">A: It varies. Most of the time it\u2019s obstruction of the kidney. We have kidney stones. We have polycystic kidney disease that may need operation or removal. Patients may have multiple other surgical issues of the kidney, such as lymphoceles that are draining or need to be drained. Basically, the garnet [sic] of surgical kidney diseases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">As this testimony reveals, Dr. Jordan has experience with consults for emergency room patients who present both with medical issues of the kidney <em>and </em>with urinary tract obstructions and surgical kidney diseases. In other words, Dr. Jordan is familiar with the medical conditions and diseases normally treated by nephrologists and urologists that may be presented in an emergency room setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Most significant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Jordan testified at length about his familiarity with emergency room consults for patients who present with blood and protein in the urine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">Q: Are you ever \u2014 have you ever been called upon, in the last 10 years, to see a patient in an emergency department setting with a presentation of hematuria and proteinuria?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">A:. Absolutely. Many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-13\">Q: On approximately how many occasions in the last 10 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-14\">A: I would say probably 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Q: And are these patients who have already been diagnosed with glomerulonephritis or are these patients without a diagnosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">A: Both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">Q: And what is your role when you\u2019re called upon to see these patients? How is it that you\u2019re called in? Are you called by the emergency department attending or are you called by another specialist? How does it normally work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">A: Both. We will either \u2014 often, most often I will be called by the emergency room doctor with a problem, a kidney \u2014 a nephrologic problem in terms of consultation, especially when we\u2019re on the on-call rotation. We will go in and see the patient, evaluate them. Sometimes I am called by a nephrologist who\u2019s already seen the patient and wants a second opinion or a confirming opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">Q: Are you ever called by a urologist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">Q: In the emergency department setting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">A: That\u2019s fairly rare, but that has happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Dr. Jordan\u2019s testimony that he has seen \u201cpatient[s] in an emergency department setting with a presentation of hematuria and proteinuria,\u201d and that at least some of these patients have presented \u201cwithout a diagnosis,\u201d makes clear that he has evaluated patients similar to appellant in the instant case. Such evaluation would involve a differential diagnosis, which, as we have explained, is a procedure carried out on patients before any final diagnosis is made, during which physicians consider the universe of conditions \u201cthat are possibly responsible for the patient\u2019s illness.\u201d A differential diagnosis of a patient similar to appellant would involve knowledge of possible medical conditions and diseases treated by both nephrologists and urologists. Consequently, the procedure at issue in the instant case-preparing a differential diagnosis of a patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>who presents with blood and protein in his or her urine \u2014 \u201cis one which both healthcare providers Dr. Jordan and appellees] have experience with.\u201d <em>DeMuth, </em>205 Md.App. at 543-44, 45 A.3d 898 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>750 F.Supp.2d at 581).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Nevertheless, appellees argue that there is no overlap, because \u201c[n]ephrologists diagnose and treat nephritis[,]\u201d and \u201c[u]rologists do not.\u201d In support of this argument, appellees point to Waskow\u2019s deposition testimony that \u201c[diseases of the ... kidneys are not within our scope of practice.\u201d This argument is without merit, because the particular procedure or treatment at issue in the instant case is the preparation of a <em>differential </em>diagnosis from an emergency room consult involving a patient who presents with blood and protein in his or her urine, and not the <em>final </em>diagnosis and treatment of nephritis, as appellees argue. As previously stated, such differential diagnosis must take into consideration <em>possible </em>medical conditions or diseases treated by both nephrologists and urologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that under the circumstances of the case <em>sub judice, </em>nephrology and urology are \u201crelated specialties]\u201d pursuant to section 3-2A-02(c)(2) of the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in ruling that Dr. Jordan was not qualified to testify as an expert under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEES TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\">. Although appellant is now 22 years old, he was a 15-year-old minor at the time that he received the treatment by appellees relevant to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-10\">. Appellant also filed a second Certificate from Dan M. Mayer, M.D., an emergency medicine physician, not otherwise relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\">. The questions as posed in appellant's brief read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">1. Did the Circuit Court err in granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff's expert, a board certified nephrologist, was not qualified under the Act to testify that a urologist, a physician's assistant, and their employer violated the standard of care in treating Plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-13\">2. If the Circuit Court correctly held that Plaintiff\u2019s expert was not qualified, did the Circuit Court err by granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and directing the entry of judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff, rather than ordering that this action be dismissed without prejudice?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\">. Appellant was treated in June 2005 by physicians who are not parties in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\">. As the Court of Appeals has noted, some sources refer to the certificate as a \"certificate of qualified expert,\u201d while others use \"Certificate of Merit.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Carroll v. Konits, </em>400 Md. 167, 171 n. 2, 929 A.2d 19 (2007). For the sake of clarity and conciseness, we will follow their practice in referring to the filed document as a \"Certificate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\">. Appellant contends that \"[t]he Act incorporates the common law rule that an expert need not be a specialist to be qualified to testify about the governing standard of care.\u201d Specifically, appellant relies on <em>Radman v. Harold, </em>279 Md. 167, 171, 367 A.2d 472 (1977), in which the Court of Appeals wrote that, \u201cwe have never treated expert medical testimony any differently than other types of expert testimony....\u201d Appellees disagree, contending that \"[s]ection 3-2A-02(c) of the ... Act abrogates the common law tenets governing medical expert testimony,\u201d serving as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>a \"statutory abolition of the <em>Radman </em>rule.\u201d The answer, in our view, lies somewhere between these two positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In evaluating these arguments, we are guided by the principles restated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Wazer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 911 A.2d 427 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed, and it is not to be presumed that the legislature by creating statutory assaults intended to make any alteration in the common law other than what has been specified and plainly pronounced. Because statutes in derogation of the common law are disfavored, the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>has been extensively employed to avoid repeal of the common law, and refuted in order to make the statute cumulative with it. Most statutes, of course, change the common law, so that principle of narrow construction necessarily bends when there is a clear legislative intent to make a change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af\"><em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 911 A.2d 427 (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnote omitted). <em>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is a canon of statutory construction that means that \" \u2018to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 287-88, 26 A.3d 878 (2011) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 661 (9th ed.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Section 3-2A-10 of the Act, entitled \"Construction of subtitle,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An3\">Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-08A and 3-2A-09 of this subtitle, the provisions of this subtitle shall be deemed procedural in nature and may not be construed to create, enlarge, or diminish any cause of action not heretofore existing, except the defense of failure to comply with the procedures required under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">CJP I \u00a7 3-2A-10 (emphasis added). The text of this section unambiguously provides, among other things, that any party who wishes to challenge a Certificate on the grounds that the party who filed the Certificate \"fail[ed] to comply with the procedures required\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-02 and 3-2A-04 of the Act may do so. Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, \"the certificate requirement is in derogation of the common law, intended to place <em>additional </em>requirements on a claimant.\u201d <em>Breslin, </em>421 Md. at 284, 26 A.3d 878 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted); <em>see also DeMuth v. Strong, </em>205 Md.App. 521, 541, 45 A.3d 898 (2012) (noting that the requirements set forth in subsection (c)(2) of the Act are \"qualification <em>prerequisites </em>\u201d to whether an expert is allowed to testify) (emphasis added). Thus, in addition to the requirements at common law as set forth by Maryland Rule 5-702, \"experts certifying or testifying in medical malpractice cases\u201d must first clear the hurdles of section 3-2A-02(c). <em>DeMuth, </em>205 Md.App. at 541, 45 A.3d 898. We previously summarized the interrelationship between determining whether an expert is qualified by a valid Certificate and whether the expert\u2019s testimony is admissible, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">If the [Certificate] prerequisites are not satisfied, the expert cannot submit a valid Certificate or testify at a trial or hearing. If the prerequisites are satisfied, then, with respect to testimony, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>or panel chairman will determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony at the trial (or hearing), pursuant to Rule 5-702.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\">. We note that the circuit court did not have the benefit of our opinion in either <em>DeMuth </em>or <em>Hinebaugh </em>both when it made its original ruling in August 2010 and when it decided appellant's motion for reconsideration in November 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b64-13\">. Appellees note that on the Consultation Report form following appellant\u2019s July 27, 2005 visit, Dr. Gordon recommended that appellant \"should be referred to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation.\u201d Appellees also note that the discharge instructions given to appellant's mother on that day recommended that she \u201cfollow up with pediatric nephrology \u2014 Dr. Mendley at University of Maryland.\u201d Whether any such referral was made, however, goes to the issue of whether the standard of care was complied with. It does not address the issue of the instant appeal \u2014 namely, whether <em>Dr. Jordan </em>is qualified to define the standard of care itself and to opine as to whether such standard was breached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. Appellant advances two alternative arguments that we do not reach, for different reasons. First, appellant contends that \"Dr. Jordan had clinical experience, provided consultation relating to clinical practice, and taught medicine in a \u2018related\u2019 field of health care\u201d by teaching \"nephrology, transplant medicine, immunosuppression, and transplant immunology to urology trainees, medical students, residents, fellows, and physician assistants.\u201d Because we have concluded that under the circumstances of the instant case, nephrology and urology are \"related specialties\u201d within the meaning of the Act, we need not reach the merits of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Second, appellant claims that, even if Dr. Jordan is not board certified in a \"related\u201d specialty, his Certificate is still valid because the appellees were \"providing care or treatment to [appellant] unrelated to the area in which [appellees are] board certified.\" Appellant fails to present any argument in support of this contention as required by Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(6). Thus, even if we reached this argument, we would not agree with appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
