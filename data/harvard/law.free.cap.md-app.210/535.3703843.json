For the reasons that follow, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Charles G. and Elizabeth S. Grey owned farmland in Howard County. In 1980, the Greys took steps to become part of Maryland\u2019s agricultural land preservation program. To be part of the program, the farmland has to meet certain soil and location criteria and be at least 50 acres. Before 2007, the farmland had to be placed first in an Agricultural District.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Then, the landowner could sell a land preservation easement to the State. The owner had to sell the State an easement \u201con the entire contiguous acreage of such agricultural land.\u201d CO-MAR 15.15.01.05A (1979); 6 Md. Reg. 19-21 (Jan. 12, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">An agricultural district was created through a district agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Greys\u2019 district agreement required that the owners maintain the property for agricultural use and prohibited the subdivision and development of the land for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes. One exception permitted the landowner to convey one acre or less to himself and to each of his children for construction of a dwelling intended for personal use \u2014 a conveyance that could only be done one time for that owner and each child. The agreement stated that the \u201csubject property\u201d contained 131.347 acres, more or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In 1984, the Greys sold an easement to the State. The Deed of Easement states that it is an easement \u201cin, on and over the hereinafter described tract or parcel of land ... that is to say: All those three contiguous parcels of land ... described as follows!.]\u201d Throughout the rest of the deed, the three contiguous parcels are referred to as the \u201cdescribed land.\u201d Under covenants, conditions, limitations, and restrictions the deed states, \u201c[s]ubject to the reservations hereinafter contained, the Grantors covenant, grant, and relinquish the following rights: ... [t]he right to subdivide the above described land for any purpose except upon written approval of the Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In 1995, the Greys conveyed the entire land to Kenneth Lee and Maureen Fogarty Williams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The two then conveyed the land to Kenneth Lee Williams individually in 1998. In 2001, Williams conveyed the land to Covered Bridge Farms, LLC. Covered Bridge Farms then reconfigured the three parcels by Deed of Adjoinder Transfer and Deed After Adjoinder Transfer. This changed the parcel lines, the acreage of two of the parcels, and the numbering of the parcels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2006, MALPF approved the release of one lot from the easement for a personal residence for Covered Bridge Farm\u2019s owners, the Newsomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In 2007, Covered Bridge Farms was liquidated and, without requesting MALPF\u2019s approval, it conveyed the three reconfigured parcels to three separate entities, namely Covered Bridge Farms II, III, and IV. MALPF filed a complaint against the CBF entities and the Newsomes in 2011. MALPF alleged that the three separate conveyances constituted subdivisions of the land in violation of the deed of easement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>district agreement, and Maryland law and regulations. The CBF entities and the Newsomes moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. MALPF filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and declaratory relief. The circuit court granted MALPF\u2019s cross-motion, finding that the conveyance was a subdivision in violation of the district agreement, the easement, and State regulations; declaring the transfer null and void; requiring the land to be transferred to a common owner; and ordering the lot lines eliminated or restored to their original configuration.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Appellants present two questions for review,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which we have consolidated into the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Did the circuit court err in concluding that the transfer of the three reconfigured parcels from Covered Bridge Farms, LLC to the Covered Bridge entities were subdivisions in violation of the District Agreement, the Easement, and applicable State regulations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">For the following reasons, we answer this question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">We review a declaratory judgment that was entered as the result of the grant of a motion for summary judgment to determine whether that declaration was correct as a matter of law. <em>Claggett, </em>412 Md. at 61, 985 A.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">We focus on a case that is on all fours with this one. In <em>Stitzel v. Maryland, </em>195 Md.App. 443, 448-52, 6 A.3d 935 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(2010), we held that the conveyance of a portion of land that was subjected to an agricultural preservation easement was a subdivision of land even though the land had been separate before becoming part of the Maryland land preservation program. Paul F. Stitzel entered into a district agreement with MALPF in 1999. <em>Id. </em>at 445-46, 6 A.3d 935. The agreement placed three separate but adjoining parcels into one agricultural district. <em>State of Maryland, v. Stitzel, </em>Case No. 21-C-06-25292 DJ, (Circuit Court for Washington County, April 3, 2008). Stitzel then sold an agricultural land preservation easement on all the acreage in the agricultural district to MALPF. <em>Stitzel, </em>195 Md.App. at 446, 6 A.3d 935. In 2005, Stitzel conveyed one of the original parcels to a couple, the Bowers, without consent from MALPF. <em>Id. </em>MALPF filed suit against Stitzel for subdividing the land without permission. <em>Id </em>at 447, 6 A.3d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In concluding that this was a subdivision in violation of the district agreement and the easement, we explained first that the district agreement stated that \u201c[t]he landowner agrees not to subdivide the land for any purpose unless the Foundation first has approved the proposed subdivision,\u201d and the easement reiterated that \u201c[t]he land subject to this Deed of Easement may not be subdivided for any purpose including subdivision, off conveyance and the movement of boundary lines unless written approval first has been obtained from the [Foundation].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 6 A.3d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In defining subdivision, we agreed with the circuit court that the then-current COMAR regulation provided the best guidance. <em>Id. </em>at 449-50, 6 A.3d 935. It defined subdivision as: \u201cthe division of land into two or more parts or parcels.\u201d COMAR 15.15.01.01-2B(7) (2001), 28 Md. Reg. 1063 (June 1, 2001) (proposed), 28 Md. Reg. 1399-1400 (July 27, 2001) (adopted). The circuit court disagreed with StitzeFs argument that because the parcel was separate before the district agreement and easement it was already subdivided. <em>Stitzel, </em>195 Md.App. at 449-51, 6 A.3d 935. Instead, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>reasoned that all of the property that was included within the district agreement \u201cshould be considered one parcel,\u201d as it was sometimes referred to in the documents as the \u201csubject property\u201d or \u201cthe land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449-50, 6 A.3d 935. For more support on this issue, there was deposition testimony in the record from a representative of the Foundation who expressed the view that, \u201c[r]egardless of how many parcels are under easement, it is treated as one unit under easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 6 A.3d 935. This interpretation was reasonable in light of the evidence in the record that indicated that smaller parcels of land could be less valuable for agricultural uses. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 6 A.3d 935. We noted that \u201cthe definition of \u2018subdivision\u2019 found in the regulation ... simply contemplates the subtraction of a portion of land within an agricultural district or subject to an easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 6 A.3d 935. Therefore, we concluded that Stitzel\u2019s conveyance was a subdivision. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 6 A.3d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The holding in <em>Stitzel </em>controls the outcome of this case. The restriction on the subdivision of the land is found in both the <em>Stitzel </em>easement and the easement in this case. Here, the restriction reads: \u201c[sjubject to the reservations hereinafter contained, the Grantors covenant, grant, and relinquish the following rights: ... [t]he right to subdivide the above described land for any purpose except upon written approval of the Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation[.]\u201d In <em>Stitzel, </em>the restriction read: \u201c[t]he land subject to this Deed of Easement may not be subdivided for any purpose including subdivision, off conveyance and the movement of boundary lines unless written approval first has been obtained from the [Foundation].\u201d Although the appellants correctly point out that this restriction does not contain the words \u201coff conveyance\u201d or \u201cmovement of boundary lines,\u201d the focus in <em>Stitzel </em>was on the word subdivision, as it is in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The same COMAR regulation that applied in <em>Stitzel </em>applies in this case because it was the regulation in place when both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>conveyances occurred. Thus, subdivision means \u201cthe division of land into two or more parts or parcels.\u201d Appellants argue, just as Stitzel did, that the land was already subdivided before it entered into the agricultural program. But, in this case, just as in <em>Stitzel, </em>the district agreement and the easement described the three separate parcels as one \u201cland,\u201d one agricultural district. Also similar to <em>Stitzel, </em>the district agreement and easement refer to the three parcels as the \u201csubject property\u201d or \u201cthe land.\u201d Additionally, a Foundation representative stated in an affidavit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax6G\">As a routine matter, the Foundation accepted individual farms into the state agricultural land preservation program that are composed of separately described parcels of land. The Foundation does not require landowners to survey and combine the multiple parcels into one parcel because the great cost of doing so would discourage program participation. However, the Foundation considers the entirety of the multiple parcels covered in the District Agreement or easement as one \u201cland\u201d and one \u201cparcel\u201d subject to the subdivision prohibition that prevents any landowner from chopping up the farm and conveying its pieces or parcels to other owners, thereby destroying the farm\u2019s potential as a profitable agricultural unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The appellants vigorously contend that the land in this case should not be treated as one parcel because it was described differently than the land in the <em>Stitzel </em>case. They argue that the easement in <em>Stitzel </em>described the land as a single \u201cagricultural preservation parcel,\u201d while the easement in this case described three separate parcels. Looking at the two documents, we can see that this supposed difference is actually not a difference at all. Although one section of the easement in this case describes the three parcels as \u201call those three contiguous parcels of land,\u201d everywhere else in the easement these parcels are described as the \u201cland.\u201d Also, in the district agreement related to this case, the three parcels are referred to as the \u201csubject property\u201d and it is noted that the agreement is for the \u201cestablishment of an agricultural preservation district.\u201d Looking to the <em>Stitzel </em>easement, it similarly uses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>terms parcels and land. It sometimes says a \u201cparcel of land,\u201d while other times it refers to \u201cLots 1 thru 4\u201d or Parcel No. 1, 2, and 3. Just as the <em>Stitzel </em>Court concluded that there was one unit of land, we similarly conclude that the district agreement and easement in this case created one parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Stitzel conveyed one of the parcels that was separately described in the district agreement to a buyer. Here, the appellants actually reconfigured the three parcels that were part of the agricultural district and sold each parcel to a different entity. Thus, unlike in <em>Stitzel, </em>where the property lines were the same as they were before becoming part of an agricultural district, the three parcels in this case were not the same three parcels separately described in the easement. The Court in <em>Stitzel </em>determined that the conveyance of a parcel that was separately described in an agricultural district agreement was a subdivision. Thus, conveying three parcels that were not actually the same parcels separately described in the district agreement is clearly a subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">To no avail, appellants continue to argue that this case is distinguishable. They vehemently believe the conveyances in this case are different from the one in <em>Stitzel </em>because the parcel in <em>Stitzel </em>was improved with a dwelling, the buyers expected to receive the title free of encumbrances, and the parcel, according to appellants, was subtracted from the \u201coperation and effect\u201d of the easement. We disagree. The dwelling and the buyer\u2019s feelings were both irrelevant to the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Stitzel. </em>Additionally, the land was still subject to the easement. Specifically, the Court explained that the owner removed a portion of land that was still within an agricultural district and subject to the easement. Controlled by our holding in <em>Stitzel, </em>we conclude that the conveyances in this case were subdivisions of the agricultural district subject to the easement. Because the conveyances were subdivisions, the sellers needed the Foundation\u2019s approval before conveying the parcels to separate buyers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>As a final matter, we agree with appellants\u2019 contention that the agricultural regulations revised and enacted in 2011 do not apply to this case. Appellants specifically argue that the Foundation improperly tried to rely on three new regulations. First, COMAR 15.15.12.03(B)(7) (2011) changes subdivision to mean \u201cthe division of land into two or more parts or parcels. Subdivision includes the lease of any part or parts less than 100 percent of the total parts of the land for a term in excess of 20 years.\u201d Second, COMAR 15.15.12.02 (2011) ensures that the entirety \u201cof the land subject to an agricultural land preservation easement acquired by the Foundation is considered to be one parcel of land even if the total acreage comprises separately described parcels or government-assigned tax parcels or accounts.\u201d Finally, COMAR 15.15.12.04(A) (2011) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">except as approved by the Foundation as provided by this chapter and in COMAR 15.15.01.17C and 15.15.06.01-.06, a landowner may not subdivide land encumbered by an easement, including the movement of interior boundary lines, or transfer or cause to be transferred, any part or parts separately from the total acreage of the land, voluntarily, involuntarily, by testamentary disposition, or by reason of foreclosure or bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The new language of these regulations is not necessary for the conveyances in this case to be deemed subdivisions. Even without the new language, the conveyances were violations of the former regulations and the deed of easement. In 2007, when the land was conveyed, a subdivision was defined as a \u201cthe division of land into two or more parts or parcels.\u201d <em>Stitzel </em>held, in 2010 before the new regulation language, that land in one agricultural district was considered one parcel even if it originally had been more than one. Thus, the conveyances in this case were subdivisions regardless of the 2011 regulation language because the three parcels became one agricultural district in 1980 and the deed of easement in this case prohibited subdivision of the district without prior approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>For the reasons discussed, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">. The General Assembly has since eliminated this requirement as a condition for the easement sale application process. <em>See </em>Act of May 17, 2007, ch. 650, 2007 Md. Laws 4073. The law terminated \"agricultural districts\u201d as of June 30, 2012, except for those districts on which an easement had been conveyed to the Foundation or for districts established by a county for tax credit purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 4077. An easement has been conveyed to the Foundation on the district in this case and, therefore, is still in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">. This was a contract between the Foundation and the landowner.

The District Agreement provides that it is binding on subsequent heirs, successors and assigns, and the easement states that it runs with the land. <em>See Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation v.
