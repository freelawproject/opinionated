The Union filed a prohibited practice charge against the County Executive accusing him of violating \u00a7\u00a7 33-109(a)(8) of the Montgomery County Code (\u201cMCC\u201d). On May 14, 2011, the Montgomery County Labor Relations Administrator (\u201cLRA\u201d) issued a decision finding that the County Executive committed a prohibited practice by failing to submit an impasse arbitrator\u2019s award as part of his proposed budget. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The County filed a writ of mandamus in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking judicial review of the LRA\u2019s decision. The circuit court reversed the LRA and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Union ask us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">Whether the Labor Relations Administrator for Montgomery County, Maryland correctly applied the Montgomery County Charter and Code when he held that the Montgomery County Executive committed a prohibited practice by refusing to submit an impasse arbitrator\u2019s award as part of his annual budget submission to the Montgomery County Council and ordered the Montgomery County Executive to specifically perform his obligations under the County Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Finding that the LRA\u2019s decision was based on a correct interpretation of the law, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The facts in this case are undisputed. The Union and the County had a series of CBAs with the most current agreement set to expire on July 1, 2011. Consequently, the Union and the County Executive commenced bargaining for a new CBA in the Fall of 2010 and reached an impasse on certain economic issues in February 2011. Upon reaching an impasse, the parties submitted the dispute to an impasse arbitrator (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The parties were required by the MCC to submit their last, best, final offers (\u201cLBFO\u201d) to the Arbitrator, for the Arbitrator to review and decide which LBFO was the most reasonable. In making a conclusion, the Arbitrator was regulated by MCC \u00a7 33 \u2014 108(f), which stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKpC\">(4) In making a determination under this subsection, the mediator/arbitrator must first evaluate and give the highest priority to the ability of the County to pay for additional short-term and long-term expenditures by considering:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(A) the limits on the County\u2019s ability to raise taxes under State law and the County Charter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>(B) the added burden on County taxpayers, if any, resulting from increases in revenues needed to fund a final offer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">(C) the County\u2019s ability to continue to provide the current standard of all public services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">(5) After evaluating the ability of the County to pay under paragraph (4), the mediator/arbitrator may only consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(A) the interest and welfare of County taxpayers and service recipients;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">(B) past collective bargaining agreements between the parties, including the past bargaining history that led to each agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">(C) a comparison of wages, hours, benefits and conditions of employment of similar employees of other public employers in the Washington Metropolitan Area and in Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">(D) a comparison of wages, hours, benefits, and conditions of employment of other Montgomery County employees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">(E) wages, benefits, hours, and other working conditions of similar employees of private employers in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">On February 18-19, 2011, the Arbitrator held a hearing and both parties submitted evidence and presented witnesses. Following the hearing, the parties submitted briefs to the Arbitrator. On March 28, 2011, the Arbitrator issued an award finding that the Union\u2019s LBFO was the more reasonable offer. Under MCC \u00a7 33 \u2014 108(f)(6), the LBFO selected by the Arbitrator became the final agreement between the parties (\u201c2011 Agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MCC \u00a7 33-108(g) then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>In each proposed annual operating budget, the County Executive must describe any collective bargaining agreement or amendment to an agreement that is scheduled to take effect in the next fiscal year and estimate the cost of implementing that agreement. The employer must submit to the Council by April 1, unless extenuating circumstances require a later date, any term or condition of the collective bargaining agreement that requires an appropriation of funds, or the enactment or adoption of any County law or regulation, or which has or may have a present or future fiscal impact. If a later submission is necessary, the employer must specify the submission date and the reasons for delay to the Council President by April 1. The employer must expressly identify to the Council and the certified representative any term or condition that requires Council review. Each submission to the Council must include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">(1) all proposed legislation and regulations necessary to implement the collective bargaining agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(2) all changes from the previous collective bargaining agreement, indicated by brackets and underlines or a similar notation system; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">(3) all side letters or other extraneous documents that are binding on the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">The employer must make a good faith effort to have the Council approve all terms of the final agreement that require Council review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">On March 15, 2011, the date required for budget submission by \u00a7 303 of the Montgomery County Charter (\u201cCharter\u201d), the County Executive submitted a proposed budget (\u201cFY12 Budget\u201d) to the Council that did not include the Union\u2019s LBFO and sufficient funding to implement the 2011 Agreement, but instead included the County Executive\u2019s LBFO, which had been rejected by the Arbitrator. The County Executive\u2019s FY12 Budget admitted that \u201c[t]his budget recommendation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>inconsistent with the arbitrated award.\u201d The Union filed a petition in the circuit court to compel the County Executive to submit the Arbitrator\u2019s award as part of the FY12 Budget. The circuit court held that the Union\u2019s petition was premature because the Union was required to seek administrative relief first. To comply with the court\u2019s instruction, the Union filed prohibited practice charges with the LRA. The parties submitted briefs to the LRA and agreed to allow the LRA to decide the ease without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">On May 14, 2011, the LRA issued a decision finding that the County Executive\u2019s actions constituted a prohibited practice under MCC \u00a7 33 \u2014 109(a)(8), which states that it is a prohibited practice for the employer to \u201c[d]irectly or indirectly oppos[e] the appropriation of funds or the enactment of legislation by the county council to implement an agreement reached between the employer and the certified representative under this article.\u201d The LRA found that the Charter permits the Council to limit the County Executive\u2019s budgetary discretion by requiring the County Executive, by statute, to include an impasse arbitrator\u2019s award in the proposed budget. In his decision, the LRA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Since the County has admitted that County Executive did not include in his recent budget the interest arbitration award and it\u2019s [sic] funding, the LRA finds that the County Executive did commit a prohibited practice as charged by the Union. However, if the County Executive\u2019s newly claimed discretion, to decide what his budget will contain, is determined to be valid, no Prohibited Practice will be found. That being the case, this discussion will turn to the legal questions upon which the briefs focused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">This case presents a number of intriguing questions, which were not answered in the briefs, and which cause puzzlement and invite speculation. Here are just a few such questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">1. When did a County lawyer first realize that Charter 308 offered the opportunity for the County Executive to free himself of the requirement of the collective bargain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ing law on what must be included in his budget submission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">2. Was the County Executive immediately told he had established a poor practice by following the several collective bargaining laws in regard to what he must place in his budget?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">3. Did anyone assess the harm using this previously unknown discretion might have on the long established relationship with the several unions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">4. How is it possible that when amendments were made over the years to the County Charter, particularly those related to collective bargaining or to State or County laws, that no one discovered this conflict between the Charter and the collective bargaining laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">5. Doesn\u2019t the County have lawyers for both the Council and the Executive who should check on the language in proposed changes to the Charter and legislation to avoid such conflicts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">6. Has the decades-long practice by both the Union and County of following the collective bargaining law regarding what must be included in the County Executive\u2019s budget created a \u201cpast practice\u201d which, as it would in private sector arbitration, make the formal rule inoperative? The LRA understands there is a difference between a law and a collective bargaining agreement. The parties are free to modify a CBA by practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">On May 16, 2011, the County petitioned the circuit court for administrative mandamus to reverse the LRA\u2019s award. On June 7, 2011, the circuit court, in an oral opinion, granted the County\u2019s petition and reversed the decision of the LRA. The order was entered on June 10, 2011. On June 23, 2011, the Union noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Additional facts will be discussed in the relevant sections below.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The parties urge us to apply the usual standard of review of administrative agency decisions. Under this standard, the appellate court\u2019s role is identical to that of the circuit court, and we review the agency, or in this case, the LRA\u2019s decision. <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 273-74, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012); <em>Frey v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>422 Md. 111, 137-38, 29 A.3d 475 (2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1796, 182 L.Ed.2d 618 (2012). As such, our review is limited to determining if the agency\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and \u201cno error of law exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The agency\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Generally, we accord some deference to the agency when it is interpreting the statutes it administers. <em>Md. Aviation Admin, v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005). However, where the issue lies not with the collective bargaining statutes themselves, but with an interpretation of the Charter and the Council\u2019s ability to limit the County Executive\u2019s budgetary discretion, no deference is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">I. Collective Bargaining Law and Montgomery County Charter</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The Union argues that the LRA properly concluded that the County Executive violated the MCC sections pertaining to collective bargaining with the Union by failing to include the Arbitrator\u2019s award as \u201cpart of the budget.\u201d (Emphasis in original). The Union contends that the collective bargaining laws unequivocally require the County Executive to include an arbitrator\u2019s award as part of the proposed budget because the award requires fiscal action to fund the CBA. According to the Union, it is insufficient for the County Executive \u201cto simply submit the award for the Council\u2019s review or to submit a description of the award for the Council\u2019s consideration.\u201d The Union argues that the County Executive does not have \u201cunlimited \u2018legislative\u2019 discretion when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>participating in budgetary matters\u201d because the Charter limits that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The County responds that the County Executive has a \u201cvirtually unchecked\u201d discretionary legislative function in proposing a budget delegated to him by Charter \u00a7 303 that cannot be divested by any collective bargaining laws enacted by the County Council. The County asserts that the Charter \u201cpermits the Council to prescribe by law what information \u2014 as opposed to recommendations \u2014 the County Executive must include in the recommended budget.\u201d The County avers that the term \u201crecommendation\u201d refers to a \u201cdiscretionary act calling for the exercise of judgment\u201d in contrast to \u201ca requirement to provide information, which is a ministerial function.\u201d The County also argues that a prohibited practice charge cannot arise out of the County Executive\u2019s \u201cexpression of his views,\u201d and that the County Executive \u201ccannot be called to account before an arbitrator for an exercise of his legislative discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Ultimately, the dispute involves the interpretation of the Charter and any effect the collective bargaining laws enacted by the Council has on the County Executive\u2019s responsibilities under Charter \u00a7 303. The Court of Appeals, after noting that \u201c[t]he tension between public employee unions and local governments, particularly those bound by an executive budget system, has surfaced in Maryland appellate cases since at least [1945],\u201d provided an extensive review of the cases arising since then in the recent opinion in <em>Atkinson v. Anne Arundel Cnty., </em>428 Md. 723, 728, 53 A.3d 1184 (2012). After an exhaustive discussion, the Court concluded that collective bargaining is appropriate charter material, and a county can impose binding arbitration on the executive branch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 743-45, 53 A.3d 1184. There is no need to reiterate their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>thorough analysis here, in response to the parties\u2019 arguments, that binding arbitration cannot apply to the County Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">A. The State Executive Budget System</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Montgomery County budget system is modeled in many respects on the State budget system. The State has an \u201cexecutive\u201d budget system, where the budget originates with the Governor. So too, does Montgomery County \u2014 as the County points out, \u201c[u]nder the Charter, only the County Executive can initiate the County\u2019s budgetary process.\u201d However, where the State system limits the ability of the General Assembly to alter the budget submitted to it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Montgomery County system gives the Council unfettered authority to alter, reduce, or increase the appropriations submitted by the Executive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The similarities of the two systems, in regard to the limitations placed on the executive branch\u2019s discretion as to what must be included in the budget is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The State budget process is set forth in Art. III, \u00a7 52 of the Maryland Constitution. Section 52 was adopted, in large measure, to correct the haphazard system of appropriation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>that existed prior to 1915, which could easily lead to a deficit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See McKeldin v. Steedman, </em>203 Md. 89, 96, 98 A.2d 561 (1953) (\u201cAppropriations for various purposes were made piece-meal by the General Assembly, each project receiving independent consideration without relation to other claims upon the public purse.\u201d). Section 52 apportioned responsibility according to the established branches of government by vesting \u201csole responsibility, within the limits of the Constitution and the provisions of existing law, of presenting to the Legislature a complete and comprehensive statement of the needs and resources of the State\u201d to the Governor. <em>Md. Action for Foster Children, Inc. v. State, </em>279 Md. 133, 146, 367 A.2d 491 (1977) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>(quoting <em>Journal of Proceedings of the Senate of Maryland </em>at 133-34). The General Assembly was given authority to initiate appropriations, but was subject to the balanced budget requirement of Art. III, \u00a7 52. The underlying purpose of establishing an orderly budget system with clearly delineated responsibility was the rationale behind the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Foster Children, </em>where it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">The provisions of the Budget Amendment to the Maryland Constitution, Art. III, \u00a7 52, and the purposes underlying those provisions set forth in the Goodnow Commission\u2019s report, compel the conclusion that he funding of Art. 88A, \u00a7 60B(b) of the Code in future annual budgets is a matter constitutionally committed to the Governor\u2019s discretion. For a court to require that the Governor fund the foster care program administered by the Juvenile Services Administration at a particular level in future Budgets prepared and submitted by the Governor would be inconsistent with several provisions of the Budget Amendment to the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 367 A.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Court further explained: \u201cThe Legislature, by enacting statutes specifying minimum spending limits, cannot deprive the Governor of the discretion which the Constitution explicitly vests in him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 367 A.2d 491. The Court stated that if the General Assembly could specify what was to be included in the budget and the amounts, then the executive budget system would be destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 152, 367 A.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Dissenting, Chief Judge Murphy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">To impose such a mandatory duty on the Governor is not to cause the destruction of the executive budget system, as the majority suggests. Indeed, not to impose such a duty upon the Governor has far more deadly consequences; most certainly it would herald the demise of the delicate and time-honored balance existing between the power and responsibility of the legislature to make the laws and the Governor\u2019s duty to see that they are faithfully executed.... Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the Governor enjoys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>unbridled authority to ignore the legislative will, or even worse, to decide, in his sole discretion, which enactments will be funded and which will not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 153, 367 A.2d 491. The dissent pointed to the language of Art. III, \u00a7 52(4) requiring the Governor to include appropriations \u201cfor such other purposes as are set forth in the ... laws of the State\u201d and argues that this provision removes the Governor\u2019s discretion to simply exclude items from the budget. <em>Id. </em>at 157, 367 A.2d 491. The dissent explains that it is not \u201cnew or novel\u201d for the General Assembly \u201cby enacting a general law [to] compel the Governor to include an appropriation in his Budget Bill[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 367 A.2d 491 (citations omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 160-61, 367 A.2d 491 (citing the Goodnow Commission which drafted the Budget Amendment and Md.Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.) Art. 15A, \u00a7 21A). Citing to amicus curiae briefs, the dissent clarified the position of the General Assembly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">Maryland\u2019s adoption of an executive budget system has resulted in no transfer from the General Assembly of its fundamental power to declare what the law shall be, in fiscal as in other matters. At most, the adoption of such a system shifted to the Governor a role of initiation or proposal; it did not give to the executive branch any power to overrule legislative policy determinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">The Governor still has the power, within the guidelines established by the General Assembly by law, to allocate the general revenues of the state among the various programs provided by law and to determine the extent to which these programs shall be funded. If in his opinion the general revenues of the state will not be sufficient, then it is incumbent upon him to make this fact known to the Legislature so that it may levy such taxes as it deems best to provide the necessary revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 158-160, 367 A.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The majority\u2019s holding was superceded in part by a 1978 constitutional amendment, which required the Governor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>include in the annual budget bill any minimum level of funding for a program specified by statute. It is our view that, as a result, the dissent\u2019s argument has been vindicated and, as the County Executive analogizes his role to that of the Governor, this discussion is pertinent to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Further, because the question of whether the Council can permissibly constrain the County Executive\u2019s discretion in his budget submission is one of first impression, we will be guided by the State\u2019s example.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">B. History of the Montgomery County Charter</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Montgomery County evolved differently than the State, with the position of the County Executive established via an amendment to the County\u2019s original Charter. Montgomery County is a \u201chome rule\u201d county, authorized by Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution to adopt a county charter. The county charter functions as a \u201cconstitution\u201d for the county. <em>Mont. Cnty. v. Anchor Inn Seafood Rest., </em>374 Md. 327, 331, 822 A.2d 429 (2003) (citing <em>Save Our Streets v. Mitchell, </em>357 Md. 237, 248, 743 A.2d 748 (2000)). Article XI-A, \u00a7 3, requires \u201cthat a county adopting a home rule charter must select one of two types of government: (1) an elective legislative body known as the County Council without an elected County Executive or (2) an elective County Council plus an elective County Executive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 822 A.2d 429 (footnote omitted); <em>see </em>Md. Const. Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In 1948, Montgomery County adopted a charter. In the original charter, Montgomery County had no county executive, making the elected County Council the entire governing body with both legislative and executive powers. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 822 A.2d 429. Twenty years later, in 1968, Montgomery County adopted a new charter, effective in 1970, which, pursuant to Article XI-A, imposed separation of powers with the Council as the legislative branch and a county executive as the executive branch of the government. <em>Id.; see also Eggert v. Mont. Cnty. Council, </em>263 Md. 243, 256-60, 282 A.2d 474 (1971) (discussing the new charter and how the Council\u2019s efforts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>exercise powers now reserved to the executive branch were invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The original Charter expressly prohibited the Council, when sitting in executive session from exercising legislative powers. <em>Scull v. Mont. Citizens League, </em>249 Md. 271, 280, 239 A.2d 92 (1968). In construing the Council\u2019s powers respective roles, the Court in <em>Scull </em>stated that \u201cunambiguously ... the Council in executive session has and may exercise the administrative and executive powers ... and may implement and facilitate and insure the proper execution of laws and ordinances passed by the Council in legislative session[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 239 A.2d 92. This same delineation of power is reflected in the new (and current) Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Article 1 of the Charter describes the legislative branch of the county, with \u00a7 101 stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">All legislative powers which may be exercised by Montgomery County under the Constitution and laws of Maryland, including all law making powers heretofore exercised by the General Assembly of Maryland but transferred to the people of the County by virtue of the adoption of this Charter, and the legislative powers vested in the County Commissioners as a District Council for the Montgomery County Suburban District, shall be vested in the County Council. The legislative power shall also include, but not be limited to, the power to enact public local laws for the County and repeal or amend local laws for the County heretofore enacted by the General Assembly upon the matters covered by Article 25A, Annotated Code of Maryland, 1957, as now in force or hereafter amended, and the power to legislate for the peace, good government, health, safety or welfare of the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Article 2 of the Charter sets forth the executive branch powers, stating in \u00a7 201:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">The executive power vested in Montgomery County by the Constitution and laws of Maryland and by this Charter shall be vested in a County Executive who shall be the chief executive officer of Montgomery County and who shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>faithfully execute the laws. In such capacity, the County Executive shall be the elected executive officer mentioned in Article XI-A, Section 3 of the Constitution of Maryland. The County Executive shall have no legislative power except the power to make rules and regulations expressly delegated by a law enacted by the Council or by this Charter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The Charter\u2019s delegation of power is critical to an analysis of the meaning of Charter \u00a7 303. Section 303 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">The County Executive shall submit to the Council, not later than January 15 and March 15, respectively of each year, proposed capital and operating budgets including recommended expenditures and revenue sources for the ensuing fiscal year and any other information in such form and detail as the County Executive shall determine and as may be prescribed by law. These budgets shall be consistent with six-year programs. A summary shall be submitted with the budgets containing an analysis of the fiscal implications for the County of all available budgets of any agencies for which the Council sets tax rates, makes levies, approves programs or budgets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">As discussed, Charter \u00a7 305 gives the Council the authority to \u201cadd to, delete from, increase or decrease any appropriation item in the operating or capital budget.\u201d The Council clearly did not divest itself of authority to overhaul the budget submitted by the Executive in the way that the General Assembly is precluded from altering that submitted by the Governor. Section 511 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">The Montgomery County Council may provide by law for collective bargaining, with arbitration or other impasse resolution procedures, with authorized representatives of officers and employees of the County Government not covered by either Section 510 or Section 510A of this Charter. Any law so enacted shall prohibit strikes or work stoppages for such officers and employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The Council enacted the collective bargaining laws at issue pursuant to Charter \u00a7 511 and imposed binding arbitration on the Executive, but not on itself. <em>See </em>footnote 6 and accompa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>nying text, <em>infra. </em>It is evident that the Council retained nearly all the discretion in enacting a budget, subject only to the Executive\u2019s line-item veto power.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">C. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Recently, in <em>Mont. Cnty. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Mont. Cnty. Lodge 35, Inc., </em>427 Md. 561, 50 A.3d 579 (2012), the Court of Appeals reiterated the following regarding statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">It is a well-settled principle that the primary objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature. The first step in this inquiry is to examine the plain language of the statute, and if the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. Thus, where the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent. Furthermore, words may not be added to, or removed from, an unambiguous statute in order to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHo\"><em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 50 A.3d 579 (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v. Hayward, </em>426 Md. 638, 649-50, 45 A.3d 224 (2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). \u201cCharters are subject to the same canons of statutory construction that apply to the interpretation of statutes.\u201d Just as the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the legislature, so it is \u201cthe cardinal rule of charter interpretation.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; City Council v. Bunting, </em>168 Md.App. 134, 141, 895 A.2d 1068 (2006) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axr\">where a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment. In such circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>court, in seeking to ascertain legislative intent, may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">Even under the plain meaning rule, however, we do not ignore the Legislature\u2019s purpose if it is readily known ...

A statutory provision should be interpreted in the context of the entire statutory scheme, and reading the various provisions together and giving effect to each can aid in determining the intent of the legislature. <em>Office of the Pub.

Section 302 of the Charter, entitled \u201cSix Year Programs for Public Services, Capital Improvements, and Fiscal Policy,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">The County Executive shall submit to the Council, not later than January 15 of each even-numbered year, a comprehensive six-year program for capital improvements. The County Executive shall submit to the Council, not later than March 15 of each year, comprehensive six-year programs for public services and fiscal policy. The six-year programs shall require a vote of at least five Councilmembers for approval or modification. Final Council approval of the six-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>year programs shall occur at or about the date of budget approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">The public services program shall include a statement of program objectives and recommend levels of public service by the County government, and shall provide an estimate of costs, a statement of revenue sources, and an estimate of the impact of the program on County revenues and the capital budget.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">The capital improvements program shall include a statement of the objectives of capital programs and the relationship of capital programs to the County\u2019s long-range development plans; shall recommend capital projects and a construction schedule; and shall provide an estimate of costs, a statement of anticipated revenue sources, and an estimate of the impact of the program on County revenues and the operating budget. The capital improvements program shall, to the extent authorized by law, include all capital projects and programs of all agencies for which the County sets tax rates or approves budgets or programs. The Council may amend an approved capital improvements program at any time by an affirmative vote of six Council-members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">The fiscal program shall show projections of revenues and expenditures for all functions, recommend revenue and expenditure policies for the program period and analyze the impact of tax and expenditure patterns on public programs and the economy of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">The County Executive shall provide such other information relating to these programs as may be prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">All capital improvement projects which are estimated to cost in excess of an amount to be established by law or which the County Council determines to possess unusual characteristics or to be of sufficient public importance shall be individually authorized by law; provided however, that any project declared by the County Council to be of an emergency nature necessary for the protection of the public health or safety shall not be subject to this requirement if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the project is approved by the affirmative vote of six Councilmembers. Any project mandated by law, statutory or otherwise, interstate compact, or any project required by law to serve two or more jurisdictions shall, likewise, not be subject to this requirement. The County Council shall prescribe by law the methods and procedures for implementation of this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Just as in Charter \u00a7 303, in the above-cited section of the Charter, the County Executive is required to include in the six-year plan any \u201cother information ... as may be prescribed by law.\u201d The Council may amend an approved capital improvement program at any time by an affirmative vote of six Councilmembers. Here, the Charter again reserves to the Council the authority to amend the County Executive\u2019s submissions. Section 303 requires the County Executive to make the budget consistent with these six-year programs, a clear limit on the County Executive\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The Council retains the authority to limit the County Executive\u2019s power through legislation in other Charter provisions as well. Section 217, entitled \u201cReorganization of the Executive Branch,\u201d states that \u201c[t]he Council may prescribe by law the organization of the Executive Branch of County Government.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 309, entitled \u201cTransfer of Funds,\u201d permits the County Executive to \u201ctransfer an unencumbered appropriation balance within a division or between divisions of the same department\u201d but allows the Council to limit that authority in stating that \u201c[tjransfers between departments, boards or commissions, or to any new account, shall be made only by the County Council upon the recommendation of the County Executive.\u201d Section 501, entitled \u201cDisaster-Continuity of Government During Emergencies,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">In order to ensure continuity of government during an emergency caused by a disaster or enemy attack, the Council shall prescribe by law for the temporary suspension of specific provisions of this Charter and for temporary succes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>sion to the powers and duties of public offices whether filled by election or appointment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">(Emphasis added). The Charter affords the Council the authority to control the County Executive\u2019s action or limit the County Executive\u2019s discretion by enacting laws specific to more general Charter provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Moving on, the Charter provision in question, \u00a7 303, is not ambiguous. It requires the County Executive to include information \u201crequired by law\u201d in the budget proposal. The County argues that the provision in dispute in \u00a7 303 should be read such that \u201cother information ... as may be prescribed by law\u201d is separate from what must be included in the budget. We disagree. Parsing the sentence into its component parts results in the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">The County Executive shall submit to the Council, not later than January 15 and March 15, respectively of each year, proposed capital and operating budgets including [1] recommended expenditures and revenue sources for the ensuing fiscal year and [2] any other information in such form and detail [a] as the County Executive shall determine and [b] as may be prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The disputed provision requires that the County Executive \u201cinclud[e]\u201d in the budget \u201cinformation in such form and detail\u201d that is \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in addition to information that he chooses to include in his discretion. \u201cOther information\u201d cannot be separated from \u201cincluding\u201d in the way that the County suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Charter \u00a7 511 is also not ambiguous; it gives the Council the authority to enact collective bargaining laws with arbitration and impasse procedures if it so chooses, and which it has done. Those laws are binding on the County Executive as well as the employees to which they relate. If the County Executive, as the employer who is required to be bound by an arbitrator\u2019s decision, can effectively undo an arbitrator\u2019s decision by refusing to include any agreement in the budget proposal that requires appropriation, then an intractable conflict results. <em>See Atkinson, 428 </em>Md. at 748 n. 9, 53 A.3d 1184 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(discussing that if the legislative body is required to have the \u201cdiscretion to refuse to fund a binding arbitration award, then there can never be binding arbitration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We are required by another canon of statutory construction to \u201c \u2018avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bunting, </em>168 Md.App. at 142, 895 A.2d 1068 (quoting <em>Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 75, 854 A.2d 879 (2004)). The <em>Bunting </em>Court stated by way of example that Montgomery County had used its code to \u201cdefine the boundaries of what had been granted in [its] charter[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 895 A.2d 1068. Thus, the Council defined the boundaries of the County Executive\u2019s budgetary discretion granted generally in Charter \u00a7 303 as related to collective bargaining agreements in the MCC. Such an interpretation is consistent with Charter provisions that provide for the Council to supplement Charter requirements by enacting legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Court of Appeals explained that \u201c \u2018if two statutes contain an irreconcilable conflict, the statute whose relevant substantive provisions were enacted most recently may impliedly repeal any conflicting provision of the earlier statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atkinson, </em>428 Md. at 743, 53 A.3d 1184 (quoting <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552 (1992)). Moreover, \u201c[w]hen ... two statutes conflict and one is general and the other specific, the statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one.\u201d <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 306, 835 A.2d 1175 (2003) (citations omitted). Here, the County Executive has discretion as to what to recommend in the budget pursuant to Charter \u00a7 303, except where otherwise constrained by the later-enacted \u00a7 511 and collective bargaining laws. Interpreting the phrase \u201cas otherwise required by law\u201d in \u00a7 303 to exclude the collective bargaining provisions of the MCC is to render those words meaningless. Such an interpretation violates the canon of statutory interpretation requiring that no word is rendered superfluous or meaningless and, as discussed, would require interpreting \u00a7 303 inconsistently with other provisions of the Charter. <em>Atkinson, </em>428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Md. at 744-45, 53 A.3d 1184; <em>see also Office of Pub. Defender, </em>413 Md. at 465, 993 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">An amendment to the Charter, such as \u00a7 511, \u201cis necessarily limited in substance to amending the form or structure of government initially established by adoption of the charter.\u201d <em>Bunting, </em>168 Md.App. at 147, 895 A.2d 1068 (citation omitted). Unlike the cases cited by the parties in which charter provisions were invalidated by virtue of being too specific, or in the nature of \u201clegislative\u201d schemes, the County\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 511 is not specific enough because it does not require the County Executive to include an arbitrator\u2019s award in the proposed budget. <em>See Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 381, 470 A.2d 345 (1984); <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 415 A.2d 255 (1980); <em>Md. Classified Emps. Assoc. v. Anderson, </em>281 Md. 496, 380 A.2d 1032 (1977); <em>Wicomico Cnty. Fraternal Order of Police v. Wicomico Cnty., </em>190 Md.App. 291, 988 A.2d 555 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We find this argument unpersuasive and contradicted by the Montgomery County Attorney\u2019s July 22, 1998 opinion that \u00a7 511, which allows for collective bargaining with arbitration or impasse procedures for County employees other than police and firefighters, permits the Council to delegate the County Executive\u2019s responsibilities to a third-party. In the memorandum from the Office of the County Attorney to the Council, the County Attorney expressed the view that \u201cdelegating the County Executive\u2019s decision-making authority with respect to a collective-bargaining agreement to a private arbitrator\u201d would not \u201camount to an unlawful delegation of the executive power assigned to the County Executive by \u00a7 201 of the Charter\u201d because Charter \u00a7 511 authorizes the Council to provide for such delegation through legislation. The July 22, 1998 memorandum states \u201c[t]he legislative history concerning Charter \u00a7 511 confirms that \u00a7 511 was intended to authorize a binding dispute resolution process.\u201d The County Attorney concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Unless authorized by the County Charter, the Council would be without the authority to enact legislation to impose a binding dispute-resolution process on the exercise of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>executive function \u2014 like agreeing to a collective bargaining agreement \u2014 by the County Executive. But Charter \u00a7 511 does authorize the Council to enact legislation providing for arbitration to resolve collective bargaining impasses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201cabsent authorization from the county charter or State public general law, [a] local [collective bargaining] ordinance could not validly provide for the delegation to others of certain duties involving the exercise of discretion specifically assigned by a county charter to the county executive and council\u201d such as the budget. <em>Fraternal Order of Police v. Baltimore Cnty., </em>340 Md. 157, 170, 665 A.2d 1029 (1995) (citing <em>Freeman v. Local 1802, </em>318 Md. 684, 691, 569 A.2d 1244 (1990); <em>Anne Arundel Cnty. v. Fraternal Order, </em>313 Md. 98, 543 A.2d 841 (1988); <em>Md. Cl. Emp. Ass\u2019n., Inc. v. Anderson, </em>281 Md. 496, 380 A.2d 1032 (1977)). The Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">Where municipal governments have been authorized by higher law, <em>i.e., </em>state constitutional provisions, or public general laws or municipal charter provisions, to enter into collective bargaining agreements which bind them in the exercise of their legislative discretion, the courts have generally upheld such collective bargaining agreements, rejecting contentions that they amount to invalid abdications or delegations of legislative authority. On the other hand, in the situation where neither a public general law nor municipal charter provision authorized the municipality to bind itself in the exercise of legislative discretion over public employee compensation, the courts have generally taken the position that attempts to do so in collective bargaining agreements or municipal ordinances are invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Anne Arundel Cnty., </em>313 Md. at 114-15, 543 A.2d 841 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>281 Md. at 508-09, 380 A.2d 1032). In the instant case, the Charter allows for such delegation because it both permits arbitration in \u00a7 511, and subjects the County Executive\u2019s budgetary discretion to limitation \u201cas may be prescribed by law\u201d in \u00a7 303. The <em>Atkinson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Once the voters ... made the policy decision [to have binding arbitration in the budget process], Charter \u00a7 812 left all of the detail of implementation to the Council for the exercise of its Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3 law-making power in Bill 1-03. It covered possible mediation, each step in the selection of the neutral arbitrator, timing, the powers of the arbitrator, receipt of final offers of each party, ten factors to be considered by the arbitrator after receiving evidence, the final, binding award, possible revision thereof by agreement, post-hearing motion or court action, and implementation of the award as part of the budget process. We hold that Charter \u00a7 812 did not unconstitutionally preclude the exercise of the County Council\u2019s law-making discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">428 Md. at 749-50, 53 A.3d 1184. Clearly, the Charter permits limits to budgetary discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Requiring the County Executive to participate in the bargaining process but then allowing the County Executive to unilaterally refuse to include the results of that process in the proposed budget pursuant to MCC would foster uncertainty. No county employee would ever know the sincerity with which the County Executive was bargaining, or if the Council would be privy to any agreement reached between the County Executive and the Union. The Council considered the issues that the Charter raises \u2014 that the County Executive must consider the fiscal health of the county in submitting a budget \u2014 and created a detailed statutory scheme in which an arbitrator must consider several financial factors in determining which party\u2019s LBFO is the most reasonable. <em>See </em>MCC \u00a7\u00a7 33 \u2014 108(f)(4)\u2014(5). The County Executive\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in its brief, that the County Executive must retain the ultimate discretion on what to include in the budget because of changes in the economy, ignores that the Council reserved for itself the ability to address such circumstances. The Council retained the ability to add or remove items from the proposed budget, including items in any CBA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Similarly, the State has a collective bargaining law codified in Md.Code (1993, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-501 of the State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d), addressing collective bargaining with state employees. Subsection (c) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">(1) The parties shall make every reasonable effort to conclude negotiations in a timely manner for inclusion by the principal unit in its budget request to the Governor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">(2) (ii) In the budget bill submitted to the General Assembly, the Governor shall include any amounts in the budgets of the principal units required to accommodate any additional cost resulting from the negotiations, including the actuarial impact of any legislative changes to any of the State pension or retirement systems that are required, as a result of the negotiations, for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1 if the legislative changes have been negotiated to become effective in that fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">(Emphasis added). Subsection (d) states, regarding a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d), which is the equivalent of a CBA and contains all the terms agreed upon during the negotiations: \u201c(2) To the extent these matters require legislative approval or the appropriation of funds, the matters shall be recommended to the General Assembly for approval or for the appropriation of funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The Maryland Constitution, unlike the Montgomery County Charter, has no provision expressly requiring collective bargaining or binding arbitration. Nevertheless, the Governor is required to include in his budget amounts necessary to fund any agreement. In <em>Ehrlich v. Md. State Emps. Union, </em>382 Md. 597, 607-608, 856 A.2d 669 (2004), discussing why the Governor was required to sign the MOU or otherwise ratify it, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">The statute, at least on its face, does purport to limit the Governor\u2019s discretion. Section 3-501(c)(2)(ii) requires that \u201cin the budget bill submitted to the General Assembly, the Governor shall include any amounts in the budgets of the principal units required to accommodate any additional cost resulting from the negotiations.... \u201d Given that statutory mandate which, coupled with the Constitutional mandate of Art. III, \u00a7 52(4)(g) of the Maryland Constitution, would seem to require at least the incumbent Governor during whose term of office the MOU was signed to include appropriations to fund the MOU provisions, the Legislature obviously wanted to make certain that the Governor personally understood and approved what was in any MOU signed at his direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The State requirements are analogous to the situation in Montgomery County. The primary differences between the systems are the amount of control retained by the Council versus the General Assembly, the State collective bargaining provisions do not require binding arbitration or make an agreement reached through arbitration binding on both the employees and the Governor, and at the State level, the governor retains the discretion to ratify the MOU. It is settled that the Governor can be required by ordinary law enacted by the General Assembly to include specific items or funding in the budget. So too can the County Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Additionally, the County\u2019s arguments that Charter \u00a7 510, 510A, and 511 did not put the public on notice that the Council would constrain the County Executive\u2019s discretion in preparing a budget as it pertains to collective bargaining are equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>unpersuasive. Charter \u00a7 111, entitled \u201cEnactment of Legislation,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">The Council shall enact legislation only after public hearing upon reasonable notice. No legislation shall be enacted by the Council unless it receives the affirmative vote of five members of the Council. Legislation containing a section declaring that it is necessary for the immediate protection of the public health, safety, or interest, and enacted by the affirmative vote of at least six members of the Council, shall be expedited legislation. Expedited legislation, as defined in this section, is the emergency legislation referred to in Article XI-A, Section 3, of the Constitution of Maryland. Any vote cast by a member on any legislation shall be recorded in the journal of the Council.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Thus, the provisions in the MCC requiring the County Executive to submit to binding arbitration and to include the results of that arbitration in the budget were required by the Charter to be presented to the public. The Council could then act on the budget submission. In sum, we can find no persuasive authority supporting the County\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">D. Proposing the Budget is a \u201cLegislative Act\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The County argues that the County Executive acts in a legislative capacity when submitting a budget proposal to the Council. The Union disagrees, and the Court of Appeals has rejected such an argument several times, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">[W]e have an unbroken line of county authorities from the original Provincial county courts to the County Commissioners at the present time, and continuing to a County Council, if one is established under a charter, all authorized to exercise the power of fixing the county expenditures and raising money to defray them. This is, therefore, not a new power conferred upon the counties by Article XI[-]A, but on the contrary is a power always previously exercised by some local agency in every county.

The County Executive then proposed a second \u201csavings plan\u201d for FY11 in December 2010. The Council passed a revised FY11 budget with over $32 million in reductions from the budget that was originally enacted in May 2010. <em>Id. </em>at 465-66. In evaluating whether the County Executive and Montgomery County Fire Chief Richard Bowers, who supported the proposed cuts before the Council, were entitled to legislative immunity, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Legislative acts, the ones for which the immunity and privilege are granted, typically involve the adoption of prospective, legislative-type rules, rules that establish a general policy affecting the larger population.

Suburban Sanitary Comnn\u2019n, </em>631 F.3d 174, 184 (4th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Applying this test, the <em>Kensington </em>Court had \u201cno trouble concluding that enacting a budget is a legislative act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471 (citing <em>Bogan v. Scott-Harris, </em>523 U.S. 44, 55, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998) (finding that legislative acts can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>performed by an executive branch official)). The Court explained that the County Executive and Bowers were named as defendants \u201cbased on their legislative activity in proposing, submitting, and advocating for a budget\u201d and were, therefore, entitled to legislative immunity from the tort claim. <em>Id. </em>at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><em>Kensington </em>is distinguishable. It addresses a tort claim for discharge based on the County Executive advocating for budgetary reductions to a previously-enacted piece of legislation\u2014 the FY11 budget. It does not stand for the proposition that the inclusion of required information in a budget proposal constitutes a legislative, rather than a ministerial, act.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The County moves on to cite to cases that involve the General Assembly\u2019s delegation of appropriation authority to the Governor in further support of its argument that budget-making is a legislative function. These cases have only limited relevance to the case <em>sub judice </em>because, as discussed, \u201c[t]he Montgomery County budget system differs from the type of executive budget systems in several other charter counties and at the state government level.\u201d <em>Haub v. Mont. Cnty., </em>353 Md. 448, 450, 727 A.2d 369 (1999) (holding that a complaint challenged a legislative act only after the Council had acted on the County Executive\u2019s budget submission). Nevertheless, even if the County Executive\u2019s acts could be construed as legislative, these cases support our conclusion that the Charter\u2019s limit of the County Executive\u2019s budgetary discretion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In <em>Judy v. Schaefer, </em>331 Md. 239, 262, 627 A.2d 1039 (1993), the Court of Appeals explained that \u201cArticle III, \u00a7 52, allows the Governor to act in a way that would otherwise be considered legislative; the Governor has a major legislative-type role with respect to the budget.\u201d (Citing <em>Mandel v. O\u2019Hara, </em>320 Md. 103, 121-25, 576 A.2d 766 (1990) (holding that Governor\u2019s action in vetoing legislation is a legislative act)). The Court has made clear that \u201c[ujnder our cases, delegations of legislative power to executive branch agencies or officials ordinarily do not violate the constitutional separation of pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ers requirement as long as guidelines or safeguards, sufficient under the circumstances, are contained in the pertinent statute or statutes.\u201d <em>Christ v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 427, 441, 644 A.2d 34 (1994) (citations omitted); <em>see also Judy, </em>331 Md. at 263-64, 627 A.2d 1039; <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 440, 370 A.2d 1102 (1977). If the Charter delegates such \u201clegislative power\u201d to the County Executive, as the County argues, then Charter \u00a7\u00a7 303 and 511, along with the MCC collective bargaining provisions, are guidelines or safeguards for the exercise of that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">II. Prohibited Practice Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Having determined that the Charter permits the Council to legislate what the County Executive must include in the budget proposal, we now turn to the issue of whether the County Executive\u2019s failure to include the 2011 Agreement was a prohibited practice. To determine if a prohibited practice occurred, we must determine what the MCC collective bargaining provisions related to the Union require. MCC \u00a7\u00a7 33-108(f)(6) states that \u201cany provision which requires action in the County budget must be included in the budget which the employer submits to the County Council.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The code is unambiguous. The County Executive must include in the budget any provision from the parties\u2019 final agreement that will require action. <em>See </em>MCC \u00a7 33 \u2014 108(f)(6). The LBFO selected by the Arbitrator constituted the parties\u2019 final agreement. The Union argues that the award affects the budget and requires funding and, therefore, must be included as part of the budget. We agree. In reviewing the collective bargaining statutes as an entire statutory scheme and harmonizing the provisions related to the Union, the police, and the fire fighters, we hold that \u00a7 33-108(g) also requires the County Executive to include any CBA and its funding in the proposed budget that is submitted to the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The County avers that the County Executive submitted the award to the Council, albeit not as part of the formal FY12 Budget. This does not comport with our interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>what is required under the statute, and we are not persuaded by the County\u2019s argument that the Union had ample opportunity to advocate for the Council to reject the County Executive\u2019s budget and implement the 2011 Agreement. Nor is such an argument dispositive of the prohibited practice charge unless the statute requires no more of the County Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">MCC \u00a7 33 \u2014 154(a)(8) states that it is a prohibited practice for the employer to \u201cdirectly or indirectly oppose the appropriation of funds or the enactment of legislation by the County Council to implement an agreement reached under this Article[.]\u201d Refusing to abide by the statute requiring an arbitrator\u2019s award, if it requires action in the budget, to be included in the proposed budget serves to indirectly oppose the appropriation of funds sufficient to implement any agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Moreover, a Memorandum dated March 29, 2011, from the County Executive to the Council, with the subject \u201cFiscal Impact Statement \u2014 FY12 Labor Agreements between Montgomery County Government and Municipal and County Government Employees Organization (MCGEO), Local 1994, International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), Local 1664, Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 35, and Montgomery County Volunteer Fire Rescue Association (MCVRFA),\u201d briefly explains what the arbitrator awarded to each union, but then accounts in detail why the County Executive prefers restructuring and implies that the County Executive\u2019s proposals are the only way to save the County \u201cnearly $30 million in FY12.\u201d The attachments to the Memorandum are fiscal impact statements written so as to illustrate what the award will cost the County and are not a side-by-side comparison of the County Executive\u2019s LBFO and the Fire Fighters\u2019 LBFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Charter does not permit the County Executive to determine how the information is to be presented to the Council. As discussed, the Charter requires the County Executive to include the \u201cinformation in such form and detail\u201d as prescribed in the relevant MCC provisions. The County Executive\u2019s description of the arbitrated award is clearly designed to sway the Council into disfavoring it; this indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>interference is a prohibited practice. We agree that the Arbitrator\u2019s decision that the County Executive committed a prohibited practice is correct as a matter of law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The County argues that the County Executive\u2019s actions fall under MCC \u00a7 33-110(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">The expression or dissemination of any views, argument, or opinion, orally, in writing, or otherwise, does not constitute and is not evidence of a prohibited practice under any of the provisions of this article, nor is it grounds for invalidating any election conducted under this article if the expression or dissemination does not contain a threat of reprisal or promise of benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The County cites no authority in support of its position that this section encompasses the County Executive\u2019s budgetary omission, and we have been unable to discern any. A plain reading of the section indicates that it addresses the expression of views regarding the union itself, not the budget or an award. The County has not contended that the County Executive, in refusing to include any part of the award in the FY12 Budget, was expressing his opinion of the Union and, therefore, we do not hold that \u00a7 33-110(a) relieves the County Executive of his statutory budget responsibilities or protects him from a prohibited practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The County also argues that requiring the County Executive to include the 2011 Agreement in the FY12 Budget amounts to \u201c[Compelling an individual to affirm a belief that the individual does not hold [and] is repugnant to the principals [sic] protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d To the contrary, the County Executive is not expressing his views as a private citizen on a matter of public concern when he submits the budget; he is acting in his official capacity as the head of the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">It is well established that restraints may be imposed \u201con the job-related speech of public employees that would be plainly unconstitutional if applied to the public at large.\u201d <em>United States v. Nat\u2019l Treasury Emps. Union, </em>513 U.S. 454, 465, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>S.Ct. 1003, 130 L.Ed.2d 964 (1995) (citation omitted). The instant case does not present a situation in which the County-Executive is precluded from exercising his right to speech. In fact, the County Executive is required to advocate his views in the bargaining process, up to the submission of a LBFO should the parties reach an impasse. The statute requiring the County Executive to submit an arbitrated award promotes the efficiency of the budget and collective bargaining processes. <em>See Borough of Duryea v. Guamieri, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2488, 2500, 180 L.Ed.2d 408 (2011) (\u201cIf the interference with the government\u2019s operations is such that the balance favors the employer, the employee\u2019s First Amendment claim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of public concern.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III. Legislative Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Union argues that the County Executive\u2019s actions were not protected by the doctrine of legislative immunity because budget-making is not a legislative act. The County argues that because proposing a budget is tantamount to \u201cintroducing legislation,\u201d the County Executive \u201cis also clothed with legislative immunity and cannot be called to account before an arbitrator for an exercise of his legislative discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">We note that the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 895D, states that \u201c[a] public officer acting within the general scope of his authority is immune from tort liability for an act or omission involving the exercise of a judicial or legislative function.\u201d The Court of Appeals has explained that a \u201cgovernmental representative is entitled to public official immunity under the common law when he or she is acting as a public official, when the tortious conduct occurred while that person was performing discretionary rather than ministerial acts, and when the representative acted without malice.\u201d <em>D\u2019Aoust, </em>424 Md. at 586, 36 A.3d 941. This Court has recognized that the immunity broadly protects local legislators from having to defend their legislative actions in suit. <em>State v. Holton, </em>193 Md.App. 322, 368, 997 A.2d 828 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The County argues that legislative immunity also precludes the County Executive from having to \u201canswer to an arbitrator for the exercise of discretionary legislative responsibilities, such as recommending a budget.\u201d To this end, the County relies on <em>Mont. Cnty. v. Schooley, </em>97 Md.App. 107, 627 A.2d 69 (1993). However, while <em>Schooley </em>discusses how legislative privilege is akin to legislative immunity, that case dealt with Council members meeting to enact legislation, not an executive engaged in a ministerial function of adding a required submission to a piece of proposed legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the County Executive\u2019s inclusion of funding to implement any CBA is legislative, that does not compel the conclusion that the County Executive\u2019s actions during that process cannot be evaluated for the existence of a prohibited practice. The common themes of the decisions addressing immunity are the function being performed by the official and the amount of discretion involved in the performance of that function. However, the policy behind the immunity is to refrain from chilling the ability of officials to exercise their discretion in carrying out their official duties. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Mandel:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">The Supreme Court noted that official immunity apparently rests on two rationales, (1) the injustice of subjecting to liability an officer who is legally required to exercise discretion, particularly absent bad faith, and (2) the danger of deterring willingness to exercise judgment with decisiveness posed by the threat of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">320 Md. at 116-17, 576 A.2d 766 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">As discussed, the County Executive has no discretion, by enactment of the Council, regarding whether to include funding to implement the 2011 Agreement in the proposed budget. Therefore, neither of the rationales raised by the Court in <em>Mandel </em>apply. The concerns about the County Executive\u2019s ability to exercise his discretion are legitimate, but the Council provided an opportunity for the County Executive to have discretion \u2014 during the collective bargaining process itself. Once that process is complete, by agreement or impasse, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Council stripped the County Executive of any discretion regarding the inclusion of the CBAs and their funding in the budget, making the function ministerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Moreover, any immunity arising from the Executive\u2019s \u201clegislative\u201d activities is \u201ca matter of Maryland common law.\u201d <em>Mandel, </em>320 Md. at 134, 576 A.2d 766. As a charter county, the Council can change the common law by statute. <em>County Council for Mont. Cnty. v. Investors Funding, </em>270 Md. 403, 416-19, 312 A.2d 225 (1973). The Council did so by enacting the prohibited practice provisions of the MCC. Accordingly, we hold that the County Executive is not entitled to invoke legislative immunity to avoid being \u201ccalled to account\u201d for a prohibited practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Having thus discharged the responsibility imposed upon him by the Constitution, the Governor must thereafter await the final disposition of his recommendations by the Legislature, whose members were free to adopt, alter or entirely ignore any or all of them, except in so far as the Governor, by virtue of his prestige and his influence with the members of the Legislature, might affect the course of his recommendations through the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">The power to fix the fiscal policies and determine the course of the fiscal operations of the State was, therefore, exclusively vested in the Legislature, subject only to the mild restraint of the limited veto powers of the Governor, and whatever power of persuasion he might be capable of exercising with individual members of the Legislature. The old method often witnessed \"log-rolling\u201d or \"you help me and I\u2019ll help you\u201d tactics among many of the members of the Legislature in their efforts to insure passage of the particular appropriations in which they had some selfish or political interest.
