As a consequence, for the purposes of this appeal, appellee shall be referred to by her maiden name, Sarah Hornbeck, throughout the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b313-8\">HOTTEN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In this divorce action between Jeffrey W. Reichert (\u201cJeffrey\u201d), the appellant-cross-appellee, and Sarah Hornbeck<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cSarah\u201d), the appellee-cross-appellant, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted a divorce on the grounds of a twelvemonth separation, pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-103(a)(4) of the Family Law Article,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and granted both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>parties joint physical and legal custody of the child with tie-breaking authority to Sarah. The court declined to make any award of rehabilitative alimony to Sarah.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The court, however, ordered Jeffrey to pay $1,651 per month in prospective and retroactive child support. Because Jeffrey had contributed $500 per month in <em>pendente lite </em>child support prior to the absolute dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, the court credited him $4,806 in retroactive child support but, nevertheless, concluded he owed $15,006 in arrearages. As a consequence, the court ordered Jeffrey to pay an additional $500 per month in child support until the $15,006 in arrearages were satisfied. In addition, the court granted Jeffrey the right to claim the parties\u2019 minor child as a dependent for his 2011 taxes and every other year thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">After reviewing the property the parties amassed during their eighteen-month marriage, the court found that the 2009 joint tax refund should have been equally divided into both Jeffrey and Sarah\u2019s accounts. As a consequence, the court concluded that because Jeffrey had wrongfully dissipated the entire amount of the refund, it was extant property. Therefore, the court designated half the amount of the refund ($8,100) Jeffrey\u2019s extant property. As a result, the court granted Sarah a monetary award in the amount of $7,000 and further awarded her $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Following the court\u2019s judgment of absolute divorce, Jeffrey filed a motion to alter or amend the court\u2019s judgment on October 27, 2011. In response, Sarah filed a motion in opposition and further moved to revise the court\u2019s previous judgment on November 16, 2011. The trial court held a hearing on February 21, 2012, and issued a memorandum and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>order on March 30, 2012, leaving open the issue of whether Sarah was entitled to additional attorney\u2019s fees for the post-trial motions. As a result, the court held an additional hearing on April 13, 2012, denying her request for additional fees.</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Jeffrey noted a timely appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, Sarah filed a timely cross-appeal. In sum, both parties presented six questions for our review. We have consolidated, rephrased, and reorganized them as follows:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVg\">1. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion when it ordered joint legal custody of the minor child with tie-breaking authority to Sarah Hornbeck and when it ordered joint physical custody of the minor child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">2. Did the circuit court err in its findings when it calculated the child support owed to the parties\u2019 minor child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">3. Did the circuit court err or abuse its discretion regarding the tax exemption for the parties\u2019 minor child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">4. Did the circuit court err in granting Sarah Hornbeck a monetary award in the amount of $7,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">5. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in awarding Sarah Hornbeck $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\u2019s judgment of absolute divorce and its grant of joint physical and legal custody, with tie-breaking authority to Sarah Hornbeck. Because we conclude, however, that the court erred in ordering Jeffrey to pay an unrealized amount of income, in ordering alternating years to the tax dependency exemption without the appropriate consideration, in the granting of a monetary award, and in ordering $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, we vacate those orders and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Sarah and Jeffrey first met in a restaurant on April 8, 2000. Jeffrey was a recent law school graduate and bar exam passee, working for Allegis Group as Associate General Counsel. At that time, Sarah was preparing for her matriculation to the University of Baltimore School of Law and contemplating a future career in legal practice. The couple dated for a little over three years until their initial breakup in the spring of 2008. The relationship ended shortly before Sarah\u2019s successful completion of her legal studies. Although both Sarah and Jeffrey attributed their initial breakup of 2003 to different factors, both parties characterized their initial relationship as \u201crocky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Nonetheless, Sarah and Jeffrey remained in contact with one another following the end of their initial relationship. Around April of 2008, the two agreed to meet for dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Thereafter, the parties resumed their romance on and were engaged four months later. At that time, Jeffrey had proverbially moved-up the ladder at Allegis Group and was now earning approximately $125,000 a year as Group General Counsel for Allegis Group. In addition, he earned an additional amount from his work with the Army Reserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Shortly before the rekindling of their romance, Sarah was earning approximately $120,000 a year at Roy Kirby and Sons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Inc. She left the company, however, shortly after the end of her prior failed engagement. She subsequently assumed employment with Thomson Reuters as a Westlaw Research Specialist on August 17, 2009, earning roughly $68,340 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On November 1, 2008, Sarah and Jeffrey moved into a three-story rental property located at 1286 Harbor Island Walk, Baltimore, Maryland 21230. The parties were subsequently married in an elaborate ceremony at Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church on January 31, 2009. At the time of the parties\u2019 marriage, Jeffrey was 35.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sarah was nearly 34.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the parties\u2019 honeymooned on St. Kitts, an island located in the West Indies formally known as St. Christopher Island. Unfortunately, the conflict that Sarah and Jeffrey had experienced during their first relationship returned on the second night of their honeymoon and would remain throughout their short marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Despite the parties\u2019 many disagreements, Sarah bore a son, Grant Lyle Reichert (\u201cGrant\u201d), on November 7, 2009. Sadly, Grant was born with a collapsed lung, and spent the first three nights after his birth in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital. At approximately twenty-four to twenty-five days of age, Grant began vomiting. Unfortunately, Grant\u2019s vomiting progressively worsened, necessitating emergency surgery to correct his pyloric stenosis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Grant\u2019s medical complications have subsequently resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Sarah and Jeffrey found ways to work through their personal conflicts to attend to the needs of their child. However, once Grant\u2019s condition improved Sarah and Jeffrey\u2019s discourse resumed. Marriage counseling proved unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">At the end of a counseling session on August 27, 2010, Sarah and Jeffrey departed separately. Fearing for her safety and for that of her son, Sarah attempted to obtain a protective order, but her request was denied. Sarah returned home to Grant, who was in the care of Sarah\u2019s mother. Later that evening, divorce and custody papers were delivered to Sarah. After Sarah contacted counsel, she was subsequently informed that Jeffrey had filed a protective order against her. In response, Sarah filed a counter complaint for limited divorce, custody, child support and other relief. She subsequently filed a timely answer to Jeffrey\u2019s complaint on September 24, 2010. The parties proceeded to litigate the matter for a series of months.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Trial commenced on September 20, 2011. At the close of trial on September 30, 2011, the circuit court issued its oral opinion, in which it granted a divorce on the grounds of a twelve-month separation, pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 2012 RepLVol.), \u00a7 7-103(a)(4) of the Family Law Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and granted both parties joint physical and legal custody of the child with tie-breaking authority to Sarah. The court declined to make any award of rehabilitative alimony to Sarah.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">However, the court ordered Jeffrey to pay $1,651 per month in prospective and retroactive child support. Because Jeffrey had contributed $500 per month in <em>pendente lite </em>child support prior to the absolute dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, the court credited him $4,806 in retroactive child support but concluded he, nevertheless, owed $15,006 in arrearages. As a consequence, the court ordered Jeffrey to pay an addition $500 per month in child support until the $15,006 in arrearages were satisfied. Additionally, the court granted Jeffrey the right to claim the parties\u2019 minor child as a dependent for his 2011 taxes and every-other year thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The court subsequently addressed Sarah and Jeffrey\u2019s distribution of the marital property. Preliminarily, it noted that both Jeffrey and Sarah entered the marriage as property owners, each individually owning condominiums in Baltimore City, Maryland. Further, although the court acknowledged that the parties\u2019 retirement plans were marital property, it granted the retirement plans to the respective spouse for whom the plan was created. After reviewing additional property the parties\u2019 amassed during their eighteen-month marriage, the court found that the 2009 joint tax refund should have been equally divided into both Jeffrey and Sarah\u2019s accounts. As a consequence, the court concluded that because Jeffrey had wrongfully dissipated the entire amount of the refund, it was extant property. Thereafter, the court granted Sarah a monetary award in the amount of $7,000 and further awarded her $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Following the court\u2019s judgment of absolute divorce, Jeffrey filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment on October 27, 2011. In response, Sarah filed a motion in opposition and further moved to revise the court\u2019s previous judgment on November 16, 2011. The trial court held a hearing on February 21, 2012, and issued a memorandum and order on March 30, 2012, leaving open the issue of whether Sarah was entitled to additional attorney\u2019s fees for the post-trial motions. As a result, the court held an additional hearing on April 13, 2012, denying her request for additional fees. Jeffrey noted a timely appeal to this Court, to which Sarah responded by filing a timely cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Additional pertinent facts with be provided <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">(A) The Legal and Physical Custody of the Parties\u2019 Minor Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">After granting the parties\u2019 request for an absolute divorce and ordering that Sarah\u2019s maiden name be restored, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>circuit court addressed the issue of child custody in its oral opinion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel] has said to me that because [Jeffrey] has exhibited the behavior that I\u2019ve already spoken about before the trial, during the trial and the like. That I should not award him with the joint custody that he\u2019s requesting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">And I believe it was something to the effect that if, you know, is the kind of character, the person with this kind of character that should have the joint custody with the child. And when I thought about this and literally I had not made up my mind about anything, until I heard you all argue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">So I\u2019m back there thinking about it. And part of me initially said, you know, yeah. She\u2019s kind of right, because that\u2019s a character flaw. A lot of what I\u2019ve seen here is character flaw. But if I did that who would I be punishing? Would I punish [Jeffrey]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">But who am I to be concerned about when I\u2019m talking about custody? It\u2019s Grant. And then also if I did that it would punish Grant. And I\u2019m not willing to make him suffer. He has, regardless of what your flaws or individual flaws are[,] I think he has great parents. Regardless to what your individual flaws may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">I can address those in another way. But as far as [G]rant is concerned[,] he gets the best of both of you. As much as the other witnesses tried when they came in, and when it came down to it, each of them said I\u2019ve got concerns about him, but they\u2019re fit, and they\u2019re proper and they love their son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">And even when the other person testified concerning the parenting if you would of the other, it wasn\u2019t a whole lot that you all could say about, that was negative about the parenting, because it wasn\u2019t. Each of you are a good parent. Your character flaws show up when you deal with each other, but not when you deal with Grant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">And so when it comes to custody, this Court believes[,] and as much as I don\u2019t like to split children down the middle, it has been working, it\u2019s not broken. Joint custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>I am going to grant. Physical joint custody with Grant. And Pm going to address some other \u2014 we\u2019re going to change some issues concerning the holidays and the like, and we\u2019ll take about that in a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">But I just want to get the decision part out of the way, and we\u2019ll go back and tweak some of the other things. Each of you talked about, or you both said joint legal custody would be acceptable. And I, the concern that I have is that you all don\u2019t communicate well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">That\u2019s a concern that I have, but you\u2019ve asked for, or you\u2019ve agreed to a parent \u2014 a parental \u2014 a parent coordinator, sorry. You\u2019ve agreed to a parent coordinator. And I think that that [sic] is the best way to do it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">And the reason, short of your inability to communicate with each other, I have to deal with, certainly the character and reputation of the parents. I think short of what you all exhibit towards each other, as I said I think that each of you are \u2014 yeah\u2014other persons that came here to testify on your behalf, the proffers that I received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">They each find that you all are good people. Nobody has said that you\u2019re horrible people. One individual may not have liked how somebody looked at them, or how they didn\u2019t speak, or they did speak. Not that you\u2019re bad people. So[,] I can\u2019t say there\u2019s anything wrong with your character, or your reputation that gives this Court any concern when it comes to custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">The psychological and physical fitness of each parent, I find that you all are certainly equal in that matter. And so[,] therefore, I don\u2019t think that gets in the way. The desire of the parents and the content of any agreement between them, you all had one agreement concerning just the \u2014 that was financial more than anything else, the investment and the college tuition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">But you at least desire, each of you desires to be a good parent to Grant. And that\u2019s what I think is very, very important. Your willingness to share the custody, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>know that one side wanted, [Sarah] wanted sole custody with joint legal, but sole physical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">But [Jeffrey] wanted joint physical, as well as joint legal custody. So there\u2019s a little bit, you know, kind of plus and minus I did there with the willingness part of this, the factors that I look at. But not so much so that[ ] it would make me override that the consent agreement that you all entered into has been working. It has been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">The ability for you all, I talked about the communicating, we\u2019re going to settle that with the parent coordinator. The potential of maintaining natural family relations, I believe that whether the child is with [Jeffrey], or with [Sarah], ... they will have the ability commune with their families on an equal basis. Not just [Sarah] and not just [Jeffrey], but with grandparents, with cousins, and with aunts and uncles and the like on each side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">He\u2019s too young to tell me what his preference is, so we can\u2019t even consider that. The material opportunities that would affect the child\u2019s future, you all are more, as I indicated, extremely blessed to provide material opportunities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">Certainly [Jeffrey] makes more money than [Sarah] does. Whether that\u2019s, you know, in my opinion sometimes it\u2019s a choice that we make as to, you know, whether or not you make a lot of money, and sometimes it\u2019s not. Sometimes it\u2019s the best job you can get, and you hold onto that until you can do better. That\u2019s just the way of the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">The age, health and sex of the child, and Grant\u2019s very young. Not quite two, almost two, not quite. And his health is, from what I understand now is great. The only time that I think you all had the chance to bring it together was when he was ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">Yeah, and that was really when I thought, that was the one time that you all actually came together. And a lot of weight for a little boy. He couldn\u2019t even hold you together. So, you know, it only lasted for awhile. But that was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>time in which you all[,] sort of, had a meeting of the minds if you will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">The suitability of your residences, I have \u2014 they\u2019re certainly very suitable. I have no concerns one way or the other. I think again, he\u2019s a blessed little boy to have two residences, and the two that are as \u2014 that they\u2019re safe. And that he has a place where he can grow, and he can thrive. And so I think they\u2019re very suitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">How long \u2014 you want me to consider how long the child\u2019s been separated from one parent or the next. You all for the last year, all right, it\u2019s been 13 months maybe, something like that been [sic] sharing him back and forth. So he certainly hasn\u2019t had to be separated from either one of you to any extent to where it would damage him when he wasn\u2019t with you, or that he would resist going with you, because he\u2019s not familiar with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">There\u2019s been no voluntary abandonment for me to consider. His relationship with each of you, everyone comes in and testifies to each of you. And said how Grant loves you back, as much as you all love him. And that\u2019s important, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">You all live [in] very close proximity to each other[. S]o[,] that\u2019s not like someone has to travel a long, long distance to get to him and the like, but you do live very, very close. There\u2019s nothing, no schools I have to worry about, whether he lives \u2014 he\u2019s going to be able to go to school or he\u2019s not. I don\u2019t have to worry about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">The demands of each parent\u2019s employment. And there\u2019s a lot of talk about that. And in my reviewing and listening to the evidence, I think each of you, the way it came out can work as much as you want to work. In that sense of flexibility. You can work from home, when you want to work from home. You can go to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">You spend some hours when you travel, some hours when you travel. The Army \u2014 the Jag Reserve that [Jeffrey], that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>may take him away a little bit more. And I\u2019m going to address that period of time with the custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">____The age and number of children involved, only one child that\u2019s involved in this matter. Sincerity, motivation of the parent\u2019s request, you all are more sincere than anybody. And I think that the legal fees bear that out, that you\u2019ve been very serious about your requests, and the best interest of Grant, which is the final thing that I must consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">And as I said, I think that Grant deserves the best of both of you. I think that in the last 13 months, or how \u2014 I say 13 months, how many months are we talking about a year?.... That he has gotten the best of both of you. Nobody has testified to me about anything that\u2019s been less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">When Grant \u2014 when it was concerning [ ] Grant, ... you all gave your best. And that you all were, for the most part on your best behavior, when you all were doing the exchanges....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Following the court\u2019s continued discussion of how Grant\u2019s holidays and vacation schedule would be divided between Sarah and Jeffrey, the Court considered the matter of a tie-breaking authority with the parties\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">THE COURT: Yes, and I am holding \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I want to do. But I know what I have to do. I have to give a tie[-]breaker. I meant,] that\u2019s the hard part, because I just wish that you guys could talk, but you don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">Is there a way, and I\u2019ve seen this before, [counsel], where the parties cannot come to an agreement. That they have to seek a mediator, I\u2019ve seen that done before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Or with the parent coordinator <em>bona fide </em>efforts to try to resolve it, and if not then a tie[-]breaker\u2019s allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>THE COURT: Okay, okay. I can\u2019t make the parent coordinator do the tie[-]breaking authority can I? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">[Jeffrey\u2019s counsel]: Unfortunately, Your Honor, you can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE-\">THE COURT: Okay, all right. But the parent coordinator will be used for that particular reason, for communication between the parents. So there must be some <em>bona fide </em>effort. And then [Sarah] will have the tie[-]breaking authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">On appeal, Jeffrey contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered joint legal custody, with tie-breaking authority to Sarah. Specifically, he asserts that the court abused its discretion \u201cbecause [the court] gave no reason for the decision, because it was not supported by the evidence, and because there was no finding that it was in the son\u2019s best interest.\u201d Thus, he argues that, \u201c[i]n essence, the court gave legal custody to [Sarah.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Conversely, Sarah argues that while \u201cthe court had reason to grant sole custody\u201d to her, the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it ordered joint legal custody of their minor child with tie-breaking authority to her, because the court\u2019s order of a <em>bona fide </em>effort to agree via the parent coordinator safeguards Grant\u2019s best interest. Nevertheless, Sarah further contends that the circuit court erred when it ordered joint physical custody for two reasons. First, she asserts that \u201c[t]he trial court failed to give weight to [Jeffrey\u2019s] abuse of the legal system in his effort to obtain custody\u201d of their minor child. Second, she attests that \u201c[t]he court further failed to give adequate weight to the best interest[ ] of the child,\u201d which, she insists, is not \u201cserved here by joint physical custody.\u201d We conclude, however, that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Preliminarily, we note that this Court reviews child custody determinations utilizing three interrelated standards of review. <em>Gillespie v. Gillespie, </em>206 Md.App. 146, 170, 47 A.3d 1018 (2012) (affirming the circuit court\u2019s modification of physical custody by granting significantly more access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>father and concluding there was no error in modifying the joint legal custody decree by granting the father tie-breaking authority in the event of an impasse). The Court of Appeals described the three interrelated standards in the case of <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">.... [W]e point out three distinct aspects of review in child custody disputes. When the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Md. Rule 8-131(c) ] applies. [Second,] if it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7q\"><em>Id. </em>at 586, 819 A.2d 1030. Therefore, the reviewing court gives \u201cdue regard ... to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 819 A.2d 1030. Further, we acknowledge that \u201cit is within the sound discretion of the [trial court] to award custody according to the exigencies of each case, and ... a reviewing court may interfere with such a determination only on a clear showing of abuse of that discretion. Such broad discretion is vested in the [trial court] because only [it] sees the witnesses and the parties, hears the testimony, and has the opportunity to speak with the child; [it] is in a far better position than is an appellate court, which has only a cold record before it, to weigh the evidence and determine what disposition will best promote the welfare of the minor\u201d child. <em>Id. </em>at 585-86, 819 A.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">It is a bedrock principle that when the trial court makes a custody determination, it is required to evaluate each case on an individual basis in order to determine what is in the best interests of the child. <em>Gillespie, </em>206 Md.App. at 173, 47 A.3d 1018 (citations omitted). <em>See also Bienenfeld v. BennettrWhite, </em>91 Md.App. 488, 503, 605 A.2d 172 (1992) (\u201cIt is well established that child custody determinations be made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>careful examination of facts on a case-by-case basis.\u201d); <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Sanders, </em>38 Md.App. 406, 419, 381 A.2d 1154 (1978) (the best interest of the child varies with each individual case). \u201cCourts are not limited or bound to consideration of any exhaustive list of factors in applying the best interest standard, but possess a wide discretion concomitant with their \u2018plenary authority to determine any question concerning the welfare of children within their jurisdiction[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Bienenfeld, </em>91 Md.App. at 503-04, 605 A.2d 172 (internal citation omitted) (quoting <em>Kennedy v. Kennedy, </em>55 Md.App. 299, 310, 462 A.2d 1208 (1983)). Nonetheless, Maryland courts have provided a list of factors that the trial court may use in rendering its custodial determination. These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[AJmong other things, the fitness of the persons seeking custody, the adaptability of the prospective custodian to the task, the age, sex and health of the child, the physical, spiritual and moral well-being of the child, the environment and surroundings in which the child will be reared, the influences likely to be exerted on the child, and, if he or she is old enough to make a rationale choice, the preference of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>Wagner v. Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. 1, 39, 674 A.2d 1 (1996) (citing <em>Hild v. Hild, </em>221 Md. 349, 357, 157 A.2d 442 (1960), and <em>Kramer v. Kramer, </em>26 Md.App. 620, 623, 339 A.2d 328 (1975)), <em>quoted in Gillespie, </em>206 Md.App. at 173, 47 A.3d 1018. \u201cAt best we can discuss the major factors that should be considered in determining whether joint custody is appropriate, but in doing so we recognize that none has talismanic qualities and that no single list of criteria will satisfy the demands of every case.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 303, 508 A.2d 964 (1986) (discussing joint custody considerations). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he best interest of the child is therefore not considered as one of many factors, but as the objective to which virtually all other factors speak.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Indeed, there are specific factors particularly relevant to a consideration of joint custody: (1) the capacity of the parents to communicate and reach shared decisions affecting the child\u2019s welfare; (2) the willingness of parents to share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>custody; (3) the fitness of the parents; (4) the relationship established between the child and each parent; (5) the preference of the child; (6) the potential disruption of child\u2019s social and school life; (7) the geographic proximity of the parental homes; (8) the demands of each parents\u2019 employment; (9) the age and number of children; (10) the sincerity of the parents\u2019 request for joint custody; (11) the financial status of the parents; (12) the impact on state or federal assistance; (13) the benefit to the parents; and (14) any other relevant factors to be considered. <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 304-11, 508 A.2d 964. These factors, however, are \u201cin no way intended to minimize the importance of considering all factors and all options before arriving at a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 508 A.2d 964 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">To be sure, the capacity of the parties to communicate and reach shared decisions regarding the children\u2019s welfare is of paramount importance. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThis is clearly the most important factor in the determination of whether an award of joint legal custody is appropriate.... \u201d). <em>See also Gillespie, </em>206 Md.App. at 173, 47 A.3d 1018. As a consequence, \u201c[rjarely, if ever, should joint legal custody be awarded in the absence of a record of mature conduct on the part of the parents evidencing an ability to effectively communicate with each other concerning the best interest of the child, and then only when it is possible to make a finding of a strong potential for such conduct in the future\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 304, 508 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We caution, however, that this does not require the parents to agree on every aspect of parenting, \u201cbut their views should not be so widely divergent or so inflexibly maintained as to forecast the probability of continuing disagreement on important matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305-06, 508 A.2d 964. <em>See also Barton v. Hirshberg, </em>137 Md.App. 1, 25, 767 A.2d 874 (2001). Therefore, at a minimum, the parties must maintain \u201c[a] sense of respect for one another as parents, despite the disappointment in each other as marriage partners. Each [must] appreciate[ ] the value of the other to the child, and [maintain] sensitivity] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>to the possible loss of a parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 306, 508 A.2d 964 (citing S. Steinman, <em>Joint Custody: What We Know, What We Have Yet to Learn, and the Judicial and Legislative Implications, </em>16 U.C.D.L. Rev. 739, 745 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Ordinarily, the best evidence of compatibility with this criterion will be the past conduct or \u201ctrack record\u201d of the parties. <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 307, 508 A.2d 964. \u201cWe recognize, however, that the tensions of separation and litigation will sometimes produce bitterness and lack of ability to cooperate or agree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[t]he trial judge will have to evaluate whether this is a temporary condition, very likely to abate upon resolution of the issues, or whether it is more permanent in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBlind hope that a joint custody agreement will succeed, or that forcing the responsibility of joint decision-making upon the warring parents will bring peace, is not acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201c[i]n the unusual case where the trial judge concludes that joint legal custody is appropriate notwithstanding the absence of a \u2018track record\u2019 of willingness and ability on the part of the parents to cooperate in making decisions dealing with the child\u2019s welfare, the trial judge must articulate fully the reasons that support that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The instant record contains evidence of the parties\u2019 ability to cooperate in matters relating to Grant. First, there was the existence of an agreement for joint custody pursuant to a consent order prior to trial. <em>See Barton, </em>137 Md.App. at 26, 767 A.2d 874. Sarah argues before us, as she did before the trial court, however, that she \u201centered into the [i]nterim [c]onsent [ajgreement in the belief that the joint custody schedule would be temporary.\u201d She further asserts that she only acquiesced \u201cto this short-term solution on the courthouse steps in fear that she might lose custody entirely in light of the entry of the fraudulently obtained [i]nterim [protective [o]rder\u201d Jeffrey had obtained against her. Notwithstanding these assertions, she offered other testimony at trial suggesting that both she and Jeffrey \u201cshould participate fully in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Grant\u2019s life and his development and also [in] the decisions affecting his life and development and well-being.\u201d She additionally noted a willingness to adapt to circumstances when both she and her husband are working. Moreover, Jeffrey\u2019s testimony at trial additionally recognizes the parties\u2019 ability to work in tandem to address Grant\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">This evidence indicates that the parties have been able to communicate and reach decisions regarding Grant in the past. Admittedly, tensions and disagreements between the parties have escalated. Nonetheless, after hearing all the testimony and after judging the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses, the trial court concluded that the parties could resolve their differences and act together in Grant\u2019s best interest. As the trial court observed, \u201cwhen it was concerning [ ] Grant, ... you all gave your best. And that you all were, for the most part on your best behavior, when you all were doing the exchanges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Further, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the record reflects the parties\u2019 inability to communicate or cooperate regarding Grant\u2019s best interest, the court \u201carticulated fully the reasons that supported the] conclusion\u201d that joint physical and legal custody was appropriate through an extensive and thoughtful consideration of all suggested factors. The court specifically noted the parties\u2019 flexibility in their employment schedules and their sincerity in providing for Grant\u2019s best interest. In sum, the court believed, \u201cthat Grant deserves the best of both [Sarah and Jeffrey].\u201d The court believed \u201cthat in the last 13 months, or how \u2014 I saw 13 months, how many months are we talking about a year?.... That he has gotten the best of both of you. Nobody has testified to me about anything that\u2019s been less.\u201d The court additionally explained its reasoning in providing Sarah tie-breaking authority and observed that this authority was not to be used cavalierly: \u201cBut the parent coordinator will be used for that particular reason, for communication between the parents. So there must be some <em>bona fide </em>effort. And then [Sarah] will have the tie[-]breaking authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>As a consequence, we find no error or abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s grant of joint legal and physical custody. The circuit court\u2019s decision was not \u201cwell removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 583-84, 819 A.2d 1030. Therefore, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s order of joint legal and physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">(B) The Calculation of Child Support.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Following the circuit court\u2019s custodial determination, the court proceeded to address the issue of child support. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">.... So[,] that being said, the child support which I will follow right up with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">And my figures came out different from everybody\u2019s figures. And this is where people are going to stop smiling at me, and stop shaking their head in agreement, and I know that so I won\u2019t look at you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">Both sides agree that [Sarah\u2019s] salary per month is $5,695. Where you all differed was as to what [Jeffrey\u2019s] salary is. And I think that had [Jeffrey] been forthcoming about a number of things, we wouldn\u2019t have that question. I don\u2019t know whether that military salary is more or less than what that one document says that it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">I can\u2019t imagine, sir, that since January the l[st], 2001 and September the 30[th], 2011 that you could not have gotten one document to show this [c]ourt what it is that you were making this year. So as I said when you hide from me, it makes me wonder what you\u2019re hiding from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">And so where I won\u2019t punish you when it comes to Grant. And punish is a harsh word, I don\u2019t even really mean it in that term, but I guess what I mean is when I look at what I have to consider across the [b]oard, there is some way in which that has to be a sanction that I have to look at it, in a light that makes it more beneficial or equitable if you will for both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>So I am taking the salary that was on your W-2 form of $23,052.1 know that that [sic] includes the investment incentive, I know that. I know it and I\u2019m doing that on purpose, because I believe that a lot of this \u2014 hold that, take it back. $23,052 is what the [c]ourt came up with and believes that [is] what [Jeffrey\u2019s] salary is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">The problem is when I look at it on a shared basis, I did not include any allowance for a childcare [provider]. And I\u2019ll tell you why, this [is] 50/50[. W]hen the child\u2019s in your care[,] you pay for childcare. When the child is in your care and you need childcare, you pay for it. That\u2019s how this [c]ourt looks at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">The $140 will certainly be put in dad\u2019s column when it comes to the medical insurance. But that was the only thing that I put in the column. And I don\u2019t believe that either of the attorneys, short of the child care included anything else in their columns, other than the salaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">This is what the guidelines tell me. That the child support based on the shared custody, comes out to be $2,492 a month. That\u2019s what it comes out to be. And I don\u2019t know, it didn\u2019t make sense to me, because I looked at [Sarah\u2019s] proposal, that was based on the shared [custody].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">It was \u2014 I mean based on sole custody, physical custody to [Sarah], I would\u2019ve expected the numbers to have been higher, than what they were for shared. I put the numbers in, that\u2019s what they came out to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">And if anybody wants to say there\u2019s anything I\u2019m doing wrong with it, I\u2019m happy to hear it. But I can only plug the numbers in and it comes out to what it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Upon the court\u2019s invitation, the parties\u2019 counsel both indicated that the schedule on which the court had relied did not have equal amounts of overnights between Sarah and Jeffrey. After correcting the number, the circuit court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">Okay, that you all. $1,651 is the monthly child support. Let me go to my calculator. The date of filing that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>[c]ourt had, and I\u2019m doing it as to the date that [Sarah] filed. Now this is the date that I\u2019m using, September 21, 2010. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Okay. So actually, we\u2019re taking about one year? And I\u2019m dealing with the arrearages at this point. When I multiply 12, which is one year, it\u2019s $19,812. And that is before I subtract the credit that he is due. I had the credit at $4,806?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">So I have the arrearages at $15,006. Now, [Jeffrey], I\u2019ll tell you one of the things that did disturb this [c]ourt in hearing it, even though you were not under an order to pay child support. It would\u2019ve gone such a long way, had you taken that responsibility a lot earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">And certainly the $500 and some odd dollars that was given, it was $534 that was given to [Sarah] during the time that \u2014 pending trial, between January and today\u2019s date, was offset by the fact that she had to pay the \u2014 and agreed to pay for the Touareg. So really she came out with $5 a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">In essence, I\u2019m giving you credit for what you paid, but in a essence, that\u2019s kind of what she ended up with, it was like $5 once she paid the car note. It was $5 that she had. So you weren\u2019t under the order, but this is the child that you tell me that you \u2014 this is your man. This is your little man. And so I took that into consideration when I used the figure that I used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">I think the figures are legitimate. I know there was a question about the investment that was included in there. I believe that certainly your potential for this year getting the bonuses that you have gotten in the past. I certainly can\u2019t imagine that those won\u2019t happen again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">And when you look at the information that I was given, this is the figure that the [c]ourt believes is the actual figure of your salary, at least as much as I could put together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>about your salary, since there\u2019s a piece of it that I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">(emphasis added). Following the court\u2019s oral opinion and order, Jeffrey petitioned the court for rehearing to alter or amend its judgment. Specifically, Jeffrey argued that the circuit court \u201cerred in the determination of [his] income ... which resulted in an error in the calculation of [his] child support obligation and ... arrears.\u201d In response, Sarah moved for an increase in child support and requested the circuit court to modify Jeffrey\u2019s income to include his previously unreported rental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The trial court held a hearing on February 21, 2012. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the court denied Jeffrey\u2019s request to amend the judgment of child support and issued a memorandum opinion and order on March 30, 2012, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahn\">[Jeffrey] requests that this court amend its judgment to reflect that [his] actual monthly income is $18,295 and not $23,052. [Jeffrey] alleges that in calculating [his] child support and arrearage payments, the court included unrealized income in [his] monthly salary. [He] argues that the income received from the Allegis Group on Plaintiffs W[-]2 was unrealized income. For further guidance, [Jeffrey] suggests] that the Allegis Plan illustrates that [he] did not realize this income. [He] states that his correct monthly income is $18,295. Accordingly, per [Jeffrey], the monthly child support should be amended to $977 and the arrears should be amended to $6,918.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">In reviewing the Allegis Group Plan[,] it is clear to this court that the Allegis Group is a complicated investment vehicle. During trial, [Jeffrey] failed to provide the testimony necessary to support his claim that the $23,052 monthly salary is partially unrealized income based on how the Allegis Group investment vehicle is designed. The time to offer this testimony would have been at trial. [Jeffrey] likened the Allegis Plan to the S Corporation at issue in <em>Walker v. Grow, </em>170 Md.App. 255 [907 A.2d 255] (2006). The facts in <em>Walker v. Grow </em>indicated that the Appellee did not technically receive all the income reported on his tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>returns. In that case, as in this case before this court, the court had before it someone with a \u201csomewhat complex business and personal financial picture.\u201d Unlike the present case, expert testimony was offered to the trial court in <em>Walker v </em>[.] <em>Gro[w </em>] to assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence and to determine a fact in issue. An expert or a witness familiar with the design of the Allegis Plan would have been helpful to this court in determining if [Jeffrey] actually received income from Allegis. This testimony was not presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">.... Considering the fact that Allegis is not an S Corporation, no expert testimony was presented during trial and that this court questions the credibility of [Jeffrey] as it concerns his income, this court is not persuaded to rely on [Jeffrey\u2019s] assertion alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">The court did not find [Jeffrey] to be a credible witness during the trial on the merits, especially as to his testimony concerning his income. The court finds that [he] has not been credible and forthcoming about his income in that [he] refuse[s] to respond to [Sarah\u2019s] request for documents detailing his income from all sources in discovery. [Jeffrey] failed to respond to the court\u2019s order compelling discovery and during depositions^ He] failed to refused to produce documents as to all his income. Trial testimony revealed that [Sarah] willfully (and wrongfully) cashed the 2009 joint income tax return and retained the funds. Additionally [Jeffrey] points to his 2010 tax return to show his actual income. However, during the hearing on the motion it was brought to this court\u2019s attention that [he] failed to include on his income tax statement the rental income from his real property. Again, this is a credibility issue on the part of [Jeffrey]. For all of the above reasons, this court cannot rely on [his] testimony concerning his salary. Therefore, the court denies [Jeffrey\u2019s] request to alter and amend the order by reducing the income to $18,295. This court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>denies the request to adjust the arrears to the amount of $6,918.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">(footnotes omitted) (emphasis in added).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In addition, the circuit court granted Sarah\u2019s request to revise the guidelines to reflect an income from <em>Jeffrey\u2019s </em>rental property in the amount of $1,800 per month in rent. As a consequence, Jeffrey\u2019s monthly child support obligation was increased from $1,651 per month to $1,653 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Before this Court, Jeffrey asserts that the circuit court erred when it calculated the child support owed to Grant. Specifically, Jeffrey contends that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s inclusion of [his] [incentive [investment [p]lan and gross rental income ... to calculate child support was clearly erroneous and an abuse of discretion.\u201d Sarah counters Jeffrey\u2019s argument by asserting that circuit court properly exercised its discretion in calculating Jeffrey\u2019s child support obligations because Jeffrey \u201cwas given ample opportunity to present evidence^] including expert testimony to explain the overly complicated Allegis Group, Inc.[,] compensation plan.\u201d She further argues that \u201c[r]egardless, the parties\u2019 income is above the child support guidelines established by statute and the [court] did not err in including [Jeffrey\u2019s] [incentive [investment [p]lan earnings in the calculation of child support as the court clearly questioned [Jeffrey\u2019s] veracity when presenting his financial picture at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Preliminarily, we note that \u201c[t]he parents of a child are his [or her] natural guardians and, quite apart from the moral obligations of parenthood, owe the child a legal, statutory obligation of support.\u201d <em>Walker v. Grow, </em>170 Md.App. 255, 265, 907 A.2d 255 (2006) (quoting <em>Lacy v. Arvin, </em>140 Md.App. 412, 422, 780 A.2d 1180 (2001)). Therefore, in addressing these contentions, it is useful to put them in context by reviewing the purpose of the child support guidelines \u2014 notwithstanding our observation that this is an \u201cabove guidelines\u201d case. <em>See, e.g., Jackson v. Proctor, </em>145 Md.App. 76, 89, 801 A.2d 1080 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>To comply with federal law, the General Assembly enacted Maryland\u2019s Child Support Guidelines (\u201cthe guidelines\u201d) in 1989, contained in Md.Code (1989, Repl.Vol.2012), \u00a7 12-201 <em>et seq. of </em>the Family Law Article. <em>Jackson, </em>145 Md.App. at 89, 801 A.2d 1080 (citations omitted).

Considering the fact that Allegis is not an S Corporation, no expert testimony was presented during trial and that this court questions the credibility of [Jeffrey] as it concerns his income, this court is not persuaded to rely on [Jeffrey\u2019s] assertion alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">But Sarah\u2019s reliance on the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Walker v. Grow </em>is misconceived. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In <em>Walker v. Grow, </em>the parents of two minor children, Elinor Walker (\u201cmother\u201d) and Ronald Grow (\u201cfather\u201d), had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>engaged in several support disputes over the years. 170 Md.App. at 263, 264, 907 A.2d 255. There, the mother moved for modification of child support, alleging that the children\u2019s expenses had increased, and, additionally, that the father\u2019s income had increased. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 907 A.2d 255. The basis of the mother\u2019s assertion was premised on the fact that the father was chief operating officer to a S Corporation (\u201cAliron\u201d) and a shareholder in said corporation, which, in turn, resulted in the father\u2019s tax return showing an adjusted gross income of $272,835. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, the mother requested that the circuit court \u201crecalculate child support on the basis of an \u2018above [guidelines\u2019 analysis of the joint income of the parties, the minor children\u2019s expenses and other related factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In his monthly statement to the court at trial, however, the father listed in his financial statement monthly wages at $12,499.06, which amounted to an actual income of $149,988.72 per year. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 269, 907 A.2d 255. This financial statement, however, was a stark contrast to the father\u2019s federal income tax return for 2003, listing a taxable income of $277,175, and the federal income tax returns of 2001 and 2002, showing taxable incomes of $174,751 and $249,148 respectively. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 907 A.2d 255. Therefore, the father offered into evidence testimony of Aliron\u2019s accountant, who noted that \u201cbecause Aliron is a Subchapter S corporation, [the father\u2019s] federal income tax returns do not reflect his actual income. Rather, \u2018[the] income of the business is flowed through the shareholders and reported on the shareholder\u2019s personal tax returns, and the taxes associated with that income [are] paid by the shareholders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Aliron\u2019s account further explained that the father did not \u201c \u2018technically receive the income that was reported\u2019 on his tax returns[.]\u201d <em>Walker, </em>170 Md.App. at 269, 907 A.2d 255. Thereafter, the father entered into evidence a 1040 tax return on which Aliron\u2019s accountant had calculated his income without the pass-through income that was retained by Aliron, which would be used to pay the company\u2019s taxes or distributed for business purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 270, 907 A.2d 255. Aliron\u2019s accountant explained how she came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>to that calculated income and then proceeded to demonstrate the calculation from the stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">After considering all the evidence presented, the court ultimately found that the father\u2019s income was even less than the amount testified by Aliron\u2019s accountant. <em>Id. </em>273, 907 A.2d 255. Consequently, the circuit court based its child support award on a determination that the passthrough corporation\u2019s income should be excluded and that the father\u2019s actual income was $12,442 per month, which would amount to $149,304 per year. <em>Id. </em>The mother objected to the court\u2019s exclusion of the pass-through corporate income in the modified calculation of child support. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Before this Court, the mother asserted that the circuit court erred in accepting the testimony of Aliron\u2019s accountant in making its determination of the father\u2019s adjusted actual income. <em>Id. </em>Rejecting the mother\u2019s argument, we concluded that the trial court may admit expert testimony to assist in determining a parent\u2019s income when appropriate so long as \u201cthe court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 907 A.2d 255 (quoting Md.

The court found that because the parties shared custody of their son, they should share the right to claim the tax exemption of his dependency in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">THE COURT:.... Taxes, let me ask a question. I saw on the taxes from one of the years, well Grant\u2019s only been around for one probably, tax year. Where both persons had, both persons claimed him. Did they claim him for the full year, or half? Does anybody know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Well[,] I believe both claimed him as a dependent, as head of household with a dependent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">THE COURT: Okay. I believe if I\u2019m not mistaken, for taxes that each of them claim him for six months a piece on taxes. They cannot. Okay, then first year claiming since and \u2014 I thought I saw that on that. When I\u2019m filling out taxes 1 to 12 months, they gave you a range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Mr. \u2014 for the \u2014 the [c]ourt is actually, because I know what I\u2019m going later on concerning finances, the [c]ourt is actually going to, for the first \u2014 the taxes for this would [be for the] 2011 year, right? Tax 2011, [Jeffrey] is going to be able to claim Grant, 2011 and every odd year thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">2012 tax year, [Sarah] will be able to claim him, and every even year thereafter. Okay, let me go \u2014 are we \u2014 we\u2019re clear about the custody issues? So I can move onto the next thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Within Jeffrey\u2019s petition for rehearing to alter or amend its judgment of October 11, 2010, Jeffrey additionally argued that the circuit court had abused its discretion in alternating the tax dependency exemption. Specifically, he argued that \u201c[according to IRC \u00a7 152(c)(4)(A)(ii), when a child resides equally with both parents, as in the instant case, the parent with the highest adjusted gross income is entitled to the dependency exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">After the parties\u2019 hearing of February 21, 2012, the court denied Jeffrey\u2019s request to be named the sole beneficiary of the tax exemption within its memorandum and opinion of March 30, 2012, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">The court did not err when it ordered that the tax dependency exemption alternate between [Jeffrey] and [Sarah], [Jeffrey] argues that this court abused its discretion in alternating the tax dependency and requests the sole right to claim minor child as a dependent for state and federal tax returns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">IRC Section 152(c)(4)(B)(i) states that the tax exemption for a child shall be claimed by the \u201cparent with whom the child resided for the longest period of time during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>taxable year.\u201d Prior to 1984, a non-custodial parent could claim a tax dependency exemption if the non-custodial parent paid more than $1,200 toward the support of the child in the calendar year. The law now provides that the custodial parent is always entitled to the exemption unless he or she executes a signed waiver disclaiming the child as an exemption for a given year. The law changed in order to resolve the dispute between the divorce [sic] parents and to reduce the number of divorced parents both claiming the dependency exemption in the same calendar year. The committee wished \u201cto provide more certainty by allowing the custodial spouse\u201d to claim the exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Congress was silent on whether a state court can require a custodial parent to execute a waiver of the tax exemption to the non-custodial parent. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals in <em>Wassif v. Wassif </em>[77 Md.App. 750, 551 A.2d 935 (1988) ] ruled that a court order alone is insufficient to effectuate the transfer of the tax exemption. A non-custodial parent may claim the tax exemption only if the custodial parent executes a signed waiver of the exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">Although a Maryland court has not ruled on whether alternating the tax exemption is within the court\u2019s discretion, other states have made such a determination. A Mississippi state court ruled that the parties may alternate the tax exemption because the court found that both parties would benefit from the dependency exemption. In this case, the Mississippi court determined that the court did not abuse its discretion by alternating the tax exemption because both parties in the case are employed, have similar monthly incomes and would benefit from use of the dependency exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">An Illinois appellate court also determined that alternating the tax dependency is within the court\u2019s discretion. The court ruled that Defendant was entitled to the dependency exemption in alternating years because Defendant has substantial visitation with minor child and provides child support and health insurance benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>This court holds that due to the parties\u2019 shared custody of the minor child[,] alternating the tax dependency is within the spirit of IRS Section 152(c)(4)(B)(i) and follows Maryland [L]aw. This court finds this [sic] its decision is also consistent with other jurisdictions in that alternating the dependency exemption is beneficial to both parties. The minor child is in the care and custody of each party on a shared basis and therefore, both are entitled to claim the child on their taxes but in alternating years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Before this Court, Jeffrey maintains his assertion that the circuit court \u201cabused its discretion when it refused to modify its finding that the parties should alternate the tax dependency for Grant\u201d because \u201ceven if child support is modified to reflect [Jeffrey\u2019s] actual income, he pays the majority of the support for Grant.\u201d Thus, he attests that the court failed to conform with Section 152(c)(4)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that in situations where more than one parent is claiming the qualified child,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cif the parents claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>any qualifying child do not file a joint return together\u201d and \u201cif the child resides with both parents for the same amount of time during such taxable year,\u201d then that child will be treated as the qualifying child of \u201cthe parent with the highest adjusted gross income.\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. 152(c)(4)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Conversely, Sarah, relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wassif v. Wassif </em>77 Md.App. 750, 551 A.2d 935 (1989), argues that the trial court properly exercised its discretion because \u201c[a] court may assign or otherwise allocate the tax exemption for a minor child\u201d as it sees fit. We find Jeffrey\u2019s argument more persuasive and, therefore, vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and remand the issue for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Title 26, Section 152(e) of the United States Code provides the \u201c[s]pecial rule [regarding the tax dependency exemption] for divorced parents[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prior to January 1, 1985, Sections 152(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) (1982) of the Internal Revenue Code provided that unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by the parties or addressed in a court decree, the noncustodial parent could claim a dependency tax exemption if he or she paid more than $1,200 toward the support of a child in any calendar year and the custodial parent did \u201cnot clearly establish that he provided more for the support of such child during the calendar year than the parent not having custody.\u201d <em>See Wassif v.

Wassif, </em>77 Md.App. 750, 551 A.2d 935 (1989). There, Patricia Lynn Wassif (the \u201cmother\u201d) petitioned to alter the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County\u2019s judgment of absolute divorce, which, in part, ordered that Anis M. Wassif (the \u201cfather\u201d) would be entitled to claim one of the couple\u2019s three minor children as a dependent on his income tax returns. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 551 A.2d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">On appeal, the mother argued before this Court that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to order a custodial parent to execute a waiver of his or her presumptive right to the tax dependency exemption provided by Section 152(e) of the In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ternal Revenue Code. <em>Id. </em>at 759, 551 A.2d 935.

The new statute was meant to address the desire of the IRS not to get involved in such factual disputes where it had very little, if anything, to gain by the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\"><em>Id. </em>(relying on H.R.Rep.

Therefore, we turn our attention to the reasoning of our sister jurisdictions for guidance and begin where our decision in <em>Wassif </em>left off.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>Cross v. Cross, </em>178 W.Va. 568, 363 S.E.2d 449 (1987), the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reasoned that Congressional silence in the amended code as to whether a state trial court can require a custodial parent to execute a waiver \u201cdemonstrates Congress\u2019s surpassing indifference to how the exemption is allocated as long as the IRS doesn\u2019t have to do the allocating.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457. As a consequence, the court concluded that Congress did not intend to forbid state courts from allocating the exemption and that a state court has broad equitable power to order a custodial parent to sign the necessary waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">Indeed, under the new [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) ] a state court does not have the power to allocate the exemption simply by court order alone (as it could have done before the 1984 Amendment), but it does have the equitable power to require the custodial parent to sign the waiver ... [T]here is <em>no prohibition </em>\u2014 express or implied \u2014 on a state court\u2019s requiring the execution of the waiver, and because the court allocation of dependency exemptions has been custom and usage for decades, it is more reasonable than not to infer that if Congress had intended to forbid state courts from allocating the exemption by requiring the waiver to be signed, Congress would have said so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 458 (emphasis in original), <em>quoted in Wassif, </em>77 Md.App. at 760, 551 A.2d 935. <em>See also Hisquierdo v.

Thus, the court found \u201cnothing in the 1984 amendment to [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) ] that precludes a power in [West Virginia\u2019s] trial courts to award the dependency tax exemption as an integral power of setting child support <em>by ordering the custodial parent to execute the waiver required by the </em>[Internal Revenue Code].\u201d <em>Cross, </em>363 S.E.2d at 458 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Notwithstanding these findings, however, the court did not completely dismiss notions that the 1984 amendment to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) may also serve as \u201ca collateral financial benefit upon the custodial parent.\u201d <em>Cross, </em>363 S.E.2d at 457. The court went on to note that despite Congressional intent to only remove the Internal Revenue Service from the dependency dispute, See H.R.Rep. No. 432, Part II, 98th Cong., 2d Sess, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News </em>697, 1140, nothing was meant to imply that \u201cthe new [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) ] does not provide valuable benefits to custodial parents even though providing those benefits was not its primary purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. The court continued, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">----In the 94 percent of all divorces that are concluded by voluntary settlement, the custodial parent is given a new bargaining chip that, depending upon the economic circumstances, may be of significant value. Furthermore, when the dependency exemption is allocated to the non-custodial parent on a year-to-year basis[,] the custodial parent must sign a waiver to allow the noncustodial parent to take the exemption. This simple mechanical requirement provides the custodial parent with an opportunity to collect back support payments every April 15th. In light of the low level of compliance with alimony and child support awards, this scheme hardly seems ill-conceived from points of view other than the [Internal Revenue Service]\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The facts of life are that income tax exemptions are valuable only to persons with income, and up to a certain point, the higher the income the more valuable exemptions become because of the progressivity of the federal income tax. In this regard, it is to be remembered that the federal government is not providing every custodial parent with a cash grant under [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) ]. Rather, [Section 152(e) ] provides an economic benefit that is of significantly greater value to a parent with income than it is to a parent without income. Consequently, it seems only reasonable that the trial judge should allocate the dependency exemption to the parent in the highest tax bracket, and then enhance (or reduce) the value of the cash child support payments to offset the value of the exemption____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">This, however, is not to say that the custodial parent loses any of the benefits rightly conferred upon her by the new [Section 152(e) ]. When the circuit court orders that a custodial parent execute the waiver of the dependency exemption in favor of her former spouse, execution of the waiver is dependent upon a non-custodial parent\u2019s having paid his [or her] court-ordered child support. This gives the custodial parent leverage because she [or he] can refuse to execute the waiver in the event of nonpayment, which forces the non-custodial parent to take her [or him] back to court to force the execution of the waiver, at which time she [or he] may raise the back payment issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Cross, </em>363 S.E.2d at 459-60 (emphasis added). Thus, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals concluded that a trial court may allocate the tax dependency exemption to the noncustodial parent so long as he or she is within a higher tax bracket and additionally enhance the child support obligation of the non-custodial parent to offset the value of the tax exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Like the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Cross, </em>the Court of Appeals of Missouri reached a similar conclusion regarding the Congressional silence in <em>Vohsen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Vohsen, </em>801 S.W.2d 789 (Mo.Ct.App.1991) (noting that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e)\u2019s amendments \u201csought to achieve \u2018certainty in the allocation of dependency exemption <em>for federal tax administration purposes.\u2019 \u201d </em>(quoting <em>Cross, </em>363 S.E.2d at 457)) (emphasis in <em>Cross, </em>363 S.E.2d at 457).

Dickinson, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court observed that, given the amendments to Section 152(e)\u2019s administrative convenience, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) \u201cdoes not limit the state court\u2019s authority to allocate the exemption[,]\u201d because the allocation of the exemption concerns the support of the child. <em>Singer, 588 </em>N.E.2d at 809, 811 (citation omitted). The court\u2019s evaluation of the Section 152(e) resulted in a determination that \u201c[t]he exemption is clearly meant to provide a federal tax allowance for the costs attributable to supporting children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 811 (reasoning that such a purpose is apparent from the plain language of the statute, \u201cwhich recognizes the custodial parent presumption only if the child received over half of his support from his parents\u201d). The court rejected, however, the juvenile court\u2019s stated reasons for the allocation of the tax exemption, premised on an analysis of the percentages of support. <em>Id. </em>at 812. It reasoned that an allocation of the dependency exemption that only \u201cmarginally increased the non-custodial parent\u2019s ability to pay child support equates to no more than a zero-sum transaction,\u201d resulting in infinitesimal benefit to the child\u2019s interests. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">The juvenile court\u2019s analysis of percentages of support is inadequate when the dependency exemption is at issue. The allocation of the dependency exemption provided by Section 152(e) ... may be awarded to the non [-jcustodial parent when that allocation would produce a net tax savings for the parents, thereby furthering the best interest of the child. Such savings would occur through allocation to the non [-jcustodial parent only if the non[-]custodial parent\u2019s taxable income falls into a higher tax bracket than the tax bracket of the custodial parent.... If both parents\u2019 incomes are taxed in the same tax bracket, no net savings are realized by allocating the exemption to the non[-]custodial parent....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">The juvenile court\u2019s analysis assumes that the parent having the greater support obligation under the guidelines should have the exemption. However, we do not perceive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>how it serves the child\u2019s best interest to allow the non[-]custodial parent to claim the exemption when there will be no net tax savings. While an additional exemption for the non[-]custodial parent may marginally increase his ability to pay support, the removal of an exemption would equally decrease the custodial parent\u2019s ability to support the child. The child\u2019s best interest is not furthered by the zero-sum transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Singer, </em>588 N.E.2d at 812 (emphasis added). Therefore, the court recognized that even where the non-custodial parent\u2019s share of support was greater, \u201cit would make little sense to allocate the exemption to the non-custodial parent merely because that parent is responsible for a higher percentage of the support obligations under the guidelines!]\u201d when that benefit to the non-custodial parent was weighed against a custodial parent\u2019s lesser income and closer day-to-day support relationship with the child. <em>Id. See also Motes v. Motes, </em>786 P.2d 232, 239 (Utah Ct.App.1989) (noting that \u201cuse of the power to order a custodial parent to execute a <em>section </em>152 declaration should not be used to evenly or otherwise divide the available exemptions without regard to the particular economic realities!]\u201d of the parties to that specific case) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Rather, allocation of the tax dependency exemption to the non-custodial parent requires an on record showing that the interests of the child have been furthered. <em>Id. </em>at 811. Primarily, the Ohio Supreme Court found that such an allocation to the non-custodial parent would only be in the best interest of the child if \u201cthat allocation would produce a net tax savings for the parents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 812, because it thereby increased the after-tax spendable income of the family as a whole, which can then be channeled into an increase in child support payments to offset the dependency exemption. <em>Cf. id. </em>Indeed, the majority of our sister jurisdictions agree with this general principle. <em>Cornejo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at 1279-80, 283 Cal.Rptr. 405, 812 P.2d 586; <em>Motes, supra, </em>786 P.2d at 239; <em>Nichols, supra, </em>547 So.2d at 775; <em>Fudenberg v.

Requiring the trial court to consider both the comparative actual incomes of a child\u2019s parents and whether the non-custodial parent is, in fact, within a higher tax bracket to warrant a tax dependency exemption allocation to the non-custodial parent is in accordance with the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of the Income Shares Model, which rests upon a child\u2019s ability to \u201creceive the same proportion of parental income, and thereby enjoy the same standard of living, he or she would have experienced had the child\u2019s parents remained together.\u201d <em>Voishan, </em>327 Md. at 322-23, 609 A.2d 319. <em>See also Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 460, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994) (\u201c[I]t is for the trial judge to set an amount reasonably calculated to maintain as nearly as possible the standard of living enjoyed by the child prior to the parents\u2019 divorce.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">To be sure, \u201cit would be an abuse of discretion for a divorce court to order a custodial parent to sign the declaration in the absence of appropriately supported findings that [the allocation would result in an increase in after-tax spendable income of the family as a whole] or demonstrating other exceptional circumstances making it in the best interest of the parties and their child[ ] that the [exemption] be\u201d waived to the non-custodial parent. <em>Motes, </em>786 P.2d at 239. Therefore, because \u201c[t]he parents of a child are his [or her] natural guardians and, quite apart from the moral obligations of parenthood, owe the child a legal, statutory obligation of support,\u201d <em>Walker, </em>170 Md.App. at 265, 907 A.2d 255, an allocation of the tax dependency exemption to the non-custodi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>al parent requires the trial court to engage in an on record analysis of whether such allocation would be within the child\u2019s best interest. <em>See Motes, </em>786 P.2d at 239. If the trial court determines that the non-custodial parent\u2019s income places him or her within a higher tax bracket, the court must then find, pursuant to Maryland Law, whether the requesting party\u2019s higher tax bracket results from the existence of unrealized or pass-through income or is the result of the party\u2019s actual income. If the requesting party has received no unrealized income or the unrealized/pass-through income is inconsequential, the court should allocate the exemption to the noncustodial parent and include an equitable portion of the after-tax increased spendable income within its award of child support to further the best interest of the child. As we indicated in <em>Wassif, </em>however, under the current state of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e)(2), such a court order, standing alone, is ineffective to transfer a tax dependency exemption. 77 Md. App. at 761, 551 A.2d 935. As a consequence, the court must order the custodial spouse to execute a yearly declaration waiving his or her right to the tax dependency exemption pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e)(2) <em>et seq. </em>Further, the court\u2019s order should provide that the duty to execute the waiver of the custodial parent\u2019s right to the exemption at the end of each year is contingent on the non-custodial parent maintaining satisfaction of his or her child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In the instant case, however, we are met with the unique circumstance where the parents maintain shared custody of their minor child. <em>See </em>Parts I &amp; 11(A), <em>supra. </em>\u201cShared physical custody may, but need not, be on a 50/50 basis, and in fact most commonly will involve custody by one parent during the school year and by the other during summer vacation months, or division between weekdays and weekends, or between days and nights.\u201d <em>Taylor, supra, </em>306 Md. at 297, 508 A.2d 964. Therefore, in instances where the parents share joint custody but one parent still attains primary physical custody and care of the child for more than one-half of the calendar year, we conclude that the general principles regarding the exemption analysis remain constant whether the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ents share joint physical custody \u2014 in theory \u2014 or one parent is specifically designated the primary custodian of the minor child. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e)(1)(B) (2008). But when both parents share joint physical custody of the child on an essentially 50/50 basis, Section 152(e) of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply because it operates under the assumed premise that one parent is the primary physical custodian of the minor child. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 152(e)(1)(B) (explicitly noting that, notwithstanding other sections of the statute that would allocate the exemption to the parent with the highest adjusted gross income, if \u201csuch child is in the custody of 1 or both of the child\u2019s parents for more than one-half of the calendar year, such child shall be treated as being the qualifying child\u201d of the primary custodial parent unless the primary custodial parent signs a written declaration waiving his or her right to the tax dependency exemption). Consequently, in instances where Section 152(e) is inapplicable, allocation of the exemption returns to the parent with the highest adjusted gross income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(c)(4)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Notwithstanding assertions that \u201calternating the tax dependency is within the spirit of [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 152(c)(4)(B)(ii) and [additionally] follows Maryland [L]aw,\u201d any reliance on the Mississippi Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>H.L.S v. R.S.R., </em>949 So.2d 794 (Miss.Ct.App.2006), or the Third District Appellate Court of Illinois\u2019 opinion in <em>In re Marriage of Sawicki (\u201cSawicki\u201d), 34</em>6 Ill.App.3d 1107, 282 Ill.Dec. 404, 806 N.E.2d 701 <em>(2004), is </em>misconceived. The facts and reasoning of these cases are inapposite to the case at bar. Both intermediate appellate courts acknowledge that, in those particular cases, there is but one primary physical custodian of the minor child. <em>H.L.S., </em>949 So.2d at 796-97 (noting that \u201cfull care, custody, and control of the minor child\u201d was awarded to the father that the Chancery Court only modified custody to allow the mother a broader visitation with the minor child); <em>Sawicki, </em>282 Ill. Dec. 404, 806 N.E.2d at 704 (observing that the mother was awarded primary physical custody of the child). Thus, the court addressed the parties contentions within the context of a 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e) analysis. <em>See H.L.S., </em>949 So.2d at 799 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(relying on the court\u2019s previous opinion in <em>Laird v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion in allocating the tax dependency exemption between the parents in alternating years.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Based on the particular circumstances of the ease at bar, the circuit court must allocate the exemption to the parent with the highest adjusted gross income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(c)(4)(B)(ii). However, when the circuit court does so, it must additionally consider whether any increase in after-tax spendable income should be channeled into an increase in child support payments to offset the dependency exemption in order to further the best interest of the child pursuant to the Income Shares Model. <em>Cf Singer, </em>588 N.E.2d at 811-12. <em>See also Cornejo, 53 </em>Cal.3d at <em>1279-80, 283 </em>Cal.Rptr. 405, 812 P.2d 586; <em>Motes, </em>786 P.2d at 239; <em>Nichols, 547 </em>So.2d at 775. Therefore, if the parent with the highest adjusted gross income additionally falls within a higher tax bracket, similar to a Section 152(e) analysis, the court must determine whether the exempt party\u2019s higher tax bracket results from the existence of unrealized or pass-through income. If the party maintains no unrealized income or if the unrealized or pass-through income is inconsequential, the court must include that after-tax increased spendable income within its award of child support. Merely adjusting the child support payment without these considerations would be insufficient because it leaves the child no better off than before. There must be more.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">(D) The Monetary Award Granted to Sarah Hornbeck.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Jeffrey next contends that the circuit court abused its discretion when it granted Sarah a monetary award in the amount of $7,000 for two reasons. First, Jeffrey asserts that the court erred by refusing to \u201cgo back and make the appropriate adjustments to the marital property calculations\u201d regarding the parties\u2019 debt for the VW Touareg subsequent to \u201cchanging its] mind and ordering] that the vehicle be transferred to [Jeffrey.]\u201d He attests that this error further \u201cmade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>him responsible\u201d for selling the vehicle and for the entire debt \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that the value of the vehicle was negative. Second, he contends that the circuit court further erred when it attributed to Jeffrey $3,100 of extant property for the wrongfully dissipated 2009 tax refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Sarah counters that the court \u201ccorrectly classified the property and then considered the statutory factors in making the determination to order a $7,000 monetary award[.]\u201d She argues, therefore, that the circuit court properly exercised its \u201cpure\u201d discretion, and that the monetary award should be affirmed. We elect to address these contentions in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">(1) The Circuit Court\u2019s Finding of Dissipation And The Valuation of Extant Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">We begin by addressing Jeffrey\u2019s second contention: that the $3,100 was wrongfully attributed to him. Preliminarily, we note that \u201c[m]arital property means property, however titled, acquired by one or both parties during the marriage.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.

Thus, because dissipation is a clear question of fact, the circuit court was entitled to accept or reject any portion of the testimony of a witness. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 12 A.3d 96. \u201cThe finding that [the wife] had testified truthfully was therefore not erroneous \u2014 clearly or otherwise \u2014 merely because the [c]ircuit [c]ourt could have drawn different \u2018permissible inferences which might have been drawn from the evidence by another trier of facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hous.

And, I never saw a paper check. I was expecting a joint check to be made out to both of us and I never saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Did you execute the necessary document for the electronic filing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">[Sarah]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Indeed, Sarah and Jeffrey\u2019s Maryland e-File Declaration for Electronic Filing explicitly noted that the parties \u201cd[id] not want direct deposit of [their] refund or any electronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) of [their] balance due.\u201d Moreover, Joint Exhibit No. 3 included a letter of correspondence from Paar, Melis &amp; Associates, the parties\u2019 accountants, dated August 27, 2010, in which the parties were, in relevant part, advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-13\">Enclosed is your 2009 Form 1040, U.S. Individual Tax Return, prepared from the information you provided. Your return will be electronically filed with the IRS once we receive your signed Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-14\">Your federal return reflects a refund of $3,476.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-15\">You should receive a check for this amount in approximately four to eight weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Enclosed is your 2009 Maryland income tax return, prepared from the information provided.

Rather, he asserted, in contrast to Sarah\u2019s statement, that the 2009 tax refund was deposited electronically, during the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: You received a \u2014 you and Sarah [Horn-beck] filed joint tax returns for 2009; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASE\">[Jeffrey]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: And, checks were issued as refunds in both of your names; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">[Jeffrey]: I don\u2019t know whose names were on the checks. It was direct deposited to my account by my accountant; but I never saw a check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: It\u2019s your testimony there was direct deposit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">[Jeffrey]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Did you give [Sarah] any of that money? [Jeffrey]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: You kept it all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">[Jeffrey]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-16\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: You had it directed into your account? [Jeffrey]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-17\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Did you tell [Sarah] you were doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azb\">[Jeffrey]: I didn\u2019t know what was on the statement. We filed \u2014 she signed \u2014 when you fill out the tax form, it\u2019s an option to give them your checking account number that says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that you would like to have any refunds deposited directly. She signed the return, so I didn\u2019t specifically tell her; no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Further evaluation of the record additionally demonstrates Jeffrey\u2019s calculated conduct in anticipation of the parties\u2019 imminent dissolution. The court noted this conduct throughout its oral opinion. Because an accusation of dissipation is a clear question of fact, the circuit court was entitled to accept or reject any portion of the testimony of a witness. <em>Omayaka, </em>417 Md. at 658, 12 A.3d 96. Therefore, \u201cwhen a party attempts to prove a particular point by presenting evidence that is less clear, less direct, less reliable and/or less satisfactory than other evidence available to that party, the trier of fact is permitted \u2014 but not required \u2014 to find that the \u2018better\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657 n. 4, 12 A.3d 96 (citation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court committed no error in attributing to Jeffrey $3,100 of extant property for the wrongfully dissipated 2009 tax refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">(2) The Circuit Court\u2019s Marital Property Calculations Regarding The VW Touareg.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Subsequent to the circuit court\u2019s valuation and identification of the majority of the parties\u2019 marital property, identification of extant property in the amount of $3,100 and its denial of Sarah\u2019s request for alimony, the court returned to discuss the VW Touareg and initially ordered Sarah to sell the vehicle and split the proceeds with Jeffrey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">.... What I am doing with the Touareg, I\u2019m going to order the Touareg be sold. I\u2019m going to \u2014 since the Touareg is in your possession, I am going to order that [Sarah] within 60 days will sell the Touareg, and you will split the proceeds with [Jeffrey] on that Touareg. All right. The next one\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">That decision prompted the following dialogue between the court and the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: May I ask a question, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">THE COURT: You may, did I miss something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Who is responsible for the debt on the Touareg, since that\u2019s in [Jeffrey\u2019s] name? It was my understanding\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">THE COURT: I was supposed to address that, yes. Well[,] here\u2019s what \u2014 there is no proceed, unless the debt is paid. [Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">THE COURT: So[,] when you sell it, the debt gets paid. And then out of that, then there\u2019s a proceed. So if she sells it for, I don\u2019t know what you can sell it for, and I\u2019m not even sure whether or not, you know, if it really is worth $24,000 or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: I think we agreed that the fair market of the car, was $15,999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">THE COURT: But they owe $24,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: $24,000 correct, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">THE COURT: $24,000, that\u2019s where the $24,000 came from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: And it was my understanding Your Honor, that you had put that into the marital property calculation on [Jeffrey\u2019s] side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">THE COURT: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: So[,] since the debt\u2019s in his name,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Okay, it was my understanding that that [sic] was \u2014 well I guess I\u2019m confused. Who\u2019s paying the\u2014 any deficit, if there is a deficit, who is going to be responsible for the deficit? The debt is in [Jeffrey\u2019s] name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-15\">THE COURT: Here it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-16\">[Jeffrey\u2019s counsel]: According to my notes, Your Honor, it says that you estimated that the value would be at $15,909 for the lien of $24,047, based on Exhibit 25. And then you said that they are \u2014 the $24,000 lien would be split between the parties, each\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-17\">THE COURT: Right, I was taking it off of the \u2014 and I didn\u2019t take it off of the marital property, because to me it was a flush. And I was going to deal with it later, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>I didn\u2019t deal with it, that was the problem. So there is still this $24,047.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">Then[,] I think the best thing we can we do [sic] in this regard, and it\u2019s the only other way I can think of, instead of letting \u2014 instead of having [Sarah] sell the car \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think what the equitable thing will be to do. Then here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">The vehicle will be given back to [Jeffrey], because the loan is in his name. It will be given back to him. If [Jeffrey] decides to sell it, that\u2019s up to [him]. If he decides to sell it. I don\u2019t know what else to do with this vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">(emphasis added). Jeffrey\u2019s counsel objected to this designation of the VW Touareg to Jeffrey based an impermissible transfer of property and on its negative value in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">[Jeffrey\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, I do not believe under the Family Law [Article] you have the authority to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU\">THE COURT: To do what? Really? I can\u2019t transfer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">THE COURT: But it\u2019s titled in both of their names, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">THE COURT: It\u2019s just the loan that we\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlW\">[Sarah\u2019s counsel]: It\u2019d be the same thing if you sold it. If it was ordered to be sold, and he was responsible for the debt. It\u2019s the same issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">THE COURT: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">[Jeffrey\u2019s counsel]: And then he now has a negative marital debt that was acquired during the marriage attached to him, and then a monetary award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">He has a $24,000 debt with something that\u2019s only valued at $16,000. He\u2019s getting double penalized for this negative asset, with your award of the monetary award \u2014 with your Order of a Monetary Award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-15\">THE COURT: Well[,] let me ask you a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>[Jeffrey\u2019s counsel]: He\u2019s being double billed for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">THE COURT: Because I didn\u2019t give her any alimony, that\u2019s the one thing that I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not giving her alimony. And so that might be the reason I\u2019m doing that, [counsel], is because I\u2019m not making any alimony payments to her that [Jeffrey] will have to keep up over a period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">Which may in the long run end up, if I did that, putting him in certainly much more of a peril than it would be to deal with the debt of the Touareg. He doesn\u2019t have to sell it, he doesn\u2019t have to if he doesn\u2019t want to.

The loan is not in her name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Jeffrey argues that the court erred by refusing to <em>\u201cgo </em>back and make the appropriate adjustments to the marital property calculations\u201d regarding the parties\u2019 debt for the YW Touareg subsequent to \u201cchanging its] mind and ordering] that the vehicle be transferred to [Jeffrey].\u201d He attests that this error further \u201cmade him responsible\u201d for selling the vehicle and for the entire debt \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that the value of the vehicle was negative. Thus, he asserts that the court abused its discretion in making a monetary award by including the negative value of the vehicle. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\u201cThe purpose of the monetary award is to correct any inequity created by the way in which property acquired during the marriage happened to be titled.\u201d <em>Doser v.

And so I\u2019m going to address that when I\u2019m looking at whether or not I\u2019m going to require [Jeffrey] to pay any of the legal fees of [Sarah].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">And the testimony came out that there was an August the l[st] incident. There was an August the 10[th] incident. [On A]ugust l[st,] the police were called and some injury to [Jeffrey].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">[Sarah] filled out the document that indicated that she had been physically assaulted, and then changed her mind based on the police officer\u2019s assertion to her that an arrest would be imminent if in fact that happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">And she changed her mind and filled out a different document. Being an Ex-Domestic Violence Prosecutor, that doesn\u2019t sound strange to the Court at all, that a police officer would say that. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right, but they say it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-14\">And so I don\u2019t find that to be \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that people do in fact change their minds. Sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>immediately when it looks as though what they don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t imagine happening, is going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">And many people who call the police, and then once the police officers start to do what it is that they do, and what they\u2019re ordered to do, mandated to do[,] people change their minds. Which is why it makes these situations very dangerous for police officers. It makes it very, very dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">And so they allowed [Sarah] to opt out, by changing what her statement was. I\u2019m looking for my statute, hold on for a second. On August the 10[th,] there was an incident that involved [Sarah] taking [Jeffrey\u2019s] phone, going to the very top floor, locking the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">[Jeffrey] wanted to get in, get his phone, or get into her, it was not clear. [Jeffrey] then leaves. [Jeffrey] also called [Sarah\u2019s father] ... [t]o see if he could call his daughter to get her to give him his phone back, and it was just a mess. A mess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">And I\u2019m going to tell you, I\u2019ve always learned that sometimes you keep people out of your marriage. Because what happens a lot of times, you all get other people mad at the other person. And you all go right back together again, and they\u2019re stuck with the emotion because they love you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">So sometimes you got to keep people out of it. But be that as it may, [Jeffrey] testified meaning \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, [Sarah\u2019s father] testified that he was involved in the sense that he was getting phone calls from [Jeffrey].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">And [Sarah\u2019s mother] testified getting calls from her daughter, as to the emotion that this particular night\u2019s incident caused. Which I believe[,] at that point[,] was probably when it dawned on [Sarah] that this was it. Meaning that things could not be repaired again. Because then it leads to the locks being changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">[Jeffrey] not really staying in the home, but staying at \u2014 I want to say Dominic\u2019s house. I think I\u2019m correct. But then I certainly did pay close attention to the legal bills that [Jeffrey] presented in his testimony that, this was in [Jeffrey\u2019s] head way before August 4[th].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Not long after the August l[st] incident, [Jeffrey] puts things in motion. That he wanted out and I have to agree that a lot of it was calculated it was. You can\u2019t get around it. [Jeffrey] set it in motion, had communications with [his attorney], about protection orders, divorce, etc. [He d]id not mention a word to [Sarah].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">And let me say this, I also know that I\u2019m only being told a piece of this whole story. I do realize that there\u2019s a whole lot more that you all were communicating to each other that I\u2019ll never know. But what I do know [is] it sounds as though [Jeffrey] [w]as on his way to divorce, and did not share that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">At least did not articulate that to [Sarah]. And sort of, you know, kept up with the doctor\u2019s appointments, and the like. And[,] you know[,] planning out what lawyers do. You are both lawyers. You know, we plan litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Thinking about litigation, you know, long before. That\u2019s why when things happen in your friends [\u2019] lives, they call you. They want to know how can I start this thing so it can look best for me? And I have to admit, when we get to the filing of the Protection Orders, both of \u2014 it just surprised this [c]ourt that both of you went on the same day and complained an incident that happened 20 some odd days earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">I read the text messages, or the e-mails from [Sarah] to [Jeffrey]. And when I read it it\u2019s not a text message that wife, I think[,] sends a husband. You were documenting. That\u2019s what lawyers do[. W]e document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">Because at that point, you had already come back from being denied a Protection Order in one of the emails, and it didn\u2019t look as thought it was something that, you know, you were just saying to him. Because you didn\u2019t say to him[, \u201c]I went today to get a Protection Order. I don\u2019t want you around anymore. [\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">It was, you know, very detailed so that just in case it ended up that it\u2019d have to be in [c]ourt. That\u2019s my opinion, we\u2019d do it that way. But I don\u2019t believe that [Sarah]\u2014 [Sarah] put this in motion. So[,] the [c]ourt has to look at, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>when I\u2019m looking at [c]ounsel fees is the reasonableness of the fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">I have to look at the financial resources and financial needs of both of the parties. And whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting and/or defending the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">And I\u2019m looking at 11-110 in the Family Article. And if there\u2019s absence of justification!, i]f I find that there is an absence of justification for prosecuting or defending, or good cause to the contrary, the [cjourt can award to the other party the reasonable and necessary expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">Perhaps had someone at some point, and I\u2019m saying [Jeffrey] been honest and said, [\u201cYjou know what[,] I don\u2019t want to be in this marriage anymore. I want out.[\u201d] You all could\u2019ve come to some kind of agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">But what happens!? Jeffrey], when you look back in hindsight, as I\u2019m sure [Sarah] did, it looks like you had already planned it. And everything else after that looked very contrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">And so it sort of put her in a position where she had to defend herself legally. Because you were drumming up all of the ammunition that you could drum up. You were getting, you know, getting your lawyers lined up. Trying to get the psychiatrist, psychologist, whoever lined up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">You all went to a session together. Something happened in that session, and I\u2019m not even privileged, not even allowed to know, but I know something happened that would send both of you not long after that to the courthouse. One going in one direction, and one going in the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">But I believe that\u2019s when the rubber met the road was inside of that session, that none of us will ever know sort of what happened. Perhaps it did come out that it was already set up, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">But when looking at the records, [Jeffrey], set it up. It didn\u2019t have to get this far. I\u2019ll look at the \u2014 again, I\u2019ll go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>back to the number of requests that were made for documents. That had to be made for documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">There was a question about whether or not the surveillance, or there was an argument that they were trying to catch [Jeffrey] doing something. And[,] again, that\u2019s distrust. But also, you didn\u2019t leave much trust left after you\u2019ve done this to [Sarah].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">And you know, you got to see what you can get to defend your case. So I don\u2019t think that they were unreasonable things that she did. And building the expense that you built I would say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">The [c]ourt sanctioned [Jeffrey], because of the failure to comply with discovery. Although during trial, no one asked this [c]ourt to enforce the sanction, and they didn\u2019t. And to their credit they did not ask that, but it didn\u2019t get over me that there had to be not only an [o]rder to [c]ompel, and that didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">And then there had to be a sanction. So now I have to figure out the sanction and attorney\u2019s fees. Because I believe that there was information that was purposefully kept from this litigation. It didn\u2019t have to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">If you don\u2019t have anything to hide, bring it forward. So I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s out there, but I\u2019m going to certainly have to, again do what I believe is equitable. [Sarah\u2019s] finances are way, way lower. Meaning income and finances way, way lower than [Jeffrey\u2019s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">[Jeffrey] makes a tremendous amount of money comparatively speaking to [Sarah]. The [c]ourt is going to order based on that, that [Sarah] was[,] in fact[,] justified in defending the proceedings the way in which she did. And I\u2019m going to order [Jeffrey] to pay a portion of the attorneys fees for [Sarah].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">The court is going to require you, sir, to foot $60,000 of this bill. And that is to be paid directly to the attorneys, to [the firm of Sarah\u2019s attorney].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Following the entry of the circuit court\u2019s final order correlative to its oral opinion, Jeffrey filed within his petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>rehearing an argument that the circuit court had abused its discretion in awarding $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, noting that \u201cthe amount of attorney\u2019s fees far exceeded the amount in controversy.\u201d The court denied Jeffrey\u2019s request to alter or amend its previous award of attorney\u2019s fees, stating within its memorandum and opinion of March 30, 2012:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">The court did not err when it awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the [Sarah], [Jeffrey] request that the judgment be amended to reduce or abate the counsel fees. [Jeffrey] argues that the court erred in ordering [him] to pay $60,000 as contribution to [Sarah\u2019s] counsel fees. The court denies this request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">The court[,] in determining whether to award [Sarah\u2019s] request for counsel fees[,] is bound by the factors outlined in Fam. Law. \u00a7 12-203. This court considered the financial circumstances of each party and the[n] considered [Sarah\u2019s] justification for defending and bringing her claim. [Jeffrey\u2019s] obstructionist behavior throughout the entire case from its inception weighed heavily in the court[\u2019]s consideration of [Sarah\u2019s] justification for defending and bringing her claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">[Jeffrey] failed to challenge the counsel fees at trial. [Jeffrey] also argues that he is unable to pay the required amount and should not be forced to go into debt to pay [Sarah\u2019s] counsel fees. [Jeffrey] compares this case to a contempt hearing standard. This is not a contempt hearing[,] and[,] thereforef, Jeffrey] uses the incorrect standard. The court carefully weighed the factors and determined [Jeffrey\u2019s] contribution to [Sarah\u2019s] counsel fees to be [$]60,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Before this Court, Jeffrey\u2019s final assignment of error is that the circuit court erred in awarding Sarah $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, he asserts that the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was unreasonable because \u201c[t]he trial court did not properly analyze and explain the financial status and needs of each party.\u201d Therefore, he attests that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>court\u2019s simple statement that Jeffrey makes \u201ca lot more money\u201d than Sarah is an inadequate analysis of the financial status of each party, the needs of each party, and whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding. See Md.Code (1999, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 7-107(c) &amp; (d) of the Family Law Article; Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-203(b) of the Family Law Article. In sum, Jeffrey contends that the circuit court misapplied the statutory criteria for awarding attorney\u2019s fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Although the circuit court is vested with a high degree of discretion in making an award of attorney\u2019s fees, <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 600, 568 A.2d 1157 (1990), the trial judge must \u201cconsider and balance,\u201d <em>Bagley v. Bagley, </em>98 Md.App. 18, 39, 632 A.2d 229 (1993) (emphasis added), the required considerations as articulated by the General Assembly in Sections 7-107(c) and 12-203(b) of the Family Law Article, which provide consideration of \u201c(a) the financial status of both parties, (b) their respective needs, and (c) whether there was substantial justification for instituting or defending the proceeding.\u201d <em>Holston v. Holston, </em>58 Md. App. 308, 325, 473 A.2d 459 (1984); <em>Bagley, </em>98 Md.App. at 40, 632 A.2d 229. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1999, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 7-107(c) &amp; 12-203(b) of the Family Law Article. As a consequence, \u201c[t]he [trial court] necessarily [must] consider the financial status of both parties and their respective needs in [its] award of alimony.\u201d <em>Holston, </em>58 Md.App. at 325, 473 A.2d 459. Section 7-107 provides that the circuit court may order one party to pay the other a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 amount for \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018necessary\u2019 expenses,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 326, 473 A.2d 459, including: (1) suit money; (2) counsel fees; and (3) costs. Md.Code (1999, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-107(a) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">It appears from the record that the circuit court did not satisfactorily consider the financial status and needs of Jeffrey. Certainly, the court\u2019s bald statement that Jeffrey earns \u201ca tremendous amount of money\u201d compared to Sarah is insufficient. As discussed in Parts 11(b) and 11(d)(2), <em>supra, </em>Jef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>frey was erroneously ordered to pay support on an unrealized amount of income and a miscalculated $7,000 monetary award. Jeffrey\u2019s own financial statement admitted during the divorce proceedings demonstrated a deficit each month. Further Sarah acknowledged through the parties\u2019 Joint Property Statement that Jeffrey did not maintain sufficient assets to cover the marital debt and his attorneys fees much less an additional $60,000 in counsel fees for Sarah\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We conclude that, even though there may be basis for an award of some counsel fees and costs pursuant to the rule, an award of $60,000 in attorneys fees is, on this record, arbitrary and clearly wrong. <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>70 Md.App. 1, 12-13, 519 A.2d 1298 (1987) (citation omitted). We accordingly vacate the judgment. Upon remand, the circuit court should consider whether Sarah is entitled to a contribution toward her attorney\u2019s fees once a decision regarding the issue of a monetary award is rendered. <em>See, e.g., Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 335-36 n. 1, 664 A.2d 453 (1995); <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>153 Md.App. 260, 280, 836 A.2d 695 (2003) (remanding an award of attorney\u2019s fees for further consideration subsequent to this Court\u2019s decision to remand the case for reconsideration of a monetary award and on the issue of whether alimony should be ordered). <em>See also Alston v.
