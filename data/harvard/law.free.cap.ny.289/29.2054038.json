J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4H\">On April 14, 1941, the Council of the City of New Rochelle adopted an ordinance purporting to abolish the position, which the petitioner then held, of <em>\u201c </em>Clerk in Central Garage in the Department of Public Works.\u201d The petitioner was notified that his services would not be required after April 30, 1941. George F. Mohr was retained in the service of the Department of Public Works in the position of clerk. The Civil Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 7), section 31, provides that any person whose position in the competitive class under civil service law or rules \u201c is abolished or made unnecessary, through no delinquency or misconduct on his part shall be deemed to be suspended without pay, which suspension shall be made in the inverse order of original appointment.\u201d The petitioner, claiming that his original appointment was prior to the appointment of George F. Mohr, has brought proceedings under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act for an order directing that he be \u201c reinstated \u201d in the position which Mohr continues to occupy.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The petitioner has alleged in his petition that he was appointed on April 17,1917, to the position of cost clerk in the Street Department (now Department of Public Works) of the City of New Rochelle after taking a competitive examination for that position; \u201c that petitioner held such position continuously until December 15, 1928, <em>when he resigned; </em>that on September 1, 1929, petitioner was duly reinstated to the position of Clerk in the office of the Comptroller (now Department of Finance) of the City of New Rochelle; that on January 1, 1938, petitioner was duly transferred from the Comptroller\u2019s office (Department of Finance) to the Department of Public Works.\u201d The petitioner further alleges in his petition that George F. Mohr \u201c was first appointed to a position in the service of the City of New Rochelle on April 16, 1925; * * * that said George F. Mohr was originally appointed as the result of a competitive civil service examination to the position of File and Index Clerk, the title of which position was changed to Clerk by resolution of the Municipal Civil Service Commission of the City of New Rochelle adopted July 16, 1929; that said George F. Mohr entered the service of the City of New Rochelle eight years after petitioner entered said service and petitioner is entitled to the seniority rights provided for in section 31 of the Civil Service Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The petitioner\u2019s claim that after the abolition of the position petitioner held, Mohr should have been suspended and petitioner assigned to perform the duties previously performed by Mohr in accordance with the provisions of section 31, is challenged on the ground that by his resignation in 1928 the petitioner terminated his employment in the civil service of the city; that his \u201c reinstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ment \u201d thereafter was in effect a new appointment and- that rights of seniority under section 31 must be calculated from that time. If that contention is sustained then Mohr\u2019s original appointment in 1925 antedates the petitioner\u2019s appointment, and we need not consider other grounds upon which the petitioner\u2019s claim that he must be retained in the service of the city and assigned to Mohr\u2019s position has been challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In 1928 and 1929, when petitioner resigned his position and was <em>\u201c </em>reinstated \u201d in a similar position in another department, rule XXIII of the Rules for the Civil Service of the City of New Rochelle provided that \u201c any person who has held a position by appointment under the Civil Service Rules, as the result of examination and who has been separated from the service through no delinquency or misconduct on his part, may be reinstated without re-examination in the same or a similar position in the same office or grade, within one year from the date of such separation, provided * * *.\u201d The petitioner, we are told, was \u201c reinstated \u201d after his resignation in accordance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We assume, but without pausing to consider whether the assump- . tion is sound, that rule XXIII authorized the <em>\u201c </em>reinstatement \u201d or appointment of the petitioner to the position of clerk in the <em>office of the Comptroller </em>within one year after he had resigned from the position of clerk in the <em>Street Department. </em>In <em>Matter of Marcus </em>v. <em>Ingersoll </em>(266 N. Y. 359, 361), this court, while considering the effect of a similar rule, held that where a person who had resigned from a position in the competitive class in the civil service is within one year thereafter appointed to a different position, and such appointment is in no wise <em>\u201c </em>connected with the previous service \u201d but is made from an eligible list promulgated after competitive examination, the new appointment \u201c must be regarded as an original appointment, and forms the date from which the petitioner\u2019s place in the order of suspension must be determined.\u201d We expressly left open, however, the question of the date from which the order of suspension must be determined where, without new examination, there has been a re-entry into the service by reinstatement or by a new appointment which would be unauthorized by the Civil Service Law and would be prohibited by the Constitution of the State unless there had been previous service under an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>appointment, made after merit and fitness were ascertained by competitive examination. \u201c Reinstatement,\u201d we there said, \u201c might then have the effect of wiping out the resignation and renewed service might be traced in unbroken line to original appointment.\u201d The question is now posed whether \u201c reinstatement \u201d after resignation actually has that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We confine our consideration to the effect of <em>\u201c </em>reinstatement \u201d <em>after resignation. </em>Perhaps \u201c separation \u201d from the service otherwise effected might in some circumstances be only tentative, and after reinstatement, renewed service might perhaps \u201c be traced in unbroken line to original appointment.\u201d' A resignation constitutes a complete break in the service, and the absolute termination of relations. Thereafter the person resigning has no rights or duties. Reentry into the service can be accomplished only by the voluntary act of the person who has power of appointment. The prior service may furnish sufficient ground for the legislative authorization of reentry into the service without a new examination;\u2014 the reentry marks, nonetheless, a new beginning and the renewed service cannot be traced further back in unbroken line. The renewed service is based upon a new appointment, though called reinstatement, and marks the date which determines right to priority in the order of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that order of the Special Term affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Loughran, Finch, Rippey, Lewis, Conway and Desmond, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
