Laws, ch. 16) and disability retirement under section 1109-a, there was an election possible for her to take superannuation retirement instead of disability retirement and the application of the plaintiff signed in her behalf for disability retirement, constituted a choice and an election as between the forms of retirement and was therefore invalid, because of the incompetency of decedent. <em>(Finch </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>245 N. Y. 300; <em>Matter of Frank, </em>283 N.

If section 1109-a is interpreted as permitting an election by another for the incompetent, it is unconstitutional. <em>(Matter of Frank, </em>283 N.

The procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>outlined by the statute is in the interest of the mentally incompetent and should not be negatived.
