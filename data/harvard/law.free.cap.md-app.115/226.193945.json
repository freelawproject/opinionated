Bresnahan appeals from a jury verdict and subsequent court judgments rendered in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. William B. Bresnahan, appellee, cross appeals from other aspects of the jury verdict and from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Appellant presents five issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">Whether proof of actual malice is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages in a partnership dissolution case where the jury found that [appellee] breached his fiduciary duty to the estate of his deceased partner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">Whether the trial should have been bifurcated to allow [appellant] to present evidence of [appellee\u2019s] net worth in connection with the submission to the jury of [appellant\u2019s] claim for punitive damages against [appellee].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">Whether the evidence, consisting of [appellant\u2019s] testimony concerning the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in this case, is sufficient to support [appellant\u2019s] demand for attorneys\u2019 fees in the absence of expert testimony that the fees incurred were \u201creasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">Whether the trial court properly set aside the jury verdict awarding [appellant]' the profits earned by the [appellee] from the partnership after the death of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">Whether the trial court properly allowed the deed to the partnership real estate to be released to [appellee] prior to the conclusion of these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">The first two issues are intertwined, and we shall address them together. We shall address the other issues separately. Appellee, in his cross-appeal, presents a two-part question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayw-dedup-0\">Did the trial court err in entering judgment for [appellant] for deposition costs and appraisal fees, and in failing to grant [appellee\u2019s] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this respect?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Both parties in their briefs expound upon their allegations that the actions of the other were bizarre. There are allegations that one of the parties placed dead bats in condoms and rooster heads in boxes and deposited them on the other\u2019s property and allegations that the other party stated, \u201cHitler lived in the center of the earth,\u201d and made references to \u201cspace aliens,\u201d construction of space ships, \u201cvision quests,\u201d etc., most of which, in regard to this appeal, are completely irrelevant. We will not insert ourselves in the parties\u2019 vindictiveness. We shall attempt a judicious and restrained recitation of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Appellee and Daniel Bresnahan were equal partners in a \u201ccrab house\u201d operated as a general partnership. Daniel Bres-nahan died, and appellant, his widow, became the personal representative of his estate. Attempts were made by both parties to arrive at a settlement in regard to the estate\u2019s interest in the partnership and a winding up of the partnership. These attempts, to the extent that the parties participated, were rancorous and ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Eventually, appellant instituted suit against appellee. The case proceeded to trial on appellant\u2019s First Amended Complaint. It provided, after a factual recitation, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">15. All allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 are real-leged and incorporated herein by this reference as if fully set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">16. The improper actions of [appellee] herein constitute a breach of the fiduciary duty owed by [appellee] to [appellant] and to the Partnership, which duty is owed to these parties by [appellee] insofar as [appellee] is the sole remaining Partner of the Partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">WHEREFORE [appellant], on behalf of the estate, on her own behalf and on behalf of the Partnership prays for (1) Distribution to [appellant] of $62,500, representing one-half of the value of the interest in the Partnership owned by Decedent Daniel Bresnahan as of the date of death, net of amounts received heretofore by [appellant], plus undistributed Partnership profit of $6,000 accrued in 1991; (2) Distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>bution to [appellant] of one-half of the partnership profits earned between November 1, 1991 and the date on which [appellee] deposited the final installment of the Partnership value into the registry of this Court; (3) [Appellant\u2019s] attorneys\u2019 fees and related costs in maintaining this action and in attempting, in connection with ... the filing of this case, to recover the value of the Partnership from [appellee], consisting of appraisal fees of $15,960, deposition costs of $550.30, and legal fees of approximately $50,000; (4) Punitive damages, in an amount to be determined by the jury in this matter, for breach of [appellee\u2019s] fiduciary duty in this matter.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The case was tried on this amended complaint, and a special verdict form was used. The parties do not direct us to any place in the record where either of them objected to the special verdict form used. At one point, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahv\">I\u2019ve constructed the verdict sheet in the fashion that I have in order to preserve, or at least to make clear, preserve certain issues if there is an appeal, so that whatever would happen on appeal would not require the parties to exhaust resources again trying the case a second time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">That\u2019s my real purpose in constructing a verdict sheet, because it\u2019s not going to be ... to anyone\u2019s benefit, least of all mine, if the parties have to try this case again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The verdict sheet, as answered by the jury, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\n<em>VERDICT SHEET</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">1.

What damages, if any, do you award as punitive damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">$-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">Appellant\u2019s first issue is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-16\">1, Whether proof of actual malice is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages in a partnership dissolution case where the jury found that [appellee] breached his fiduciary duty to the estate of his deceased partner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">Appellant extends the impact of, and relies heavily on <em>Hartlove v. Maryland Sch. for the Blind, </em>111 Md.App. 310, 681 A.2d 584 (1996), <em>vacated and remanded for reconsideration, </em>344 Md. 720, 690 A.2d 526 (1997), for the proposition that <em>Hartlove </em>adopts in full section 874 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides that, in breach of fiduciary duty actions, the breach alone is sufficient to provide a basis for an award of punitive damages. Thus, according to appellant, the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury that it had to find actual malice in order to award punitive damages was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-18\">An initial concern is that, at the time of the verdict in this case, the tortious cause of action upon which appellant relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and prevailed, had not yet been recognized in Maryland. Even if it had been recognized, <em>Hartlove, </em>as appellant admits, did not explicitly adopt that aspect of the Restatement\u2019s provision as to punitive damages. We shall, however, leave the interesting and difficult question of the <em>ex post </em>application of Hartlove's holdings to another case, as we shall decline to extend <em>Hartlove, </em>to the extent it may still exist after <em>Kann, </em>to any degree beyond its limits as we perceive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We initially note that the only count that survived at the time this case was submitted to the jury was the single, separate count of breach of fiduciary duty. Appellant\u2019s count of fraud had been disposed of either by motion or voluntarily, by amending it out of the cause of action. Moreover, appellant has not appealed any decision of the trial court that may have resulted in the fraud count being eliminated from the suit. We are, therefore, faced with a situation in which fraud has not been established and the only cause submitted to the jury was an independent count alleging a breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On December 20, 1996, the Court of Appeals denied certio-rari in <em>Hartlove. </em>On March 7, 1997, it ordered its December 20, 1996, order to be rescinded and recalled, and finally, on March 12, 1997, the Court of Appeals granted certiorari (Pet.Doc. No. 488/96) on the petition for certiorari, denied the cross-petition for certiorari, ordered our opinion to be vacated, and remanded <em>Hartlove </em>to this Court for reconsideration in light of its opinion in <em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 690 A.2d 509 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Kann </em>discussed <em>Hartlove, </em>noting the <em>Hartlovee </em>majority\u2019s holdings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">First, it said: \u201cGiven the standard of conduct imposed upon fiduciaries, we are of the view that fiduciaries who breach their duty should be held accountable under an independent cause of action aimed at such conduct.\u201d <em>[Hartlove, </em>111 Md.App. at 331, 681 A.2d 584] (footnote omitted). The panel of the Court of Special Appeals divided two to one on this first holding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5F\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Kann, </em>at 708-709, 690 A.2d 509. In respect to this holding, the Court of Appeals commented:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">Regina [Kann] and the Court of Special Appeals read too much into \u00a7 874 of the Restatement. As we saw in Part III.A, \u00a7 874 in effect recognizes the universal proposition that a breach of fiduciary duty is a civil wrong, but the remedy is not the same for any breach by every type of fiduciary. For some breaches the remedy may be at law, for others it may be exclusively in equity, and for still others there may be concurrent remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 710, 690 A.2d 509. It further commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">Under the tort that Regina seeks, if Donald [Kann] breached the trust, he would be liable for damages for \u201cstress, mental anguish and exacerbation of various physical ailments and conditions directly resulting from Donald\u2019s actions.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 17-18. It is not at all clear that Regina would limit damages for emotional distress to cases in which the trustee has caused some economic loss to the beneficiary. Given the fact that Regina does not challenge for lack of evidence the trial court\u2019s finding that Louis misappropriated assets of the Frances Trust, Regina\u2019s arguments strongly suggest that she seeks emotional distress damages if Donald made any misstep, even if it did not cause loss. Regina\u2019s quest for this new tort liability of trustees is particularly unpersuasive when one considers that there may be instances in which a trustee may commit a breach of trust mistakenly and non-negligently. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 201 cmt. a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Regina\u2019s requested tort would also carry the potential for punitive damages. But punitive damages are not at all available in equity....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">In overview, Regina asks this Court to make a very far reaching change in Maryland law by creating a tort that will apply to <em>all fiduciaries. </em>Neither Regina nor the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Hartlove </em>has undertaken to review all of the relationships to which the new tort would apply. There has been no analysis of whether, as to any given fiduciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>relationship, the tort would duplicate existing remedies at law or would eliminate, as in the case of trustees, the nearly complete exclusivity of equitable jurisdiction. There has been no analysis of the effect of the new tort on the probate area. Further, recognition of the new tort would make trustees, and any other fiduciaries whose breaches are currently primarily remediable in equity, subject to potential liability for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asu-dedup-0\">The instant matter differs radically from a number of this Court\u2019s decisions in which new causes of action have been recognized. By way of illustration, and not limitation, we have recognized a new cause of action when there was no existing legal remedy directed at the problem. In the instant matter we have not been presented with, nor are we aware of, any lack of adequacy of the existing remedies for breach of a trustee\u2019s duties. There is, in our view, no justification for the wholesale changes in Maryland law that Regina advocates. Indeed, so enduring has been the marriage between trusts and equity in this State that adoption of Regina\u2019s contentions would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of [Maryland Code, Estates &amp; Trusts Article,] \u00a7 14-101 (\u201cA court having equity jurisdiction has general superintending power with respect to trusts.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Accordingly, we hold that there is no universal or omnibus tort for the redress of breach of fiduciary duty by any and all fiduciaries. This does not mean that there is no claim or cause of action available for breach of fiduciary duty. Our holding means that identifying a breach of fiduciary duty will be the beginning of the analysis, and not its conclusion. Counsel are required to identify the particular fiduciary relationship involved, identify how it was breached, consider the remedies available, and select those remedies appropriate to the client\u2019s problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 711-713, 690 A.2d 509 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The last three sentences above can be interpreted as a restatement of the law prior to <em>Hartlove, ie., </em>identify a fiduciary relationship, identify the breach, determine what causes of action are supported by the breach of fiduciary duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and select the cause of action that best serves the wronged party. The Court of Appeals went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">Counsel do not have available for use in any and all cases a unisex action, triable to a jury. This Court would not preside over the death of contract by recognizing as a tort a breach of contract that was found to be in bad faith. <em>See K &amp; K Management, Inc. v. Lee, </em>316 Md. 137, 557 A.2d 965 (1989). Nor shall we preside over the death of equity by adopting Regina\u2019s contentions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">To the extent that <em>Hartlove v. Maryland School for the Blind, </em>111 Md.App. 310, 681 A.2d 584 (1996), is contrary to the views expressed in this opinion, <em>Hartlove </em>is disapproved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\"><em>Kann, </em>at 713, 690 A.2d 509 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In light of <em>Kann, </em>it is doubtful that Hartlove's creation of an independent tort of breach of fiduciary tort has survived. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it was the only count submitted to the jury. It is very possible that, had appellee/cross-appellant presented the issue of the validity of the cause of action itself, we might have been required to reverse the entire verdict and decision in light of <em>Kann} </em>However, the issue has not been preserved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall address the issues presented as to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We agree with the statement in appellee\u2019s brief that \u201cthe Court of Appeals has conclusively determined that actual malice is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages, although actual malice may be met by proving fraud.\u201d We now examine the cases. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), is, as the parties indicate, the seminal case expressing Maryland\u2019s current view of punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>damages. <em>Zenobia </em>was a products liability case in which the question of punitive damages was a major issue. We shall, in our consideration of it, go directly to the Court of Appeals\u2019s discussions about the role of punitive damages in Maryland tort law. At the very inception of the opinion, Judge Eldridge noted that the Court had issued its writ of certiorari to \u201cconsider several important questions ... and to reconsider some of the principles governing awards of punitive damages in tort cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 601 A.2d 633. The Court noted its order to the parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">[Tjhis Court issued an order requesting that the briefs and argument encompass the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">In light of the concurring opinion of Judges Eldridge, Chasanow, and Cole in <em>Schaefer v. Miller, </em>322 Md. 297, 312-332, 587 A.2d 491 (1991), what should be the correct standard under Maryland law for the allowance of punitive damages in negligence and products liability cases, <em>i.e., </em>gross negligence, actual malice, or some other standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 450, 601 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">It then discussed some of its reasons for requesting that the parties address that particular issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">As noted in the opinion of Judges Eldridge, Cole and Chasanow in <em>Schaefer v. Miller, supra, </em>322 Md. at 312-332, 587 A.2d 491, in recent years there has been a proliferation of claims for punitive damages in tort cases, and awards of punitive damages have often been extremely high. See 2 J. Ghiardi and J. Kircher, <em>Punitive Damages Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 21.01, at 2 (1985); D. Owen, <em>Problems in Assessing Punitive Damages Against Manufacturers of Defective Products, </em>49 U. Chi. L.Rev. 1, 6 (1982) (\u201cLarge assessments of punitive damages may not yet be a major threat to the continued viability of most manufacturing concerns, but the increasing number and size of such awards may fairly raise concern for the future stability of American industry\u201d)----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">Accompanying this increase in punitive damages claims, awards and amounts of awards, is renewed criticism of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>concept of punitive damages in a tort system designed primarily to compensate injured parties for harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 450-51, 601 A.2d 633 (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Court then gave an advance summary of its holding in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">In Maryland the criticism has been partly fueled and justified because juries are provided with imprecise and uncertain characterizations of the type of conduct which will expose a defendant to a potential award of punitive damages. Accordingly, we shall (1) examine these characterizations of a defendant\u2019s conduct in light of the historic objectives of punitive damages, (2) more precisely define the nature of conduct potentially subject to a punitive damages award in non-intentional tort cases, and (3) heighten the standard of proof required of a plaintiff seeking an award of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 601 A.2d 633. The <em>Zenobia </em>Court noted that we (and the trial court) had required the plaintiffs to show \u201cby a preponderance of evidence that the defendants acted with \u2018implied\u2019 rather than \u2018actual\u2019 malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 601 A.2d 633. The Court discussed punitive damages arising out of contracts and then noted: \u201c[W]e abandon the \u2018arising out of a contract\u2019 distinction \u2018and return to the principles relating to punitive damages which had prevailed in this State for many, many years before <em>[H &amp; R Block v.] Testerman </em>[, 275 Md. 36, 338 A.2d 48 (1975) ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 455, 601 A.2d 633. It noted the general principle that \u201cpunitive damages are awarded in an attempt to punish a defendant whose conduct is characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, or fraud, and to warn others contemplating similar conduct of the serious risk of monetary liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 601 A.2d 633. The Court then preliminarily held: \u201cIn a non-intentional tort action, the trier of facts may not award punitive damages unless the plaintiff has established that the defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018actual malice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 601 A.2d 633 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We shall digress for a moment to note certain aspects of the majority\u2019s discussion in <em>Hartlove, supra, </em>a case upon which appellant relies extensively. The majority there noted that a \u201cpersonal representative must \u2018... act reasonably and in good faith.\u2019\u201d <em>Hartlove, </em>111 Md.App. at 330, 681 A.2d 584. We said: \u201c[The personal representative] ... is required to act in good faith, and must perform his fiduciary duties with the same degree of care and diligence that would be exercised by a prudent person under similar circumstances____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Ba<em>stian v. Baffin, </em>54 Md.App. 703, 708, 460 A.2d 623 (1983)). The majority later noted that the standard of care for a fiduciary includes \u201c[t]he exercise of reasonable watchfulness over investments; and ... [t]he maintenance of full, accurate and precise records.\u201d <em>Id., </em>111 Md.App. at 330-31, 681 A.2d 584 (quoting Allan J. Gibber, <em>Gibber on Estate Administration </em>3-1 (3d ed. 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">It is clear then that carelessness and lack of diligence can be the basis for a breach of fiduciary duty action, as the <em>Hartlove </em>majority described the tort. Interestingly, the Court of Appeals in <em>Kann </em>noted, \u201cRegina\u2019s quest for this new tort liability of trustees is particularly unpersuasive when one considers that there may be instances in which a trustee may commit a breach of trust mistakenly and non-negligently.\u201d <em>Kann, </em>at 711, 690 A.2d 509. Accordingly, while the action for breach of fiduciary duty may arise from intentional conduct, the cause of action may also arise out of careless and undiligent conduct, <em>i.e., </em>negligent actions of omission or commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The <em>Zenobia </em>Court, although addressing a product liability action, set a standard for punitive damages that appears to be generally applicable, given the Court\u2019s earlier discussion of the problems created by punitive damages. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">The knowledge component, which we hold is necessary to support an award of punitive damages, does <em>not </em>mean \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d or \u201csubstantial knowledge\u201d or \u201cshould have known.\u201d More is required to expose a defendant to a potential punitive damages award. The plaintiff must show that the defendant <em>actually </em>knew of the defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and of the danger of the product at the time the product left the defendant\u2019s possession or control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 462, 601 A.2d 633 (footnote omitted). Still addressing strict liability causes of action, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">The showing of actual malice required for a punitive damages award is the same regardless of whether the plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages was based on strict liability or on negligence. In either case, the evidence must show malicious conduct and not simply the supplying of a defective product or negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 465, 601 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In a strict products liability cause of action, the plaintiff must establish that the product was defective; that it was unreasonably dangerous; that it caused injury; and that it reached the customer in the same condition. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 601 A.2d 633. The plaintiff is not required to prove any specific act of negligence. Once the above elements have been established, only certain defenses are permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In a breach of fiduciary duty action (as it was created by this Court in <em>Hartlove), </em>a plaintiff must merely establish the existence of a fiduciary duty <em>and allege its </em>breach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Once this is done, the defendant has the burden of establishing, <em>i.e., </em>proving, that he has not committed the breach. Thus, in some respects, \u201cstrict liability\u201d and \u201cbreach of fiduciary\u201d actions are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>In <em>Adams v.

The second question was: \u201c[I]s it incumbent upon your petitioner to prove actual malice in a case involving an intentional breach of a fiduciary relationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 626 A.2d 36. The <em>Adams </em>trial court, discussing punitive damages for a breach of fiduciary duty, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t find any malice in the legal sense of the term in actual malice or anything of that matter. I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Adams has met his burden of proof in that area. If I was convinced ... that punitive damages are available purely for a breach of a fiduciary duty, absent the showing of actual malice, then I would be inclined to award punitive damages---- So, I don\u2019t believe that on a sole proof of a breach of a fiduciary duty ... that punitive damages are available because I don\u2019t find that you have proved malice, meaning actual malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKK\"><em>Id. </em>at 7, 626 A.2d 36. As can be readily discerned, appellant, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>is urging this Court to adopt the contrary position. Subsequently, the <em>Adams </em>trial court stated, \u201cI do make a finding that fraud was not committed,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] but that there was a breach of fiduciary duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 626 A.2d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The Court of Appeals, after a factual discussion, then framed the argument and issues that it perceived were presented for determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">The only issue for decision in the matter before us that turns on whether breach of fiduciary duty between partners can be asserted as a tort involves whether punitive damages are recoverable by Adams under the proof in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Whether punitive damages are recoverable is not determined exclusively by the elements of the tort, but depends primarily on Maryland policy as to the award of punitive damages. We shall assume, solely for the purpose of discussion in this case, the existence of a tort, and that, under proper proof, the tort can be the springboard for punitive damages....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">... We turn then to the second question on certiorari\u2014 whether, to obtain punitive damages, the plaintiff-partner must \u201cprove actual malice in a case involving an intentional breach of a fiduciary relationship between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aar\"><em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 626 A.2d 36. The Court quoted portions of its opinion in <em>Zenobia </em>that related, in general, to punitive damages. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">To the extent that Adams\u2019s argument is that a breach of fiduciary duty in and of itself permits the award of punitive damages, we reject his contention under the policy guidelines for punitive damages in general, as set forth in <em>Zeno-bia. </em>To the extent that Adams\u2019s argument is that the facts in the instant matter support a finding of evil motive, intent to injure, or fraud, we hold that the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding an absence of actual malice or fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\"><em>Adams, </em>331 Md. at 13, 626 A.2d 36. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">By affirming the denial of punitive damages we hold simply that the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding a lack of evidence to support punitive damages. We intimate no opinion on whether, from the record as a whole, facts sufficient to support an award of punitive damages might be gleaned, had the trier of fact reached the opposite conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">In any event, the trier of fact has discretion to deny punitive damages even where the record otherwise would support their award. <em>See Nast v.

As we have indicated, no fraud count went to the jury nor, we presume, was any fraud instruction given.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">More recently, the Court in <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 29, 690 A.2d 100 (1997), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">We have lately, and at great length, discussed the necessary prerequisites to a punitive damages award. Lest there be any remaining doubt, in order to recover punitive damages in <em>any </em>tort action in the State of Maryland, facts sufficient to show <em>actual malice </em>must be pleaded and proven by clear and convincing evidence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In our review of the Court of Appeals\u2019s cases since <em>Zenobia, </em>we have seen no weakening of the <em>Zenobia </em>holding \u2014 rather, its scope, whenever possible, appears to have been extended. It was expressly extended to actions for breach of fiduciary duty (if the action had then existed) in <em>Adams </em>and to all tortious actions no later than <em>Scott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in its findings and instructions to the jury in regard to appellant\u2019s first question and did not err in respect to appellant\u2019s second question. With the jury\u2019s finding of no actual malice, there was no necessity for a bifurcated hearing, even if the trial court agreed to proceed in that manner. A defendant\u2019s net worth has no relevance to the issue of actual malice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">3. Whether the evidence, consisting of [appellant\u2019s] testimony concerning the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in this case, is sufficient to support the [appellant\u2019s] demand for attorneys\u2019 fees in the absence of expert testimony that the fees incurred were \u201creasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The trial court declined to submit the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees to the jury because appellant had not presented any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>testimony as to reasonableness during the presentation of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Appellant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Q Mr. DeCaro is a good lawyer.

Appellant at trial never asserted any authority supporting her claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. In <em>Hess Constr. Co. v. Board of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 159-61, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">The \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d is that attorney\u2019s fees are ordinarily not recoverable by a prevailing party in a lawsuit. \u201cIn Maryland, \u2018[t]he general rule is that costs and expenses of litigation, other than the usual and ordinary Court costs, are not recoverable in an action for [compensatory] damages.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">Attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded where a statute allows for the imposition of such fees, and where parties to a contract have an agreement regarding attorney\u2019s fees. Where the wrongful conduct of a defendant forces a plaintiff into litigation with a third party, the plaintiff may recover from the defendant, as damages, reasonable counsel fees incurred in the action with the third party. Additionally, a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action, who has incurred counsel fees in the defense of the criminal charge, may be awarded those fees as damages in the civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">But exceptions are quite rare under Maryland common law to the general rule that counsel fees, incurred by the prevailing party in the very litigation in which that party prevailed, are not recoverable as compensatory damages against the losing party. The principal exception is for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>counsel fees incurred by an insured in successful litigation with a liability insurer which denied coverage or a duty to defend. In <em>Collier [v. MD-Individual Practice Ass\u2019n, </em>327 Md. 1, 17, 607 A.2d 537 (1992) ] we called this exception under Maryland common law an \u201canomaly.\u201d [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The Court concluded: \u201cAs a matter of substantive law under the American Rule, damages do not include counsel fees. The American Rule is so well established in Maryland that the mere mention of \u2018damages\u2019 in [former Rule] BE44 cannot be construed to include an exception to the American Rule.\u201d <em>Hess, </em>341 Md. at 165-66, 669 A.2d 1352 (footnote omitted). In <em>Hess, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed our <em>Hess Constr. Co. v. Board of Educ., </em>102 Md.App. 736, 651 A.2d 446 (1995), opinion. In its <em>Hess, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that Hess Construction Company (Hess), in its appeal to the circuit court and this Court, argued that counsel fees could have been awarded pursuant to the collateral litigation rule. The Court of Appeals noted that the collateral litigation rule had not been \u201cembraced\u201d within the grant of certiorari. The Court went on to note: \u201cIn any event, Hess was not engaged in litigation with a third party.\u201d <em>Hess, </em>341 Md. at 159 n. 2, 669 A.2d 1352. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no representation that the litigation is \u201cthird party\u201d litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We noted in our <em>Hess </em>that the Court of Appeals had discussed the collateral litigation rule in <em>McGaw v. Acker, Merrall &amp; Condit Co., </em>111 Md. 153, 73 A. 731 (1909), and we quoted from an excerpt in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">The counsel fees and costs which the Court allowed the plaintiff to recover are not the counsel fees and costs involved in this litigation; but such only as were incurred in securing the new lease in its name....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">The general rule is that costs and expenses ... are not recoverable ... even ... in a subsequent action; but where the wrongful acts ... ha[ve] involved the plaintiff in litigation with others, or placed him in such relations with others as make it necessary to incur expense ... such costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>expense should be treated as the legal consequences of the original wrongful act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><em>Hess, </em>102 Md.App. at 750, 651 A.2d 446 (quoting <em>McGaw, </em>111 Md. at 160, 73 A. 731). We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\"><em>McGaw, swpra, </em>makes it clear that a claimant seeking counsel fees may prevail only when the wrongful acts of one of the parties to a contract has involved the claimant in litigation <em>with </em>others....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the wrong alleged generated no action involving others.1-<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\"><em>Hess, </em>102 Md.App. at 754, 651 A.2d 446 (quoting <em>Archway Motors, Inc. v. Herman, </em>41 Md.App. 40, 44, 394 A.2d 1228 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>284 Md. 741 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Likewise, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the action is a direct action, not a collateral action, and there is no \u201cother litigation.\u201d To the extent the collateral litigation rule was pressed upon the trial court, it did not err in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">At oral' argument, appellant asserted that awards of attorneys\u2019 fees in breach of fiduciary duty actions are exceptions to the general rule that each party must pay its own litigation costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees. When queried about the source of her argument, she recited the cases in her brief. We have reviewed the cases she cited, including <em>Homa v. Friendly Mobile Manor, Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 337, 612 A.2d 322 (1992). <em>Homa </em>was a suit against an attorney and a law firm for fraud, breach of legal services contract, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. While judgment was rendered below against the attorney, the trial court awarded damages for the claims asserted and not for the costs of litigation and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in prosecuting the case. <em>Homa </em>is simply inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\"><em>Cosden v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>41 Md.App. 519, 398 A.2d 460 (1979), also cited by appellant, involved the approval of statutorily authorized attorneys\u2019 fees in respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the administration of estates and trusts. Accordingly, it does not apply. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>DeLeon Enters, v. Zaino, </em>92 Md.App. 399, 608 A.2d 828 (1992), is likewise misplaced. It involved a request for the trial court to impose attorneys\u2019 fees under Maryland Rule 1-341 as a sanction. The instant case is not a sanctions case. <em>Saint Luke Evangelical Lutheran Church, Inc. v. Smith, </em>318 Md. 337, 568 A.2d 35 (1990), involved the issue of whether a jury could consider the plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees in assessing punitive damages. In that case, the Court of Appeals upheld the punitive damages by a four to three majority. The Court in <em>Saint Luke Church, </em>adopting the view that attorneys\u2019 fees may be part of the calculations in respect to punitive damages, nevertheless opined, \u201cThe American Rule reflects a widespread rejection of both general indemnity for litigants and a \u2018make-whole\u2019 rationale as a basis for awarding attorney\u2019s fees as an element of compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 568 A.2d 35. The issues presented on appeal in <em>Shapiro v. Massengill, </em>105 Md.App. 743, 661 A.2d 202 (1995), did not include the appropriateness of attorneys\u2019 fees. Moreover, it was an action for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, and defamation. It did not concern a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In summation, the cases to which appellant directs our attention are all inapplicable. We know of no Maryland body of law that would except the new tort of breach of fiduciary duty, which we recognized in <em>Hartlove, </em>but that has since been \u201cdisapproved\u201d in <em>Kann, </em>from the American Rule even if the cause of action remained viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Accordingly, we do not perceive that appellant, in respect to the only count that went to the jury, the at best interim independent tort of breach of fiduciary duty, was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. Moreover, given the extremely limited testimony on the issue and appellant\u2019s offhand and vague remark, \u201cFrom the beginning to today, probably about $31,000, $32,000,\u201d even if the court had the power to submit attorneys\u2019 fees to the jury, it did not err or abuse its discretion in declining to do so. We shall not expend any further time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>describe what evidence, in an appropriate case, mandates such a submission. Whatever the standard would be, it was not met here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">4. Whether the trial court properly set aside the jury verdict awarding [appellant] the profits earned by [appellee] from the partnership after the death of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The jury in the case <em>sub judice </em>returned a special verdict form that, after other questions, stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2o\">What damages, if any, proximately caused by [appellee\u2019s] breach, do you award the [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Deposition fees $ 900.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">Appraisal fees $ 7,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">Profits 62,500.00 for % business</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">As indicated above, in respect to profits, the special verdict read \u201cProfits <em>62,500.00 for 1/2 business.\u201d </em>When giving or reading the verdict form, the foreperson used the same language.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The sum of $62,500 was the exact amount at which the estate\u2019s on\u00e9-half interest in the business had been appraised. Appellant had argued that she was entitled to $20,000 a year, for a total of over $90,000 in lost profits. It is certainly unclear how the jury arrived at a figure of $62,500 and then stated that it was awarded \u201cfor 1/2 business.\u201d The $62,500 is exactly the sum that the court had instructed the jury had already been determined and resolved in another proceeding. The difficult question for this Court is whether the circuit court was correct when it reformed the, to it, ambiguous jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">We initially note that there was evidence that the business generated sufficient income to support appellant\u2019s assertion that a one-half share of the profits would amount to $20,000 per year over the three or more years of the dispute. There was, therefore, sufficient evidence, if believed by the jury, for a monetary sum in excess of the $62,500 written on the verdict sheet. The trial court\u2019s consternation appears to have been caused by the sum awarded being the same amount of the value of one-half the business plus the language used \u201cfor 1/2 business.\u201d Had the jury awarded, for instance, a sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>$20,000 or $80,000 with the words \u201cfor 1/2 business,\u201d we would perceive that the trial court may have termed the words \u201cfor 1/2 business\u201d to have meant \u201cfor 1/2 profit of business.\u201d It is clear from the trial court\u2019s comments that it was the sum of $62,500 that caused him to conclude that the jury was awarding a sum for the business itself and not the profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">To us, an alternate reason for the jury\u2019s award, and the use of the language, is apparent. The jury was awarding profits, but was unwilling to award one-half of the profits in an amount greater than one-half of the value of the business. This type of inferential conflict is one reason that it is generally accepted that juries occasionally make compromises based upon the jury\u2019s concept of justice when it addresses the facts of a given case within the framework of a trial judge\u2019s instructions. This is why courts are generally reluctant to ascribe reasons to the compromises of juries and to void verdicts that are otherwise supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In <em>Traylor v. Grafton, </em>273 Md. 649, 332 A.2d 651 (1975), in which a sum of liquidated damages had been agreed upon, the trial court corrected a jury\u2019s verdict that was silent on that issue. The Court of Appeals noted: \u201cThe trial court possessed the power to correct a verdict <em>which may be defective in form </em>but which clearly and definitely expresses the intention of the jury. A verdict which is returned informally may be molded into proper shape by the trial court.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 332 A.2d 651 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). In <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Keulemans, </em>275 Md. 441, 446, 340 A.2d 705 (1975), the Court noted that a jury verdict can be \u201cmolded or reformed [by a court] to reflect what the jury manifestly and beyond doubt intended.\u201d <em>See also ACandS, Inc. v. Godwin, </em>340 Md. 334, 405, 667 A.2d 116 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The Court of Appeals discussed when modification of a jury verdict is inappropriate in <em>Gaither v. Wilmer, </em>71 Md. 361, 18 A. 590 (1889). In that case, a defense of set off had been asserted in a case involving the collectibility of certain promissory notes. The jury returned a sealed verdict that stated that they \u201cfind for the plaintiff.\u201d However, the verdict did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>assess damages. The trial court polled the jury and then excused them. Later, the defendant\u2019s attorney moved for a new trial. While the motion was pending, the plaintiffs attorney asked the court \u201cto re-assemble the jury, and to direct them to enter in their verdict for the plaintiff the sum of $5,378.72\u201d (a sum agreed during trial would be the correct amount of plaintiffs claim if the plaintiff prevailed on its claim). <em>Id. </em>at 363, 18 A. 590. The defendant denied the agreement and again moved for a new trial on the ground that the \u201cverdict is uncertain, irregular and a nullity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, the trial court inserted after the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cfor the plaintiff,\u201d the words \u201cfor the sum of $5,378.72.\u201d The Court of Appeals opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">Without doubt, a verdict, in an action like the present, simply \u201cfor the plaintiff,\u201d without stating the damages, or the amount the plaintiff is entitled to recover, is fatally defective. It is not merely an informal verdict, which the court can mould into proper shape by referring to the pleadings and issues, but it is substantially defective. In all cases where the action is upon a contract or for damages, the verdict, if for the plaintiff, must be for an amount specified; otherwise the court cannot enter judgment upon it for any amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">The question, then, is, had the court power to amend this verdict, and make it effective by inserting the amount the plaintiff was entitled to recover, at the time and under the circumstances stated? The amendment was made after the verdict was assented to by the jury, when called upon to hearken to it after it had been duly recorded, and several days after the jury had separated. The defect was discovered by the Judge when the verdict was handed to him before it was recorded, and when the jury were in attendance in open court for the purpose of rendering their verdict. It was then competent for the jury to reject this verdict in <em>toto, </em>and find another, or to vary, or correct it. The Judge, also, could then have sent them to their room, with instructions to correct this defect, whether counsel assented or not; and this was the course that should have been adopted____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>... [B]ut in States where the common law is the only guide on the subject, we think the decided weight of authority is against allowing such a thing to be done; and we have found no American case in which an amendment like this, in matter of substance, has been made upon affidavits, or from the Judge\u2019s recollection of what occurred at the trial, after the imperfect verdict has been duly recorded, and the jury have separated. A citation or review of these authorities is unnecessary, because it seems to us that the question has been settled in Maryland by the decisions of this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">...

[514,] 546 [ (1849) ] \u2014 a case most carefully considered \u2014 our predecessors have laid it down broadly and emphatically that \u201cif a jury, through mistake or partiality, deliver an improper verdict, the court may, before it is recorded, desire them to reconsider it. They cannot, however, be allowed to make alteration after the verdict is recorded\u201d; and this case was re-affirmed in <em>Williams v. State, </em>60 Md. 402 [ (1883) ]. These authorities have, in our judgment, settled it as law in this State, that no material alteration can be made by the jury in their verdict, either in a civil or criminal case, after it has been recorded, and, if this can not be done by the jury, <em>a fortiori </em>can it not be done by the court or the Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">In conclusion, we may say we are firmly convinced that the adoption of any other rule on this subject than that so plainly laid down by our predecessors, and so long adhered to in practice by the courts of the State, would be dangerous in the extreme, would open the door to abuses, and lead to doubtful and possibly pernicious results; and we can not escape the legal conclusion that, by making the amendment complained of in this case, the Judge has invaded the exclusive province of the jury, and substituted his verdict for theirs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>Gaither, </em>71 Md. at 364-68, 18 A. 590 (some citations omitted). The <em>Gaither </em>Court had previously opined that it would have been proper for the trial court, before the jury was excused, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>have submitted a supplemental verdict sheet to them for their further consideration. <em>See id. </em>at 365,18 A. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Over one hundred years later, this aspect of Gaither was discussed, and to some extent, found to be determinative in <em>Nails v. S &amp; R, Inc., </em>334 Md. 398, 639 A.2d 660 (1994). In <em>Nails, </em>the jury rendered a verdict and was polled on that verdict. The parties and their attorneys were then told that they were excused, and that the verdict was final. At that point, however, the court was asked to submit an additional issue to the jury, which was still in the jury box; it had apparently not been excused.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One of the issues in <em>Nails </em>was whether the trial court could have submitted a supplemental issue to the jury. While the real question was whether the new issue could be submitted to a jury, and did not involve a trial court\u2019s reformation of a jury\u2019s verdict, the Court, discussing <em>Gaither </em>at some length, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">This Court has consistently indicated that, in civil cases, a trial judge has the authority to have a jury deliberate further and amend its verdict as long as the jury has not been discharged and left the court room. Thus, in <em>Gaither v. Wilmer, </em>71 Md. 361, 18 A. 590 (1889), the jury returned an obviously incomplete verdict which purported to \u201cfind for the plaintiff\u2019 without specifying any amount of damages____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">... Instead, the issue here is governed by this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Ager v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>[213 Md. 414, 418, 132 A.2d 469 (1957) ]; <em>Gaither v. Wilmer, supra, </em>and similar cases. In light of the opinions in these cases, we hold that, in a civil case, after a jury has rendered an initial verdict, the trial judge ordinarily may ask the jury to amend, clarify or supplement the verdict in order to resolve an ambiguity, inconsistency, incompleteness, or similar problem with the initial verdict, up until the jury has been discharged and has left the court room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The trial judge\u2019s submission of the supplemental verdict sheet to the jury was fully justified in this case. There was a degree of ambiguity and possible inconsistency in the jury\u2019s initial verdicts, and the supplemental verdict helped clarify the ambiguity and possible inconsistency....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">... The supplemental verdict sheet, with specific findings by the jury that each of the plaintiffs had been induced by fraud to enter into the employment contracts, clarified the ambiguity in the initial jury verdicts and supported the award of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>Nails, </em>334 Md. at 408-15, 639 A.2d 660 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Citing to <em>Gaither, </em>in <em>Polkes &amp; Goldberg Ins., Inc. v. General Ins. Co., </em>60 Md.App. 162, 167, 481 A.2d 808 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 288, 487 A.2d 292 (1985), we said, \u201cGenerally, a judge has no power to reform a jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d We then noted that there are exceptions, one of which is that a trial judge \u201cis empowered to correct, remold or reform the verdict ... so as to express the jury\u2019s intent if that intent is, <em>beyond doubt, </em>clearly and definitely manifested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We noted in that case that the jury\u2019s intent was \u201cfar from clear and definite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also noted that <em>Gaither </em>was then the only Maryland case in which a \u201ctrial judge endeavored to correct an improper verdict after it was recorded\u201d and that other jurisdictions had generally held that a trial judge could not \u201cinvade the province of the jury under the guise of amending the verdict.\u201d <em>Polkes &amp; Goldberg, </em>60 Md.App. at 169, 481 A.2d 808. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Trial judges may, under Maryland law, change a verdict and remold it if the modification is one of form, <em>Davis v. Board of Educ., </em>168 Md. 74, 78-79, 176 A. 878 (1935), and \u201cthe intention of the jury is manifest and <em>beyond doubt,\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) <em>Hawks v. Crofton, </em>2 Burrows 698, 699 (K.B.1758), quoted in <em>Diamond State Telephone Co. v. Blake, </em>105 Md. 570, 575, 66 A. 631 (1907); <em>Browne v.

In effect, the judge wiped out the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to Polkes\u2019s liability to Thompson\u2019s and General. He then substituted for the jury\u2019s verdicts what he thought the verdicts should be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Polkes &amp; Goldberg, </em>60 Md.App. at 169-70, 481 A.2d 808 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As far as we have been able to discern, the only change in the law since <em>Gaither </em>is that announced in <em>Nails, i.e., </em>if the jury is still in the jury box, a supplemental issue may be submitted to it after it has rendered a verdict on the issues originally presented to it. We now examine what occurred in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">After the jury had returned and rendered its verdict, it was polled and its foreperson used the language of the jury\u2019s response on the verdict sheet in her response. The jury confirmed that verdict and was then excused. The judgment, indicating the damages for profits, was later recorded on March 21, 1996. The next day, appellee filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in which he raised the language and amount used by the jury on the special verdict sheet. The docket entries reflect the trial court\u2019s disposition of this issue almost three months later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">Granted as to award for profits. At the direction of the court the 03/14/96[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] judgment in the amount of $62,-000.00[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] for profits is stricken and judgment for the [plaintiff] in the amount of $-0- (zero) is entered for profits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHy\">We earlier noted that there was evidence before the jury that could have permitted it to make an award for profits of up to $91,000, according to appellant\u2019s evidence. The trial judge was directed by appellee\u2019s post-trial motion to the similarity of the sum awarded to the value of one-half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>business. We have indicated, however, that from these facts, an inference can also be made that the jury chose to cap its award of damages for profits at the value of the one-half interest in the business. In any event, coincidence or lack thereof does not make a jury\u2019s verdict inconsistent or reformable by a trial judge, so long as the total sum awarded does not exceed the evidence supporting the award. See <em>Birkey Design Group, Inc. v. Egle Nursing Home, Inc., </em>113 Md.App. 261, 687 A.2d 256 (1997), which involved an arbitrator\u2019s award in an amount only seventy-two cents less than the attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant argued that the sum awarded was indicative that the arbitrator had impermissibly awarded counsel fees. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">On its face, the award represents a plausible interpretation ... judicial inquiry ceases and the award must be enforced. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">... It is not this Court\u2019s function to speculate about the arbitrator\u2019s thought process when making an award.... Since it is possible that the award comprised damages rather than attorney\u2019s fees, we must assume the arbitrator acted properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 267, 687 A.2d 256. We hold that the trial judge erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in reference to the damage award for profits. Upon receipt of our mandate, the trial court is directed to reinstate the jury\u2019s award for profits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">5. Whether the trial court properly allowed the deed to the partnership real estate to be released to [appellee] prior to the conclusion of these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Because of the present posture of the case, this should no longer be an issue, if it ever was an appropriate issue, and, in light of our decision, it appears to be moot. Because we have already expended much effort to resolve the other issues and have no desire to engage in intellectual musings as to the propriety of the timing of the release of the deed, we shall not further discuss the interesting issue of whether appellant can raise the propriety of the release of the deed after she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>removed the deposited sum due her, thus benefiting from that order she now protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Appellee/cross-appellant\u2019s Question</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Did the trial court err in entering judgment for [appellant] for deposition costs and appraisal fees, and in failing to grant [appellee\u2019s] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We have earlier indicated that the parties have not directed us to the place in the proceedings that they objected to the special verdict form used in respect to deposition costs. We have been unable to find in the table of contents or the extracts where any such objections were made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In this case, appellant initially filed a two-volume Joint Record Extract, then a Supplemental Joint Record Extract, and then a separately filed Supplemental Joint Record Extract. Thereafter, when appellant filed her reply brief, she added an appendix to it. As we noted below, the parties in their arguments have not indicated where in these record extracts we can find any objection to the verdict form; neither do they direct us to the trial court\u2019s instructions on these issues nor to where objections to such instructions may be found. Likewise, they do not direct us to any objections made below to appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing arguments as to deposition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We have examined those areas in respect to appraisal fees to which our attention has been directed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue of the awarding of appraisal fees was sufficiently presented to the trial court by appellee/cross-appellant. In <em>Freedman v. Sei-dler, </em>233 Md. 39, 194 A.2d 778 (1963), cited by appellee/cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>appellant, the Court, in effect, applied the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d to the recovery of a party\u2019s costs of accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Appellant/cross-appellee has directed us to no statute or case law providing that the costs of appraisal incurred by a party (not taxed as costs of suit) may constitute a measure of damages for which a plaintiff is entitled to be compensated. Neither does she direct our attention to any authority stating that appraisal costs are an exemption to the general rule that each party is to bear the costs of prosecuting or defending litigation. The <em>Freedman </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">The injured tenant insists, and perhaps with some merit in a case such as this where the services of an accountant were necessary to show loss of profits, that she should be reimbursed for the expense of such services. But, in the absence of statutory authority permitting it, we think the charges of the accountant are not recoverable either as an element of damages or as a part of the costs. Compare point (iii) of this opinion, where, with respect to the allowance of counsel fees, it is said that the general rule is that costs and expenses other than actual court costs are not recoverable in an action for damages. We think the same rule is applicable to accountants!\u201d] charges, for we see no distinction in principle between such charges and attorneys!\u201d] fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 47, 194 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In <em>Empire Realty Co. v. Fleisher, </em>269 Md. 278, 305 A.2d 144 (1973), a fraud case, the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees, recording charges, title insurance, engineering fees for test borings, and an additional sum of $10,500 for costs incurred in retaining the services of a realtor. The Court, in discussing the trial court\u2019s award of counsel fees, noted: \u201cThe general rule is that, other than usual and ordinary court costs, <em>the expenses of litigation </em>\u2014 including legal fees incurred by the successful party \u2014 are not recoverable in an action for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285-86, 305 A.2d 144 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Accordingly, we conclude, in the absence of being directed by appellant/cross-appellee to a statute creating an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to the general rule, that she was not entitled to an award for appraisal fees, and we shall reverse the award of appraisal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">JUDGMENT OF $7,500 FOR APPRAISAL FEES IS REVERSED; TRIAL COURT\u2019S GRANTING OF APPEL-LEE\u2019S/CROSS-APPELLANT\u2019S JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT THAT REFORMED THE JURY VERDICT AS TO PROFIT DAMAGES IS REVERSED; TRIAL COURT IS DIRECTED TO REINSTATE THE JURY VERDICT FOR PROFIT DAMAGES IN THE SUM OF $62,500; IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS, JUDGMENT IS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID 50% BY APPELLANT/CROSS-APPELLEE, 50% BY APPEL-LEE/CROSS-APPELLANT.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\">. In August of 1996, well after judgment was rendered in the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court, for the first time, recognized the independent tort of breach of fiduciary duty in <em>Hartlove v. Maryland Sch. for the Blind, </em>111 Md.App. 310, 681 A.2d 584 (1996), <em>vacated and remanded for reconsideration, </em>344 Md. 720, 690 A.2d 526 (1997). Accordingly, at the time of the verdict, the independent tort had not yet been recognized. By failing to incorporate any part of her previous complaint in her amended complaint, appellant prosecuted an action that had not yet been recognized. Appellee did not raise the nonexistence of this cause of action before the trial court and has not raised it before us. Accordingly, that issue is waived, and we need not resolve whether <em>Hartlove </em>s application would apply to causes of action already litigated to judgment prior to Hartlove\u2019s filing. Moreover, the Court of Appeals in <em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 713, 690 A.2d 509 (1997), has \"disapproved\u201d <em>Hartlove.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">.

We reiterate that the other causes initially pled in the complaint did not survive, for whatever reason, to be submitted to the jury. Only the breach of fiduciary duty was submitted to the jury.

The trial court in <em>Hartlove </em>instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">Where either a confidential relationship or fiduciary duty exists, the burden <em>of </em>production of evidence falls upon the party in whom responsibility has been imposed to establish that his conduct was proper under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">Thus, as to the allegation by the Plaintiff of breach of fiduciary duty, it is the burden of the Defendant to produce evidence showing or tending to show that, in all material respects, he acted with fairness and candor....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-13\"><em>Hartlove, </em>111 Md.App. at 326, 681 A.2d 584. We declined to address the issue of burdens of proof and production because the defendant did not challenge the trial court\u2019s instruction, a portion of which is quoted above. <em>See id. </em>at 333 n. 14, 681 A.2d 584.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b264-11\">.

We realize that our mandate leaves intact a verdict and judgment predicated upon a cause of action that did not exist when the verdict was rendered below and may not exist as we render our mandate, but that may have existed for but a brief period in the interim. Because the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain then existing causes of action that incorporated breaches of fiduciary duty, it had jurisdiction. Because no appeal was taken, nor objection made below, the issue of the existence of the cause of action was waived <em>in this case.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
