Our decision to vacate the judgment of divorce is an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of the proverbial \u201crush to judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">Yudita Falk Aronson, appellee, filed suit against Elliott Barton Aronson, appellant, seeking a divorce on the grounds of adultery and a two year separation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the trial commenced on December 14, 1995 on those grounds, the parties had only lived separate and apart for twenty-two and a half months. Moreover, the wife had condoned the adultery in issue. Thus, the two year separation ground was not quite ripe, and there was reason to believe that the adultery would not withstand a challenge. Under these circumstances, it is particularly noteworthy that the parties had not agreed in advance of trial to an amendment of the complaint on the ground of a one year voluntary separation. Further, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>separation agreement did not suggest that both parties wanted to end the marriage. Nevertheless, with only a few weeks remaining to achieve the unassailable two year ground, trial commenced in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">At trial, over the husband\u2019s vigorous objection, the court permitted appellee to amend her complaint to include a claim for divorce based on a one year voluntary separation. Ultimately, the court granted appellee an absolute divorce on that ground. Subsequently, the court found appellant in contempt for failure to pay child support and sentenced him to the Baltimore County Detention Center, setting a purge amount of $11,900.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Appellant appeals from the court\u2019s judgment of divorce and from the contempt finding. He presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">I. Did the court err in granting the wife an absolute divorce on the grounds of a one-year mutual and voluntary separation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">II. Did the court err in admitting into evidence and allowing cross-examination of [the] husband on settlement discussions and a document prepared by [the] husband\u2019s lawyer for settlement purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">III. Did the court err in sentencing [the] husband to jail for civil contempt with a purge provision where the court refused to take, consider and even mark for identification evidence concerning [the] husband\u2019s ability to pay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">In her brief, appellee frames the following issue, which we have reworded slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">Regardless of the parties\u2019 mutual and voluntary separation, was appellee entitled to a divorce on the ground of adultery, because condonation is not an absolute bar?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">We are of the view that the trial court erroneously granted a judgment of divorce on the ground of a one year voluntary separation; the proof was insufficient to establish the element of mutual intent to end the marriage. Further, the court erred in concluding that condonation is an absolute bar to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>divorce on the ground of adultery. Therefore, we shall vacate the judgment of divorce and remand for further proceedings. As the court did not preclude appellant from offering evidence in the contempt proceeding, we shall affirm the contempt order. In light of our holdings, we decline to address appellant\u2019s second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The parties were married on November 29, 1981 and have two minor daughters. Mr. Aronson was the founder and part owner of Ecu-Med, Inc., doing business as Aronson Medical <em>&amp; </em>Respiratory Services (\u201cAronson Medical\u201d). Ms. Aronson is the owner of Cruises Plus, a travel business.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In December 1992, appellee discovered that appellant was involved in an adulterous relationship with Ms. Stella Nataro-va,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one of his employees. When appellee confronted appellant, he admitted to the adultery. The parties did not then separate; instead they engaged in discussions, lasting several months, about the future of their marriage. On or about April 1, 1993, appellee agreed to condone her husband\u2019s adultery on the condition that he not have any future contact with Ms. Natarova, and that he dismiss his paramour from employment; appellant agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In June 1993, appellee discovered some checks, issued by Aronson Medical and made payable to Ms. Natarova, in appellant\u2019s briefcase. When she confronted appellant, he stated that the monies were part of a severance package. He admitted personally delivering the checks to Ms. Natarova, but claimed that no improprieties occurred during his contacts with her. Nevertheless, appellee no longer considered the parties as husband and wife. Although the parties continued to reside together in the family home, they ceased any sexual relations at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In September 1993, appellee learned that appellant had purchased a condominium unit in Baltimore City. She waited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>for two weeks before confronting appellant about the purchase; during that time, appellant never acknowledged having purchased the condominium. Consequently, appellee retained counsel but continued to reside in the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">On <em>January </em>31, 1994, the parties entered into a written separation agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). It was then that Ms. Aronson left the marital home. The parties have not resided together since that time. The Agreement provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">WHEREAS, in consequence of current differences between Husband and Wife, Wife and Husband have agreed that Wife and the two Minor Children shall move from the family home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">WHEREAS, <em>the Husband does not wish to end the marriage, </em>and having love for his Wife; and Husband and Wife both having love for the Minor Children; nevertheless, <em>they have agreed to a trial separation, </em>which does not constitute abandonment by either Husband or Wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">WHEREAS, <em>the purpose of this separation is to give both parties time to think of their investment in marriage and seek professional counseling.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants and understandings of each of the parties, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">1. <em>LENGTH OF TRIAL SEPARATION.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">This Agreement shall govern the parties for a period of six (6) months. <em>During this time, should the parties agree to reconcile, this Agreement is void. </em>Reconciliation shall mean resumption of cohabitation. At the end of six (6) months, either Husband or Wife may ask the other for the right to reconcile. If either of the parties chooses not to reconcile, then all obligations under this Agreement herein cease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\"># 4! sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">12. <em>RELINQUISHMENT OF MARITAL RIGHTS.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The parties shall continue to live separate and apart, free from interference, authority and control of the other, as if each were sole and unmarried; and each may conduct, carry on or engage in any business, profession or employment that to him or her may seem advisable, without any control, restraint or interference by the other party in all respects as if each were unmarried. Neither of the parties shall molest or annoy the other or seek to compel the other to cohabit or dwell with him or her by any means whatsoever, or exert or demand any right to reside in the home of the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u2756 * # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">26. <em>COUNSELING.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">This Agreement is entered into with the earnest hope of both parties that they will seek counseling. Husband will be responsible for any costs incurred by Wife for counseling that Husband\u2019s insurance does not pay. Each party shall have the right to choose his or her own counsellor, and all such counseling shall be confidential. Additionally, it would be strongly suggested that an occasional joint monthly meeting of the parties and a counselor of Wife\u2019s choice shall be held <em>to discuss progress in reconciliation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">On July 24, 1994, less than six months after the Agreement was executed, appellee filed a complaint for absolute divorce on the grounds of a two year separation and adultery. Appellant never filed a counterclaim. In his answer, he denied that the parties were beyond reconciliation. At trial, the parties and Jeffrey Pollack, the Certified Public Accountant for appellant and Aronson Medical, were the only witnesses. Mr. Pollack\u2019s testimony did not concern any of the grounds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>divorce. Rather, it dealt only with Mr. Aronson\u2019s financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Appellee testified about her discovery of appellant\u2019s infidelity and her decision to condone it in April 1993. She believed that appellant had continued his relationship with Ms. Nataro-va, because he had \u201clied\u201d about the checks. She said, \u201cAnd I think because he lied and kept it away from me there was something more than just severance pay only, because he didn\u2019t say the truth.\u201d Although appellee had \u201cheard\u201d that appellant was still involved with Ms. Natarova after th\u00e9 separation, she acknowledged that she had no evidence that appellant had actually engaged in adultery after her condonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Appellee also testified about her discovery of the condominium purchase. Appellant told her he bought the unit because it was a \u201cgood deal.\u201d After the confrontation about the condominium, appellee said she \u201cknew then that it\u2019s time ... to see a, to go see a lawyer and it was time to call it quits.\u201d She further said that after discussing the issue from September 1993 to January 1994, she and appellant agreed that she would move out of the house. As appellant agreed to the separation and did not object to it, she considered the separation as \u201cmutual and voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Appellee called her husband as a witness. Appellant testified that appellee wanted a trial separation, to which he agreed. But he insisted that he never desired to end the marital relationship. Instead, he maintained that he agreed to separate, at appellee\u2019s request, to \u201cameliorate\u201d the conflict, to give the parties a \u201ccooling off period,\u201d and to let them seek counseling. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Counsel for appellee: Now, ultimately it was determined when you and Mrs. Aronson decided to separate, by the way, the decision to separate in January of \u201994, that was by agreement, correct, on a trial basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">Mr. Aronson: I only agreed that we should try the separation if we were really going to have it as a trial and a way, I encouraged, I even wrote in the agreement for her to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>therapy and I get some help and we make an effort to fix things. That was my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">Counsel for appellee: Mr. Aronson, my only question was, you agreed to a trial separation at that time, correct? Mr. Aronson: That\u2019s the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Counsel for appellee: Thank you. When the six month trial separation was over you wanted to renew it for an additional six month trial period, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">Mr. Aronson: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">Counsel for appellee: Which would have been a separation by agreement for a 12 month period commencing in January of 1994, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">Mr. Aronson: I don\u2019t know if six months was the right number, but some additional time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">Counsel for appellee: Didn\u2019t you just say you wanted to renew it for six months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">Mr. Aronson: No, you said six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">Counsel for appellee: And you said yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">Mr. Aronson: I said yes. I meant I wanted to renew the agreement in some form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-14\">Counsel for appellee: Mrs. Aronson wanted the separation to become permanent correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-15\">Mr. Aronson: No. That isn\u2019t true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-16\">Counsel for appellee: But the separation has been permanent; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-17\">Mr. Aronson: So far it\u2019s been permanent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-18\">Counsel for appellee: And you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-19\">Mr. Aronson: Nothing, there is nothing that is irreconcilable about our marriage and/or our separation. Unfortunately this entire circus with courts and lawyers and everything, it just, it tears down any possibility to fix or repair anything. And for two years we have been imbedded in nothing but a circus of lawyers, frankly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-20\">In view of appellant\u2019s acknowledgement that he had agreed to the trial separation in January 1994 and had wanted to renew it for an additional period of time, the court permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>appellee to amend her complaint to include the ground of a one year voluntary separation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The following exchange is relevant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">The Court: Do you want to renew your motion to amend your bill of complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">Counsel for appellee: I do, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">The Court: Now, what\u2019s your position in regard to that, in view of what your client just said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">Counsel for appellant: My client\u2019s position all along in this case has been he does not want to get divorced, he was willing to try a separation. He has always been bent on\u2014 his opinion is that the separation, he has agreed to a separation only from the point of view, that of trying to work things out with his wife. That is different than separating with a mutual intent to end the marriage. It is not the same thing. His position is that he hasn\u2019t done that. And objects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">The Court: It was mutual, voluntary separation, that\u2019s what it was, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, that\u2019s what he just said, that on January they agreed to separate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">Counsel for appellant: They agreed to separate for six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">The Court: Then they agreed for another six months. Counsel for appellant: They did not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">The Court: For another period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">Counsel for appellant: No, he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">The Court: Okay. They agreed in January to separate. Counsel for appellant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-15\">The Court: They have, in fact, been separated for almost two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Counsel for appellant: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">The Court: Okay. Granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">Counsel for appellee: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">Counsel for appellant: Just for the record today, I object to Your Honor\u2019s ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">The Court: You object to the allowing him to amend to include the one year voluntary separation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">Counsel for appellant: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">The Court: Okay. The objection is on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">When called to testify for his side of the case, appellant asserted that, at the end of the six month separation period, he wanted to reconcile. He asked his wife to return to the marital home, and had \u25a0written her letters requesting her to do so, but she refused. On cross-examination, the court permitted appellee to impeach appellant with an \u201cAddendum Agreement\u201d, drafted and signed by appellant on August 4, 1994, which proposed an additional five month separation on the same terms as the Agreement. Appellee never executed the addendum. Appellee sought to show that appellant voluntarily agreed to the separation and to an extension of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">In closing argument, appellee claimed that she was entitled to a divorce on the ground of a two year separation, a one year separation, and adultery. As to the two year ground, appellee argued that the court should consider the time from May 1993 to January 1994, when the parties resided together but did not cohabit, in order to satisfy the required two year period of separation. As to adultery, appellee argued that appellant breached the conditions pursuant to which the wife condoned appellant\u2019s conduct. With respect to the claim of a one year voluntary separation, appellee\u2019s counsel asserted that the parties agreed to a six month \u201ctrial\u201d separation, which was later extended by agreement. Based on appellant\u2019s failure to testify truthfully concerning his request to renew the separation, counsel urged the court to discredit appellant\u2019s testimony and to find instead a mutual agreement to separate for the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ry period. To support appellee\u2019s position, counsel also argued that appellant failed to corroborate his claim that he lacked the intent to end the marriage. Counsel for appellee said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">There was certainly adequate opportunity to bring in corroboration of that intent, but he brought none in. So all we have is his own testimony, which has been directly impeached....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">There is no indication from Mr. Aronson except his appearance at this trial and his testimony at this trial that at any time did he object to the separation, did he object to the separation continuing, or that he objects to a divorce now, except for the fact that it\u2019s going to cost him some money. The reality is that these parties could be divorced in six weeks. And all that would be accomplished by deferring this matter for six weeks would be to give Mr. Aronson six weeks to play with his assets and hide his money to avoid whatever award Your Honor is going to give. The evidence does not permit Mr. Aronson out of that hole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">[B]ut his affirmative testimony yesterday was that at the end of the separation period he asks for an additional six month separation. Six months plus six months would be 12 months. 12 months is what you need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">And, therefore, what the evidence out of Mr. Aronson\u2019s own mouth and documents demonstrates is that Mr. Aron-son agreed to a separation and that after then agreed to a. further separation, which although now he says he doesn\u2019t have, or want to have resulted in a divorce, which now by his own testimony was to extend for at least 12 months. Therefore, we have a mutual agreement to separate with the intent of not having a marital relationship for ... at least a period of 12 months. That\u2019s a ground for divorce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Appellant countered, <em>inter alia, </em>that the two year ground was not satisfied, because the parties did not live apart for the requisite period. He claimed that the wife\u2019s condonation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>defeated the adultery, because there was no proof of a subsequent offensive marital act or cruelty. Finally, as to the one year period, appellant strenuously argued that the wife failed to show the requisite mutual intent to end the marriage. Counsel said: \u201c[H]e is entitled to stand steadfast under the laws of the State of Maryland and contest that that is a two year separation____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Before ruling, the court expressed unequivocally that appellant\u2019s testimony was not credible. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">To say that Mr. Aronson is not a credible witness is the grossest understatement in the world. To say that his testimony was believable, or was unbelievable is a \u2014 is not doing it justice. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you would convince, I don\u2019t care if you go to the bankruptcy court or you go to the U.S. District Court, or you go to the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals, or the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Fourth Circuit, the Court of Appeals, I don\u2019t care where you go. I don\u2019t care if you go to traffic court, you testify the way you testified before me, I don\u2019t know who you are going to convince.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Thereafter, the court granted appellee an absolute divorce on the ground of a voluntary one year separation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">Adultery. It\u2019s been argued to me that I should grant a divorce based on adultery. Well, there is no question that Mr. Aronson committed adultery, there is \u2014 he admits it, that he committed adultery. There is also no question that Mrs. Aronson, knowing of adultery, continued to live with him and, in fact, in the law did what we know as condone the adultery.... I believe that once that happens, then that adultery is no longer a ground for divorce. There has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to be a new adultery that occurs after the condonation and it\u2019s not been condoned by the wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">Well, Mr. Aronson may very well \u2014 I wasn\u2019t born yesterday, I mean, you don\u2019t buy a condominium just because you are walking by and you see it\u2019s for sale and, you know, you are in debt to everybody in the world, but you decide to spend ... [$]106,000, because it looked like it was a good deal. That\u2019s absurd. You don\u2019t continue to pay your paramour monies if you no longer are involved. So could very well be that Mr. Aronson was continuing his relationship. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">But he doesn\u2019t remember whether he had sexual relations with anybody in the past year. That was as believable as the rest of the testimony that I have heard from him, quite frankly. So he may have. Probably did. <em>But I don\u2019t have the proof. I don\u2019t have the evidence. So, I can\u2019t find by a preponderance of the evidence that he did commit adultery in the past year, so since it was condoned, so I can\u2019t grant a divorce based on the adultery.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">One year separation.... I find as a matter of fact that there was an express agreement to separate. I find as a fact that both Mr. Aronson and Mrs. Aronson agreed that they would live separate and apart, they agreed that Mrs. Aronson would leave the marital home. They agreed that when she left the marital home it was, at least for that period of time, not to resume the marriage relationship. Their purpose was to separate, to separate themselves from being married.... It was their intent to not resume the marriage, for that period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">Now, in fact, I find as a fact that after that six month period ended that six month period was extended. I find that from the testimony of Mrs. Aronson, which I believe, there was an extension of the six month separation agreement. I find that Mr. Aronson proposed it. I find his testimony to the contrary. <em>His testimony about how he didn\u2019t want to separate, how he didn\u2019t want the divorce, how </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>he didn\u2019t want there ever to be a divorce between the parties absolutely unbelievable. It is not credible. You would have to see him, and hear him and watch him and look at him as he testified to it, to know that it is not credible. It\u2019s not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\"><em>I </em>find as a fact that they voluntarily separated. I find as a fact they remained separate and apart for more than 12 months after the voluntary separation. I find as a fact there is no reasonable hope or expectation of a reconciliation between these parties. These people cannot be back together, I find as a fact. Therefore, the one year separation of the parties has continued uninterruptedly for one year. It was voluntary. Neither one of them forced the other to separate. They did it with the express intent and purpose of during the period of the separation ending the marital relationship, not continuing it.... I will grant them a divorce a vinculo matrimonii.[ <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Appellant timely noted his appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Subsequently, appellee filed a contempt petition, in March 1996, alleging appellant\u2019s failure to pay child support. Prior to the hearing on June 3, 1996, appellant filed for bankruptcy, but had sent $8,100 to appellee, designating it for his child support payment. Appellee decided instead to apply the money toward the marital payment of $50,000 that appellant owed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The trial court concluded that appellee was entitled to apply the money toward the marital payment, and found appellant in contempt for not paying child support of $20,000 between January and May 1996. The court ordered appellant incarcerated for contempt, but included a purge provision permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>appellant to avoid the incarceration by paying $11,900 to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The court anticipated appellant\u2019s argument that he was unable to pay, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">Now his argument is \u201cI can\u2019t pay it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">Well, his argument was he couldn\u2019t pay it when we had the trial. That was what the whole trial was about, how he doesn\u2019t have the money, how it\u2019s not there.

Appellant never offered the exhibits as evidence, never advised the court that he had witnesses for the hearing, and never objected to the court\u2019s comments, on the ground that the court did not consider his inability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">On June 5, 1996, after appellant noted his appeal from the contempt order and filed an emergency motion for a stay of the order, we granted the stay of the contempt order.

Nevertheless, appellant argues that the trial court improperly granted the divorce on the ground of a one year voluntary separation. Appellee disagrees but argues, alternatively, that she was entitled to a divorce on the ground of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">During the trial, as we observed, appellee amended her complaint to add the ground of a one year voluntary separation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although appellant concedes that he agreed to the physical separation, he asserts that he did not separate with the requisite intent to terminate the marital relationship. Thus, he claims that the separation was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Code, Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d) \u00a7 7 \u2014 103(a)(3) (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), because it was not accompanied by a mutual agreement to end the marriage. Appellee disagrees. This dispute requires us to examine the concept of the term \u201cvoluntary separation\u201d as it is used in F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a) sets forth the grounds for obtaining a divorce. It states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">(a) <em>Grounds for absolute divorce. </em>\u2014 The court may decree an absolute divorce on the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">(1) adultery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">(3) voluntary separation, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(i) the parties voluntarily have lived separate and apart without cohabitation for 12 months without interruption before the filing of the application for divorce; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">(ii) there is no reasonable expectation of reconciliation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(5) 2-year separation, when the parties have lived separate and apart without cohabitation for 2 years without interruption before the filing of the application for divorce;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In <em>Wallace v. Wallace, </em>290 Md. 265, 429 A.2d 232 (1981), the Court of Appeals interpreted the voluntary separation provision in Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Art. 16, \u00a7 24, the predecessor to F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a)(3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What the Court said is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">In order to establish the existence of the twelve month voluntary separation ground for divorce <em>a vinculo ... </em>three elements must be shown: (i) an express or implied agreement to separate, <em>accompanied by a mutual intent not to resume the marriage relationship; </em>(ii) voluntarily living separate and apart without cohabitation for twelve months prior to the filing of the bill of complaint; and (in) that the separation is beyond any reasonable hope of reconciliation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 275, 429 A.2d 232 (emphasis added); <em>see also Smith v. Smith, </em>257 Md. 263, 266, 262 A.2d 762 (1970). Indeed, the Court of Appeals has consistently held that voluntariness requires an agreement to live separate and apart, coupled with a common intent to terminate the marriage. <em>See Sullivan v. Sullivan, </em>234 Md. 67, 72, 197 A.2d 910 (1964); <em>Foote v. Foote, </em>190 Md. 171, 179, 57 A.2d 804 (1948); <em>France v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>176 Md. 306, 4 A.2d 717 (1939); <em>Campbell v. Campbell, </em>174 Md.229, 198 A. 414 (1938). Thus, in <em>Sullivan, </em>234 Md. at 72, 197 A.2d 910, the Court said that \u201ca voluntary separation as a ground for divorce connotes and requires a mutual agreement between the husband and wife to live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>separate and apart <em>with a common intent not to resume marital relations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Foote, </em>190 Md. at 179, 57 A.2d 804, the Court pronounced: \u201c[I]n order for the separation of husband and wife to be regarded as voluntary <em>unthin the meaning of the statute </em>there must be an agreement of the parties to live separate and apart <em>ivith a common intent not to resume marital relations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>See also </em>John F. Fader, II &amp; Richard J. Gilbert, Maryland Family Law, \u00a7 3 \u2014 5(d), at 83 (2d ed. 1995) (\u201cAs stated in <em>Smith v. Smith </em>[257 Md. 263, 262 A.2d 762 (1970) ], the intention at the time of separation must be an intent not to resume marital relations.\u201d (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In contrast, \u201c[a]cquiescence in or assent to what one cannot prevent does not amount to a voluntary agreement to separate.\u201d Fader <em>&amp; </em>Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3 \u2014 5(d), at 83; <em>see Stumpf v. Stumpf </em>228 Md. 350, 179 A.2d 893 (1962); <em>Moran v. Moran, </em>219 Md. 399, 149 A.2d 399 (1959); <em>Carney v. Carney, </em>16 Md.App. 243, 295 A.2d 792 (1972); <em>see also Lloyd v. Lloyd, </em>204 Md. 352, 359, 104 A.2d 595 (1954) (\u201cEven the realization by both husband and wife that their separation is final ... does not of itself establish an agreement that they shall live apart.\u201d). Nevertheless, the elements of mutuality and separation need not coincide at the inception of the separation. Indeed, an involuntary separation may later be transformed into a voluntary separation. <em>Wallace, </em>290 Md. at 277, 429 A.2d 232; <em>Mount v. Mount, </em>59 Md.App. 538, 476 A.2d 1175 (1984); <em>see also </em>Fader &amp; Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3 \u2014 5(d), at 83. Thus, a separation that begins as a desertion may later achieve \u201cvoluntary\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In sum, the cases teach that a voluntary separation must be accompanied by a mutual intent to terminate the marriage; mutuality of intent is a component of voluntariness. Voluntary, \u201c \u201cwhen used in reference to a common act of two or more persons affecting their common relationship ... means that they acted in willing concert in the doing of the act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nichols v. Nichols, </em>181 Md. 392, 394, 30 A.2d 446 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>(1943) (quoting <em>Kline v. Kline, </em>179 Md. 10, 15, 16 A.2d 924 (1940)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">In order to be awarded a decree of divorce for voluntary separation, the plaintiff must establish that the parties entered into a mutual and voluntary agreement to separate <em>and </em>not to resume the marital relationship. The separation for the purposes of the statute commences on the date that this agreement occurs even if the parties have separated prior to reaching this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Bernard A. Raum, Maryland Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 4:16 (1996) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The essential difference, apart from time, between the one year separation and the two year separation embodied in F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a)(5) is that the one year separation must be \u201cfounded upon a ground which is consensual and not culpatory, manifesting an intention to permit the marriage relationship to be terminated in law, as well as in fact, without regard to fault.\u201d <em>Rhoad v. Rhoad, </em>21 Md.App. 147, 151, 318 A.2d 551 (1974). In contrast, \u201c[w]ith respect to the statutory separation ground [in F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a)(5) ], the voluntariness of the separation plays no part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, when one party to the divorce is not willing voluntarily to terminate the marriage relationship, the two year separation ground precludes \u201ca party from perpetually preventing his or her spouse from obtaining a decree of divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii.\u201d Flanagan v. Flanagan, </em>14 Md.App. 648, 654, 288 A.2d 225 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Certainly, there are occasions when married parties \u201cagree\u201d to separate \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d because they are undecided about the future of their marriage or for reasons wholly unrelated to the purpose of termination of the marriage. For example, the parties may need to live apart for an extended period of time when one spouse is in the military or accepts a work assignment overseas. That the parties have, in fact, been physically separated for twelve months, based on an agreement to live apart, does not alone satisfy the requirements of the voluntary separation; to establish the one year ground, there must be \u201cmore than a mere physical separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion.\u201d Fader <em>&amp; </em>Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3 \u2014 5(d) at 84. The separation must be accompanied by a mutual intent to terminate the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><em>France v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. of Baltimore, </em>176 Md. 306, 4 A.2d 717 (1939), is instructive. There, the wife claimed that the husband suggested that she visit her sister in Italy, as the sister was ill. Thereafter, he refused to send her money to return to the United States. Testimony in the case also showed that the wife was in poor physical and mental health, and was incapable of traveling alone. At the end of the statutory period, the husband filed for divorce on the ground of a five year voluntary separation. What the Court said is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">The question in this appeal is whether the facts stated show that separation of the parties was voluntary [for the requisite statuory period of five consecutive years].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">As used in the [Code, art. 16, \u00a7 38] and construed in <em>[Campbell v. Campbell, </em>174 Md. 229, 198 A. 414 (1938) ], a voluntary separation is a physical separation of the parties, by common consent with a common intent not to resume marital relations. It does not mean a mere physical separation where one of the spouses for business or pleasure leaves the other, intending to return, and with no intention of affecting their marital relationship. Any other construction would mean that whenever a wife took her children to a summer resort, or a husband went on a business trip, there would be a \u201cvoluntary\u201d separation within the meaning of the Act, which is manifestly absurd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\"><em>France, </em>176 Md. at 325, 4 A.2d 717. <em>See also Benson v. Benson, </em>204 Md. 601, 605, 105 A.2d 733 (1954) (stating that voluntary separation \u201cconnotes more than a mere physical separation.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In our consideration of the question presented, we begin with a review of appellee\u2019s testimony. We have scoured the record in an effort to find direct testimony from appellee to support her claim that appellant separated with the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>terminate the marriage. Appellee provided the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">Counsel for appellee: For the record, when was the date of the separation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">Appellee: January 31,1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">Counsel for appellee: And who moved out of the marital home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">Appellee: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">Counsel for appellee: <em>Okay.

So you never separated then at all? You never, so this is the only separation you have had; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Appellee: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">Counsel for appellant: Was there any discussion about who would move out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Appellee: We were going back and forth. And we agreed there that it would be better that I move, with the children. It was agreed upon, both of us agreed to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">The court: Then you, in fact, separated in January of \u201994?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am0\">Appellee: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">The court: Since January of 1994 you have not lived with him, cohabited with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">Appellee: Nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">The court: Or had any sexual relations with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">Appellee: Nothing actually since June of, May of \u201993, but I lived in the same house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">Counsel for appellant: Now you stated in your testimony, Mrs. Aronson, that [appellant] did not object to the separation. And you also stated in your testimony that he has never asked you to move back in. But has he ever agreed to the separation? <em>Have you ever heard him telling you that he agreed to the separation between the two of you as mutual and voluntary?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">Appellee: <em>It was mutual and voluntary to my understanding.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Counsel for appellant: Well, isn\u2019t it a fact, Mrs. Aronson, that you moved out and wanted to end the relationship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Appellee: I, we went over from September of \u201993 until January, took us four months to come to an agreement. And it was a mutual agreement to the best, for both of us and the children and I that I will move out. Yes, this was both of our agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">Appellee: It was an agreement on everything. It was a, <em>he wanted a six months separation </em>agreement\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">We pause to compare the foregoing testimony to the evidence presented in <em>Wallace, </em>290 Md. 265, 429 A.2d 232. There, the Court considered the divorce statute in the context of a suit for alimony. As the husband in that case had already obtained a divorce in Virginia, the Court analyzed whether Ms. Wallace could assert a claim for alimony, since she would have been entitled to a divorce under Maryland law. Although the husband had abandoned his wife for another woman, and the separation was not initially mutual, the wife testified that, at a certain point, \u201cthe separation [became] agreeable\u201d to her, which the husband understood. Moreover, in the husband\u2019s pleadings, he admitted that the separation ultimately became \u201cmutual and voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 429 A.2d 232.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In marked contrast to <em>Wallace, </em>appellee never affirmatively represented that both parties wanted to end the marriage. Instead, in response to a question from her attorney about whether appellant objected to ending the marriage, she merely said: \u201cWe really never talked about it, but he never objected.\u201d Apart from testimony that appellant agreed to the separation, she failed to describe statements or conduct by appellant that evinced his intent to end the marriage. Moreover, appellee\u2019s assertion that the parties agreed that she would move out of the marital home does not distinguish between an agreement to separate, which appellant concedes, and an agreement to separate for the particular purpose of terminating the relationship, which appellant contests. Further, unlike in <em>Wallace, </em>appellant\u2019s answer reflects that he did not want to end the marriage. In his answer, appellant stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">2. [Appellant] denies the allegations as to any expectation or hope of reconciliation, in that he earnestly entered into an agreement with his wife to give her breathing room to allow her to mend the marriage and he sincerely believes that this is possible. He admits the allegations that the parties have been separated since January 31,1994.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Interestingly, appellee argued at trial that appellant failed in his burden and did not corroborate his testimony regarding intent. As the moving party, however, it was appellee who had the burden of proving that the separation was <em>mutually </em>voluntary, within the meaning of the statute. Fader &amp; Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-11(c) at 97; <em>Nichols, </em>181 Md. at 394, 30 A.2d 446. Moreover, every element of the claim must be corroborated. F.L. \u00a7 7-101(b) (\u201cA court may not enter a decree of divorce on the uncorroborated testimony of the party who is seeking the divorce.\u201d); <em>see Smith, </em>257 Md. at 266, 262 A.2d 762 (\u201cThat <em>every </em>element <em>must </em>be corroborated is well settled.\u201d); <em>Styka v. Styka, </em>257 Md. 464, 263 A.2d 555 (1970); <em>Fuller v. Fuller, </em>249 Md. 28, 237 A.2d 925 (1968); Fader &amp; Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-5(c) at 83. The corroboration, however, need only be slight. <em>Zulauf v. Zulauf, </em>218 Md. 99, 107, 145 A.2d 414 (1958). It may take the form of admissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>by a spouse, when \u201cthe testimony is trustworthy....\u201d Fader &amp; Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3 \u2014 11(d) at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In our assessment of the evidence, we also note that appel-lee never called any witness, other than appellant, to corroborate her case. Appellee relies on F.L. \u00a7 8-104 and argues that the Agreement corroborated her testimony that the parties voluntarily separated within the meaning of F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a)(3). Section 8-104 of the Family Law article permits a party to use a separation agreement for corroboration. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">In a suit for absolute divorce on the grounds of voluntary separation, a separation agreement is full corroboration of the plaintiffs testimony that the separation was voluntary if the agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">(1) states that the spouses <em>voluntarily agreed </em>to separate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">(2) is executed under oath before the application for divorce is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u201cA writing is, of course, excellent evidence of the intent of the parties and when it recites that the parties voluntarily agreed to separate; it will not easily be cast aside.\u201d Fader &amp; Gilbert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-5(d), at 83-84. This Agreement, however, does not buttress appellee\u2019s position. To the contrary, the Agreement clearly conflicts with appellee\u2019s assertion that the parties made a mutual and voluntary decision to separate <em>for the purpose of ending the marriage. </em>The Agreement, which was only operative for a six month period, expressly states that appellant \u201cdoes not wish to end the marriage,\u201d and that the purpose of the separation was to permit the parties to consider their interests in the marriage and to seek counseling. Moreover, the paragraph concerning counseling suggests that the parties should meet regularly to discuss any progress toward reconciling their differences. Thus, the terms of the Agreement indicating that appellant did not wish to end the marriage, and encouraging the parties to obtain counseling, are at odds with appellee\u2019s claim that, at the time of separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tion, the parties had a mutual intent not to resume the marriage. We recognize that the Agreement also contains a provision in which the parties agreed to relinquish their marital rights during the period of the trial separation. That clause, however, does not allow us to disregard other provisions expressly included in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Appellee points to the language , in the Agreement which states that, if \u201ceither of the parties chooses not to reconcile, then all obligations under this Agreement herein cease.\u201d Further, she argues that appellant demonstrated his intent to terminate the marriage by proposing an Addendum to extend the Agreement. She further contends that appellant failed to seek a reconciliation at the end of the six month separation and that this testimony was corroborated when the court expressly determined that appellant was not credible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Cullotta v. Cullotta, </em>193 Md. 374, 66 A.2d 919 (1949), appellee argues that the trial court was entitled to find \u201cnegative corroboration\u201d of appellant\u2019s intent to end the marriage; since the court did not believe appellant\u2019s protestations that he did not want to terminate the marital relationship, she urges that the converse must be taken as true. In <em>Cullotta, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201c[T]o sustain the burden of proof, testimony of one spouse, flatly contradicted by the other, needs corroboration, but the inherent strength or weakness of opposing testimony may furnish corroboration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 382, 66 A.2d 919 (quoting <em>Maranto v. Maranto, </em>192 Md. 214, 217, 64 A.2d 144 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The case of <em>Barr v. Barr, </em>58 Md.App. 569, 473 A.2d 1300 (1984), provides some guidance to us, and leads us to reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>appellee's proposition under the circumstances of this case. In <em>Barr, </em>the wife filed for divorce based on the grounds of adultery and constructive desertion, claiming that the husband had refused to engage in sexual intercourse with her for at least four years. Although the husband admitted that he refused to have sexual relations with his wife, he claimed this did not constitute desertion, because he had not intended to terminate the marriage. We acknowledged that the trial court \u201cis not bound to believe a litigant\u2019s expression of past intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 473 A.2d 1300. Rather, the court was entitled to infer from the husband\u2019s conduct \u2014 the admitted refusal to have sex with his wife, his adultery, and his departure from the marital home \u2014 that he intended to terminate the marriage. <em>Id. </em>We said: \u201cNot only does the refusal belie the protestation [of lack of intent], but also his subsequent affair hardly imputes [a] suggestion of permanence to the nuptial bond.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">But <em>Barr </em>is readily distinguishable from this case in several critical respects. First, there was no evidence presented below of appellant\u2019s infidelity after the condonation, and it was appellee who actually moved out. Second, in <em>Barr, </em>the wife was far more direct in her testimony and supported her affirmative testimony with the husband\u2019s admission that he had refused to engage in marit\u00e1l relations. In contrast, appellee does not point to any statement by appellant in which he actually said he wanted to end the marriage. Indeed, the Agreement conflicts with that assertion. Further, in <em>Barr, </em>the couple\u2019s two children corroborated their father\u2019s admissions. Finally, the husband in <em>Barr </em>counterclaimed for divorce, thereby indicating that he wanted to terminate the marriage. Appellant, however, never filed a counterclaim. Rather, in his answer, appellant denied that there was no hope of reconciliation. Unlike <em>Barr, </em>in which the husband\u2019s actions clearly evinced an intent to end the marriage, notwithstanding his denials, appellee has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to establish that appellant had the intent to end the marriage. This is not a case in which one spouse, at the eleventh hour, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>attempts to derail what has ripened into a one year voluntary separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">To be sure, we do not quarrel with the finding by the trial court that appellant\u2019s testimony was unworthy of belief. As we see it, however, even in the light most favorable to appellee, that finding merely leaves the record with insufficient evidence as to appellant\u2019s state of mind concerning a critical element of appellee\u2019s case. Appellee did not expressly state that appellant agreed to the separation with the intention of ending the marriage; she called no witnesses, other than her husband; and the Agreement underscored appellant\u2019s desire not to end the marriage. By its terms, the Agreement was in effect for six months, until the end of July 1994. On July 24, 1994, several days <em>before </em>the expiration of the Agreement, appellee filed for divorce. Thus, at the expiration of the Agreement, and by the time appellant presented the Addendum, we have no doubt that appellee was not interested in a reconciliation. Nevertheless, this does not establish that appellant formulated the intent to terminate the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Given appellee\u2019s scanty presentation concerning a key aspect of her case, the court\u2019s disbelief of appellant simply was not enough to transform appellee\u2019s case. In spite of appellee\u2019s effort to characterize the evidence as sufficient to prove her claim, we must conclude that it was inadequate to dissolve the marriage on the ground of a one year voluntary separation. To hold otherwise would render the term \u201cvoluntary\u201d completely superfluous. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The Court found no evidence that appellant committed adultery subsequent to appellee\u2019s condonation of her husband\u2019s earlier infidelity. The court concluded that appellee\u2019s condonation of her husband\u2019s adultery constituted an absolute bar to a divorce on that ground. In response to appellee\u2019s query, the court indicated that, but for the bar of condonation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>it would have granted the divorce on the ground of adultery. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">Counsel for appellee: I need clarification on two points. Your Honor gave your opinion as to the law of condonation and I respectfully disagree, as I told the court I would. In order that should this matter result in an appeal, as may will be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">The court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">Counsel for appellee: \u2014 could I impose upon the court to indicate to the Appellate Court that were my interpretation of the condonation Statute accurate and that it does not bar an absolute divorce that Your Honor would have been inclined to grant an absolute divorce in this case on that ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">The court: If there was no condonation here legally that barred a divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">Counsel for appellee: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">The court: Would absolutely grant a divorce based on adultery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Appellee challenges the court\u2019s legal conclusion that condo-nation is an absolute bar to a divorce on the ground of adultery, absent a subsequent instance of adultery. Appellee contends that, but for the court\u2019s misunderstanding of the law, the court would have granted a divorce on the ground of adultery. She claims she is entitled to a divorce on that ground, because appellant breached the express conditions of her condonation, <em>i.e., </em>no further contact with Ms. Natarova and her dismissal from employment. Therefore, she asks us to affirm the divorce decree on the ground of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">As a preliminary matter, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that appellee has \u201cimproperly\u201d raised the issue that she is entitled to an affirmance on the ground of adultery. As the party who prevailed in the trial court, appellee is entitled to assert any ground on appeal that would support an affirmance of the judgment in her favor, even those rejected by the trial court, -without lodging a cross-appeal. What the Court stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>in <em>Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 575, 579, 552 A.2d 868 (1989), is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">Our cases apply a number of rules on the subject of when an appeal is impermissible, on the one hand, and when on the other, an appeal is required in order to raise certain issues. For example, an appeal or cross appeal is impermissible from a judgment wholly in a party\u2019s favor. <em>Offutt v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Ed., </em>285 Md. 557, 564 n. 4, 404 A.2d, 281, 285 n. 4 (1979). In that situation, however, despite a party\u2019s inability to raise adverse issues by appeal or cross appeal, if the losing party appeals, the winning party may argue as a ground for affirmance matters resolved against it at trial. As Judge Eldridge explained, for the Court, in <em>Offutt:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">[w]here a party has an issue resolved adversely in the trial court, but ... receives a wholly favorable judgment on another ground, that party may, as an appellee, argue as a ground for affirmance the matter that was resolved against it at trial.... This is merely an aspect of the principle that an appellate court may affirm a trial court\u2019s decision on any ground adequately shown by the record. <em>Id. </em>[citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>See also Joseph H. Munson, Co. v. Sec. of State, </em>294 Md. 160, 448 A.2d 935 (1982) (finding that the State, which had not cross-appealed, could not argue that the trial court failed to dismiss the suit for lack of standing, because the trial court\u2019s ruling came at summary judgment, not on a motion to dismiss), aff<em>'d, </em>467 U.S. 947, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u201cCondonation is, of course, forgiveness with an implied condition that the marital offenses shall not be repeated and that the party offended shall be treated with conjugal kindness and on breach of this condition, the right to remedy for former injuries revives.\u201d <em>Cullotta, </em>193 Md. at 383, 66 A.2d 919; <em>see Stewart v.

A violation of the implied conditions of condonation, may revive a previously condoned ground for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Condonation is not an absolute bar to a divorce on the ground of adultery. F.L. \u00a7 7-103(d) provides: \u201cCondonation is not an absolute bar to a decree of an absolute divorce on the ground of adultery, but is a factor to be considered by the court in determining whether the divorce should be decreed.\u201d To overcome condonation, the condoning party has the burden of showing \u201csubsequent conduct sufficiently serious to effect a revival of the offense condoned.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>225 Md. at 286, 170 A.2d 195. <em>See, e.g., Dorsey, 245 </em>Md. at 704, 227 A.2d 617 (husband revived offense of adultery by continuing adultery); <em>Cullotta, </em>193 Md. at 383, 66 A.2d 919 (husband who had previously assaulted his wife revived the offense by buying presents for another woman, slapping the wife in the face in front of their neighbors, and locking her out of their home); <em>Lissy, </em>180 Md. 689, 23 A.2d 39 (husband\u2019s conduct in visiting female friend after his reconciliation with wife did not constitute cause for divorce); <em>Hilbert v. Hilbert, </em>168 Md. 364, 373, 177 A. 914 (1935) (husband who had previously physically abused his wife revived the offenses by a lack of conjugal kindness as evidenced by his \u201cabuse, threats, his throwing things at her, intoxication, and tirades of abuse----\u201d); <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>93 Md. 298, 48 A. 833 (1901) (husband who had committed adultery revived the offense by committing cruelty).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Appellant admitted in his answer that he had committed adultery; appellee\u2019s subsequent condonation was undisputed. Although the court properly found that appellee condoned the adultery, we agree that the court erred in concluding that the condonation necessarily barred a divorce on that ground. Nevertheless, we cannot grant a divorce on that basis. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>for the trial judge to determine, as a factual matter, whether a divorce on the ground of adultery is warranted, within the meaning of F.L. \u00a7 7-103(d). Thus, we shall remand to the circuit court for a reconsideration of the adultery ground, in accordance with F.L. \u00a7 7-103(d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On remand, if appellee chooses to pursue the adultery claim, the court should determine whether, following the condonation, appellant breached the implied conditions of condonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In light of our remand, we shall briefly comment on appel-lee\u2019s argument that appellant breached the express conditions that appellee allegedly attached to the condonation. We have found no authority to support appellee\u2019s assertion that the condoning spouse may attach <em>express conditions </em>to the condo-nation which, if breached by the offending spouse, may revive the original ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Appellee relies upon <em>Merriken v. Merriken, </em>87 Md.App. 522, 590 A.2d 566 (1991), to support her argument that specific conditions may be attached to a spouse\u2019s condonation. In our view, <em>Merriken </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In <em>Merriken, </em>the trial court granted the wife an absolute divorce on the ground of constructive desertion. Evidence in the case indicated that the husband had been physically abusive to the wife for nearly ten years before the separation, and that on the day the couple separated, he had pushed her out of the house in the middle of a snowstorm. We did not consider that a brief vacation, during which the couple cohabited, constituted condonation of the husband\u2019s prior offensive behavior. Even if the wife did condone the conduct, however, we said that the wife\u2019s \u201coriginal grievances [were] immediately revived\u201d by the husband\u2019s offensive conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 590 A.2d 566. We noted that the wife \u201chad conditioned reconciliation on [the husband\u2019s] doing something about his drinking; she was afraid of him when he was drunk because he became violent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 590 A.2d 566. We went on to point out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that the husband continued to drink, which caused his violent behavior, even though that was \u201canother of [the wife\u2019s] reasons for leaving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further noted that, subsequent to the condonation, the husband had grabbed his wife\u2019s breast on a public street, while calling her an epithet, that he had begun an intimate relationship with another woman, and that he had failed to complete a psychotherapy program. Thus, there were numerous actions by the husband that amounted to a breach of the condition of showing conjugal kindness, independent of any express conditions of condonation made by the wife. Further, the wife\u2019s condition that her husband not behave violently toward her can be seen as an element inherent in the concept of conjugal kindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">III. Contempt Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Appellant claims that the trial court improperly refused to accept evidence concerning his ability to pay the purge provision. While appellant concedes that he has paid the purge provision, he argues that, because a second petition is pending, we should instruct the trial court as to the proper procedure to follow in determining a purge provision. Appellee counters that appellant never offered any evidence for the court\u2019s review, even though the court gave him the opportunity to do so. She also argues that the issue concerning the contempt is moot, because appellant has paid the purge provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the claim is not moot, it is nonetheless without merit. Appellant correctly states that the trial court must afford a contemner the opportunity to show that he is unable to satisfy the purge provision. <em>See Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 464 A.2d 228 (1983); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>241 Md. 416, 216 A.2d 914 (1966). Appellant had the burden of showing that he could not do so. <em>McDaniel v. McDaniel, </em>256 Md. 684, 262 A.2d 52 (1970). The hearing transcript clearly shows, however, that appellant never offered for admission the evidence he now claims the court improperly declined to hear. The trial court simply had no opportunity either to admit or preclude the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>As we see it, the court\u2019s comments expressing disbelief that appellant could not pay the purge, based on the trial proceedings that had occurred five months earlier, did not preclude appellant from offering evidence as to his then present ability to pay. To the contrary, after appellant expressed concern about having a lengthy hearing, the court stated to appellant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">We can have as lengthy a hearing as you want to have.... It\u2019s okay with me. You know, ... its no threat to me that we can have a very lengthy hearing. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Although the court never expressly asked appellant if he had any additional evidence to produce concerning his ability to pay, neither did the court inform appellant that he did not have the opportunity to present evidence, or refuse to receive evidence offered by appellant. Thus, we find appellant\u2019s claim of error unfounded.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED AS TO DIVORCE ON THE GROUND OF ONE YEAR VOLUNTARY SEPARATION.
