The arguments are: 1) that under Article III, section 40 of the Maryland Constitution, a property owner has a constitutional right to a twelve-person jury in a condemnation proceeding; and 2) if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that it would be constitutionally permissible for the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Assembly to pass a statute allowing a jury of less than twelve to decide condemnation cases, section 8-306 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code Annotated (1995 Repl.Vol.), which allows a six-person jury in civil actions, does not apply to a condemnation proceeding because a condemnation proceeding is not a \u201ccivil action.\u201d We hold that Article III, section 40, of the Maryland Constitution does not require a twelve-person jury in an eminent domain case. We also hold that a condemnation proceeding is a \u201ccivil action\u201d within the meaning of section 8-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">On July 1, 1994, the State Roads Commission of the State Highway Commission, appellee, filed a quick-take petition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to take possession of property owned by Wesley and Wona Bryan, appellants. The land was needed for the widening of New Hampshire Avenue. A formal Condemnation Petition was filed by the State on February 23, 1995, in which the State sought to take a 1,866 square foot strip of appellants\u2019 land in fee simple, together with another 653 square feet for a revertible easement during the construction period.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Trial commenced on July 15, 1996. Counsel for the appellants, during <em>voir dire, </em>notified the trial judge (Chapin, J.) that appellants took the position that they were entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>twelve-person jury. The trial judge disagreed, citing section 8-306 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which states: \u201cIn a civil action in which a jury trial is permitted, the jury shall consist of 6 jurors.\u201d Prior to the jury being sworn, the trial judge asked the parties if they were satisfied with the jury. Appellants\u2019 counsel advised the trial judge that he was dissatisfied due to the fact that the court had rejected his contention that his clients were entitled to a twelve-person jury. A six-person jury awarded appellants $12,800 in damages due to the taking of their land. Disappointed with the amount of the award, appellants noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A. Article III, Section 40 of the Maryland Constitution Article III, section 40, of the Maryland Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">The General Assembly shall enact no Law authorizing private property to be taken for public use, without just compensation, as agreed upon between the parties, or awarded by a Jury, being first paid or tendered to the party entitled to such compensation.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Appellants contend that section 40 requires a jury of twelve persons in all eminent domain proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The only support offered by appellants for this contention is language contained in the case of <em>Baltimore Belt Railroad Co. v. Baltzell, 75 </em>Md. 94, 108, 23 A. 74 (1891). When <em>Baltzell </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>decided, common law juries in most counties sat for only two jury terms per year, each about six months apart. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 23 A. 74. These juries sat for only one term of court and thereafter persons who wanted jury trials had to wait until the next court term. <em>Id. </em>In an apparent attempt to avoid such delays, the Maryland Legislature enacted a statute (Article 23, section 167) that, in certain circumstances, provided for sheriffs juries in condemnation cases. The statute allowed the owner of property to apply to a justice of the peace to issue a warrant to the sheriff, requiring him to summons a jury</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aih-dedup-0\">of twenty qualified to act as jurors under the laws of the State, to meet on the premises on a day named in the warrant, and from the panel thus selected, the [condemnor] and the owner, may each strike off four persons and the remaining twelve shall act as \u201cthe jury of the inquest of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 98, 23 A. 74. Under the statute then in effect, the sheriffs jury was required to \u201creduce their inquisition to writing\u201d; the inquisition was then returned by the sheriff to \u201cbe confirmed by the court at its next session, unless cause to the contrary be shown.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In <em>Baltzell, </em>the Court was asked to determine whether the Legislature had the power to mandate that compensation was to be determined in a condemnation case by a special jury summoned upon a sheriffs warrant and not by a common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>jury. <em>Id. </em>at 106, 23 A. 74. The court held that the Constitution left to the Legislature to \u201cprovide whether such assessment shall be made by a common law jury or by a jury summoned by warrant.... \u201d In reaching this conclusion, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">[W]e can hardly suppose framers of the Constitution meant to delay and embarrass the construction of railroads and other public improvements, by requiring compensation to be awarded in court by a common law jury. At least, if such had been the intention ... it is but fair to presume this intention would have been declared in plain and explicit terms. <em>What they did mean, was to provide in the first place that the owner should have the right or privilege of a jury of twelve men in determining what compensation was to be paid, and in the next, that he should not be deprived of his property till such compensation has been paid. And such has been the uniform construction of this clause of the Constitution from the time of its adoption till the present.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"apq-dedup-1\"><em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 23 A. 74 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Appellants, relying solely on the emphasized portion of the above quote, contend that Article III, section 40, was \u201clong ago construed to require a jury of twelve persons.\u201d Appellants ignore the fact that the Court of Appeals was not asked in <em>Baltzell </em>to determine the proper number of jurors in a condemnation case. Thus, the <em>Baltzell </em>Court\u2019s statement that a property owner is entitled to a jury of \u201ctwelve men\u201d was clearly dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Unlike holdings, statements of dicta are remarks \u201cby the way\u201d including any statement of the law enunciated by the court merely by way of \u201cillustration, argument, analogy or suggestion.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 541 (4th ed.1968). As explained by Judge Moylan, writing for this Court in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>106 Md.App. 24, 36-39, 664 A.2d 1 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 502, 667 A.2d 342, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>U.S.,-U.S.-, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">The precedential weight of a holding is predicated in large measure on its status as the <em>deliberate and considered </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>judgment </em>of an entire collegiate court, including the opinion writer, on the issue before it that must be decided.... A holding, therefore, has earned the authoritative weight we give it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">Well considered <em>dicta, </em>of course, is sometimes very good and, therefore, of significant persuasive weight. That is a far cry, however, from giving persuasive weight to every hurried word that may appear in the course of an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\"><em>[Sjtare decisis </em>is ill served if readers hang slavishly on every casual or hurried word....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The statement in <em>Baltzell </em>relied upon by appellants is manifestly of the \u201churried word\u201d variety.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The Court of Appeals has directed inferior courts to \u201cturn to the federal case law for guidance in defining the scope of the right to jury trial in Maryland.\u201d <em>Higgins v. Barnes, </em>310 Md. 532, 543, 530 A.2d 724 (1987); <em>Mattingly v. Mattingly, </em>92 Md.App. 248, 607 A.2d 575 (1992). In <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970) and <em>Colgrove v. Battin, </em>413 U.S. 149, 93 S.Ct. 2448, 37 L.Ed.2d 522 (1973), the Supreme Court tackled issues similar to the one at hand: Whether a twelve-person jury is required, respectively, under the Sixth and Seventh Amendments. Like Article III, section 40 of the Maryland Constitution, neither the Sixth nor the Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution, which respectively guarantee the right to a jury trial in criminal cases and most common law civil suits, specify the number of jurors required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Williams, </em>399 U.S. at 102, 90 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>1907, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not require a jury of twelve for a criminal defendant even though at common law a jury consisted of twelve jurors. The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">the fact that a common law jury was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance \u201cexcept to mystics.\u201d [citation omitted]. To read the Sixth Amendment as forever codifying a feature so incidental to the real purpose of the Amendment is to ascribe a blind formalism to the Framers which would require considerably more evidence than we have been able to discover in the history and language of the Constitution....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In <em>Colgrove, </em>413 U.S. at 157, 93 S.Ct. at 2453, the Court held that the presence of twelve members on a jury is not a \u201csubstantive aspect\u201d of the right to trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment. The Court acknowledged that earlier decisions of the Court, such as <em>Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, </em>174 U.S. 1, 19 S.Ct. 580, 43 L.Ed. 873 (1899), made the statement that \u201c \u2018trial by jury\u2019 means \u2018a trial by a jury of 12,\u2019 \u201d but explained that those statements were \u201cclearly dictum and not a decision upon a question presented or litigated.\u201d <em>Colgrove, </em>413 U.S. at 157, 93 S.Ct. at 2453. In <em>Colgrove, </em>the Court also pointed out that \u201cjuries of less than 12 were common in this country throughout colonial times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Article III, section 40, does not contain language incorporating any of the historical features of juries in condemnation proceedings or indicating that a specific number of jurors is required. Likewise, the Debates and Proceedings of the 1851 Maryland Reform Convention to Revise the State Constitution, at which the current form of Article III, section 40, was first adopted, also provide no evidence of any intent by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Convention to dictate the number of jurors required in a condemnation proceeding. 2 <em>Debates and Proceedings of the Maryland Reform Convention </em>766, 784 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We, therefore, conclude that Article III, section 40 of the Maryland Constitution does not require a twelve-person jury in condemnation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">B. Section 8-306 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">While appellants acknowledge that section 8-306 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (hereinafter section 3-306) mandates a jury of only six persons \u201c[i]n a civil action in which a jury trial is permitted,\u201d they contend that this section does not apply to eminent domain proceedings because (allegedly) a condemnation proceeding is not a \u201ccivil action.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In <em>Unnamed Physician v. Commission on Medical Discipline of Maryland, </em>285 Md. 1, 7, 400 A.2d 396, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 868, 100 S.Ct. 142, 62 L.Ed.2d 92 (1979), the Court of Appeals, in a case of first impression, interpreted the meaning of the term \u201ccivil action.\u201d The issue before the Court was whether a proceeding before the Commission on Medical Discipline of Maryland is a civil action within the meaning of Article 43, section 134A (d) of the Maryland Code (1957, 1978 Cum. Supp.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Section 134A (d) provided that the proceedings and files of a medical review committee are \u201cneither discoverable nor admissible into evidence in any civil action arising out of matters\u201d under review by the medical review committee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 4, 400 A.2d 396. In resolving this issue, the Court employed the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>\u201ccivil action\u201d set forth by <em>Poe\u2019s Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 46 (H. Sachs ed., 6th ed.1970) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">[a] civil action may be defined to be a proceeding instituted in a court of law for the purpose of obtaining redress for a grievance in the shape of a judgment by the court. \u201cAction\u201d includes all the steps by which a party seeks to enforce any right in a court of law or equity and includes <em>an appeal taken to a court of </em>record from the final decision of an inferior court <em>or administrative body where such appeal is authorized by </em>statute. \u201cAction\u201d does not include a criminal proceeding.... Until defined by the Maryland Rules, the word \u201caction\u201d was inapplicable to suits pending in equity, the definition of the word being limited to those matters pending only before the law courts, [emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\"><em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 8, 400 A.2d 396. The Court, after acknowledging that \u201cthere are many sources which have attempted to explain the meaning of the term,\u201d quoted Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 311-12 (4th rev. ed.1968), which defines a civil action as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">[a]n action wherein an issue is presented for trial formed by averments of complaint and denials of answer or replication to new matter ..., an adversary proceeding for declaration enforcement or protection of a right, or redress, or prevention of a wrong.... Every action other than a criminal action, [citations omitted].[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auq-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 7, 400 A.2d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Using those definitions, the Court in <em>Unnamed Physician </em>held that \u201cas a fundamental principle a civil action is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>adversary proceeding before a court of law; judicial review of the decision of an administrative agency is a civil action; a proceeding before the Commission [on Medical Discipline of Maryland] is not a civil action unless the Legislature has clearly manifested an intention that it should be.\u201d <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 9-10, 400 A.2d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Applying the definitions used in the <em>Unnamed Physician </em>case to the issue before us, it is clear that a \u201ccondemnation proceeding\u201d falls within the ambit of the term \u201ccivil action.\u201d It is a non-criminal adversary proceeding in a court of law that protects a landowner\u2019s private property right by providing redress, in the form of compensation, when the state exercises its power of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Appellants, citing <em>Bouton v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>288 Md. 305, 309, 418 A.2d 1168 (1980), argue that condemnation proceedings have never been considered \u201cordinary suits at law, but have always been special proceedings brought pursuant to the power of eminent domain.\u201d \u201c[A] proceeding is special where the law confers a right and authorizes a special application to the court to enforce it.\u201d 1A C.J.S. <em>Actions </em>\u00a7 67, at 458 (1985). In <em>Bouton, </em>288 Md. at 306, 418 A.2d 1168, the Court of Appeals addressed the issue of whether a question of law was improperly submitted to the jury in a condemnation case. In its opinion, the Court explained the origins of condemnation proceedings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">At common law there was no right to an ordinary jury trial in condemnation cases, even on the issue of damages. 1 <em>Nichols\u2019 The Law of Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 4.105[1] (rev.3d ed.1973). Condemnation proceedings were not ordinary suits at law. Rather, they were special proceedings, lacking the characteristics of ordinary trials, brought pursuant to the power of eminent domain, a power derived from the sovereignty of the state. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 309, 418 A.2d 1168. Although <em>Bouton </em>states that condemnation proceedings were \u201cspecial,\u201d neither <em>Bouton </em>nor any other Maryland case stands for the proposition that condemnation proceedings are not \u201ccivil actions.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Applying the definition of \u201ccivil action\u201d used in the <em>Unnamed Physician </em>case, we conclude that the mere fact that a condemnation proceeding is \u201cspecial\u201d does not mean that the proceeding cannot be a \u201ccivil action\u201d as well.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>1A C.J.S. <em>Actions </em>\u00a7 67, at 457 (the term \u201caction\u201d generally includes a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Our conclusion is supported by the legislative history of section 8-306. That section was originally introduced at the 1992 legislative session of the General Assembly as Senate Bill 263 and House Bill 319. The Senate bill was signed by the Governor and became effective October 1, 1992, as chapter 85 of the Acts of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The floor report for Senate Bill 263 indicates that the Legislature, in specifying that six-person juries should serve in all \u201ccivil actions,\u201d intended to promote \u201cjudicial economy and efficiency\u201d by saving local governments between \u201ctwenty and thirty percent\u201d in jury costs. S.B. 263, Floor Rep., 1992 General Assembly of Maryland (1992) [hereinafter Floor Report]. In the floor report, it is said, \u201cTestimony indicated that the vast majority of states now allow 6-person juries in civil proceedings and misdemeanor trials.\u201d This at least suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>that the Legislature intended to restrict the number of jurors to six in all non-criminal proceedings when the parties have a right to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Any interpretation of the statute allowing for twelve-person juries in condemnation cases and six-member juries in all other non-criminal cases when jury trials are permitted would lead to results that we believe to be both illogical and inconsistent with the legislative purpose of curbing costs and promoting judicial efficiency. <em>Cf. Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 517, 525 A.2d 628 (1987) (considering statute in light of purpose and objective, Court of Appeals adopted construction \u201ccomporting] with common sense and avoiding] illogical or absurd results\u201d). If we were to apply appellants\u2019 reasoning, the jury in highly complex mass tort actions, such as the recent Baltimore City asbestos case considered in <em>ACandS, Inc. v. Godwin, </em>340 Md. 334, 667 A.2d 116 (1995), which involved over eight thousand plaintiffs, would be limited to six persons while a landowner in a simple condemnation proceeding, such as the one <em>sub judice, </em>would be entitled to a jury of twelve. Appellants fail to provide any explanation, and we can think of none, as to why the General Assembly could possibly have intended to make such a distinction when its professed goal was to curb costs and promote judicial efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">.

Appellants\u2019 counsel argues that amendment of Article III, section 40, could not \u201caris[e] by implication from the amendment of Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights,\u201d which was approved in 1992 by voter referendum. Because no such amendment to Article III, section 40, was passed, appellants argue that \"Article III, [s]ec1ion 40 remains unamended, and continues to contemplate and require a twelve[-]person jury in eminent domain proceedings.\u201d We need not address this argument because, by failing to present it in their initial brief, appellants\u2019 have waived the argument on appeal. Md. Rule 8-504(a)(5); <em>Kimbrough v. Giant Food, Inc., 26 </em>Md.App. 640, 654, 339 A.2d 688 (1975); <em>see </em>also <em>Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">If this argument were properly before us, we would hold that it has no merit. Article III, section 40, was not amended by implication. Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights, before it was amended in 1992, provided, in pertinent part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">That the Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England, and the trial by Jury, according to the course of that Law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed on the Fourth day of July, seventeen hundred and seventy-six; and which, by experience, have been found applicable to their local and other circumstances, and have been introduced, used and practiced by the Courts of Law or Equity....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8_D\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In 1992, Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights was amended by adding subsections (b) and (c) which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">(b) The parties to any civil proceeding in which the right to a jury trial is preserved are entitled to a trial by jury of at least <em>6 </em>jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">(c) That notwithstanding the Common Law of England, nothing in this Constitution prohibits trial by jury of less than 12 jurors in any civil proceeding in which the right to a juiy trial is preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights is inapplicable to condemnation proceedings because, as demonstrated in Part A of this opinion, at common law there was no right to a common law jury in condemnation proceedings. There was no need to amend Article III, section 40, because, as discussed, <em>supra, </em>Article III, section 40, neither specifies the number of jurors required nor contains any language incorporating any of the historical features of juries in condemnation proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">.
