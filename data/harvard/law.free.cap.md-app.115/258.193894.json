This is an issue of first impression, which we answer in the negative, based on our interpretation of the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d as used in Maryland Code Annotated, Labor and Employment section 8-1003 (Supp.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Barbara Hider and Virginia White (appellants), employees of the North Arundel Nursing &amp; Convalescent Center, Inc. (the Nursing Home), were fired on October 7, 1994, for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>incident that occurred at the Nursing Home on October 6, 1994. Ms. Hider, a registered nurse, had worked as Assistant Director of Nursing at the Nursing Home for five years prior to her discharge. Ms. White, a licensed practical nurse, had been a nursing supervisor for over two years before her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The Office of Unemployment Insurance of the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development (DEED) conducted a fact-finding hearing to determine whether appellants were separated from their employment for a \u201cdisqualifying reason\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Code Annotated, Labor and Employment sections 8-1001 to 8-1003 (Supp.1996). The Office of Unemployment Insurance, in separate notices dated Nov. 15, 1994, concluded: \u201cInsufficient information has been presented to show misconduct in connection with the work. As a result the circumstances surrounding the separation do not warrant a disqualification under section 8-1002 or 8-1003 of the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The Nursing Home appealed the decisions and a hearing was held on January 23 and January 24, 1995, before the Appeals Division of DEED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a written decision dated February 3, 1995, Hearing Examiner Kevin M. O\u2019Neill found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">The claimants were terminated by the employer on or about October 7, 1994, for failing to respond to an emergency situation. The claimants presented numerous witnesses and documentation to support a finding that <em>they were not aware </em>of an emergency situation with a specific patient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">(Emphasis added.) He concluded that the claimants \u201capparently misunderstood the gravity of the situation\u201d and \u201cused poor judgment.\u201d He held that their \u201cmisjudgment in this ... case amounts to misconduct\u201d connected with employment within the meaning of Labor and Employment section 8-1003. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Accordingly, appellants were denied unemployment insurance benefits for ten weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The Board of Appeals of DEED<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (the Board), in separate but identical decisions, dated April 3, 1995, adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of Hearing Examiner O\u2019Neill.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">On April 20, 1995, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, appellants filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the Board\u2019s decision. Both the Nursing Home and DEED notified the circuit court of their intent to participate in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Nursing Home filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, on November 20,1995, alleging that appellants failed to either file a timely memorandum pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-207(a) or to timely seek a filing extension. On December 8, 1995, Judge Robert H. Heller heard arguments on the Nursing Home\u2019s motion to dismiss. Judge Heller denied the motion but entered a judgment of $500 against appellants for a portion of the Nursing Home\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The circuit court (Goudy, J., presiding), after hearing arguments, affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Appellants filed a timely appeal raising three issues,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which we have rephrased and reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">I. Whether appellants were discharged from the Nursing Home for the same behavior that the Board found to be misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">II. Whether the Board erred as a matter of law by concluding that appellants\u2019 misjudgment amounted to miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>duct within the meaning of section 8-1003 of the Labor and Employment Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in entering a judgment of $500 against appellants to reimburse the Nursing Home for certain attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The incident leading up to the discharge of Ms. White and Ms. Hider involved the care of a sixty-nine year old chronically ill patient (the patient) at the Nursing Home, on October 6, 1994. In the words of his physician, the patient was a \u201cvery seriously ill gentleman,\u201d who had been \u201cin and out of the hospital many, many times during his admission\u201d at the Nursing Home. The patient had been the victim of several heart attacks and suffered from recurrent pneumonia. He often moaned and got agitated and, to calm him, Ativan and Tylenol were prescribed. His mental faculties were adversely affected by his heart ailment, and as of October 6, 1994, the patient was getting progressively sicker and weaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">After the incident in question, the patient was transferred from the Nursing Home to North Arundel Hospital for \u201cevaluation.\u201d A \u201ctransfer summary\u201d by North Arundel Hospital noted that the patient was \u201cdiaphoretic\u201d (profusely sweating) and was \u201cagitated and chanting.\u201d The patient was admitted to the hospital to rule out a \u201ccardiac event.\u201d He remained in the hospital for two weeks and was discharged with a diagnosis of pneumonia in both lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The Multi-Purpose Room Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">A considerable portion of the testimony presented to the Hearing Officer was devoted to events that allegedly took place in the multi-purpose room at the Nursing Home on October 6,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">According to witnesses testifying on behalf of the Nursing Home, at approximately 12:30 p.m. on that date, Sandra Osborne, Lorraine Hill, Melinda Miller, Charlene Roberto, and appellants were present in the multi-purpose room. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Nursing Home\u2019s witnesses testified that while Ms. White was in the room she was paged by Robin Anderson, LPN, the nurse in charge of the patient. Ms. Osborne remembered that Ms. White answered the page and was advised of the patient\u2019s grave condition; Ms. White then instructed Ms. Anderson to call the patient\u2019s physician for input. Several witnesses testified that after finishing the conversation, Ms. White asked if anyone had heard the patient complain about \u201chis heart hurting.\u201d According to Ms. Osborne, the following events then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">Melinda Miller [LPN] stated she had never heard him make a statement like that, it sounded serious. Ms. Osborne:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">And was there any reaction from anyone? [Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asc\">They discussed it back and forth\u2014 Ms. Osborne:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">And then what happened? [Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aja-dedup-0\">Barbara Hider was sitting in a chair. She was writing out a care plan, and they [White and Hider] got up to leave out of the multipurpose room. Barbara Hider said, \u201cWhat about the food in the car?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Osborne:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">[Counsel]: And what did Ms. White say, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">Ms. Osborne: She said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll get the food out of the car, and then we\u2019ll dial 911 when we get back.\u201d[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">Ms. Osborne remembered that appellants were laughing when they left the multi-purpose room. The Nursing Home\u2019s witnesses also testified that after appellants left the room, Ms. Miller also left to check on the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">In contrast, both Ms. White and Ms. Hider testified that they neither heard nor answered a page from Ms. Anderson. Ms. Anderson, who testified on behalf of appellants, partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>corroborated their version of the events. She testified that the patient\u2019s family had told her that he was moaning, \u201cMy heart, my heart.\u201d She paged Ms. White because she \u201cwasn\u2019t quite sure what to do, because he [the patient] does this so often.\u201d Ms. Anderson further testified that someone answered her page, and that, although she did not recognize the voice, at the time she \u201cassumed\u201d it was Ms. \"White. She testified that she was not sure if she, in fact, spoke with Ms. \"White, \u201cbecause the person didn\u2019t identify\u201d herself and because, minutes later, when she met Ms. \"White and Ms. Hider in the hallway, Ms. White \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what I was talking about.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The Hearing Examiner did not credit the testimony of the Nursing Home\u2019s witnesses regarding the events in the multipurpose room:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">Much testimony was produced with regard to activities that occurred in the morning in the multi-purpose room. This Hearing Examiner does not find as fact that either part[y] heard a page in that multi-purpose room. It is clear that both claimants spoke to Ms. Anderson prior to exiting the building____ Ms. Anderson had made a page minutes prior believing that she had communicated with Ms. \"White. Ms. Anderson may not have communicated with Ms. White on a prior page.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The Hallway Conversation</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Although the Hearing Examiner determined that neither Ms. Hider nor Ms. White were informed of the patient\u2019s condition as a result of the page to the multi-purpose room, he concluded that they were informed of Ms. Anderson\u2019s concern for the patient\u2019s condition in a hallway conversation prior to their exit from the building. The testimony of Ms. Hider, Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>White, and Ms. Anderson confirms that such a conversation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Ms. Anderson testified that, after she explained the patient\u2019s condition to the person answering her page, she was told to call the doctor. Dr. O\u2019Chaney, the patient\u2019s regular physician, testified that when Ms. Anderson called him she said that the patient was \u201cagitated\u201d and moaning \u201cMy heart, my heart.\u201d When Dr. O\u2019Chaney asked Ms. Anderson if she thought the patient was having chest pains, she replied that \u201cit\u2019s hard to tell ... because he\u2019s acting the same as he does every day.\u201d Dr. O\u2019Chaney understood her problem because the patient was \u201ca difficult patient to assess most of the time, because of his mental condition.\u201d Ms. Anderson asked Dr. O\u2019Chaney if she could \u201csend him out\u201d via 911.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. O\u2019Chaney instructed her to give the patient Ativan and Tylenol and to \u201cwait and watch what happens.\u201d From the information that Nurse Anderson conveyed to Dr. O\u2019Chaney, he did not think that it was an emergency situation, and thus, he told her that she should not transfer the patient to a hospital via 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">After speaking with Dr. O\u2019Chaney, Ms. Anderson was still concerned about the patient because she \u201creally felt that he should be sent out\u201d to be evaluated, \u201ceven if he wasn\u2019t having chest pains.\u201d Ms. Anderson decided to talk to Ms. White \u201cagain.\u201d As she got up from her desk, she saw Ms. White and Ms. Hider walking down the hall. She told both of them that she had spoken with Dr. O\u2019Chaney and that he didn\u2019t want the patient sent to the hospital. According to Ms. Anderson, Ms. White \u201cdidn\u2019t act like she quite understood what I was talking about\u201d and she asked questions such as \u201cwhy did you call the doctor\u201d and \u201cwhat is [the patient] doing.\u201d During the conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sation, Ms. Anderson informed appellants that she had not yet taken the patient\u2019s vital signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Ms. White and Ms. Hider testified that they instructed Ms. Anderson to get the patient\u2019s vital signs and assess his condition. They advised her that they would return shortly. The two then left the building and went to the parking lot to get food for an employee\u2019s bridal shower. Ms. Anderson never evaluated the patient, however, because on her way to his room Ms. Miller waved to her and told her, \u201cWe\u2019re sending him out.\u201d Ms. Miller explained that she had been in the patient\u2019s room, that he was sweating profusely with a rapid pulse rate of 104, and that she had called 911.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">At the hearing, Ms. Anderson admitted that, while in the hallway, she did not tell Ms. Hider and Ms. White that the patient was sweating profusely because \u201che wasn\u2019t real dia-phoretic when I saw him.\u201d Ms. White testified that Ms. Anderson did not request her or Ms. Hider\u2019s. assistance, nor did she indicate that there was an emergency: \u201c[S]he was just giving me a general update like the other nurses do periodically through the day.\u201d Ms. Anderson admitted that she did not use the word \u201cemergency\u201d when speaking to Ms. Hider and Ms. White. When Ms. Anderson was asked whether, during the hallway conversation, she indicated in any way to appellants that it was an emergency, she replied somewhat ambiguously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Yes, I did, in the way that I was concerned that he had said that he was having chest pains. And that ... I thought that he should be evaluated, sent out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Regarding the hallway conversation, the Hearing Examiner found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">The charge nurse, Robin Anderson, notified her Supervisor, Ms. White and the Assistant Director of Nursing, Ms. Hider, that she had a great concern for a specific patient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Ms. Anderson informed them that she had called the doctor with regard to her concern for the patient. Ms. Anderson was seeking advice and opinion from her two supervisors, because of her concern for a patient. Ms. Anderson testified credibly that she believed it was an emergency situation, but did not use these words. The claimant, [] Ms. White, and Ms. Hider did not follow Ms. Anderson back to the patient\u2019s room. They proceeded to the parking lot to receive personal items which were to be used later during the day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Decision to Terminate</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Sandra Mennerick, Administrator of the Nursing Home, investigated the events of October 6, 1994, and made the decision to terminate Ms. Hider and Ms. White. She testified that, on October 6, she was informed of the incident in the multi-purpose room by Sandra Osborne. On October 7, 1994, she spoke with Marcy Ely, Nursing Director, who agreed to conduct an investigation of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">According to Ms. Mennerick, Ms. Ely spoke with appellants, and they both denied being in the multi-purpose room.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result, both Ms. Ely and Ms. Mennerick determined that \u201csomeone\u2019s lying.\u201d To clarify the matter, Ms. Ely and Ms. Mennerick called Lorraine Hill, Volunteer Supervisor, into Ms. Mennerick\u2019s office and asked her to describe what had happened in the multi-purpose room. Ms. Hill confirmed Ms. Miller\u2019s and Ms. Osborne\u2019s versions of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">As a result of their investigation, Ms. Ely and Ms. Menner-ick decided that Ms. Hider and Ms. White must be terminated immediately.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. Mennerick called Ms. Hider and Ms. White into her office, and the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Ms. Mennerick: The four of us [Mennerick, Ely, White <em>&amp; </em>Hider] started to discuss the situation. ... Barbara [Hider] did most of the talking, and Barbara was emphatic that she was not in the room, she had never been in the room the entire day, and was not in there. And I said to her, \u201cWell, I saw you in there myself. I saw you earlier in there at the back table.\u201d And she said, \u201cI was never in there. I wasn\u2019t in there the entire day. I was never in the room. I know nothing about this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">[Counsel]: So how did the conversation proceed after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">Ms. Mennerick: So the four of us, and I don\u2019t remember the exact words or in exactly what order people were talking, except that Marcy [Ely] reiterated again her concern about [the patient] that they had left the building; about the statement about his heart hurting, their denying that they knew anything about that, that they never heard him say anything like that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">[Counsel]: Who told them that they were being terminated?SUMs. Mennerick: I did. I told them <em>based on the information that was presented to me, </em>that I felt that they were not [ ] credible people, and that under those circumstances that they failed to respond to a patient that was in distress. That that was extremely against any of our policies, and that I didn\u2019t want them working there any longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">(Emphasis added.) Prior to terminating Ms. Hider and Ms. White, Ms. Mennerick did not speak with Ms. Anderson, nor did she have knowledge of Ms. Anderson\u2019s conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>appellants in the hallway prior to their exit from the building.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In response to a form titled \u201cRequest for Separation Information\u201d from the Office of Unemployment Insurance of the DEED, Ms. Mennerick, in her capacity as Administrator of the Nursing Home, gave the following reason for Ms. White\u2019s and Ms. Hider\u2019s discharges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">10/6/94 Failed to respond to a request for assistance regarding patient\u2019s health status and during the situation left the building to get personal items from [] car. This resident was sent out 911 <em>&amp; </em>resulted in a myocardial infarction.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Our role in reviewing the decision of an administrative agency \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). Like the circuit court, we must review the administrative decision itself. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691 (1974). Inasmuch as the Board adopted the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, we look to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision in order to determine whether the Board erred in concluding that appellants were discharged for misconduct, within the meaning of Labor and Employment section 8-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The standard of review of unemployment insurance determinations is governed by Labor and Employment section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>8-512(d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under that standard, our review of the Board\u2019s decision is limited to determining: (1) whether the Board \u201capplied the correct principles of law,\u201d <em>Department of Economic and Employment Dev. v. Taylor, </em>108 Md.App. 250, 261, 671 A.2d 523 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>344 Md. 687, 690 A.2d 508 (per curiam); and (2) whether the Board\u2019s factual findings are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). The Board\u2019s decision is reviewed in the light most favorable to the Board, \u201csince decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Board of Education v. Paynter, </em>303 Md. 22, 35-36, 491 A.2d 1186 (1985). We can, however, only affirm the Board\u2019s decision based on its findings and for the reasons presented. <em>Department of Economic Employment Dev. v. Propper, </em>108 Md.App. 595, 607, 673 A.2d 713 (1996) (citing <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>336 Md. at 570, 650 A.2d 226).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u201c[F]indings of fact made by the Board are binding upon the reviewing court, if supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals, Dep\u2019t of Employment and Training v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>72 Md. App. 427, 431, 530 A.2d 763 (1987). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard means that the scope of review is limited to determining \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Department of Economic and Employment Dev. v. Hager, </em>96 Md. App. 362, 369, 625 A.2d 342 (1993) (quoting <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 661-62, 490 A.2d 701 (1985)). In addition, it is the Board\u2019s exclusive province to resolve factual conflicts and draw inferences from the evidence. <em>Paynter, </em>303 Md. at 36, 491 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>1186; <em>Taylor, </em>108 Md.App. at 262, 671 A.2d 523. \u201c \u2018The Court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the right one or whether a different inference would be better supported. The test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 448, 168 A.2d 390 (1961) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In contrast, our review of the Board\u2019s legal conclusions is much broader: When the issue before the agency is one of law, \u201cno deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 443, 624 A.2d 941 (1993); <em>see Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Callahan, </em>105 Md.App. 25, 34, 658 A.2d 1112 (1995) (court may substitute its judgment on the law if agency\u2019s \u201cfactual findings supported by substantial evidence are susceptible of but one legal conclusion, and the agency does not so conclude\u201d). Moreover, if there is an issue of statutory construction, \u201c[s]uch an issue involves a question of law,\u201d and our review of the Board\u2019s interpretation of a statute is expansive. <em>Gray v. Anne Arundel County, </em>73 Md.App. 301, 309, 533 A.2d 1325 (1987) (citing <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Mandel Re-election Comm., </em>280 Md. 575, 579, 374 A.2d 1130 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Analysis of the first and second issues presented by appellants requires us to interpret section 8-1003 of the Labor and Employment Article and to apply well-settled principles of statutory construction. The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent in enacting the statute. <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994). The language of the statute itself is the primary source for determining the intention of the Legislature, <em>Gray, </em>73 Md.App. at 309, 533 A.2d 1325, and we give that language its \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d 448; <em>Harford County v.

The Unemployment Insurance Law is a remedial statute \u201cintended to prevent economic insecurity and to alleviate the consequences of involuntary unemployment and economic distress.\u201d <em>Allen v. Core Target City Youth Program, </em>275 Md. 69, 75, 338 A.2d 237 (1975). Given the remedial nature of the Unemployment Insurance Law, the Court of Appeals has held that such laws are to \u201cbe read liberally in favor of eligibility,\u201d and \u201cdisqualification provisions are to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Sinai Hosp., </em>309 Md. at 40, 522 A.2d 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">I. Whether appellants were discharged from the Nursing Home for the same behavior that the Board found to be misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Labor and Employment section 8-1003 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">(a) <em>Grounds for disqualification. </em>\u2014 An individual who otherwise is eligible to receive benefits is disqualified from receiving benefits <em>if the Secretary finds that unemployment results from discharge </em>or suspension as a disciplinary measure <em>for behavior that the Secretary finds is misconduct </em>in connection with employment but that is not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">(1) aggravated misconduct, under \u00a7 8-1002.1 of this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">(2) gross misconduct, under \u00a7 8-1002 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>(b) <em>Duration of disqualification. </em>\u2014 A disqualification under this section shall</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">(1) begin with the first week for which unemployment is caused by discharge or suspension for misconduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">(2) continue for a total of at least 5 but not more than 10 weeks, as determined by the Secretary, based on the seriousness of the misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">(Emphasis added.) A plain reading of section 8-1003(a) dictates that to disqualify a claimant from receiving benefits, the Secretary is required to find that the employee was discharged \u201cfor behavior\u201d that the Secretary \u201cfinds is misconduct in connection with employment.\u201d In other words, in order to deny unemployment insurance benefits, the Secretary must first focus on the misbehavior of the employee that the employer alleges justified the termination; if the Secretary finds that the employee was not guilty of <em>that </em>misbehavior or that <em>such </em>misbehavior does not constitute misconduct, denial of unemployment benefits is unwarranted. An employee may not be denied benefits based on some action or inaction, that does not constitute the employer\u2019s basis for the discharge. Any contrary reading of the statute would deny due process to unemployment insurance claimants. The most basic requirement of due process \u201cin any adversary proceeding ... is that the person proceeded against be given notice and an adequate opportunity to contest the claim against him.\u201d <em>Burns v. Mayor and City Council of Midland, </em>247 Md. 548, 553, 234 A.2d 162 (1967). To allow the Board to find misconduct for reasons different from those alleged by the employer would deny an employee the opportunity to present adequately his or her claim for benefits before the Board. Aside from the issue of due process, any contrary reading of the statute would also thwart the principle that unemployment insurance statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We agree with appellants that the Nursing Home fired them for \u201clying and not assisting the charge nurse with a patient after an alleged call in the multi-purpose room.\u201d This conclusion is supported by Ms. Mennerick\u2019s testimony, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>with the Nursing Home\u2019s statement in the form titled \u201cRequest for Separation Information.\u201d As previously mentioned, the Hearing Examiner did \u201cnot find as fact that either part[y] heard a page in that multi-purpose room.\u201d Rather, he concluded that <em>after having spoken with Ms. Anderson in the hallway, </em>appellants \u201cused poor judgment\u201d by failing to follow Ms. Anderson to check on the patient\u2019s condition. Inasmuch as the Nursing Home was unaware of the hallway conference at the time of discharge, appellants could not have been discharged for this behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Board erred as a matter of law when, based on different behavior from the behavior for which the Nursing Home discharged appellants, it found that appellants were \u201cdischarged for misconduct\u201d connected with employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II. Whether the Board erred as a matter of law by concluding that appellants\u2019 misjudgment amounted to misconduct within the meaning of Labor and Employment section 8-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Even if we were to find that the Nursing Home did terminate appellants for the same behavior as that found by the Hearing Examiner, the outcome of this case would be the same. Appellants argue that an employee\u2019s behavior must be \u201cdeliberate or intentional\u201d in order to constitute misconduct within the meaning of section 8-1003. Failing to mention aggravated misconduct, the Nursing Home counters that the \u201c[Ljegislature provides for two distinct disciplinary findings\u2014 gross misconduct and simple misconduct,\u201d and that, quoting <em>Employment Sec. Bd. of Md. v. LeCates, </em>218 Md. 202, 208, 145 A.2d 840 (1958), the Legislature \u201cintended to distinguish between \u2018deliberate and wilful misconduct\u2019 and \u2018misconduct\u2019 of a lesser degree.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>To determine the meaning of \u201cmisconduct\u201d in section 8-1003, we must first look at the statutory scheme as a whole. Under the Unemployment Insurance Law, an employee can be disqualified from receiving benefits for varying durations for, <em>inter alia, </em>three forms of misconduct: gross misconduct, aggravated misconduct, and misconduct. While \u201cgross misconduct\u201d and \u201caggravated misconduct\u201d are technically defined in the statute, the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d remains undefined. <em>Allen, </em>275 Md. at 86, 338 A.2d 237.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The term \u201cmisconduct\u201d as used in the Statute, means a transgression of some established rule or policy of the employer, the commission of a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, or a course of wrongful conduct committed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>employee, within the scope of his employment relationship, during hours of employment, or on the employer\u2019s premises[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 132, 314 A.2d 113 (1974). In determining that appellants\u2019 misjudgment amounted to misconduct, the Hearing Examiner professed to use the definition of misconduct as set forth in <em>Rogers. </em>Appellants plainly were <em>not </em>discharged for transgression of some established rule of the employer, for the commission of a forbidden act, or for a course of wrongful conduct. Thus, under the <em>Rogers </em>definition, the only possible reason for the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision is that, evidently, he believed that appellants were guilty of \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The question arises as to whether, under the <em>Rogers </em>definition of misconduct, dereliction must be intentional, and more broadly, whether the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d has an implied intent element. Dereliction of duty is a term that has been generally \u201cinterpreted to mean a willful or fraudulent violation or neglect of any official duty, and not the mere failure to do one particular thing.\u201d 26A C.J.S. <em>Dereliction, </em>at 499 (1956). Thus, using this general interpretation, to find that an employee was guilty of a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d would require a finding of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In <em>Boynton Cab Co. v. Neubeck, </em>237 Wis. 249, 296 N.W. 636, 640 (1941), the Wisconsin Supreme Court defined \u201cmisconduct\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">[CJonduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer\u2019s interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>interests or of the employee\u2019s duties and obligations to his employer. On the other hand, mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, inadvertencies or ordinary negligence in isolated instances, or good-faith errors in judgment or discretion are not to be deemed \u2018misconduct\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkMC\">(Emphasis added.) The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s definition of misconduct has been cited with approval and/or adopted by courts in several jurisdictions. <em>See Hickenbottom v. District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Bd., </em>273 A.2d 475, 477-78 (D.C.1971) (adopting <em>Boynton Cab </em>definition of misconduct as set forth in 48 Am.Jur. <em>Social Security, Unemployment Ins. &amp; Retirement Fund </em>\u00a7 38 (1943)); <em>Wickey v.

Moreover, courts in other jurisdictions have held, under their own unemployment insurance statutes, that misconduct must be intentional, so that a mere error in judgment does not constitute misconduct. <em>See Perry v. Gaddy, </em>48 Ark.App. 128, 891 S.W.2d 73, 74 (1995) (good faith errors in judgment or discretion are not considered misconduct unless of such degree or recurrence as to manifest culpability, wrongful intent, or evil design); <em>Colton v.

Also instructive is the definition of misconduct set forth by <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1150 (4th ed. 1968), which similarly contains an intent requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">A transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction from duty, unlawful behavior, <em>willful in character, </em>improper or wrong behavior; its synonyms are misdemeanor, misdeed, misbehavior, delinquency, impropriety, mismanagement, offense, but not negligence or carelessness. <em>Mandella v.

The term implies ... a wrongful intention, and not a mere error of judgment....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Inasmuch as the Unemployment Insurance Law must be \u201cread liberally in favor of eligibility\u201d and \u201cdisqualification provisions are to be strictly construed,\u201d we do not believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the Legislature intended that workers, who, like the claimants in this case, have contributed into the unemployment insurance fund for many years, would be denied benefits for a mere error of judgment.

He concluded that the two claimants merely used \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d The Board, in adopting the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings, erred as a matter of law in concluding that appellants\u2019 misjudgment amounted to misconduct in connection with work within the meaning of Labor and Employment section 8-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">III. Whether the circuit court erred by entering a judgment of $500 against appellants to reimburse the Nursing Home for certain attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Appellants and Appellee DLLR urge us to vacate the circuit court\u2019s assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against appellants. They contend that such an assessment of fees violates the dictates of Labor and Employment section 8 \u2014 512(a)(3), which prohibits a court from charging fees of any kind to persons who make claims for unemployment insurance benefits. DEED also argues that the circuit court erred in assessing fees against appellants because the fees were incurred due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to mistakes by the clerk\u2019s office and the judge\u2019s staff as well as the Nursing Home\u2019s \u201cfutile motion\u201d to dismiss. In order to address this question, it is necessary to set forth some rather dull details.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">A Motion for Special Admission of Out-of-State Attorney was filed, on May 25, 1995, by Karen Kiefer, attorney of record for appellants, requesting that Frank Hider, a Texas attorney, be admitted to the bar for the limited purpose of participating as co-counsel for appellants. Although the motion was granted on June 12, 1995, the clerk\u2019s office did not docket the order or list Mr. Hider as attorney of record until October 31,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Maryland Rule 7-207 requires a petitioner to file a memorandum within 30 days after the clerk sends notice of the filing of the record. On August 24, 1995, the clerk notified all attorneys of record, except Mr. Hider, that the record of the proceedings had been filed. On October 10, 1995, Mr. Hider wrote to Judge Heller requesting clarification of the briefing schedule he had been sent. He also complained that he had not received notice that the record had been filed. By letter dated October 30,1995, Judge Heller responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">First, there was an oversight on the part of the Clerk\u2019s Office in not notifying you of the filing. Apparently, the Clerk did not note the' Order allowing your appearance. I have to assume that your co-counsel shares information with you that she receives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">Nevertheless, you will have until November 29, 1995 in which to file your Memorandum.... My understanding is that the Attorney General\u2019s Office has indicated that they have no objection to this____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">While the Attorney General\u2019s Office did not object to the extension, due to an oversight, Judge Heller\u2019s staff did not contact the Nursing Home to receive its input. By letter dated November 2, 1995, the Nursing Home objected to the \u201cextension of time\u201d granted to appellants to file their memorandum. The Nursing Home\u2019s counsel expressed his \u201cutter outrage\u201d that appellants, who were represented by local coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sel, had been allowed to miss a filing date without any sanctions. Moreover, he stated that the \u201cfailure to even ascertain our views is even more galling____\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court scheduled a hearing on all open matters and, on November 20, 1995, the Nursing Home filed a motion to dismiss. It alleged that appellants failed to either file a timely memorandum pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-207(a) or to timely seek a filing extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">At a hearing on December 8, 1995, the trial judge observed that although appellants technically were required to file a memorandum by September 24, 1995, as of October 30, 1995, when the court gave appellants a new filing date for their memorandum, the Nursing Home had not objected or filed a motion to dismiss. Judge Heller denied the motion to dismiss but entered a judgment of $500 against appellants to cover some of the Nursing Home\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\"><em>I mil treat this granting of the additional time as the equivalent of a continuance </em>... and, <em>although it does not provide under </em>[ ] the rule of <em>7[-]207, </em>and [ ] <em>although 2[-}508 </em>on a continuance is <em>not directly on point, </em>I\u2019m going to adopt the provisions of the [e] section dealing with costs when the [ ] Court grants a continuance for a reason other than ... \u201clegislative privilege.\u201d And I\u2019m relying upon 2[-]508 and that portion of [s]ub-paragraph [a] that says: \u201c[On] [mjotion of any party or on its own initiative, the [c]ourt may continue a trial, or other proceeding, as justice may require.\u201d And I\u2019m going to look at that as the continuing [of] a proceeding, [ ] proceeding being [defined] under Maryland Rule l[-]202[ (s) ], [as] any part of an[ ] action and, thus ... <em>I\u2019m going to award in favor of North Arundel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Nursing &amp; Convalescent Center against Barbara Hider and Virginia White, </em>costs ... of five hundred dollars....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6n\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Maryland Rule 2-508(a) permits a court, by motion or on its own initiative, to continue a trial or other proceeding as justice may require. When granting a continuance for any reason except legislative privilege, Maryland Rule 2-508(e) allows the court to assess costs and expenses occasioned by the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Judge Heller did not have the right to award attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction in this matter because no rule gave him that right. No sanctions were requested under Maryland Rule 1-341 and Maryland Rule 2-508 is plainly inapplicable. The extension of time for filing a memorandum is not equivalent to a \u201ccontinuance\u201d of a \u201ctrial or other proceeding\u201d under Maryland Rule 2-508. Although the court, in an order dated December 14, 1995, changed the trial to a later date, the Nursing Home agreed to this continuance and did not incur any loss as a result of changing the trial date. Moreover, the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against appellants runs afoul of the prohibition set forth in Labor and Employment section 8-512(a)(3), which prohibits a court from charging \u201can individual who claims benefits a fee in any proceeding under this title.\u201d This provision is consistent with the statute\u2019s general purpose of easing the economic insecurity of the unemployed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>JUDGMENTS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE BOARD OF APPEALS FOR THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER IN FAVOR OF APPELLANTS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\">.

Appellee\u2019s reliance on language from the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>LeCates </em>is misplaced.
