The local Association filed the Petition after the Attorney General denied its \u201cClaim Pursuant to [Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. (S.G.) \u00a7 10-224] for Reimbursement of Expenses, Etc.\u201d (the \u201cClaim\u201d) seeking reimbursement of expenses it incurred responding to a Civil Investigative Demand (the \u201cCID\u201d) issued pursuant to Md. Comm. Law II Code Ann. (C.L.) \u00a7 11-205. It also sought reimbursement for monitoring expenses incurred during the underlying state antitrust investigation of an alleged violation of C.L. \u00a7 <em>11-204</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>We shall affirm the judge\u2019s order dismissing the Petition and all then pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Allegedly at the behest of the Hallmark Card Co., Inc. (\u201cHallmark\u201d), the Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Division (\u201cthe Division\u201d) began an investigation of a 27-31 October 1991 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Baltimore, Maryland convention of the National Association of Retail Druggists (the \u201cnational Association\u201d). The Division apparently attempted to ascertain if certain pharmacists, or trade organizations of pharmacists, cared enough to boycott the very best. During that convention, an exhibit, entitled the \u201cHallmark Hall of Shame\u201d, was established. The purpose of that presentation was to reveal that Hallmark endorsed mail-order prescription plans over retail pharmacies for its employees\u2019 usage in their medical benefits plan. Incongruously, those same pharmacies, the \u201cHall of Shame\u201d insisted, served as the centerpiece of Hallmark\u2019s system of greeting card distribution. The local Association disclaimed substantive connection to the convention or the \u201cHall of Shame\u201d. The local Association maintained that any involvement on its part, limited to certain social events, was due solely to the convention\u2019s Baltimore location.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">On 3 August 1993, the Division sent a letter to the local Association requesting certain documents concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cHall of Shame\u201d. That communique requested compliance with the CID. It seems that the Attorney General for Maryland, and his counterparts in Ohio and Texas, initiated antitrust enforcement investigations. The Maryland investigation was initiated, and a CID was issued pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 11-205. That statute states, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX\">if the Attorney General believes that a person may be in possession, custody, or control of any original or copy of any ... tangible document or recording, wherever situated, which he [or she] believes is relevant to the subject matter of an investigation of a possible violation [of the Maryland Antitrust Act, C.L. \u00a7 11-201 <em>et. seq.], </em>he may serve on the person before the institution of a civil proceeding for the violation a written civil investigative demand [or CID] which requires him to produce the documentary material and permit inspection and copying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In compliance with the CID, the local Association delivered to the Division a notebook of documents and a written denial of involvement in the \u201cHall of Shame\u201d exhibition. A few weeks later, on 4 November 1993, an \u201cuncivil\u201d protracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>stationery battle began. The local Association fired twelve volleys at the Division seeking information and closure of the investigation. The Division returned fire, with seven missiles of its own, refusing to share information regarding the progress or status of the investigation. Finally, the stonewall barriers of the Division tumbled when, on 2 February 1996, the Division returned the notebook of documents to counsel for the local Association.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Recognizing the significance of that action, the local Association confirmed that the investigation was \u201cclosed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">That \u201cclosure\u201d resulted in the inception of the current case. The local Association sought reimbursement for the expenses it incurred during its compliance with, and monitoring of, the CID. That request was made pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 10-224. The relevant portions of that statute are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"Avo\">\u00a7 10-224. Litigation expenses for small businesses and non-profit organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">* * * * <em>* </em>#</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">(c) Reimbursement authorized. \u2014 Subject to the limitations in this section, an agency or court may award to a business or nonprofit organization reimbursement for expenses that the business or nonprofit organization reasonably incurs in connection with a contested case or civil action....</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">(d) Claim required in contested case.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">(1) To qualify for an award under this section when the agency has initiated a contested case, the business or nonprofit organization must make a claim to the agency before taking any appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">(2) The agency shall act on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Appellant filed a claim with the Attorney General for certain expenses it incurred in responding to the CID request and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>attempting to monitor the investigation. The Attorney General denied that claim by stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the CID did not initiate a \u201ccontested case or civil action\u201d within the meaning of S.G. \u00a7 10-224. The local Association filed the Petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that was ultimately dismissed along with all pending motions. It is that dismissal that the local Association now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We shall focus our analysis on four questions raised, at least inferentially, by appellant. We have restructured those issues below to facilitate better our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">I. Under what types of proceedings may a party seek reimbursement under S.G. \u00a7 10-224?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">II. Is the local Association entitled to seek reimbursement under S.G. \u00a7 10-224 for expenses it incurred in a \u201ccontested case\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">III. Is the local Association entitled to seek reimbursement under S.G. \u00a7 10-224 for expenses it incurred in a \u201ccivil action\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">IV. Did the trial court err by dismissing a motion to compel compliance with Md. Rule 7-206 coincident with its dismissal of the Petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">In order to invoke the provisions of S.G. \u00a7 10-224, there must be a \u201ccontested case or civil action\u201d. This prerequisite to reimbursement is clear from the plain language contained in the statute. \u201cAn agency or court may award to a business or nonprofit organization reimbursement for expenses that the business or nonprofit organization reasonably incurs in connection with a contested case or civil action----\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-224(e). Simply put, either a \u201ccontested case or civil action\u201d must be linked to the expenses in order for a party to sustain a claim for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>If the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, our search for its meaning may begin and end with their plain meaning. <em>See e.g., Board of Trustees of Md. State Retirement and Pension Sys. v. Hughes, </em>340 Md. 1, 7, 664 A.2d 1250 (1995) ; <em>see also Long v. State, </em>343 Md. 662, 667, 684 A.2d 445 (1996) (citing <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 94, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994)); <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145, 626 A.2d 946 (1993); <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481 (1991). Where language is plain and unambiguous, and expresses a definite meaning consonant with the statute\u2019s purpose<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, courts must not insert or delete words to make it express an intention different from its clear meaning. <em>See e.g., In re Adoption </em>/ <em>Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 557-59, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994); <em>Department of State Planning v. Mayor of Hagerstown, </em>288 Md. 9, 15, 415 A.2d 296 (1980). We conclude that the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous regarding the \u201ccontested case or civil action\u201d prerequisite. There simply is no provision, contained in S.G. \u00a7 10-224, for recovery of expenses, unless those expenditures stem from a \u201ccontested case or civil action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\u201cContested case\u201d, as that term is used in S.G. \u00a7 10-224, is defined, in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">(1) ... a proceeding before an agency to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">(i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ7I\">S.G. \u00a7 10-202(d). In <em>Modular Closet Sys., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 438, 554 A.2d 1221 (1989), the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d was further refined to include only those disputes that, by their nature, entitle a party to an agency hearing, regardless of whether a hearing was in fact held. Id. at 444, 554 A.2d 1221. The entitlement to an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>hearing does not arise from the Administrative Procedure Act (S.G. \u00a7 10-101, <em>et seq.), </em>but must originate <em>from </em>another source such as a statute, regulation, or due process principles. <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Md. Waste Disposal Auth., </em>323 Md. 641, 652, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991); <em>North v. Kent Island Ltd. Partnership, </em>106 Md.App. 92, 103, 664 A.2d 34 (1995). Thus, in order to decide that a \u201ccontested case\u201d existed, we must discern from some other source that the local Association would have ultimately been entitled to an agency hearing on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">In its attempt to demonstrate an entitlement to an agency hearing, appellant proffers an overly expansive interpretation of <em>Modular Closet. </em>Appellant, in its brief, posits that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aik-dedup-0\">just as in <em>Modular [Closet </em>] where the [agency] abandoned the pursuit of its sales tax assessment, here, [the Attorney General] abandoned the proceedings.... The law permitted a hearing to the local [Association] at several stages. First, if instead of cooperating with the [Attorney General\u2019s CID, the local Association] played \u201chardball\u201d and failed to comply ..., it would have required the [Attorney General] to apply to [c]ourt for enforcement where the court would hear and determine the matter. Secondly, if there was evidence of a[n antitrust] violation, a civil action would be required ... which would necessitate a hearing. If the [Attorney General] had not abandoned the proceeding a civil action would have been filed and a hearing granted to the [local] Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">(internal citations omitted). Essentially, the local Association asserts that, had it balked at complying with the CID or if the Attorney General had pursued the fruits of its investigation through a civil action, the local Association would have been entitled to a \u201chearing\u201d before a court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant has apparently confused a \u201chearing\u201d before a court with a \u201chearing\u201d before an agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We conclude that a \u201ccontested case\u201d is a proceeding before, or dispute with, an agency that entitles a party to an <em>agency </em>hearing. The definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d contemplates only an agency hearing. In every instance, S.G. \u00a7 10-202(d) limits the scope of contested cases to those proceedings entitling a party to an agency hearing and not a hearing before a court. We agree with appellant that, had the Attorney General taken further action against the local Association for a violation of state antitrust law, it may have ultimately been subjected to a hearing before a constitutional court. Such a hearing may have stemmed from either a petition for enforcement of the CID pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 ll-205(h) or a civil action pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 11-209. Such an ultimate result, however, does not amount to an entitlement to an agency hearing. Without such, the dispute cannot be labeled, under any circumstances, a \u201ccontested case\u201d. We cannot unearth, nor has appellant identified, an entitlement to an agency hearing springing from the issuance of the CID. In fact, no provision of the Maryland Antitrust Act contemplates an agency hearing. The Attorney General has only two enforcement options. He may either institute criminal proceedings under C.L. \u00a7 11-207 or a civil action under C.L. \u00a7 11-209. Simply put, the antitrust investigation of the local Association was not a \u201ccontested case\u201d because such is initiated only when a person becomes entitled to an agency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Unlike our prior determination concerning \u201ccontested cases\u201d, we perceive that no entitlement to a hearing is neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>sary for the existence of a \u201ccivil action\u201d. According to Md. Rule 2~101(a), a \u201ccivil action is commenced by filing a complaint with a court.\u201d \u201cAs a fundamental principle[,] a civil action is an adversary proceeding before a court of law; judicial review of the decision of an administrative agency is [also] a civil action.... \u201d <em>Unnamed Physician v. Commission on Medical Discipline, </em>285 Md. 1, 9-10, 400 A.2d 396 (1979). We conclude that ordinarily the only method of initiating a \u201ccivil action\u201d is the filing of a complaint or petition of review with a court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No such document was ever issued by the Attorney General in the instant case. In order to implement his civil enforcement of the Maryland Antitrust Act, the Attorney General must file a complaint \u201cin equity to prevent or restrain violations of [C.L.] \u00a7 11-204....\u201d C.L. \u00a7 10-209(a). He is required to do so only when an investigation reveals evidence that the Maryland Antitrust Act has been violated. In the instant case, no \u201ccivil action\u201d commenced because a complaint was never filed and, therefore, expenses are not recoverable under S.G. \u00a7 10-224. The trial court did not err by dismissing the local Association\u2019s petition for judicial review because no \u201ccontested case\u201d or \u201ccivil action\u201d existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Finally, the local Association attempts to assign error to the trial judge\u2019s dismissal of its Motion to Compel Compliance with Md. Rule 7-206<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. The trial judge, in his order dismissing the Petition, similarly disposed of all pending motions. Appellant, by its motion, had sought to compel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Attorney General to make available the \u201crecord\u201d of its proceedings regarding the investigation. The Attorney General had refused to produce evidence gathered during its investigation citing the nondisclosure provisions of C.L. \u00a7 ll-205(f). The Attorney General argues on appeal that the Motion to Compel production of the record became moot when the underlying case was dismissed. The local Association claims that the case could not have been properly dismissed without allowing the court and appellant to have access to the contents of the record. Similarly, the local Association argues that this Court cannot fully determine the extent of the Attorney General\u2019s investigation without access to the record. Essentially, appellant contends that the record may reveal that the nature of the dispute satisfies the definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d. We agree with the Attorney General that the motion became moot upon dismissal of the Petition. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">As stated above, the local Association never had the right to seek reimbursement. Nothing in the record could have resulted in a determination that the local Association was entitled to an agency hearing. Therefore, the record could not remedy the failure of the instant matter to warrant classification as a \u201ccontested case\u201d. We conclude that the contents of the record, and the extent of its development, were irrelevant to the trial court\u2019s determination regarding the viability of the Petition. Similarly, the record could not alter our determination that redress under S.G. \u00a7 10-224 was never available to the local Association. The motion to compel production of the record, therefore, became moot upon the dismissal of the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-11\">. This subtitle details the conduct, contracts, combinations, and conspiracies proscribed by the Maryland Antitrust Act (C.L. \u00a7 11-201 <em>et. seq.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-11\">. The Attorney General never explicitly notified the local Association that the investigation was closed. Although we do not decide that the Attorney General was compelled to reveal the status of the investigation, we do not applaud, and surmise as unpalatable, his decision to remain mute upon cessation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">. The stated purpose of the statute is \"to ensure the right of all persons to be treated in a fair and unbiased manner in their efforts to resolve disputes in administrative proceedings governed by this subtitle; and promote prompt, effective, and efficient government.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">. In <em>Modular Closet, </em>the Court of Appeals indicated that a proceeding that would ordinarily qualify as a \u201ccontested case\u201d, does not become a \"contested case\" when the proceeding remains in a preliminary investigative stage. <em>Modular Closet Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>315 Md. 438, 447, 554 A.2d 1221 (1989). The agency, in that case, went beyond mere investigation and levied an assessment against appellant. That action shifted the matter beyond the preliminary stages. At that point, Modular became entitled to an eventual hearing. In the instant case, appellant argues that the Attorney General\u2019s investigation went beyond the preliminary stages. As we shall discuss <em>infra, </em>the extent of the investigation remains irrelevant to our analysis because under no circumstances would the local Association be entitled to an agency hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">. Under limited circumstances not relevant to the instant action, \u201ccivil actions\u201d may be initiated by other means. For example, certain \"special proceedings\u201d (formerly codified under Chapter 1100 of the Maryland Rules and now dispersed throughout) are \"civil actions\u201d that are launched by filing a mere petition.
