R. 252,) we held that mere irregularities in the manner of selecting and impanneling the grand jury, not affecting the competency of any of the members, cannot be pleaded in abatement, or be made the ground of a motion to quash the indictment, but can only be taken advantage of by challenge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-6\">Where a plea in abatement to an indictment was sustained, on the ground that the grand jury was not selected from the original panel, twenty-nine of whom answered to their names, but promiscuously from said twenty-nine and others summoned to complete the number of thirty-six, the judgment was reversed, on the ground that the objection could only be taken by challenge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">Appeal from Jasper.

The State we held that mere irregularities in the manner of selecting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>impanneling the grand jury, not affecting the competency of any of the members, cannot be pleaded in abatement, or made the ground of a motion to quash the indictment, but can only be taken advantage of by challenge. (12 Tex. R. 252, 268.) The matter pleaded in abatement of the present indictment was a mere irregularity in impanneling the grand jury, in no way affecting the qualifications or competency of any of the members of that body; and on the authority of the case of Vanhook and authorities there cited, there was error in sustaining the plea and quashing the indictment. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
