One of the deeds from the appellant to Jones, for 140 acres of land, was dated September 4th, 1852 and contained the following condition :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">\u201c When the said San Antonio and Mexican Gulf Railroad \u201c Company shall be fully organized, and shall have put under \u201c contract twenty miles of said railroad, and located said road \u201c so as to cross the C\u00edbolo creek above the Sulphur Springs to \u201c San Antonio, then the said Enoch Jones is hereby fully au- \u201c thorised to convey to the Presiden t and Directors of the said \u201c Railroad Company, in my name, a full and complete fee-sim- <em>\u201c </em>pie title to the said land herein described, but without gua- \u201c ranty of title, except as to those claiming by, through or un- <em>\u201c </em>der me, or my heirs or assigns ; the land herein conveyed \u201c being a donation to said Company in the construction of a \u201c railroad,\u201d <em>&amp;c.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">The other deed from appellant to Jones, for five hundred acres of land, was dated Sept. 4,1852, and contained the follow-: ing condition:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201c When the said Railroad Company shall be fully organ- ' ized, and the president and directors shall issue in my favor a \u201c certificate for four shares of the capital stock of said Compa- \u201c ny, said stock entitling me to all the advantages, privileges, \u201c and dividends of other stockholders who may subscribe \u201c in money, then the said Enoch Jones is hereby fully author- \u201c ized and empowered to convey to the president and directors \u201c of the said Railroad Company and their successors in office, \u201c for the use of the Company, by absolute fee-simple title, with \u201cfull stipulations of warranty, the land hereinbefore de- \u201c scribed,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">Both of these deeds provided that, in case of the death or removal of Jones, Thomas J.

Devine, citizens of Bexar \u201c county, together with others, obtained a charter from' the Le- \u201c gislature of the State of Texas, in which they were appoint- \u201c ed a committee to form and organize a company, to be enti- \u201c tied the San Antonio and Mexican Gulf Railroad Company ; \u201c that the said Enoch Jones and Thomas J. Devine, on the \u201c 7th day of October, 1851, were elected, the one president, \u201c and the other a director of said Company, and had one P. \u201c W. Platt constituted and appointed an agent to solicit <em>\u201c </em>donations to said Company and obtain subscriptions for \u201c stock; that the said Platt on the 4th day of September, \u201c 1852, as agent of said Company as aforesaid, repre- \u201c sented to your petitioner that the construction of said \u201c railway would result in very great immediate advantage and \u201c profit to your petitioner, from the increase of immigration to \u201c this State, and the consequent rise of lands, besides the in- \u201c creased facilities for transportation ; and said Platt further \u201c represented that said railway had at that time already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>M </em>commenced la accordance with one of the provisions of the \u201c said charter, to-wit: that said railway should he commenced \u201c within one year from the 1st day of November, 1850, other- \u201c wise the charter should be null and void <em>f </em>that said Platt farther represented that twenty miles of said railway would be completed within three years from its commencement. Tour petitioner alleges and expressly charges that said representations, made by the said Platt, as agent aforesaid, were false and were made with a view to deceive and defraud your petitioner ; that they were made by the said Platt with the full knowledge and authorization of said Company, and that the said Company authorized the said Platt, as agent aforesaid, to make said false and fraudulent representations with a view to defraud your petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\">Tour petitioner further alleges and expressly charges that the above representations by the said Platt, that said railway had at that time already been commenced in accordance with the provisions of the charier, and that twenty miles would be completed within three years from its commencement, were false and fraudulent and that since said false representations were made by the said Platt, this petitioner has discovered, and expressly charges, that said Company never did make a <em>banafide </em>commencement of said road in accordance with the provisions of said charier, but that said Company, with a view to deceive, and in fraud of the provisions of said charier, made a few marks with a plow and cut a few bushes near Mission Conception in the neighborhood of the city of San Antonio on the 31st day of October, 1851, the very last day allowed by the charter for the commencement of said road ; that the whole amount of labor performed in making said marks and cutting said bushes did not amount to the labor of three men for one day; that at the time said work was performed, said road was not located, and the said work was not done upon the line of said road, as subsequently adopted by said Company, nor has any work been since done at said place, or any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>where upon the line adopted subsequently ; that the representations of said Platt, that twenty miles of said road would be completed, within the time specified in said charter, was likewise false and fraudulent, and made also with a view to deceive ; and your petitioner expressly charges that the said Platt and the said Company knew at the time that there was no reasonable prospect of the completion of the said twenty miles within the three years. But your petitioner, having faith and confidence in the truth of said false and fraudulent representations, did, at the request of said Platt as agent aforesaid make, execute and deliver (the deed for one hundred and forty acres, describing it, and making exhibit of a copy thereof.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">Your petitioner further represents that said Enoch Jones, in fraud of your petitioner\u2019s right, conveyed said land to the said Company without your petitioner\u2019s knowledge and consent and without the conditions, contained in said deed of trust, having been complied with on the part of said Company, a copy of which conveyance is hereto annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">Your petitioner further represents, in addition to what he has already alleged, that the said P. W. Platt, acting as agent as aforesaid, on the 4th day of September, 1852, and at the same time he procured the deed of trust from your petitioner, with the same authority, knowledge and consent of said Company, falsely represented, in addition to said fraudulent representations as to the commencement of said road, and the completion of twenty miles of the same, that said railway would not cost above twelve thousand dollars per mile, and that the taking of stock in said Company would be a profitable investment in consequence of the cheapness of the construction of said railway, and the large income that the Company would realize from the same; that one J. E. Johnson, an engineer, was then engaged in surveying a route for said railway, and, from all the Company could learn from him and from other sources, that said- railway would not exceed in cost the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>mentioned above ; and your petitioner charges that said false and fraudulent representations were made by the said Platt with a view to deceive and defraud your petitioner, and with the full knowledge, consent and authority of said Company, and that your petitioner having faith and confidence in the said false representations of said Platt, at his request made, executed and delivered to the said Jones and Devine a deed (the deed for 500 acres above described.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">Your petitioner further represents, that, on or about the 2nd day of February, 1853, the said Jones, acting as president of said Company, advertised that sealed proposals would be received until the first day of April next for the construction of sixty (60) miles of the San Antonio and Mexican Gulf rail road, extending from Lavaca bay to the crossing of the Guadalupe river in the* vicinity of the town of Clinton ; that on or about the 12th day of April, 1853, said Enoch Jones, still acting as president of said Company, and the sai'd Thomas J. Devine, still acting as director, procured the contract for the construction of said railway from Lavaca bay to the city of San Antonio, the entire distance of the contemplated railway, at twenty-seven thousand dollars per mile, thus by advertising that the construction of a part only of said railway would be con\" tracted for, when the whole was intended, the Company diverted competition, thereby greatly diminishing if not absolutely destroying the- value of the stock of said Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">Your petitioner further represents that he has never been officially informed of the organization, or has received a certificate of the five shares of stock stipulated for in said deed of trust, or been informed that the same was ready for him, yet the said Enoch Jones, in fraud of your petitioner\u2019s rights, and -without his knowledge and consent, has conveyed said land in fee simple to said Company, without said Company having complied with any of the provisions and conditions of said deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">Your petitioner further represents that he was induced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>make the donation, to said Company and take stock therein through the false and fraudulent representations of said Platt as agent for said Company, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">The defendants filed a general denial. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">At the trial, the plaintiff after proving the deeds as herein-before stated, read in evidence the 18th Section of the charter of said Company, as follows : \u201c That if said railroad is not \u201c commenced within one year from the 1st November, 1850, <em>\u201c </em>and at least twenty miles are not in running order within <em>\u201c </em>three years from its commencement, then this charter shall \u201c be null and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">Then plaintiff read a contract between the said Company and Jones and T. J. Devine for the construction of said railway from the Gulf terminus to the city of San Antonio, for twenty-seven thousand dollars per mile* made and entered into on the 11th day of April, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\">J. H. Beck, a witness for plaintiff, testified that he was employed by the Company to grade and grub one mile; that he commenced work on the day before that on which the charter would have been forfeited, had no work been done ; that he grubbed about half a mile for which he received about thirty dollars ; that the object of the work was to secure the charter ; that he stopped work at the request of the president of the Company, who offered him another mile of equal labor on another route ; that he undertook the work in good faith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">- M. L. Merrick, for plaintiff, testified that there was a small amount of cutting brush and, perhaps, some grubbing and one or two furrows ploughed upon the ground where the Company commenced work; that the work done might have cost ten dollars ; that it was done a short distance from San Antonio in 1851 or 1852, near the limit of the charter, when a demonstration had to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-10\">P. W. Platt, for plaintiff, testified that his agency for the railroad Company began about the 4th of March, 1852, and continued about one year ; that, on examination of the copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>of the deeds annexed to the petition, he believed that he had procured like deeds from plaintiff; that he represented to the plaintiff that the country would be greatly benefitted by the construction of the road ; that his lands would be doubled in value ; that facilities would be furnished for trade; that he made money by giving the land to the Company, by the increased value of his other lands ; that he thought he told Mm it would be commenced on the 1st of January, 1853, and con tinue to the crossing of the Guadalupe above Clinton in one year, and to the C\u00edbolo in two or two and a half years ; that it would cost \u00a710,000 per mile. He further testified that he had obtained the information, upon which these representations were based from Jones, the president of the Company, and Johnson, the chief engineer ; that he represented that the road had been commenced in accordance with the charter, which information he derived from the president; that a contract had been let to Beck, who had done work on it; that he made the statement as a fact on the knowledge which had thus been obtained ; that his representations as to the time of completing the road were made upon the authority of the president.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">It was admitted that the deeds referred to by this witness were the same as those appended to' plaintiff\u2019s petition. It was admitted that no part of the road had been constructed ; that the contract between Jones and Devine and the Company had been rescinded in 1854, and a contract made with Osgood, in April, 1856, for the construction of the road from Lavaca and Powderhorn to Victoria for nineteen thousand nine hundred and eleven dollars per mile, which was the least the road could be constructed for; that the certificates of stock, mentioned in the deeds, had been ready for plaintiff since the execution of the deeds from Jones to the Company ; but that plaintiff had never called for or received them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">Andrew Neill, for plaintiff, testified that he knew the land in controversy, that it was then worth \u00a74 per acre, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the cause of its rise from eighty cents, the amount allowed for it by the agent of the Company, to $4, was owing to the increase of immigration and the gradual improvement of the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">The defendants proved several legislative extensions of the .charter, the organization of the Company and election of officers immediately after the grant of the original charter, the sending of an agent North to negotiate means ; a survey by Col. Johnson, U. S. A., with a corps of surveyors, before the expiration of the time in the original charter, for which thirty three thousand dollars were paid ; that the means were raised partly from subscriptions, and partly from $30,000 subscribed by the city of San Antonio and Bexar county, in bonds ; that Jones and Devine had a portion of the necessary ties cut and prepared : that the Osgood contract was secured by the Bexar and city bonds, the stock subscriptions and land donations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">It was agreed that the land donation by the State was considered in evidence, and that said lands were not hypothecated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">It was proved that Johnson\u2019s estimate was that a road, without grading, for the first thirty miles, might be built for $14,000 per mile, but it would have no ballast and only fifty-two pounds of iron per yard; but a first-class road, with seventy pounds of iron to the yard would cost $27,-000 per mile. The first estimate was made after Johnson had been over most of the ground, but before any surveys had been returned : the surveys wore returned about the time of the making of the Jones and Devine contract. The coast and part of the route had been surveyed previous to plaintiff\u2019s subscription, but no official report was made until afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">The Court, without request, after stating to the jury the issues joined, instructed the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">The question of fraud, or of a fraudulent intent is a question of fact for the jury, which they must determine from the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>To justify the jury in finding a verdict for the plaintiff in this case, on the ground of fraud practised by the defendant or its agents, they must be satisfied from the evidence, that the plaintiff was induced by false representations made to him by said Company or by its agent, with their knowledge and authority, to execute the deeds in question, and that these representations were not only false, but that they were made with the intent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">If any such false representations were made, which induced the plaintiff to make the deeds referred to, it is for the jury to determine by their verdict, whether they were made with the intent to defraud, or whether they were made <em>bona fide </em>(in good faith) but under a mistaken idea as to what the Company or its agent supposed and stated would be the future result as connected with the proposed railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">The jury must look to all the facts and circumstances as disclosed by the evidence and return their verdict accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-7\">At the request of defendant, the Court gave the following-instructions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">That the time limited in the charter for beginning and completing the railroad having been extended by the Legislature, the time limited in the original charter for the beginning and completion of the road were not of the essence of the contract; and the failure to complete the road or any part of it within the time does not discharge the party from his contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">That if they believed from the evidence that the plaintiff had equal opportunity of knowledge, the advantages, facilities and means of knowing the character of enterprise in which he was embarking, the low estimates of time and cost by the agents of the Company are not such circumstances as would relieve him from his donation and stock subscription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\">That the defendants by their charter had the right to receive land donations and land stock subscriptions, and those donating or subscribing were bound to use due diligence as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the advantages and disadvantages to themselves and the public, and if they deceived themselves, or were deceived by the mere mistaken notions of others, the subscribers could not therefore be relieved from their contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">That if the jury believe from the evidence that the statements made by Platt were the mere arguments of a sanguine man, about which the plaintiff was bound to exercise his own judgment, and about which both might alike have been deceived, then such statements do not amount to a fraud but only an extravagant opinion about a public enterprise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">The Court refused to give the following instruction asked by plaintiff:'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">That if the plaintiff was deceived by the representations of Platt, it operated as a fraud upon plaintiff, whether Platt knew the representations to be false or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-8\">Verdict and judgment for defendant; motion for new trial overruled.; and appeal by plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-9\"><em>W. B. Leigh, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-10\"><em>I. A. &amp; G. W. Paschal, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU9\">The statement of facts shows that the charter has been extended from time to time, and the privileges had never expired ; and that at the trial, the road was in progress of construction ; that the failures had been owing to uncontrollable circumstances; and there was no proof that the agent who merely hazarded opinions as to the rapidity with which the road would progress, had any authority to do so. Nor is there proof that a single false or untrue statement was made to induce Henderson to subscribe for stock. There was proof of the appreciation of the value of the land ; but no proof of any positive wrong</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-11\">The issues of fraud went to the jury under proper instructions from the Court. They found for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-12\">The only .question really presented, is, can a subscriber for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>railroad stock, who thus becomes one of the corporators, as soon as he gets tired, sue the Corporation, and recover back Ms money, or land, for the stock, simply because he is tired ? If so, every man persuaded into an adventure might have an action against his partners for the fraud. Pacts relate to things present, or things existing at the time of speaking.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">The instructions of the District Judge upon tMs point were perfectly correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">The Court would not have been allowed to suppose a case within the law governing individual transactions, and then to give instructions to suit the supposed ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">The fact is, one stockholder can have no such action against a corporation to rescind his contract, upon any such grounds. The public have an interest in these enterprises, which rises above the individual rights of a single stockholder. If the action is for the mis-user or non-user of the charter, and is by a stockholder, it should be a suit to rate the expenses and wind up the business of the concern. Then all the stockholders and creditors could be heard ; and if the appellant had suffered any peculiar hardship, he could be heard. But a form of action in which he seeks to take back all that he subscribed, because he has been disappointed would if\"tolerated be injurious to the public.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">The charges of the Court were altogether too favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">We here cite a few general references :</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-10\">As to the power of the agents of corporations. (Angell &amp; Ames, Sec. 298 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-11\">And that the plaintiff could not take advantage of the nonperformance of the conditions, or of the forfeiture, or of the extension of the charter without his consent. (Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, Art. 777 <em>et seq.; </em>and the numerous notes, which are better than any brief.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-12\">And that the plaintiff being a stockholder has no action against the Company, but only against the managers or offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>eers. He is not a creditor or partner. (Angell &amp; Ames, Sec. 313 and cases there cited.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b584-5\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvE\">The argument for the appellee questions the right of the plaintiff to maintain the action. He is a stockholder, it is said, and as such cannot sue the Company in a suit of this character. If the position were correct, it would result in the affirmance of the judgment, whatever errors may have been committed upon the trial. But the law is otherwise. A private corporation may be sued by one of its own members. This principle is established by numerous decisions, both in the English and American Courts. (5 Adol. and Ell. R. 866; 3 B. and Adol. R. 125 ; 2 Bay, 109; 3 Met, 44 ; 4 H. and Johns. 338.) In this respect, the eases of incorporated companies are entirely dissimilar to those of ordinary copartnerships, or unincorporated joint stock companies. In incorporated companies, the individual members are entirely distinct from the artificial body endowed with corporate powers. (Angell and Ames on Corp. Sec. 390.) A member of a corporation, who is a creditor, has the same right of action as any other creditor, and may .even attach the property of the company, though he may be personally liable by statute to satisfy other judgments against it. (3 Metc. 44.) The individual members of the corporation, are deemed strangers to the artificial body created by the Act of incorporation, and may maintain their rights of action against the company, of whatever nature, in the same manner as .those who are not members. The fact, that, by his contract the plaintiff was entitled to become, or was, in fact, a stockholder or member, did not deprive him of Ms right of action against the company. On general principles, it would seem not to admit of question, that one who, by. false and fraudulent representations and inducements held out to him by the company, had been deceived and misled into the making an injurious contract, by which he became a stockholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and member of the company, might maintain an action against it, to rescind the contract and dissolve the connection. To deny the right would be subversive of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The plaintiff having the right to maintain the action, it becomes material to inquire whether there be error in the judgment, which has been rendered against him. The ground of error, mainly relied on, is the charge of the Court, as follows : \u201c To justify the jury in finding a verdict for the plaintiff on the \u201c ground of fraud practised by the defendant or its agents, \u201c they must be satisfied from the evidence, that the plaintiff was \u201c induced by false representations made to him by said com- \u201c pany, or by its agent with their knowledge and authority, to \u201c execute the deeds in question ; and that these repres'enta- \u201c tions were not only false, but that they were made with in- \u201c tent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The charge maintains that to render the Company responsible for the frauds practised by their agents, the false representations must have been made, 1st, with the knowledge and authority of the Company ; and 2nd, with the intent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff. That both propositions are erroneous will be apparent by, a brief reference to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Story, in his Treatise on Agency, thnaistate&amp;dhe law, upon the subject of the liability of theprii*$w fc^l^p^e^gances, gences and torts of his agents,1 judged cases. <em>\u201c </em>It is a general doctj \u201c'the principal is not ordinarily liat \u201c a criminal suit, for the acts or mis^ \u201cindeed,he has authorized, or co-opei%t^dmtnoseaoj\u00a1yor mis- <em>\u201c </em>deeds; yet he is held liable to third pers^slnacivil suit \u201c for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, \u201c negligences, and other malfeasances, or misfeasances, and \u201c omissions of duty of his agents, in the course of his employ- \u201c ment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or \u201c participate in, or, indeed, know of such misconduct, or even \u201c forbade the acts, or disapproved of them. In all such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201c the rule applies, <em>respondeat superior ; </em>and it is founded upon <em>\u201c </em>public policy and convenience; for in no other way could \u201c there be any safety to third persons in their dealing, either \u201c directly with the principal, or indirectly with him through <em>\u201c </em>the instrumentality of agents. In every such case, the prin- <em>\u201c </em>cipal holds out his agent, as competent and fit to be trusted ; \u201c and thereby, in effect, he warrants his fidelity and good <em>\u201c </em>conduct in all matters within the scope of Ms agency.\u201d (Story on Agency, Sec. 452, 127, 135, 137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The same doctrine applies in respect to the liability of incorporated companies for the acts of their agents. Unless the act of incorporation expressly prescribe the contrary, the duly authorized agents of corporations, as of natural persons, may, within the scope of their authority, not only bind them by their contracts ; but from their acts and conduct, as from the acts or conduct of the agents of natural persons, implications may be made, either for or against their constituents. And if a corporation ratifies the unauthorized act of its agent, the ratification is equal to a previous authority, as in case of natural persons. The representations, declarations, and admissions of the agent of a corporation, stand upon the same footing with those of the agent of an individual. As natural persons are liable for wrongful acts, and neglects of their servants and agents, done in the course and within the scope of their employment, so are corporations, upon the same grounds, in the same manner, and to the same extent. \u201c Indeed, (it is said in \u201c a learned treatise on corporations,) whether we consider their <em>\u201c </em>mode of appointment or of action, their powers, rights and <em>\u201c </em>liabilities, or the liabilities and rights of their constituents, <em>\u201c </em>by virtue of their acts, or contracts, we can perceive no differ- <em>\u201c </em>ence in principle or precedent, between the agents of corpor- \u201c ations, and those of natural persons, unless expressly made 1 \u2018 by the Act of incorporation or by laws.\u201d (Angell and Ames on Corporations, Sec. 315, 292, 304, 309, 310, 311.) The defendants, therefore, are to be held responsible for the acts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>representations of their agent in the same manner as an individual would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">And nothing is better settled, than that the fraud of an authorized agent will invalidate a contract, entered into by him on behalf of his principal, though in perpetrating the fraud, the agent acted without the knowledge or consent of the principal. (4 Term R. 39; 1 Id. 12 ; 1 Stark. R. 434: 6 Mees. and Wels. 358.) And even'though the agent has transcended his authority in making the contract, yet if the principal ratify it, and make the contract his own by availing himself of the benefit of it, he is liable in like manner as if he had personally made the contract. And if the agent has made misrepresentations, the principle is bound by them ; for he cannot ratify the contract, and avoid the responsibility of the representations, &amp;c., which formed its basis ; but he must avoid or ratify the contract <em>in toto </em>. (Story on Con. Sec. 496.) This doctrine was affirmed by Judge Story in Hough v. Richardson, 3 Story, R. 689,) and I quote the language of the learned Judge as asserting a principle applicable to the facts of the present case. \u201c The sale, then, being made by Moulton, not as himself the. \u201c owner\u2014which he was not\u2014but as the agent of the owners, \u201c it follows that they are bound by his representations, made at \u201c the time touching the sale, as a part of the <em>res gestae ; </em>and as \u201c to the purchasers, it makes no difference whether these repre- <em>\u201c </em>sentations were made by the authority of the owners or not, <em>\u201c if </em>they were material to, and-constituted the basis of, the sale, <em>\u201c </em>and it was made by the purchaser on the faith and credit of \u201c these representations. Tender such circumstances, the sale is \u201c good in the entirety, or not good at all. The owners have no <em>\u201c </em>right to insist upon the validity of the sale independent of the \u201c representations. The whole must be taken together as a part <em>u </em>of one and the same transaction. It cannot be adopted in \u201c part and rejected in part. It must be taken as good for the \u201c whole or not at all.\u201d (And see 1 Story R. 172; 3 Id. 129, 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The Court therefore erred in charging the jury, that in order to set aside the contract, on the ground of the fraudulent representations of the agent, they must have been made with the knowledge and by authority of the Company. The representations of the agent, acting within the scope of his authority and employment, are treated as the representations of the principal himself ; and are binding upon him, whether he knew of them or not. And, as we have just seen, though he exceeded his authority in making the contract, yet, as the Company, by accepting a conveyance from the trustee and taking the benefit of the contract, have ratified and adopted his acts, and made them their own, they are liable in like manner as if they had personally done the acts. They must take them all together, and with all their consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Then, as to the proposition embraced in the charge, that, to avoid the contract, the false representations must have been made <em>\u201c </em>with the intent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff,\u201d the Court was equally in error. 11 If a material misrepresent- \u201c ation be made, although it be not embodied in the contract, 11 it is considered as a constructive, or legal fraud, although it \u201c be made without any wilful intention to deceive, but merely \u201c through carelessness, mistake or ignorance ; for if a party be \u201c actually deceived by a misrepresentation, the practical result \u201c is the same, whether it were a wilful fraud or not. If, there- \u201c fore, a party. undertake to make a material statement, not \u2018\u2018 knowing whether it is true or false, and thereby mislead ano- \u201c ther to his injury, it is no difference that he did not know that 1 the statement was false ; since, before making the affirmation, \u201c he should have ascertained its truth. But where this repre- \u201c sentation is purely accidental and without fraudulent design, \u201c it is not necessary to consider it to be a fraud, since if it be \u201c made by mistake, it would avoid the contract if it should touch \u201c its essence, on the ground of a want of mutual assent of the \u201c parties. For if a gross misrepresentation be made as to a ma- \u201c terial fact, it matters not whether it be treated as a construe- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201c tive fraud, or as a mere mistake, the right of the party de- \u201c ceived to avoid it is the same.\u201d (Story on Con. Sect. 506, and notes; Mitchell v. Zimmerman, 4 Tex. R. 75.) Judge Story, in his treatise on Equity, states the doctrine more strongly, thus: \u201cWhether the party thus misrepresenting a \u201cmaterial fact, knew it to be false, or made the assertion with- \u201c out knowing whether it was true or false, is wholly immate- \u201c rial: for the affirmation of what one does not know or believe \u201c to be true, is equally in morals and law as unjustifiable as the \u201c affirmation of what is known to be positively false. And \u201c even if a party innocently misrepresents a material fact by mis- \u201c take, it is equally conclusive, for it operates a surprise and \u201cimposition upon the other party.\u201d (1 Story\u2019s Eq. Juris. Sec. 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The charge of the Court, therefore, was erroneous and calculated to mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">At the instance of the defendent, the Court further instructed the jury, \u201c That the time limited in the charter for begin- \u201c ning and completing the road, having been extended by the \u201cLegislature, the time limited in the original charter,\u201d &amp;c\u201e, \u201c was not of the essence of the contract, and the failure to \u201c complete the road or any part of it, within the time does not \u201cdischarge the party from his contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The propriety of giving this instruction is, to say the least, very questionable. In so far as it implies, that an extension of time by the Legislature, could have the effect, as between the Company and third persons, of releasing the former from the obligation of their contracts, or could affect the rights of the parties to the contract in question, we cannot assent to the doctrine. If the construction of the road within some certain time was the essential inducement to the making of the contract; if that was the real intention of the contract, and the obligation which it imposed on the defendants, the extension of time by the Legislature could not have the effect to discharge the defendants from that obligation. The terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of the contract and the attendant'circumstances must be looked to, to ascertain the real intention of the parties, and how far time was regarded by them as material. We must suppose it. was within their contemplation that the road would be constructed, if not literally within the time stipulated, at least..within some reasonable time, regard being had to all the circumstances, and that that expectation was the essential inducement to the contract. It is not reasonable to suppose that the plaintiff would have made the contract, if he had not been led to believe that the road would be constructed, or at least in the process of being constructed, within the time specified, or some reasonable time thereafter. It certainly is not a reasonable supposition, that it entered into the intention or contemplation of the parties to the contract, that the time for its construction, might be extended by legislative enactment, from time to time, indefinitely. Nor can it be reasonably contended* that the failure to commence and prosecute the work within a reasonable time, if not within the time specified-, would not avoid the contract. That would be to hold a contract binding upon one party, when the obligation was not mutual. The charge of the Court was calculated to induce the belief that time was not material, when it appeared to have been the essential and sole inducement to the contract; or at least, that it was not material, so long as the Legislature might see proper to extend the time for the making of the road, when such extension of time could have no other effect than, perhaps, to enable the defendants to perform their undertaking within such reasonable time as may be supposed to. have been within the contemplation of the parties. It was going too far, to -tell the jury that, because the Legislature had given an extension of time, \u201c the failure to complete the road, \u201c or any part it within the time, does not discharge the party \u201c from his contract.\u201d The instruction was calculated to mislead the jury, and was therefore- erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">But the right of the plaintiff to the redress he has sought is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>denied ; and it is said that the charge of the Court was correct, for that the public have an interest in these enterprises, which rises above the individual rights of a single stockholder ; that the public interest forbids that one stockholder should thus discharge himself; that it was not allowable for the Court to suppose a case within the law governing individual transactions, and instruct the jury as to the law applicable to the supposed case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">There is no principle known to the law which will enable a party, individual or corporate, to claim immunity for his wrongful acts, done to the injury of another\u2019s right, \"on the ground of public interest. On the contrary, the public as well as individual interests, demand the utmost fairness and probity in the transactions, as well of corporat\u00e9 bodies, as of individuals. Nor does the law recognize any such distinction, as that the ordinary rules governing the contracts of individuals do not equally apply to the case of incorporated companies. They are subject to the same liabilities and responsibilities for their acts and contracts as individuals. We know of no principle upon which they and their agents are to be deemed exempt in their dealings with others, from the ordinary obligations of morality and honesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Again, it is said, it can hardly be predicated that an agent of so extensive a public enterprise could deceive any body by his opinions as to its completion and cost; that these are matters about which every one is presumed to be equally capable of judging. And the conclusion to be deduced, of course, is that the plaintiff was as capable as the defendants, or their agent, of judging of the truth of the representations ; consequently he ought not to have been deceived by them ; and, if' so deceived, it was his own folly, for which he is remediless.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">If the defendants, or their agent, had communicated truly and fully all the facts respecting the cost and character of the work, and their means of accomplishing their undertaking, and left him to judge for himself of the probability of its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>pletion within the time stipulated, instead of making positive statements as to what they could and would do, the argument would be entitled to more weight. But it is certainly reasonable to suppose they best knew the extent of their own means and resources, and when they undertook to give positive assurances, upon their own responsibility, we know of no reason why third persons might not trust them ; or, if deceived by them to their own injury, why redress should be denied. We cannot assent to the doctrine, that no one ought to be deceived by them, because no one ought to trust to their representations ; nor are we prepared to hold them irresponsible on any such ground as that their opinions, professions and assurances ought not to be relied on by third persons with whom they contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Again, it is insisted that their representations cannot be deemed fraudulent, for that they had relation to things in the future. But it is not necessary, in order to render the representions and assurances of a party, on which others have acted, binding upon him, that they should have relation to facts which had previously transpired. The representations, as to what the defendants would do, when used as inducements to others, to contract with them, became assurances and undertakings, which they were bound to fulfill. They were obligatory upon them, and must be so held, or the contract would be void- for- the want of mutuality. If such assurances were not binding, there could be no binding promise to perform an act in future.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">None of the considerations suggested in. argument impair the claim and right of the plaintiff to the redress he seeks. They do not obviate the effect of the errors in the charge of the Court, or authorize us to consider them as immaterial. The charge was pertinent and material, and must have had a controling effect in its application to the facts of the case. It appeared in evidence, that, since the making of the contract, the land had appreciated more than fourfold in value. The time specified, for having the road completed, to the several points indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>cated, (crossings of the Guadalupe and C\u00edbolo,) had elapsed, and no part of it had been built; nor had there even been a beginning. There was an attempt to prove a beginning, and it was in evidence, that on the day before the charter would expire, when, as a witness stated, a demonstration had to be made to save the charter, some trifling amount of work had been commenced; there was some brush cut, and some grubbing, and perhaps a furrow or two ploughed, estimated to be worth ten dollars ; and this, instead of being at the place of beginning, was near San Antonio. But if it had been at the right place, it was not of sufficient importance to bo called a beginning of such an undertaking. The defendants are in the enjoyment of the plaintiff \u2019s property, without having verified any of the professions, by which they induced him to part with it; without having rendered any equivalent or consideration whatever. The plaintiff has derived none of the promised benefits to himself from the defendant\u2019s undertaking. The contract has operated as a gross imposition and fraud upon him. Such is the state of case which the record exhibits, and it would be difficult to conceive of a stronger case for the rescission of a contract. To hold that a man may be thus deceived, imposed upon and deprived of his property, by false hopes held out to him by another, and that he shall be wholly without redress for the injury done him, would be shocking to common sense and the sense of justice. In fine, to deny the plaintiff\u2019s right to redress upon the case which the record presents, would be, in effect, to maintain an exemption from legal responsibility, on the part of the defendants, which no body corporate, or politic, not even the State itself, can claim, in any country where private rights are respected, and law and justice administered. If the record truly presents the facts of the case, it cannot be denied, that the contract has operated a surprise, imposition, and manifest fraud on the plaintiff, which well entitle him to the redress he seeks ; that is, to have the contract rescinded, and the property conveyed under it restored to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We are of opinion, therefore, that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
