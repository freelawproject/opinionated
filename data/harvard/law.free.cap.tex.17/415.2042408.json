On the next day, he was brought before the Mayor of the town, and tried for the same assault and battery, under an ordinance for the punishment of assaults and battery, on -which trial he offered in bar the certificate of the Justice of the Peace, which defence was overruled ; and he then demanded a trial by jury, which was refused, and he was fined thirty dollars. The case was taken by <em>certiorari </em>to the District Court, which Court dismissed the <em>certiorari, </em>on demurrer ; from which judgment the appellant appealed-</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The Charter of the corporation of the town of La Grange provides \u201c that the Mayor shall, in a summary way, try all \u201c offences against the laws passed by the Council, without a \u201cjury, give judgment and issue execution for the same.\u201d And it is admitted that by an ordinance of the city, the Mayor was authorized to impose a fine not exceeding thirty dollars for an assault and battery committed within the corporate limits of the said town.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The main question for our consideration is the constitutionality of that part of th.e Charter of the town of La Grange, cited above. The 19th Section of Article 4 of the Constitution of the State is in the following words, 1. e.: \u201cIn all cases where \u201c Justices of the Peace or other judicial officers of inferior tri- \u201c bunals shall have jurisdiction in the trial of causes, where \u201c the penalty for the violation of a law is fine and imprison\u00bb \u201c ment (except in cases of contempt) the accused shall have the \u201c right of trial by jury.\u201d We do not believe it will admit of a doubt, that the powers intended to be conferred by the por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>tion of the Charter referred to, are of a judicial character : and that it was an inferior tribunal, there can be as little doubt. We therefore believe that it was unconstitutional and void. And the judgment is reversed and the cause ordered to be dismissed at the cost of the corporation. We say nothing about the legality of two fines for the same assault and batferv.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Reversed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
