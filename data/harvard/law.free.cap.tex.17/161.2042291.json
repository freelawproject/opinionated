He who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>trusts most shall lose most. Huntsman trusted no one; and in addition had the Statute of two years adverse possession in his favor. Concealment, if true, did not apply to Huntsman ; nor is it an exception in the Statute.

Mebane, 10 Id. 246 ; 7 Id. 281.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">A strong reason for a liberal course in favor of petitions for certiorari is, that such is almost the only method of correcting-the errors of inferior Courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-6\"><em>G. F.

On looking into the record we can find no sufficient ground for reversing the judgment of the Court, in so dismissing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">There is no sufficient reason shown, why the plaintiff in the certiorari did not make all the-defences which he alleges can be made to the suit, in the Justice\u2019s Court, nor was it shown that they were not made. The two grounds upon which the appellant seems to rely most, are the great irregularity and long pendency of the suit in the Justice\u2019s Court, without formal continuances, and the Statute of Limitations. As to the irregularity complained of, it furnished no ground for a new trial in the District Court. Strict forms of entry of continuances cannot be looked for in a Justice\u2019s Court; and the appellant went into trial at last, without showing that the means of making his defence had been impaired by the protracted delays ; and it appears that they were caused as much by himself as by the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The Statute of Limitations might - have been interposed in the Justice\u2019s Court, but was not, by him ; and the record does not show that it had constituted a bar to the proceedings against him, at the time of the commencement of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The record shows that the plaintiff below had been more than two years out of the possession of the horse, but it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>not show that it came into the possession of the appellant and those under whom he claimed, more than two years before the commencement of the suit; and, from what appears, the Statute would not have availed him anything, if it had been set up in the Justice\u2019s Court. We are therefore of opinion that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
