R. 139.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-5\">II.\u2014The Court below erred in refusing to strike out the answers of plaintiff to the interrogatories 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and part of 8th. (See pages 8 and 9 of transcript.) Said answers not being categorical, and being so answered as to evade the interrogatories propounded. The statute is peremptory on this point. (Hart. Dig. Art. 736 and 737 ; Hirams and Donaho v. Coit, Dallam 449 ; Hughes v. Prewitt, 5 Tex. R. 294 ; Teas v. McDonald, 13 Id. 355 ; Scott v.

The certificate of the Notary shows that the answers of the plaintiff to the interrogatories propounded to him by the defendants, were sworn to and subscribed before the officer; and the certificate is strictly in conformity to the statute. (Hart. Dig. Art. 739.) The answers were filed more than a year before the trial; and the motion to reject certain of them, and take the interrogatories as confessed for the want of an answer, came too late. (8 Tex. R. 129.) ' The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
