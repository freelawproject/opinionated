We, Wilborn J. Williford, as principal, and Hugh W. Branch and Stephen H. Darden and O. M.

District Court of said State, to be begun and holden in and for Gonzales county, at the Court house thereof in the town of Gonzales on the 7th Monday after the 1st Monday in September, A. D. 1855, and attend from day to day and Term to Term, then and there to answer the State of Texas on a charge contained in an indictment, presented and filed in said Court, against him, at the Spring Term thereof, A.

The word \u201c before\u201d is manifestly used to designate time, and the bond therefore required the prisoner to appear before the time of the next Term. The word should have been \u201cat.\u201d Another objection is, that the bond required the prisoner to appear before the Term of the Court, and not at. the Court itself as required by the statute. Another variance from the statute is, that the bond required the prisoner to appear \u201c from day to day and Term to Term.\u201d The last condition transcends the statute, and is onerous beyond what it prescribes.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b667-11\"><em>Stewart, ds Mills, </em>also for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b667-12\"><em>Attorney General, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b667-13\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT1\">If we were to construe the condition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>bond by the single expression, \u201c before the next Term of the Hon. District Court,\u201d this phraseology, disconnected from the context, would favor the construction contended for by counsel for the appellants ; that is, that it requires the appearance of the party anterior to the time of holding the Court. But we must construe the instrument as a whole, and with reference to all its parts ; and so construed, it becomes apparent that such is not its meaning. It requires that the defendant \u201c shall be and personally appear before the next Term of the Hon. District Court, to be begun and holden,\u201d &lt;fcc., stating the time and place of holding the Court, \u201c and attend from day to day and Term to Term, then and there to answer the State of Texas,\u201d &amp;c. The defendant is thus required to \u201c be and personally appear\u201d before the Court, \u201c then and there\u201d to answer, &amp;c., which he could not do until the meeting of the Court. To place the meaning contended for upon the word before, therefore, would render the language employed repugnantfand contradictory in itself. Such a construction as will defeat the intention of the instrument, and render it nugatory, is not to be adopted where the language will reasonably admit of a different construction, which will effectuate the intention. And by attending to the latter clause of the sentence, <em>\u201c </em>then and there to answer,\u201d &amp;c., it appears, evidently, that the word before is used, not as a sign of time merely, but to mean in the presence ' of; and the evident meaning of the condition, is, that the defendant shall make his personal appearance before, that is in the presence of the Court, then next ensuing, \u201c then and there to answer,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>Thus construed, with reference to all its parts, there is no real ambiguity, and can be no doubt as to the import of the condition of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Then, as to the condition being more onerous than the law requires; we do not so regard it. The prescribed' condition is, that the defendant \u201c will appear at the District Court of the proper county, at the next Term thereof, then and there to answer the charges exhibited against him, and that he will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>depart therefrom without leave of the Court.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 2889.) The condition that he will not depart without leave of the Court, requires the defendant to attend from day to day and Term to Term, until discharged by the Court, and is of precisely equivalent legal import to the condition of the bond in this case. Thus, in The State v. Stout, (6 Halst. 124,) it is said a recognizance in general binds to three particulars : 1st. To appear to answer, either to a specified charge, or to Such matters as may be objected ; 2nd. To stand and abide the judgment of the Court; and 3d. Not to depart without the leave of the Court. And each of these particulars is distinct and independent. The party is not to depart until discharged, although no indictment should be found against him by the grand jury, or although he be tried, and a verdict of acquittal rendered. If no trial is requisite, an order of discharge is regularly made by the Court. If a trial results in a verdict of not guilty, the judgment of the Court contains a discharge ; which, in practice, is always supposed to be entered, although not always done. (Id. 133, 134.) The condition of the present bond, though not in the very words prescribed in the statute, is precisely the same in its legal effect. But if the condition to \u201c attend from day to day and from Term to Term,\u201d were not authorized by the statute, it would not invalidate the condition requiring the defendant to appear at the Term next succeeding ; and as the forfeiture was taken at that Term, it must be supported. For it is well settled that superadded words of condition, beyond what are authorized by statute, do not invalidate the recognizance ; but it has the same effect as if they had been omitted. (Howie v. The State, 1 Ala. 113.) It results that the Court did not err in the rulings complained of, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
