Over appellee\u2019s objections, the board subsequently approved and adopted the report and recommendation of the hearing examiner and revoked appellee\u2019s license to practice medicine and surgery in the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Appellee appealed to this court, which concluded that the common pleas court had not abused its discretion in finding the board order supported by substantial, reliable and probative evidence. Nonetheless, under <em>Brost v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 218, 581 N.E.2d 515, this court reversed the sanction imposed and remanded the matter for the board\u2019s reconsideration under the full range of sanctions available to the board irrespective of its internal disciplinary guidelines. <em>Roy v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 675, 610 N.E.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">On remand, the board reconsidered its sanction, and once again voted to revoke appellee\u2019s license. However, in doing so, the board specifically noted that appellee\u2019s license to practice medicine and surgery in Ohio was permanently revoked. Appellee again appealed to the common pleas court, contending that the board lacked the statutory authority to permanently revoke his license. Following full briefing, the trial court agreed with appellee, holding that R.C. 4731.22(B) does not grant the board the authority to permanently revoke a doctor\u2019s license to practice medicine and surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Appellant appeals to this court, asserting that the trial court erred in concluding that the board lacked the statutory authority to permanently revoke appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>lee\u2019s license. In so holding, the common pleas court noted that nothing in R.C. 4731.22(B)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grants the board the authority to permanently revoke a license; rather, the board\u2019s authority is limited to simply revoking a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>State v. White </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 39, 29 OBR 388, 505 N.E.2d 632, the Supreme Court considered similar statutory language, as well as similar contentions regarding the meaning of that language. Under R.C. 4507.16(A), as discussed in <em>White, </em>a trial judge was permitted to suspend a driver\u2019s license for not less than thirty days nor more than three years, or to revoke the license under designated circumstances. In analyzing the meaning of \u201crevoke,\u201d the Supreme Court noted first that the legislature\u2019s use of both \u201csuspend\u201d and \u201crevoke\u201d implies that the terms are not synonymous. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 29 OBR at 389-390, 505 N.E.2d at 633-634. Rather, the Supreme Court stated that the \u201cterm \u2018suspend\u2019 ordinarily contemplates the temporary taking away of something. \u2018Revocation,\u2019 however, is a permanent taking without the expectation of reinstatement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A similar statutory analysis of R.C. 4731.22(B) suggests that the term \u201crevoke\u201d includes permanent revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>Bouquett v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 203, 598 N.E.2d 762, this court visited a similar issue, couched in arguments regarding a physician\u2019s ability to seek reinstatement of a revoked license. In addressing those contentions, this court noted that \u201cnothing in the definition of \u2018revoke\u2019 * * * compels this court to conclude that this term contemplates <em>only </em>a permanent and irreversible condition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 208, 598 N.E.2d at 765. Further, the court noted that \u201cthere is nothing in the record before this court which indicates that the board intended to permanently prohibit plaintiff from the practice of medicine in Ohio. Rather, the board\u2019s order appears to be its standard order revoking a medical license with no other language indicating a permanent revocation * * As a result, the court concluded \u201cthat R.C. 4731.22(B) authorizes the board to reinstate to the practice of medicine a physician whose medical license has previously been revoked.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Thus, without specifically addressing the issue, this court in <em>Bouquett </em>suggested, consistent with the analysis in <em>White, </em>that the board\u2019s authority to revoke a license includes the authority to revoke it permanently. Nonetheless, <em>Bouquett </em>determined that some revocations are subject to reinstatement. Indeed, in <em>White, </em>although the Supreme Court found that the authority to revoke a license included the authority to impose a permanent revocation, it also noted that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>some circumstances a new license may be obtained following revocation, thus acknowledging that not all revocations prevent relicensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Given the foregoing analysis, the authority granted the board under R.C. 4731.22(B) to revoke a physician\u2019s license to practice medicine includes the authority to revoke it permanently. See, also, <em>Brost, supra </em>(\u201cPermanent revocation, of course, is the most serious penalty that the board can impose.\u201d); <em>Fattah v. State Med. Bd. </em>(Mar. 10, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93AP-601, unreported, 1994 WL 73903 (\u201cthe sanction of permanent revocation was within the board\u2019s statutory authority\u201d). While appellee relies heavily on <em>Bouquett, Williams v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 743, 605 N.E.2d 1311, and <em>DeBlanco v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 194, 604 N.E.2d 212, none of those cases suggests, much less holds, that the board may not permanently revoke a license. Rather, <em>Williams </em>and <em>DeBlanco </em>found R.C. 4731.22(B) constitutional, in part because a doctor may seek reinstatement of a revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The parties further argue the availability of reinstatement where the board specifies that it is permanently revoking a license. Although the parties have raised both the issues of reinstatement and constitutionality if no opportunity for reinstatement of a permanently revoked license exists, neither of those issues is before us in this case. The record reveals no application for reinstatement, and thus we do not address that issue. Further, in not addressing the availability of reinstatement under the sanction the board imposed in this case, we likewise do not reach the constitutionality of R.C. 4731.22(B) in the event that reinstatement is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Nonetheless, finding that the statute does authorize the board to permanently revoke a physician\u2019s license, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-9\">Close and Reilly, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b387-10\">Archer E.
