Marhofer has appealed from the judgment of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas in favor of defendants Daniel E. Baur and Courtesy Pontiac Olds, Inc. (\u201cCourtesy\u201d) in this breach of contract action. He has argued that the trial court (1) incorrectly granted summary judgment dismissing his claim against Baur, and (2) incorrectly determined that Courtesy had not breached the agreement at issue. This court affirms the judgment of the trial court because (1) Baur was not a party to the agreement at issue, and (2) Courtesy did not breach the agreement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Marhofer is engaged in the business of facilitating sales of automobile dealerships. He does business under the name \u201cAutomotive Business Associates\u201d (\u201cABA\u201d). Baur is the former president of Courtesy, which owned an automobile dealership in Wadsworth, Ohio. On June 14, 1990, Marhofer and Courtesy entered into an agreement in which Marhofer agreed to assist in the sale of Courtesy\u2019s Wadsworth dealership. Pursuant to the agreement, Courtesy agreed to pay Marhofer $50,000 for any contract for the purchase of the dealership that he procured which was \u201cacceptable\u201d to Courtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Shortly after the execution of the agreement, Marhofer presented Courtesy a written offer for the dealership that was far below its asking price. Courtesy rejected that offer as unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">During late 1990 or early 1991, Marhofer mentioned Bishop Motors, an entity owned by Glen and Tom Bishop, to Baur as a potential purchaser of the dealership. Marhofer engaged in discussions with the Bishops, but those discussions never resulted in his presenting an offer to Courtesy from them. Baur and Marhofer had no further discussions regarding Bishop Motors as a potential buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">On October 14, 1991, Tom Bishop contacted Baur directly in order to express an interest on the part of Bishop Motors in purchasing the Wadsworth dealer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ship. On November 20, 1991, Courtesy and Tom Bishop entered into an agreement pursuant to which Bishop agreed to purchase the dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Marhofer filed this action against Baur and Courtesy in the Medina County Court of Common Pleas on April 3, 1992. He alleged that he was entitled to recover $50,000 from them as a commission on Courtesy\u2019s sale of the dealership to Bishop.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On June 23,1993, Baur and Courtesy moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied the motion insofar as it related to Courtesy. It determined, however, that Baur had signed the agreement only on behalf of Courtesy rather than in his personal capacity. Accordingly, it concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that Baur was entitled to judgment dismissing Marhofer\u2019s claim against him as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Marhofer\u2019s claim against Courtesy was tried to the court on August 5, 1993. On August 30, 1993, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it found that Marhofer had failed to procure a contract acceptable to Courtesy and concluded that Courtesy was entitled to entry of judgment in its favor dismissing Marhofer\u2019s claim against it. Marhofer timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Marhofer\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly granted summary judgment dismissing his claim against Baur. Specifically, he has-argued that there were genuine issues of fact regarding whether Baur was personally liable on the agreement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, this court applies the same standard a trial court is required to apply in the first instance: whether there were any genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121, 1122-1123. \u201cAn officer of a corporation is not personally liable on contracts * * * for which his corporate principal is liable, unless he intentionally or inadvertently binds himself as an individual.\u201d <em>Centennial Ins. Co. v. Tanny Internatl. </em>(1975), 46 Ohio App.2d 137, 142, 75 O.O.2d 115, 118, 346 N.E.2d 330, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Baur\u2019s signature appears at the end of the agreement only once, directly below the typed words \u201cCourtesy Pontiac Olds, Inc.\u201d The typed word \u201cBy,\u201d followed by a colon, immediately proceeds his signature, and his signature is followed by the designation \u201cPres.\u201d Marhofer has not suggested that Baur signed the agreement in his personal capacity. Rather, he has argued, in reliance upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Spicer v. James </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 222, 21 OBR 236, 487 N.E.2d 353, that \u201c[wjhether a corporate officer is personally liable upon a contract depends not only upon the form of the signature, but also upon the form of the promise.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">According to Marhofer, the \u201cform of the promise\u201d contained in the agreement indicates that it was contemplated that Baur would be personally liable for Courtesy\u2019s undertaking. He has pointed specifically to the agreement\u2019s opening paragraph:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u201cMEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT entered into this 14th day of June 1990, by and between John A. Marhofer, DBA, AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (herein \u2018ABA\u2019), Courtesy Pontiac Olds Inc. and Daniel E. Baur, its Pres; collectively, jointly and severally, \u2018SELLER.[\u2019]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">He has argued that the reference to Courtesy \u201cand\u201d Bam1, coupled with the use of the words \u201ccollectively, jointly and severally,\u201d demonstrates that Baur was intended to be a party to the agreement. He has also noted that the word \u201cSELLER\u201d is used at some places in the agreement and the word \u201cSELLERS\u201d is used at other places in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">There is no significance to the use of the words \u201cSELLER\u201d and \u201cSELLERS\u201d in the agreement. There is no pattern to their use; rather, they are used interchangeably. If the word \u201cSELLERS\u201d had been intended to refer to both Courtesy and Baur and the word \u201cSELLER\u201d had been intended to refer to only one or the other, the word \u201cSELLERS\u201d would have appeared at the close of the opening paragraph instead of the word \u201cSELLER.\u201d Marhofer prepared the agreement and, in doing so, he used the singular and plural interchangeably. That use amounted to nothing more than a clerical error. The issue presented by Marhofer\u2019s first assignment of error, therefore, is whether the appearance of Baur\u2019s name in the opening paragraph of the agreement, coupled with the use of the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201ccollectively, jointly and severally,\u201d was enough to personally bind him to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The opinion in <em>Spicer v. James, supra, </em>21 Ohio App.3d 222, 21 OBR 236, 487 N.E.2d 353, does contain a single sentence that appears to support Marhofer\u2019s position that an individual who signs a contract only in his corporate capacity could be held personally liable based upon the \u201cform of the promise\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u201cWhether a corporate officer is personally liable upon a contract depends upon the form of the promise and the form of the signature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 21 OBR at 238, 487 N.E.2d at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Review of the full opinion, however, demonstrates that it in fact stands for the proposition that the form of the signature controls over the form of the promise when there is a discrepancy between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The appellants in <em>Spicer </em>were officers of a corporation who had signed a lease for property utilized by the corporation:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u201cAppellants\u2019 signatures were first signed in an individual capacity and did not have any corporate designation after them. After their second set of signatures, appellants indicated their corporate title; for example, appellant Bob Burn has \u2018V.P.\u2019 written after his signature and appellant Douglas James has \u2018Pres.\u2019 written after his signature. Appellants\u2019 first set of signatures did not have a corporate designation appearing after them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 21 OBR at 238, 487 N.E.2d at 354-355.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The court concluded that the appellants were personally liable on the lease despite the fact that the body of the lease always referred to the tenant as the corporation or in the singular. Despite the sentence in the opinion relied upon by Marhofer, therefore, the full opinion in <em>Spicer </em>stands for the proposition that, when there appears to be a discrepancy between the form of the promise and the form of the signature, it is the form of the signature that controls. In the absence of facts that justify piercing the corporate veil, an officer is not personally liable on a contract that he has only signed in his corporate capacity. See <em>Cent. Benefits Mut. Ins. Co. v. RIS Administrators Agency, Inc. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 397, 403, 638 N.E.2d 1049, 1053-1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Inasmuch as Baur only signed the agreement at issue as president of Courtesy, there were no genuine issues of material fact, and he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law dismissing Marhofer\u2019s claim against him. Marhofer\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Marhofer\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly determined that Courtesy had not breached the agreement at issue. Specifically, he has argued that he fulfilled his duty as a \u201cbusiness finder\u201d by finding the ultimate buyer, Bishop, and providing him with information about Courtesy. According to Marhofer, Courtesy breached its obligation to him by refusing to pay him a commission of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Marhofer\u2019s argument, however, is based upon cases involving contracts with terms different from the terms of the agreement at issue in this case. The rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement at issue must be determined based upon the language they chose to use in that agreement. In particular, \u201cParagraph 7\u201d of the agreement provided the circumstances under which Marhofer would be entitled to receive a commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201cCompensation to ABA. As compensation for services rendered hereunder by ABA, SELLERS shall pay a fee to ABA in the amount of $50,000.00 flat for any contract procured by ABA and acceptable to SELLER. BUYER can be anybody acceptable to SELLER and not necessarily anyone who has discussed Dealership with SELLER before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The evidence was undisputed that Marhofer never presented an offer which was acceptable to Courtesy. Marhofer presented Courtesy with only one offer, which Baur found unacceptable. Although Marhofer claimed he \u201cfound\u201d Bishop, the ultimate buyer, he conceded that he never presented Courtesy with an offer from him. He did not perform as required by Paragraph 7. Marhofer\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Marhofer\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\n<em>Jvdgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-9\">Reece, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
