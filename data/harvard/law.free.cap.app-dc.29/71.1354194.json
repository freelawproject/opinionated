Wickers and' Patrick M. Furlong for a patent for an improvement in process of making printing plates, filed March 1, 1905, these applicants appealed from the decision of the principal Examiner rejecting the claims of the application on the issues of three interferences in which certain applications of these appellants were involved. These interferences are <em>Wickers </em>v. <em>Weinwurm, </em>No. 23,741; <em>Wickers </em>v. <em>McKee, </em>No. 22,404 (No. 388 Patent Appeal Docket) <em>[ante, </em>25]; and <em>Wickers </em>v. <em>McKee, </em>No. 22,405 (No. 389 Patent Appeal Docket) <em>[ante, </em>28], The Examiner rejected certain claims on a British patent to Weinwurm, No. 14,508 of 1901. The Examiners-in-Chief affirmed the Examiner in refusing to allow the claims brought before them upon appeal, holding 'that the issues in the aforenamed interferences, when considered together, substantially covered the real invention of this application of Wickers and Furlong, and suggesting doubt if these appellants can obtain a valid patent if the decisions in these interferences be adverse to them. \u25a0 Wickers and Furlong appealed to the Commissioner of Patents from this decision of the Examiners-in-Chief affirming the rejection by the Primary Examiner of the following claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201c1.

The Commissioner held, after a careful review, that the issues of the interferences we have mentioned cover substantially the real invention of this application of Wickers and Furlong, and that the appeal claims are not distinguishable from them. We will not here repeat his clear exposition in his opinion. He fully sustained the Examiner and Board of Examiners-in-Cliief, holding that the separate matters in all the claims brought up on appeal were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>volved in the issues in interference before mentioned. The Commissioner also regarded the decision of the Assistant Commissioner, who had affirmed.the rejection of the five claims mentioned on the British patent to Weinwurm, and held that claims. 8, 9, 10, 11, and <em>2\u00e9 </em>are not patentable over the British patent to Weinwurm.' From this ruling, Wickers and Furlong have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We have disposed of the series of interferences involving the questions sought to be raised by this appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents refusing to grant a patent for a process of making printing plates to these appellants upon their application filed March 1, 1905. The case of the interference of these appellants against Weinwurm is not before ns. We are convinced that the claims of the application in which this appeal is taken are for the same invention involved in the interferences named in the record in this case, and we concur with the tribunals of the Patent Office that it would be improper to grant a patent, under the circumstances, to the appellants upon this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It is so well established that two valid patents may not be issued to a party based upon the same patentable invention that we need not cite authorities. It is the practice in the Patent Office, where an application is allowed to a party, to reject any other applications of the same party upon the allowed application, unless such other applications claim a clearly different invention from\u2019that claimed in the allowed application. In this way the Patent Office limits an inventor to a single patent based upon a single invention. It appears proper, therefore, in a case where a party whose application \u2022 is involved in pending interference proceedings presents another application based upon the invention involved in an interference, to refuse a patent upon -the later application until the interference has terminated. A different course would involve inextricable confusion. To suspend action upon such an application appears to us to be just. In the interference proceedings there is ample opportunity for the appellants to raise the question of the sufficiency of their opponent\u2019s application. We greatly doubt whether the affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>vits in this record presented for the consideration of this court, and controverting the sufficiency of disclosure found in the Weinwurm application in interference, could be profitably considered by this court. That question should come before us. upon testimony taken in the interference proceeding. Since all the tribunals of the Patent Office concur in holding that all the appealed claims are for the same invention as claims of the appellants\u2019 earlier applications, involved in interference proceedings, we should hestitate to differ with these expert tribunals. The reasoning in several of these decisions is most persuasive that, after the generic process of preparing printing plates with projecting portions on the back thereof, and pressing these to the face of the plates, giving a graduated surface, has been claimed, and the specific mode of preparing the plates by the use of photographing and etching has also been claimed, that there is nothing left to claim in a separate application as a separate invention as a process of making-ready printing plates. What remains would appear to be a mere carrying out of the purposes of the original invention, \u2014 matters which ought to be obvious to skilled workers in this art.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"Ag1\">A petition by the appellant for a rehearing, filed February 25. 1907. was denied March 6. 1907.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As we concur with the Commissioner upon this general ground for rejecting these claims, we need not discuss the rejection of five of these claims on the British patents to Weinwurm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents in refusing to issue a patent to the appellants upon their application in which this appeal comes before us is affirmed, and the clerk of this court will certify this opinion and decision to the Commissioner of Patents in accordance with law. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
