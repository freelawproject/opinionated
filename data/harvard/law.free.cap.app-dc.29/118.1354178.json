Hopkins, appeals from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents refusing registration of a trademark. The original application was accompanied by a label containing in large letters, across the top, the words \u201cOriental Cream,\u201d under which follow the words \u201cor Magical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>.Beautifier.\u201d It then proceeds to describe the article as the most elegant and delicate preparation for the skin, etc., etc., with other words indicating manufacturer, etc. Under the large words at the top, and about the middle of the label, is a figure resembling the eagle on the larger silver coins of the United States, which was described as \u201ca fantastic winged figure.\u201d By amendment, the trademark was described by the words \u201cOriental Cream associated with an eagle holding a scroll in its beak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The refusal to register was on the ground that the term \u201cOriental\u201d is a geographical term, and therefore prohibited from registration by sec. 5 of the trademark act of February 20, 1905. The Commissioner said: \u201cThe \u2018Orient\u2019 is a term used to indicate the east, eastern countries, and, specifically, the regions to the east and southeast of the leading states of Europe. Century Diet. The term \u2018Oriental\u2019 is in general use in commerce to indicate goods that are manufactured in this region, as, for example, Oriental rugs. As applied to a cream it would indicate that the cream came from the Orient.\u201d In support of his conclusion he cites cases holding such terms as \u201cLackawanna\u201d in connection with coal <em>(Delaware &amp; II. Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>13 Wall. 311, 20 L. ed. 581) ; \u201cColumbia\u201d <em>(Columbia Mill Co. </em>v. <em>Alcorn, </em>150 U. S. 460, 37 L. ed. 1144, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 153); \u201cOld Country\u201d and \u201cOur Country\u201d <em>(Allen B. Wrisley Co. </em>v. <em>Iowa Soap Co. </em>122 Fed. 796); \u201cEast Indian\u201d in connection with \u201cRemedy\u201d <em>(Connell </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>128 Mass. 477, 35 Am.

E. 235 (word \u201cInternational\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The contention of the appellant that the words \u201cOriental Cream\u201d are not descriptive, but arbitrary as applied to his product, which is not a cream, but a cosmetical lotion of a creamy appearance, is met by a recent decision of this court in which the question is fully considered. <em>Re American Circular Loom Co. </em>December 4, 1906, 28 App. D. C. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed; and this decision will be certified to him as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
