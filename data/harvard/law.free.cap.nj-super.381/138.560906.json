On March 15, 2005, the trial court considered defendant\u2019s motion \u201cfor an order directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>prosecutor to provide the defense with a photograph of the complaining witness, ... pursuant to court <em>Rule </em>3:13-3(c), the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and Art. 1, \u00b6 10 of the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion but stayed the order pending the State\u2019s interlocutory appeal. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On November 20, 2003, at approximately 3:30 a.m., M.C. noticed a shadow in her bedroom and realized that someone was there. The intruder, a man, jumped on her, made her face the floor, and he threatened her with a weapon. He wrapped a shirt around her eyes and tied her hands behind her back. After searching for items to steal from M.C.\u2019s apartment, the intruder told M.C., \u201cyou have no money so I have to take something from you.\u201d He then vaginally penetrated the victim. M.C. felt semen fall on her stomach, and she wiped it off with a blanket from the bed after her assailant left through the bedroom window.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">According to M.C., while the incident was taking place the man told her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Ok, so I know everything about you and I went through your stuff, I know where you work, I went, I know where yon live I\u2019ve seen you, I\u2019ve seen you, and I don\u2019t want nobody to know about this, and if I know that you ya know told anybody ya know they need time [to] get a warrant to get me so I\u2019m gonna come back and get you. I\u2019m gonna kill you if I know that somebody knows about this. I will kill you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">A lew days later on November 24,2003, defendant was arrested for allegedly burglarizing a home in the area where M.C. resided. At the request of the police, defendant voluntarily provided a DNA sample. Defendant\u2019s DNA sample matched the DNA samples taken from the blanket that M.C. used to wipe the semen off her stomach after she was sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">A Hudson County Grand Jury indicted defendant on the following charges: three counts of aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, burglary, and criminal restraint. Defendant is presently in custody. There are two other indictments pending against defendant charging him with burglary and robbery. M.C. has since moved from the apartment where the assault occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion for farther discovery\u201d requested a photograph of M.C. to assist defendant in preparing Ms legal defense. Defendant\u2019s brief in support of Ms discovery motion stated: \u201cIn order to prepare to cross-examine [M.C.] at trial, it is essential that Mr. Gilchrist see her photograph before trial as part of the defense investigation---- [P]osing for a photograph imposes no material burden on [M.C.], who will have to confront Mr. Gilchrist in person at trial; not providing Mr. Gilchrist with a photograph will for a certainty impair Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s ability to prepare Ms defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The State advised the trial court that it would have complied with defendant\u2019s request if the victim did not object. But when M.C. was contacted by the prosecutor\u2019s office, she \u201cexpressed overwhelming fear that the giving of a photograph to the defendant would make it easier for the defendant to fulfill Ms earlier threats to find her and kill her. She was relieved to hear that defendant had forgotten her face.\u201d As a result of this conversation, the prosecutor\u2019s office opposed defendant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">No testimony was taken prior to the entry of the order under appeal. Defendant\u2019s attorney told the trial court that defendant knows the name and address of the alleged victim, but he \u201cdoes not know what the lady looks like.\u201d Defendant argued it is \u201cessential\u201d to obtain a photograph of the alleged victim so that he can determine if he knows her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">He knows that there\u2019s a complaining witness. He knows a name. He knows an address. He does not know what the lady looks like. He ... needs to have a view of her facial features in some form or fashion to determine if this is somebody who he knows, who he may have had some kind of exchange with in the past. There may have been or may not have been an incident. She may be a total stranger to him or she may be someone that he remembers from a past encounter. It might very well yield information that is essential to his defense, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">This is implicating Mr. Gilchrist\u2019s right to confrontation, his right to effective assistance of counsel. Basically Defense cannot mount an investigation without this essential nugget of information: does he or does he not know this woman from the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The prosecutor argued that defendant did not have a \u201cright to confront witnesses pretrial,\u201d and he stated that if defendant \u201cwants a trial, that\u2019s no problem. We\u2019ll of course, bring her in for that purpose.\u201d The State also argued that defendant\u2019s motion should be denied because he failed to present any legitimate reason for obtaining M.C.\u2019s photograph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">If he wants to give some proffer as to how this could be an ex-girlfriend, if he knows the person\u2019s name. But, I mean, we have nothing, we have absolutely nothing ... I can understand from a strategic perspective that the Defense ... wouldn\u2019t want to necessarily further incriminate this defendant who\u2019s already got a lot of proof stacked up against him. But if they\u2019re going to ask the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to go and photograph this victim, make her feel arguably, make her feel like, you know, she\u2019s being processed, then the State\u2019s position is we, we really need to know why.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">While acknowledging that he was uncertain why defendant wants or needs M.C.\u2019s photograph, the trial judge, nevertheless, granted defendant\u2019s motion, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Let\u2019s throw the law aside for a minute and let\u2019s be practical. What\u2019s going to be more alarming to [the] victim, somebody standing in front of her house with a camera and when she opens the door, click, or kind of being explained to her that yes, ... this is what\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s going to be a picture taken of you. The person will get to see you at trial anyway, but they want a picture of you to see if they ever had a confrontation with you in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">I take it they\u2019re going to get a picture of her. She needs to live her life. She doesn\u2019t need to live her life in fear either. I don\u2019t know if something happened. I know the gentleman is charged with a brutal crime. I\u2019m very mindful of that. But if they want to get a picture of her, ... they\u2019re going to get a picture of her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">So I think why don\u2019t we just do this as easily ... as non-threatening to her as possible, other than having somebody flash a bulb in her face. I mean, there really is no law on this other than I don\u2019t think I could stop them from taking her picture if I wanted to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Preliminarily, we note our concern with the trial court\u2019s approach. We perceive no legitimate reason to \u201cthrow the law aside\u201d in an effort to achieve a practical solution. Notwithstanding the best of motives, a judge\u2019s role is circumscribed by the law. A judge is not free to do whatever he or she thinks is best for a defendant, or a crime victim, without reference to controlling legal principles. To do so is to depart from his or her proper role as a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Both the Federal and New Jersey Constitutions \u201cguarantee criminal defendants \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 168, 827 A.2d 243 (2003) (quoting <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>683, 690, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2142, 2146, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>636, 645 (1986)), cert. <em>denied, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>1160, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1169, 157 L.Ed.2d 1204 (2004). To ensure that opportunity, each criminal defendant has the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 10. This right \u201cis made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 403, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 1068, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>923, 926 (1965). A defendant\u2019s right to confront and effectively cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses is essential to the due process right to a \u201cfair opportunity to defend against the State\u2019s accusations,\u201d and is one of \u201cthe minimum essentials of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>284, 294, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1038, 1045, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 308 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u201cThe right to confront one\u2019s accusers is a concept that dates back to Roman times.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 43, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 187 (2004). The ultimate goal of the Confrontation Clause \u201cis to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 61, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The right to question adverse witnesses, however, \u201cdoes not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 53, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 999, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>40, 54 (1987) (plurality opinion); <em>State v. Krivacska, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 35, 775 A.2d 6 (App.Div.), (\u201cThe Confrontation Clause is not a constitutionally compelled right to discovery in a criminal case.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>206, 785 A.2d 435 (2001), <em>cert. denied, 535 U.S. </em>1012, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1594, 152 L.Ed.2d 510 (2002) <em>State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 463, 530 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>A.2d 806 (App.Div.) (finding that trial court properly refused to permit defendant access to victim\u2019s records maintained by Division of Youth and Family Services and Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center because \u201cinformation was not determinative of any issues before the court or necessary for the conduct of the proceedings.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>54, 582 A.2d 1118 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In this case, defendant has failed to articulate any legitimate basis for obtaining M.C.\u2019s photograph, and we conclude that neither the Sixth Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to furnish him with her photograph. <em>See State v. R.W., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>14, 28, 514 A.2d 1287 (1986) (\u201c[Allowing a defendant to forage for evidence without a reasonable basis is not an ingredient of either due process or fundamental fairness in the administration of the criminal laws.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Should this matter proceed to trial, defense counsel will have an opportunity to cross-examine M.C. regarding her credibility, including any motive to fabricate, and to explore any potential bias or prejudice. If it develops that defendant has had a \u201cpast encounter\u201d with M.C., we are confident of the trial court\u2019s ability to address any evidentiary issues or other problems that may arise without jeopardizing defendant\u2019s right of confrontation and his right to present a complete defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s post-indictment right to discovery is automatic.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3.1 on <em>R. </em>3:13-3 (2006). <em>Rule </em>3:13-3(c) requires the State to permit defendant to inspect and copy or photograph relevant material specifically enumerated in the rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Generally, a defendant in a criminal case is entitled to broad discovery. <em>State v. D.R.H., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>249, 256, 604 A.2d 89 (1992). \u201cNevertheless, criminal discovery has its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>limits.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A defendant should not be allowed to \u201ctransform the discovery process into an unfocused, haphazard search for evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Another significant limitation on a defendant\u2019s right to discovery is \u201cthe chilling and inhibiting effect that discovery can have on material witnesses who are subjected to intimidation, harassment, or embarrassment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Although defendant claims that M.C.\u2019s photograph is \u201cessential\u201d to his defense, the State contends that there has been no showing that the photograph will be either relevant or exculpatory. \u201cRelevant evidence\u201d is defined as \u201cevidence having a tendency in reason to prove or disprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>401. In determining whether evidence is relevant, the inquiry should focus upon \u201cthe logical connection between the ... evidence and a fact in issue.\u201d <em>State v. Darby, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>509, 519, 809 A.2d 138 (2002) (quoting <em>State v. Hutchins, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 358, 575 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1990)). We agree that defendant has failed to show how M.C.\u2019s photograph is relevant to his claim of innocence, and he has also failed to explain how the photograph might be exculpatory. <em>See Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 <em>U.S. </em>83, 87, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218 (1963) (defendant is entitled to disclosure of all exculpatory evidence); see <em>also State v. Morton, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>383, 413, 715 A.2d 228 (1998), (\u201cA <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when a prosecutor fails to turn over material, exculpatory evidence to the defendant.\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>931, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1380, 149 L.Ed.2d 306 (2001) Thus, defendant\u2019s reliance on R. 3:13-3(c) is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Because M.C. was sexually assaulted and her attacker told her that he would kill her if she told anyone what happened, the State argues that M.C.\u2019s fears are objectively reasonable and that she will be \u201cvictimized again\u201d if she is forced to submit to a court-ordered photograph. The State also claims that the trial court\u2019s decision will have a \u201cchilling effect on victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The Victim\u2019s Rights Amendment of the New Jersey Constitution mandates that \u201c[a] victim of a crime shall be treated with fairness, compassion and respect by the criminal justice system.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>It also states that crime victims \u201cshall be entitled to those rights and remedies as may be provided by the Legislature.\u201d <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1, \u00b6 22. In 1985, the Legislature enacted the Crime Victim\u2019s Bill of Rights, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:4B-34 to\u201438, which granted crime victims and witnesses certain rights, including the right to be treated with dignity and compassion, and the right to be free from intimidation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:4B-36(a), (c). As part of its findings and declarations, our Legislature stated \u201cthat without the participation and cooperation of crime victims and witnesses, the criminal justice system would cease to function. The rights of these individuals should be given full recognition and protection.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:4B-35. And in sexual assault cases, the Court has recognized a special need to protect victims and witnesses from emotional trauma, embarrassment, and intimidation. <em>State v. R.W., supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 514 A.2d 1287 (finding that any possible evidentiary benefit to defendant from a court-ordered examination of a witness was outweighed by witness\u2019s right to privacy and public need to encourage victims of crimes to report and assist in prosecution of offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> The trial court was not insensitive to M.C.\u2019s concerns, but it failed to properly evaluate all of the relevant considerations. \u201cJudicial discretion connotes conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action; it takes into account the law and the particular circumstances of the case before the court.\u201d <em>Higgins v. Polk, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>490, 493, 103 A.2d 1 (1954). \u201cWhether discovery should be expanded involves exercising judicial discretion or, put another way, balancing the beneficial effects of discovery against its disadvantages.\u201d <em>State in the Interest of W.C., supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 224, 426 A.2d 50. Here, any possible benefits to defendant from a court-ordered photograph of M.C. are entirely speculative and are outweighed by other important considerations, including M.C.\u2019s right to privacy; her right to be treated with fairness, compassion, and respect; her right to be free from intimidation; and the need to encourage crime victims to cooperate and participate in the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The order requiring the State to photograph M.C. and to provide defendant with the photograph is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> Because the State does not presently have a photograph of M.C., it argues that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering it \"to essentially create evidence on behalf of defendant.\" We find this argument unpersuasive. <em>See State in the Interest of W.C., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>218, 224, 426 A.2d 50 (1981) (recognizing that courts may order pretrial lineups even though a lineup results zn new evidence rather than the disclosure of existing evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
