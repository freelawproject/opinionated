The motion judge disagreed and granted defendants summary judgment, dismissing all claims. Plaintiff appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The facts, which are undisputed, may be briefly stated. Plaintiff, a resident of Pine Hill Borough who regularly attends borough council meetings, was permitted to videotape the June 19, 2000 session because no one on the council or in the audience objected. Although plaintiff suggested at that time that he would be videotaping future meetings, he did not attend another meeting until September 18, 2000, when he began videotaping the public session without permission. Mayor Leslie Gallagher polled those present and found that several members of the audience did not wish to be videotaped. Plaintiff refused three requests of Mayor Gallager to turn off the video camera, stating that he had the right to videotape the proceedings under the <em>Maurice River Tp. </em>case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. The mayor then asked Police Chief John Welker to remove plaintiff, and Chief Welker asked plaintiff to stop recording. Plaintiff responded that the only way that the camera would be turned off would be if Chief Welker arrested him. Chief Welker turned off the video camera and escorted plaintiff out of the meeting room, where he offered to permit plaintiff back into the meeting room if he agreed to keep the camera off. Plaintiff again refused, and Chief Welker then formally charged plaintiff with disorderly conduct in violation of Borough Ordinance 3-ll.lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">An editorial account of the event appeared in the September 20, 2000 <em>Courier-Post </em>newspaper. A quote from Mayor Gallagher was included in the editorial which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">The council didn\u2019t want him to film them. I asked him to turn off the camera, and he refused to do it. We can\u2019t permit private people to film. If it was an organized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>filming, that would be different____Tf he was a decent resident, we would have no problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Basically, the same sequence occurred again at the October 23, 2000 council meeting. Plaintiff set up his video camera on a tripod in the back of the meeting room. Several audience members expressed a desire not to be videotaped. Consequently, the mayor repeatedly asked plaintiff to turn the video camera off and even offered him the opportunity to videotape the proceedings from the front of the meeting room so the audience would not be included in the footage. Plaintiff, however, refused, citing the <em>Maurice River Tp. </em>case. The Borough Solicitor attempted to explain that decision to plaintiff, but plaintiff disagreed with the solicitor\u2019s interpretation. At the mayor\u2019s instruction, Chief Welker then escorted plaintiff from the meeting room and again requested that plaintiff keep the video equipment off. In the course of a twenty-minute conversation outside of the meeting room, plaintiff told Chief Welker he would have to arrest him in order to keep his camera off. Chief Welker then arrested him for violating the borough\u2019s disorderly conduct ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">One week later, on October 31, 2000, a municipal court judge found plaintiff not guilty of the two disorderly conduct charges, reasoning that plaintiff \u201chad a right here to assert his right to film this meeting and ... he did it in a manner which was not violative of our disorderly conduct statute.\u201d Since then, plaintiff has been permitted to videotape council meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">On September 20, 2001, plaintiff filed a 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 action against defendants in the Federal District Court, claiming that he had been arrested without probable cause and maliciously prosecuted in violation of his civil rights. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to all of plaintiffs federal claims, but declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims, dismissing them instead without prejudice. The court dismissed plaintiffs federal claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution because plaintiffs refusal to obey the police chiefs order to stop videotaping and consequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>disruption of council meetings established probable cause for arrest. In this regard, the court specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avr\">probable cause for Chief Welker to determine that Plaintiff\u2019s purpose was to disrupt a lawful meeting, and that his acts tended to obstruct or interfere with the meeting. Thus, it would have been reasonable for Welker to issue Plaintiff a Disorderly Persons Summons under the Pine Hill Borough Ordinance and Plaintiff has not established that, taking his allegations to be true, his constitutional rights would have been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment, agreeing with the District Court that because Chief Welker had probable cause to arrest plaintiff, and did not engage in any wrongdoing in arresting plaintiff, the claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution fail. <em>Tarus v. Borough of Pine Hill, </em>105 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>357 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">After dismissal of his federal lawsuit, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Law Division reiterating the state law claims originally alleged in the federal action, namely, false arrest, malicious prosecution, defamation, and violation of his rights under the New Jersey Constitution and common law. In separate rulings, the motion judge granted summary judgment first in favor of defendant Welker, and then on behalf of defendants, Borough of Pine Hill and Gallagher. The judge found no state constitutional right to videotape a public meeting and no violation, in this instance, of any common law right. Finding dispositive the fact that plaintiff \u201cdisobeyed a police officer\u2019s order or command,\u201d the judge concluded that the federal court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s false arrest and malicious prosecution claims barred relitigation of these identical counts under the doctrine of res judicata. Finally, he dismissed the defamation claim, reasoning the offending comment was mere opinion not susceptible of being proven or disproven factually.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The primary issue on appeal is whether there is a state constitutional right to videotape public meetings of a township governing body. Plaintiff makes no claim under the federal constitution, and rightly so. Such an absolute right has never been recognized. <em>See Whiteland Woods, L.P. v. Tp. of W. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Whiteland, </em>193 <em>F.3d </em>177, 183-84 (3d Cir.1999). There, the Third Circuit held that a township\u2019s ban on video recording of a public meeting did not violate the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 184. Indeed, \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not require states to accommodate every potential method of recording its proceedings, particularly where the public is granted alternative means of compiling a comprehensive record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The free speech guarantee in the New Jersey Constitution is embodied in Article I, paragraph 6, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">Every person may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right. No law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\"><em>[N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">To be sure, \u201cthe New Jersey Constitution\u2019s right of free speech is broader than the right against governmental abridgement of speech found in the First Amendment.\u201d <em>N.J. Coal. Against War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>326, 353, 650 A.2d 757 (1994), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Short Hills Assoc. v. N.J. Coal. Against War in the Middle East, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>812, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>62, 113 L.Ed.2d 25 (1995); <em>State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 423 A.2d 615 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed sub nom., Princeton Univ. v. Schmid, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>100, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>867, 70 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 855 (1982). Yet, although it may afford greater free speech protection, plaintiff points to no language in the constitutional provision suggesting it is expansive enough to encompass a right to videotape public proceedings, much less expressly identifying one. Nor does plaintiff cite to any authoritative case law recognizing such a state constitutional right, and we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Instead, plaintiff relies on the lower court\u2019s decision in <em>Maurice River Tp.; </em>however, the public\u2019s right to videotape school board meetings recognized in that opinion was based on the common law, not the First Amendment or state constitution. <em>Maurice River Tp., supra, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 455 A.2d 563 (holding \u201c[t]his right is bottomed ... upon common law commitment to (paraphrasing Woodrow Wilson) \u2018open government openly arrived at.\u2019\u201d). Our decision on appeal also declined to find a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>constitutional right, holding only, in response to the township\u2019s request to enjoin the teachers\u2019 association from videotaping a public meeting, that there is no \u201cper se constitutional ... impediment ] to the use of a video camera to tape and record the public proceedings of the Board of Education.\u201d <em>Maurice River Tp., supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 492, 475 A.2d 59. And even to the extent we found a right to videotape based on the common law, we held the exercise of such a right was not absolute, but subject to reasonable governmental regulation and control. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94, 475 A.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">We recognize, of course, New Jersey\u2019s strong public policy favoring open government and \u201cthe general public[\u2019s] ... right to be fully informed on the actions of its elected officials.\u201d <em>Sudol v. Borough of N. Arlington, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 153, 348 A.2d 216 (Ch.Div.1975); <em>see also Times of Trenton Publ\u2019g Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Cmty. Dev. Corp., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>519, 529, 874 A.2d 1064 (2005) (stating \u201cNew Jersey has a strong, expressed public policy in favor of open government.\u201d). This longstanding tradition is embodied in such statutory enactments as the Open Public Meetings Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-6 to -21, and the Open Public Records Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -13, ensuring public access to governmental proceedings and records respectively. We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding that plaintiffs right of access to the public proceedings of borough council is not only founded on statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1, but also emanates from the free speech guarantee of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>See Schmid, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 535, 423 A.2d 615. Indeed, the free speech guarantee protects not only the free discussion of governmental affairs, but also the corresponding right to receive information and ideas so that the discussion be informed. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>596, 604-05, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2613, 2619, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>248, 255-56 (1982); <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>557, 564, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1243, 1247, 22 L.Ed.2d 542, 549 (1969); <em>see also Lawrence v. Bauer Publ\u2019g &amp; Printing, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 476, 446 A.2d 469 (stating \u201c[t]he First Amendment protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>an individual\u2019s activity in speaking in public forums,\u201d and encouraging citizen participation in governmental affairs), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>999, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>358, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>395 (1982); <em>Davis v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, Div. of State Police, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 76, 742 A.2d 619 (Law Div.1999) (stating \u201cthe public has a vital interest in informed discussion of governmental affairs[ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">This much is undoubtedly clear. What plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, however, is the essential nexus between the right of access and the right to videotape so that the latter may be said to be subsumed within the former. On the contrary, we perceive no correlation in this instance between plaintiffs right to receive and communicate information and the particular manner in which plaintiff chooses to record the information received. No claim is made that the council\u2019s ban on videotaping prevented plaintiff from expressing his views before the council, limited his access to the public meeting, or impeded his ability to otherwise accurately record the proceedings. As the court in <em>Whiteland Woods, supra, </em>noted in concluding that a right of access to a public meeting does not create a corresponding federal constitutional right to videotape the meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">The Township did not curtail Whiteland Woods\u2019 ability to express its views before the Planning Commission or to compile an accurate record of the proceedings. Nor did it prohibit interested parties, reporters, or members of the public from attending the meetings or limit the gathering of information by means other than by videotaping. Spectators were free to take notes, use audio recording devices, or even employ stenographic recording. Notning in the record suggests videotaping would have provided a uniquely valuable source of information about Planning Commission meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">[193 <em>F.3d </em>at 183.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">So too here. There has been no showing in this case that the council\u2019s temporary and limited prohibition on videotaping meaningfully interfered with plaintiffs and the public\u2019s ability to inform themselves of the proceedings or their rights of access thereto. Absent any demonstration that the restriction limits the underlying right of access, we decline, as did the court in <em>Whiteland Woods, supra, </em>in addressing the federal constitutional claim, to find that the general right of access affords any basis for plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>claim that the New Jersey Constitution compels a specific right to videotape. <em>See Johnson v. Yurick, </em>156 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>427, 436 (D.N.J.2001) (stating that \u201cNew Jersey courts \u2018rely on federal constitutional principles in interpreting the free speech clause of the New Jersey Constitution\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Karins v. City of Atlantic City, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>532, 547, 706 A.2d 706 (1998))), <em>aff'd, </em>39 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>742 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Binkowski v. State, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 369, 731 A.2d 64 (App.Div.1999) (explaining that \u201c[t]he New Jersey Supreme Court \u2018ordinarily interprets our State Constitution\u2019s free speech clause to be no more restrictive than the federal free speech clause----\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v. Vemiero, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>254, 264, 716 A.2d 1137 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>2365, <em>144 L.Ed.2d </em>770 (1999))).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Plaintiff then is left at most with a common law right recognized in <em>Maurice River Tp., supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 493, 475 A.2d 59. Yet even this right is neither absolute nor unqualified. In <em>Maurice River Tp., </em>we allowed the Board of Education in the first instance \u201cleave to formulate a set of guidelines designed to regulate and control reasonably the videotaping of its public proceedings ... [so as to] provide ample safeguards for the rights and interests of the Board and the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 475 A.2d 59. Thus, the right to videotape public proceedings is subject to reasonable governmental restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at 493, 475 A.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Here, no guidelines had been formally established in the relatively short time the videotaping issue presented itself to the council. Nevertheless, the restrictions council placed on plaintiff constituted neither a total nor permanent ban on videotaping, but rather were simply an ad hoc means of regulating the manner in which videotaping would occur. In fact, at the first session in June 2000, plaintiff was allowed to videotape freely, without objection or limitation of any kind. Although plaintiff was not allowed to videotape the September 2000 meeting because of objections from the audience, at the very next session in October, plaintiff was given the opportunity to videotape if he changed location to the front of the room. We find these restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>neither arbitrary nor capricious, but eminently reasonable under the circumstances, accommodating the conflicting interests and rights of plaintiff, the public and council. As such, we discern no violation of state law on the part of defendants giving rise to any actionable claim by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Having found no constitutional right to videotape, and no arbitrary governmental action in the manner in which plaintiffs common law right was restricted in this instance, we are satisfied that plaintiffs subsequent arrest and prosecution for disorderly conduct was premised on probable cause, and therefore, afford no basis for his claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution. <em>See Wildoner v. Borough of Ramsey, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>375, 389, 744 A.2d 1146 (2000) (explaining that \u201cprobable cause is an absolute defense to [pjlaintiffs false arrest ... and malicious prosecution claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Preliminarily, we note these claims, which are identical to those fully adjudicated and dismissed in the collateral federal litigation between these same parties, are barred from relitigation here under the doctrine of res judicata. <em>Velasquez v. Franz, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>498, 505, 589 A.2d 143 (1991). In any event, we find independently that plaintiffs refusal to obey the police chiefs order to stop videotaping and the consequent disruption of the council\u2019s meetings established probable cause to arrest him and proceed to municipal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">To be sure, \u201c[a] police officer may be liable for civil damages for an arrest if <em>\u2018no </em>reasonable] competent officer\u2019 would conclude that probable cause exists.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Russo, </em>212 <em>F.</em>3d 781, 789-90 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>335, 341, <em>106 </em>S.Ct. 1092, 1096, 89 L.Ed.2d 271, 278 (1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201cTo prevail on a motion for summary judgment, a public employee need not establish his subjective, i.e., actual, good faith if his conduct was objectively reasonable.\u201d Moreover, a public employee can use subjective good faith as a second line of defense at trial, regardless of whether he or she was acting reasonably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\"><em>[Mesgleski v.

Gelber, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 100, 556 A.2d 788 (App.Div.1989)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Additionally, \u201c[w]hether probable cause exists in a given case is essentially a decision for the trial judge who must balance the individual\u2019s interest \u2018in being free from police interference\u2019 and society\u2019s interest \u2018in effective law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mesgleski, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 24, 748 A.2d 1130 (quoting <em>State v. Dilley, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>460, 468, 231 A.2d 353 (1967)). Traditionally, probable cause can be decided on summary judgment by the judge if \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d or \u201ccredibility conflicts[ ]\u201d exist. <em>Merkle v. Upper Dublin Sch. Dist., </em>211 F.3d 782, 788 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Montgomery v. DeSimone, </em>159 F.3d 120, 124 (3d Cir.1998); <em>Groman v.

Lashinsky, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 404 A.2d 1121 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">Hence, where an officer\u2019s instructions are obviously reasonable, in furtherance of his duties, an individual toward whom such instructions are directed has a correlative duty to obey them.

Failure to do so can result in a number of offenses\u201d. <em>State v.

Moreover, if there is an issue where a citizen\u2019s constitutional \u201crights were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>impinged by his removal from the meeting, that deprivation could be addressed at a later time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 780 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Here, the police chief acted reasonably in light of the surrounding circumstances. There was no showing that defendants \u201cacted arbitrarily or in a manner not calculated in any way to promote public order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 780 A.2d 585. On this score, we agree with the findings of the Third Circuit in affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s false arrest and malicious prosecution claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Here, Chief Welker personally witnessed [plaintiff] undertake conduct to disrupt two Council meetings: [plaintiff] halted the September meeting as he argued with the Council about whether he would be permitted to videotape the proceedings and he delayed the start of the October meeting when he refused to turn off his video camera or change its location. In both eases, the meeting could not proceed until Chief Welker turned off [plaintiffs] video equipment and removed him from the meeting room. Chief Welker thus acted reasonably in believing that [plaintiffs] refusal to stop videotaping or move his video equipment constituted disorderly conduct as tending to obstruct or interfere with the Council\u2019s meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\"><em>[Tarus, supra, </em>105 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>at 360.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Lastly, we discern no viable cause of action for defamation based on a council member\u2019s statement: \u201c[i]f he [plaintiff] was a decent resident, we would have no problem.\u201d Summary dismissal was, therefore, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Although insults are offensive, they do not rise to the level of defamation. <em>McLaughlin v. Rosanio, Bailets &amp; Talamo, Inc., </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303, 312, 751 A.2d 1066 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>606, 767 A.2d 484 (2000). \u201c[0]nly verifiable statements can be defamatory.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, name-calling and opinions, which \u201ccannot be prove[n] true or false, ... are not actionable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, \u201copinion[s], as a matter of constitutional law, enjoy absolute immunity.\u201d <em>Dairy Stores, Inc. v. Sentinel Publ\u2019g Co., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>125, 147, 516 A.2d 220 (1986). When there is no \u201csettled meaning, the truth or falsity of an insult is not susceptible to ... proof.\u201d <em>Lynch v. N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>152, 167, 735 A.2d 1129 (1999). In other words, the reason that \u201cexpressions of pure opinion [are] non-actionable as defamation, is ... [because] ideas themselves cannot be false.\u201d <em>Avins v. White, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>627 F.2d 637, 642 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>982, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>398, 66 L.Ed.2d 244 (1980). The statement therefore is protected under the First Amendment. <em>Nanavati v. Burdette Tomlin Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>645 <em>F.Supp. </em>1217, 1248 (D.N.J.1986), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>857 F.2d 96 (3d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1078, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1528, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>834 (1989). Thus, recovery is appropriate only when there are \u201cdefamatory false averments of fact and the truth of the statement is a complete defense to a defamation action.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 312, 751 A.2d 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Moreover, a plaintiff must prove harm as part of the prima facie case. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 751 A.2d 1066. Accordingly, \u201cto survive a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must raise a sufficient question of fact as to actual injury to his or her reputation. For example, a plaintiff must adduce \u2018concrete proof that third parties lowered their estimation of the plaintiff and that he or she suffered emotional or pecuniary harm as a result.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., Inc., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 281, 516 A.2d 1083 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Here, defendant\u2019s statement was clearly opinion, as it cannot be proved or disproved. Further, he has failed to demonstrate any harm suffered as a result of the statement. And finally, contrary to plaintiffs contention, the statement does not qualify as slander per se since it \u201cdoes not [reasonably] yield an interpretation that ... plaintiff ... engag[ed] in ... illegal [conduct].\u201d <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>282, 291, 537 A.2d 284 (1988). Consequently, plaintiffs defamation claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> <em>Maurice River Tp. Bd. of Educ. v.
