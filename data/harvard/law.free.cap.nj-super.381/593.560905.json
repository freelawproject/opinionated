REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">This case presents an issue of substantial compliance with the requirement that a demand for a trial de novo, following nonbinding arbitration, be served within thirty days after the arbitration award. <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1). The trial court confirmed an arbitration award in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, based on a finding that defendants\u2019 counsel failed to serve plaintiffs\u2019 counsel with a copy of the demand notice. Based on the undisputed facts of record, we conclude that defendants substantially complied with the rule, and we therefore reverse and remand this case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Plaintiffs filed a personal injury lawsuit against defendants in 2002. The case was submitted to mandatory nonbinding arbitration which resulted in an award of $336,000 in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. The award was issued on July 29, 2004. On August 23, 2004, defendants\u2019 law firm, Cullen and Dykman Bleakley Platt LLP (Cullen firm), mailed a de novo demand to the court for filing; it was received and filed on August 26,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">According to the certification of service filed with the court, and according to her deposition testimony, Peggy M. Shulman, a secretary in the Cullen firm, also mailed a copy of the demand to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Sharkey &amp; Campisi, on August 23, 2004. At her deposition, Shulman testified that she personally mailed the envelope in a mailbox outside the Cullen firm\u2019s law office.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">According to certifications filed by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel Gregory Campisi and Jeffrey Campisi, they never received the de novo demand, although they were vigilantly watching the mail to see if a demand would arrive. Instead, during the week of August 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>2004, Jeffrey Campisi received a deposition notice from the Cullen firm. Instead of calling the Cullen firm to inquire about this notice, he and his partner waited until the thirty day time limit for filing the de novo demand had passed and then called the court on September 2, 2004, to ask whether a demand had been filed. According to Gregory Campisi, when he called the civil arbitration office, Charmin Lyons of that office advised him that a demand had been filed on August 26, 2004. She also faxed him a copy of the demand, the cover letter, and Shulman\u2019s certification of service. On September 3, 2004, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award, premised on the assertion that, although the de novo demand was timely filed, they had not been served with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Defendants filed opposition to the motion, supported by a certification from a Cullen firm attorney, Kenneth Farina, attesting that the demand had been served on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the return date of plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the judge directed that Shulman be deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">At that deposition, Shulman testified unambiguously that she had been specifically assigned to file and serve the de novo demand, and she described in detail the steps she followed in mailing the notice to the court and in mailing the notice to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. When asked to respond to a certification of plaintiffs counsel asserting that defense counsel did not serve the notice on plaintiff counsel\u2019s firm, she indicated that that statement was inaccurate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Q. Why do you believe that is inaccurate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">A: Because I served it myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">Q: You served the Notice of Demand For Trial De Novo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">A: Served it all the way up to the mailbox.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In an oral opinion issued on December 8, 2004, the trial judge confirmed the arbitration award. Although there was a clear factual dispute between Shulman\u2019s deposition testimony and the certifications filed by the Campisi firm, the judge did not hold a testimonial hearing. Instead, she determined that Shulman was not credible, based on a review of the deposition transcript. Relying on <em>Jones v. First National Supermarkets, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 127, 746 A.2d <em>1072 </em>(App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>132, 754 A.2d 1209 (2000), she reasoned that the court could only extend the thirty day time period for service of the de novo demand in \u201ccircumstances that are extraordinary, exceptional and compelling.\u201d Accordingly she concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">In the present case, the Court is convinced that what happened here is that Miss Shulman mistakenly mailed the deposition notice to Sharkey &amp; Campisi ... It does not matter that defendants may have done so because of the mistake of Miss Shulman or her carelessness or neglect. Case law is crystal clear that Miss Schulman\u2019s actions do not constitute extraordinary circumstances. For these reasons, the plaintiffs motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1), a party may obtain a trial de novo, following nonbinding arbitration, by filing with the court and \u201cserv[ing] on all other parties a notice of rejection of the award and demand for a trial de novo.\u201d The requirement that the demand be filed is statutory, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-26, but the requirement of service on other parties is only mandated by Court Rule. <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). As we observed in <em>Flett Associates v. S.D. Catalano, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 133, 824 A.2d 264 (App.Div.2003), pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:1-2, \u201c \u2018any rule may be relaxed ... if adherence to it would result in an injustice.\u2019 \u201d And <em>R. </em>1:3-4(a) permits trial and appellate courts to enlarge the time for taking action under the court rules. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">By setting a short deadline for filing a de novo demand, the statute ensures that the court will promptly schedule trials in cases that cannot be resolved by arbitration. <em>See Flett, supra, </em>361 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>at 134, 824 A.2d 264. Rule 4:21A-6(b)(1) implements the statute, but also engrafts a requirement of service on the adversary. This ensures that the adversary will have a fair opportunity to prepare for trial. <em>See Corcoran v. St. Peter\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 344, 771 A.2d 707 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">As we reasoned in <em>Flett, supra, </em>since the filing and service requirements serve different goals, it is reasonable to apply different standards for relaxation of the time limits applicable to each:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">In <em>Hartsfield [v. Fantini], </em>the Court concluded that the legislative policy of preserving judicial resources by promoting arbitration of personal injury actions required application of an \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard to an application for relaxation of the thirty-day period for filing a trial de novo demand. 149 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 695 A.2d 259. However, there is no need for application of this same stringent standard to an application for relaxation of the time for service of the demand. We note that once a party files a timely demand, the clerk of the court will promptly schedule the case for trial and notify the parties of the trial date: for example, the clerk sent out a trial notice in this case less than two weeks after the trial de novo demand was filed. Consequently, even though <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) requires both filing and service of a trial de novo demand to be made within thirty days, a delay in satisfaction of the service requirement does not have the same deleterious effect upon efficient administration of the arbitration program as a failure to file the demand within time. Therefore, we conclude that the requirement that a trial de novo demand be served within thirty days, may be relaxed upon a showing of good cause and the absence of prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\"><em>[Flett, supra, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 133-34, 824 A.2d 264.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In <em>Flett, </em>we found good cause to extend the thirty day deadline where an attorney directed his secretary to file the de novo demand, she prepared the papers to mail to plaintiffs attorney the next day, but she suffered a broken wrist that evening and did not return to work for a month. <em>Flett </em>relied in part on our earlier decision in <em>Corcoran, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In <em>Corcoran, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340-43, 771 A.2d 707, we held that the doctrine of substantial compliance applied to the service requirement under <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1). In that case defendant\u2019s counsel timely filed and served the de novo demand, but his secretary mailed the demand to plaintiffs former trial counsel rather than to plaintiffs new counsel. Defendant\u2019s counsel discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ered the error and served a copy of the demand on the correct attorney three days after the thirty day period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"><em>Corcoran </em>relied on a series of cases in which the doctrine of substantial compliance was applied to service of an affidavit of merit, <em>Mayfield v. Community Med. Assocs., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 762 A.2d 237 (App.Div.2000), service of a new trial motion, <em>Stegmeier v. St. Elizabeth Hosp., </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 571 A.2d 1006 (App.Div.1990), and even late filing of a de novo demand, <em>Gerzsenyi v. Richardson, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>213, 511 A.2d 699 (App.Div.1986), where the notice was mailed to the court within time but arrived one day after the thirty day period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In <em>Corcoran, </em>we recognized that an earlier case, <em>Jones v. First National Supermarkets, Inc., supra, </em>held that the service requirement was to be strictly enforced. But we distinguished <em>Jones, </em>because in that case counsel had not attempted to make timely service within the thirty day time limit. <em>Corcoran, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 341, 771 A.2d 707. <em>See also Flett, supra, </em>(noting that \u201cthe party seeking a trial de novo in <em>Jones </em>did not offer any excuse whatsoever for failing to serve the demand in a timely manner.\u201d 361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 131, 824 A.2d 264.) We conclude, as we did in <em>Corcoran, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 341-43, 771 A.2d 707, that the doctrine of substantial compliance can be invoked to extend the thirty day time limit for serving the de novo demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">With this conclusion in mind, we find two errors in the trial court\u2019s decision. First, there was clearly a factual dispute as to whether Shulman mailed the de novo notice to plaintiff\u2019s law firm. At her deposition Shulman staunchly insisted that she had personally mailed the de novo notice to plaintiffs law firm. Plaintiffs counsel certified that they did not receive the notice. If this were the critical fact in the case, as the trial judge believed it to be, then it would have been error to decide it without holding a testimonial hearing. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) However, in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that this dispute of fact was not material. Even accepting plaintiffs\u2019 version of the facts, i.e., that Shulman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>mistakenly mailed them a deposition notice instead of the de novo demand, we conclude that defendants substantially complied with the service requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Corcoran, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 342, 771 A.2d 707; <em>Flett, supra, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 132-33, 824 A.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">To establish substantial compliance, defendants were required to show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">(1) the lack of prejudice to the defending party; (2) a series of steps taken to comply with the statute involved; (3) a general compliance with the purpose of the statute; (4) a reasonable notice of petitioner\u2019s claim, and (5) a reasonable explanation why there was not a strict compliance with the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\"><em>[Corcoran, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 343, 771 A.2d 707 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">We conclude that they satisfied this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In their appellate brief, as in their argument ^before the trial court, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel implicitly concede that Farina intended to serve them with the notice and that he instructed Shulman to send out the notice. Plaintiffs do not claim that the Cullen firm intentionally refrained from serving them with the de novo notice. Rather, they contend that due to \u201csloppy lawyering,\u201d the Cullen firm accidentally sent out a deposition notice instead of the de novo notice. Likewise, at oral argument, defense counsel conceded that he did not doubt his adversary\u2019s word that his firm did not receive the de novo notice. Therefore, either the notice was mailed but went astray in the post office, or Shulman accidentally put the wrong document in the envelope. Neither scenario would change the result we reach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel learned, within a few days after the thirty day time limit had run, that his adversary had filed the de novo demand with the court. He also contemporaneously received a copy of that notice by fax from the clerk\u2019s office. At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel candidly conceded that his client was not prejudiced by the five-day delay in receipt of the notice. And the court was not delayed in scheduling a trial, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>demand was timely filed. <em>Flett, supra, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 134, 824 A.2d 264. Further, under all the circumstances, receipt of the deposition notice within the thirty day window for filing a de novo demand should have put plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on notice that their adversary had probably filed the demand. Why would defense counsel have served a deposition notice if the litigation was not going to continue? When he called the court, discovered that the de novo notice had been filed, and received a faxed copy together with the certification of service, counsel should have contacted his adversary to alert him to a possible error. Instead, de novo notice in hand, counsel filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">As the Supreme Court held in an analogous case concerning the Affidavit of Merit statute, <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) \u201cwas not intended to encourage gamesmanship or a slavish adherence to form over substance. The [rule] was not intended to reward [parties] who wait for a default\u201d before bringing an error to the other side\u2019s attention. <em>Ferreira v. Rancocas Orthopedic Assocs., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>144, 154, 836 A.2d 779 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that there was substantial compliance with the thirty day service requirement. Defense counsel made a good faith attempt to serve the document within the thirty day time limit, even if the wrong document was inadvertently placed in the envelope. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel received a deposition notice within the thirty day window, which should have placed them on notice that the litigation would be continuing. They received actual notice, and a copy of the demand, within a few days after the thirty day limit expired. And the delay has caused no prejudice. <em>Corcoran, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 343, 771 A.2d 707; <em>Flett, supra, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 134, 824 A.2d 264.
