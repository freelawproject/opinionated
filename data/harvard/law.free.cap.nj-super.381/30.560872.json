We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">By way of background, on March 23, 2004, Bent filed a request for public records with the Stafford Township Custodian of Records. In this request, which consisted of five subparts lettered \u201ca\u201d through \u201ce\u201d, Bent sought documents comprising the \u201centire file\u201d of his criminal investigation conducted jointly by the Stafford Township Police Department (STPD), the United States Attorney for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>New Jersey, and a special agent of the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, Bent requested that the custodian provide him with \u201cthe factual basis underlying documented action and advice to third parties to act against my interest [having] been credited to SPD under a Federal Grand Jury credit card investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On March 30,2004, the custodian responded by letter, specifically addressing the OPRA requests Bent listed in each of the five subparts of the March 23, 2004 request form. As to requests, \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d, the custodian explained that complete copies, of the two police files maintained by STPD had been provided previously to Bent, and further, that requests \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d consisted of statements, investigation theory and opinions, which are not \u201cgovernment records\u201d under OPRA. As to the final request \u201ce\u201d, the custodian advised that records of Ocean County grand jury subpoenas were sent directly to federal agents and, therefore, could not be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Bent filed two supplementary requests, on March 29, 2004, and April 2, 2004. As to the former, the custodian advised that the STPD was not required under OPRA to respond because the correspondence contained a series of opinions, interpretations and statements, and not a request for government records. Likewise, the latter request also failed to request any new records and merely posed a series of questions. Therefore, the custodian considered Bent\u2019s OPRA request closed and informed Bent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the STPD would not respond to further repetitive requests for the same records.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On May 3, 2004, Bent filed a \u201ccomplaint form\u201d with the Stafford Township Mayor\u2019s Office, complaining of misconduct committed by the STPD and the custodian in the handling of his OPRA requests. Specifically, Bent claimed that the custodian had not provided the \u201centire SPD file\u201d as he had requested previously. Thereafter, on June 16, 2004, Bent filed a \u201cdenial of access\u201d complaint with the GRC repeating the allegations contained in the May 3, 2004 Stafford Township Mayor\u2019s Office complaint form, alleging that the custodian did not respond to his request and withheld records in the file without explanation. The custodian responded, in part, with a certification to the effect that copies of all Stafford Township records relating to Bent\u2019s criminal investigation have previously been provided to Bent, and that the balance of his claim was not a legitimate OPRA request for records, but rather for interpretations and opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">On October 14, 2004, the GRC\u2019s Executive Director recommended dismissal of Bent\u2019s complaint because the custodian properly addressed Bent\u2019s OPRA request. Specifically, the Executor Director concluded that although the May 3, 2004 correspondence may have constituted an OPRA documents request under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1, the information sought did not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cgovernment record,\u201d and hence, there was no denial of access. As to Bent\u2019s argument that the custodian <em>should </em>have maintained specific documents on file, the Executive Director found that OPRA does not specify the types of records \u201crequired by law or regulation to be \u2018... made, maintained and kept on file ...\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On October 14, 2004, the GRC voted unanimously to accept the Executive Director\u2019s \u201cFindings and Recommendations,\u201d and issued a final decision dismissing Bent\u2019s complaint. On appeal, Bent argues that the requested information constitutes non-ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>empt public records subject to disclosure under OPRA and required to be maintained in the township\u2019s files. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">OPRA embodies the public policy of New Jersey that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">government records shall be readily accessible for inspection, copying, or examination by the citizens of this State, with certain exceptions, for the protection of the public interest, and any limitations on the right of access accorded by [OPRA] ... shall be construed in favor of the public\u2019s right of access____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">OPRA takes the place of the former Right to Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-2 to -4, repealed by <em>L. </em>2001, c. 404, and continues \u201cthe State\u2019s longstanding public policy favoring ready access to most public records.\u201d <em>Serrano v. S. Brunswick Tp., </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 363, 817 A.2d 1004 (App.Div.2003). Thus, \u201call government records shall be subject to public access unless exempt.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1. On this score, the custodian of the government record has the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Although expansive, OPRA\u2019s definition of \u201cgovernment record\u201d demarks the outer limits of the statute\u2019s reach. Importantly, OPRA limits its definition of \u201cgovernment record\u201d to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIj\">any paper, written or printed book, document, drawing, map, plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document, information stored or maintained electronically or by sound-recording or in a similar device, or any copy thereof, that has been made, maintained or kept on file in the course of ... official business ... or that has been received in the course of ... official business ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">This definition is not as broad as the common law definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d. <em>Bergen County Improvement Auth. v. N. Jersey Media Group, Inc., </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 509-10, 851 A.2d 731 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>143, 861 A.2d 847 (2004). Moreover, OPRA affirmatively excludes from such definition twenty-one separate categories of information, <em>N.J.SA </em>47:1A-1.1, thereby \u201csignificantly reduc[ing] the universe of publicly-accessible information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516-17, 851 A.2d 731. For instance, OPRA directs State custodians of public records to deny access to documents that are exempt from disclosure under federal law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(a), -9. Another exemption shields from disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sure documents \u201cdeliberative in nature, containing opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies,\u201d and \u201cgenerated before the adoption of an agency\u2019s policy or decision.\u201d <em>Gannett New Jersey Partners L.P. v. County of Middlesex, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 219, 877 A.2d 330 (App.Div.2005); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Significantly for present purposes, OPRA only allows requests for records, not requests for information. <em>See MAG Entm\u2019t, LLC v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 546-49, 868 A.2d 1067 (App.Div.2005). In this regard, OPRA \u201cis not intended as a research tool ... to force government officials to identify and siphon useful information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 868 A.2d 1067. In other words, a records custodian is not required \u201cto conduct research among its records ... and correlate data from various government records in the custodian\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47, 868 A.2d 1067. (internal citation omitted). To qualify under OPRA then, the request must reasonably identify a record and not generally data, information or statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Nor does OPRA \u201cauthorize a party to make a blanket request for every document\u201d a public agency has on file. <em>See Gannett, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213, 877 A.2d 330. Rather, a party requesting access to a public record under OPRA must specifically describe the document sought. <em>Ibid.; see also MAG Entm\u2019t, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 546-49, 868 A.2d 1067. OPRA operates to make identifiable government records \u201creadily accessible for inspection, copying, or examination.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1. As such, a proper request under OPRA must identify with reasonable clarity those documents that are desired, and a party cannot satisfy this requirement by simply requesting <em>all </em>of an agency\u2019s documents. OPRA does not authorize unbridled searches of an agency\u2019s property. In fact, if a request \u201cwould substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny ... [it and] ... attempt[ ] to reach a reasonable solution ... that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In the event access is denied, the GRC, within the Department of Community Affairs, is the administrative body charged with adjudicating OPRA disputes. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-7(b) provides, in part, that the GRC shall \u201creceive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian.\u201d The purpose of its adjudicatory proceedings is to \u201c... render a decision as to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access ...\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Here, the GRC properly applied these governing principles in concluding there was no denial of access under OPRA. In the first place, to the extent Bent\u2019s request was for discrete records of the 1992 criminal investigation conducted by the STPD, the undisputed evidence is that there was full disclosure of all such documents in the custodian\u2019s possession. Second, to the extent Bent\u2019s request was for records that either did not exist or were not in the custodian\u2019s possession, there was, of necessity, no denial of access at all.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Of course, even if the requested documents did exist, the custodian was under no obligation to search for them beyond the township\u2019s files. OPRA applies solely to documents \u201cmade, maintained or kept on file in the course of [a public agency\u2019s] official business,\u201d as well as any document \u201creceived in the course of [the agency\u2019s] official business.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. Contrary to Bent\u2019s assertion, although OPRA mandates that \u201call government records ... be subject to public access unless exempt,\u201d the statute itself neither specifies nor directs the type of record that is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201cmade, maintained or kept on file\u201d. <em>Ibid. </em>In fact, in interpreting OPRA\u2019s predecessor statute, the Right to Know Law, we found no requirement in the law concerning \u201cthe making, maintaining or keeping on file the results of an investigation by a law enforcement official or agency into the alleged commission of a criminal offense.\u201d <em>River Edge Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Hyland, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 545, 398 A.2d 912 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>58, 404 A.2d 1157 (1979). <em>See also, State v. Marshall, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>89, 273-75, 690 A.2d 1 (1997); <em>Daily Journal v. Police Dep\u2019t of City of Vineland, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 122-23, 797 A.2d 186 (App.Div.2002). Thus, even if the requested documents did exist in the files of outside agencies, Bent has made no showing that they were, by law, required to be \u201cmade, maintained or kept on file\u201d by the custodian so as to justify any relief or remedy under OPRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We do not view the balance of Bent\u2019s request to be a proper request for public records under OPRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(f) provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency,\u201d which \u201cshall provide space for ... a brief description of the government record sought.\u201d Here, Bent\u2019s general request for \u201cinformation\u201d neither identifies nor describes with any specificity or particularity the records sought. In his May 3, 2004, correspondence, Bent made no request for specific documents. Instead, he sought the custodian\u2019s response to his allegation of police misconduct, borne of his belief that certain unidentified and unnamed documents on file with the township were wrongfully concealed or withheld from him. For example, Bent sought \u201cthird party documents, which had been denied or withheld, and are missing from the \u2018entire [Stafford Police Department] file\u2019 \u201d; and documents confirming the police department\u2019s \u201cself interests and bad faith\u201d as well as its \u201coppressive use of authority.\u201d In essence, Bent sought general information to support his unsubstantiated claim of police misconduct. Such a request neither specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>describes the documents sought, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(f), nor seeks access to a public record, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. On the contrary, this open-ended demand requires analysis and evaluation which the agency is under no obligation to provide, instead of document disclosure authorized by OPRA. <em>See MAG Entm\u2019t, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 546-49, 868 A.2d 1067. It also seeks matters \u201cdeliberative in nature, containing opinions,\u201d interpretations and \u201cadvice about agency policies,\u201d specifically exempted from disclosure under OPRA. <em>Gannett, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 219, 877 A.2d 330. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. We conclude, therefore, that Bent\u2019s request is not a proper request for public records under OPRA, and the information it seeks is beyond the statutory reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Lastly, we simply note that the only issue properly before us on appeal is the propriety of the GRC\u2019s dismissal of Bent\u2019s \u201cdenial of access\u201d complaint. His underlying claim of police misconduct was not within the GRC\u2019s province to resolve, and thus, the GRC properly declined to address the issue. And, of course, an issue not resolved by the GRC is not properly before us on appeal. <em>Murphy v. Mayor Gerald Luongo, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>260, 268, 768 A.2d 814 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The GRC correctly limited its determination to whether the information requested constituted a government record within the meaning of OPRA and whether an unlawful denial of access had occurred. The GRC\u2019s determination in this regard, involving as it does an interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering, and with which we are in substantial accord, is entitled to great weight. <em>In re Dist. of Liquid Assets, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 773 A.2d 6 (2001); <em>Kasper v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Ann. Fund, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>564, 580-81, 754 A.2d 525 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\"> Apparently shortly after the STPD investigation commenced, it was transferred to the United States Attorney's Office on April 15, 1992 following which the role of the STPD was limited to assisting federal investigators. Ultimately, in September 1998, Bent, a former Stafford Township Committeeman and a certified public accountant, pled guilty to a single count of filing a false 1988 personal income tax return in violation of 26 <em>U.S.CA. </em>\u00a7 7206. Shortly thereafter, on May 31, 1999, Bent filed a complaint in Superior Court against Stafford Township and other individuals, alleging malicious prosecution and violations of his federal and state constitutional rights due to their involvement in the 1992 search of his home and cooperation with federal prosecutors. The summary judgment dismissal of this lawsuit was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\"> A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of record may, alternatively, \"institute a proceeding to challenge the custodian's decision\", in the Law Division. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> Indeed, Bent offers no competent proof to the contrary, but simply assumes their existence based on his own review and interpretation of IRS and other \"third party\u201d documents generated by the federal investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
