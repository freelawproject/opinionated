She became involved in an accident with Thanh Tran from which she sustained injuries. At the time of the accident, plaintiff did not live with her parents and was not a named insured on any automobile insurance policy. When the Haefeles purchased their policy, they elected the no limitation on liability option with limits of $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident, and underinsured motorist coverage with the same liability limits. These elections were reflected on the declaration page.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Plaintiff sued Tran for her personal injuries and settled for $50,000, the maximum liability under Tran\u2019s insurance policy. Plaintiff then filed an underinsured motorist claim with AIIC. AIIC denied the claim because plaintiff was neither a named insured nor a resident family member. In addition, the policy\u2019s step-down clause limited recovery to the statutory minimum for persons other than the named insured or resident family members. At the time of the accident, the statutory minimum coverage required for a claimant seeking underinsured motorist benefits was $15,000 per person, $30,000 per accident. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1. Since plaintiff was neither a named insured nor resident family member, and had received greater than the statutory minimum in her settlement with Tran, AIIC determined plaintiff was not entitled to any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Plaintiff filed a single-count declaratory judgment action against AIIC seeking an order declaring that plaintiff was a \u201cfamily member\u201d pursuant to the terms of the policy and was therefore not subject to the step-down provision. Plaintiff later amended the complaint to include a second count seeking a declaration that the terms of the policy were ambiguous and therefore the limits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>underinsured motorist coverage should be the same as those afforded to the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff, as a non-resident relative, was subject to the step-down provision, and because the settlement with Tran exceeded the statutory minimum limits for coverage, plaintiff was not entitled to receive any recovery under the Haefeles\u2019 policy. Plaintiff opposed the motion arguing that the terms of the policy were ambiguous, first, because the step-down clause was hidden in the fine print of the uninsured motorist endorsement and was not included on the policy\u2019s declaration page, and second, because the step-down clause referenced only uninsured motorists and not underinsured motorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Judge William C. Todd, III, rejected plaintiffs argument. Although he acknowledged some facial ambiguity or confusion on the title page of the \u201cUninsured Motorist\u201d endorsement, he noted that the terms \u201cuninsured\u201d and \u201cunderinsured\u201d were referenced throughout the endorsement. He concluded there was no meaningful ambiguity or confusion. He also noted there had been no suggestion that the Haefeles \u201cwere given some specific advice or representation\u201d that the scope of coverage extended to all occupants of their vehicles. Finally, Judge Todd found the provisions of the step-down clause \u201cclearly appear[ed] to apply to someone in the plaintiffs position,\u201d that is, the provisions applied to a driver who was neither a named insured nor resident family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The disputed language in the step-down clause was part of a four-page endorsement to the fifteen-page policy. The endorsement section was captioned, \u201cUNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE \u2014 NEW JERSEY.\u201d Just above this caption, the language read, \u201cThis endorsement changes the policy. Please Read It Carefully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The step-down language was set forth on the second page of the endorsement under Section A entitled \u201cLIMIT OF LIABILITY.\u201d The specific language set forth in this section stated, \u201c[wjith respect to any \u2018insured\u2019 who is not a named insured or \u2018family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>member\u2019 under this policy, our maximum limit of liability for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 is the minimum limit required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1.\u201d A family member under the policy was defined as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household. This includes a ward or foster child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">It is well settled that insurance policies are contracts of adhesion and are therefore scrutinized with particularity. <em>Zacarias v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 594-95, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001). Where there is any ambiguity in the terms and conditions of the contract, \u201cambiguous language will be construed liberally and resolved against the insurer and in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Pinto v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 387, 839 A.2d 134 (App.Div.2004), <em>aff'd, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>405, 874 A.2d 520 (2005). In doing so, our \u201ccourts have endorsed the principle of giving effect to the \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 of the insured for the purpose of rendering a \u2018fair interpretation\u2019 of the boundaries of insurance coverage.\u201d <em>Di Orio v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>257, 269, 398 A.2d 1274 (1979) (citing <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482-83, 170 A.2d 22 (1961)). \u201cThus, the insured\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 are brought to bear on misleading terms and conditions of insurance contracts and genuine ambiguities are resolved against the insurer.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Remsden v. Dependable Ins. Co., </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>587, 589, 367 A.2d 421 (1976); <em>Bryan Constr. Co. v. Employers\u2019 Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>375, 377-78, 290 A.2d 138 (1972); <em>Gerhardt v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Cos., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>291, 298-300, 225 A.2d 328 (1966)). Under this approach, courts seek to interpret the ambiguous language of the insurance contract objectively and from the perspective of the average policyholder, as far as the language of the insurance contract will permit. <em>See Perrine v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>120, 126-27, 265 A.2d 521 (1970); <em>Cooper v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>86, 93-94, 237 A.2d 870 (1968); <em>Linden Motor Freight Co. Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>511, 524-526, 193 A.2d 217 (1963). <em>See also Karl v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 186, 381 A.2d 62 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>On the other hand, it is equally well settled that notwithstanding the unequal bargaining power between an insurance company and an insured, \u201c[i]f the policy language is clear, the policy should be interpreted as written.\u201d <em>Nav-Its, Inc. v. Selective Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>110, 118, 869 A.2d 929 (2005) (citing <em>President v. Jenkins, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>550, 562, 853 A.2d 247 (2004)). Where the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, it is not the function of the courts to rewrite the policy \u201cto make a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 670, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999) (quoting <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990)). These principles have been applied to enforce step-down provisions in insurance policies, provided the provisions are expressed in clear and unambiguous language. <em>Murawski v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>423, 874 A.2d 530, <em>Pinto v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>405, 874 A.2d 520 (2005), <em>Magnifico v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>406, 710 A.2d 412 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Plaintiff urges that the ambiguity in the policy issued to the Haefeles is evident by the fact that the only reference to the step-down clause is buried on page two of the four-page endorsement. Additionally, the step-down clause refers to a statute rather than to a specific monetary amount. Plaintiff maintains that there is stark contrast between the ambiguous step-down clause language, including its location, and the clear language contained on the declaration page. On the declaration page, the insured is advised that coverage for bodily injury and uninsured motorist coverage limitations per person, per accident, is $100,000/$300,000 and there is no asterisk or other signal directing the insured to the step-down clause. Thus, plaintiff contends the court is required under <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Cas. Sur. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994), to conclude that the declaration page must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In <em>Lehrhoff, </em>the plaintiff filed an uninsured motorist claim with AETNA for injuries sustained while he was in California. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 638 A.2d 889. The insurance policy was issued to plaintiffs father, but it also listed plaintiff as a \u201cregular driver\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>declaration page. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition to the named insured, the policy also covered any family member residing in the insured\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 638 A.2d 889. A family member was defined as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident of your household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 638 A.2d 889. AETNA denied the claim because it determined plaintiff was no longer a resident in his father\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 638 A.2d 889. Plaintiff commenced a declaratory action to compel coverage and defendant moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion, agreeing that plaintiff was no longer a resident of the insured\u2019s household because he had left New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 638 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On appeal, we recognized that plaintiff was no longer a member of his father\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 638 A.2d 889. Our attention, however, focused upon the interaction between the declaration page and the policy and upon the reasonable expectations arising out of that interaction. <em>Id. </em>at 346-47, 638 A.2d 889. We concluded the listing of plaintiff on the declaration page was dispositive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">An important corollary of the reasonable-expectation doctrine ... is that reasonable expectations mil, in appropriate circumstances, prevail over policy language to the contrary. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">The natural, sensible and wholly justifiable inference is that by listing the drivers using the vehicle, including the insured himself, the purchaser of the policy is protecting all of them equally[.] ... [Njothing in the declaration page suggests to the contrary[.] .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 347, 349, 638 A.2d 889.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\"><em>Lehrhoff, </em>however, does not establish a bright line rule that the declaration page controls where important additional terms of the policy are not included on the declaration page but are reflected elsewhere. <em>Zacarias, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 603, 775 A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">In <em>Zacarias, </em>plaintiffs spouse was injured while on board the family boat that plaintiff was operating. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 775 A.2d 1262. An intra-family exclusion provision within plaintiffs insurance policy precluded coverage for the injuries sustained by plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>spouse. <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff filed a declaratory action seeking to void the intra-family exclusion, or alternatively, seeking indemnification because the insurance company failed to properly notify plaintiff of the intra-family exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 775 A.2d 1262. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied plaintiffs motion, but granted defendant\u2019s motion finding no ambiguity in the language of the policy. A divided Appellate Division panel affirmed. <em>Zacarias v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 749 A.2d 394 (App.Div.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001). The Supreme Court affirmed, and in doing so, discerned that two rules had emerged from the body of cases addressing insurance contracts and the reasonable expectations of the insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">First, in enforcing an insurance policy, courts will depart from the literal text and interpret it in accordance with the insured\u2019s understanding, even when that understanding contradicts the insurer\u2019s intent, if the text appears overly technical or contains hidden pitfalls, <em>Kievit, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 482 [170 A.2d 22], cannot be understood without employing subtle or legalistic distinctions, <em>id. </em>at 488 [170 A.2d 22], is obscured by fine print, <em>Gerhardt, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 293 [225 A.2d 328], or requires strenuous study to comprehend, <em>Sparks [v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 839, 495 A.2d 406 (1985)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">Second, the plain terms of the contract will be enforced if the \u201centangled and professional interpretation of an insurance underwriter is [not] pitted against that of an average purchaser of insurance,\u201d <em>Di Orio, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 270 [398 A.2d 1274], or the provision is not so \u201cconfusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage,\u201d <em>Weedo [v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 247, 405 A.2d 788 (1979)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\"><em>[Zacarias, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 775 A.2d 1262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Court emphasized that the declaration page is the one page an insured is most likely to read and therefore insurers should \u201cexplore ways to incorporate as much information as may be reasonably included in the declarations sheet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 775 A.2d 1262. The Court, however, refused to endorse a per se rule that an insurance contract is ambiguous solely because its declarations sheet, definitions section, and exclusion provisions are separately presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">A rule of construction forcing insurers to avoid all cross-referencing in policies would require them to reprint the entire definition section on each page of the policy, or to define each term every time it is used. That proliferation of fine print <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>would itself demand strenuous study and run the risk of making insurance policies more difficult for the average insured to understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 603, 775 A.2d 1262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Thus, the question of whether an insurance policy is ambiguous is not resolved by focusing upon the language contained in one section of the contract. <em>Werner Indus., Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 37, 548 A.2d 188 (1988). Instead, the offending section should be read in the context of the entire policy in order to determine whether harmony can be found between the alleged ambiguous language and the remainder of the policy. <em>Zacarias, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 603, 775 A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In this case, the step-down provision is found under the section designated in capital letters as \u201cLIMIT OF LIABILITY.\u201d Within that section are five subsections separated by letters. The step-down clause is set forth in Section A, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFo\">A. The limit of Bodily Injury Liability shown in the Schedule or Declarations for each person for Uninsured Motorists Coverage is our maximum limit of liability for all damages, including damages for care, loss of services or death, arising out of \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by any one person in any one accident. Subject to this limit for each person, the limit of Bodily Injury Liability shown in the Schedule or Declarations for each accident for Uninsured Motorists Coverage is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for \u201cbodily injury\u201d resulting from any one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">The limit of Property Damage Liability shown in the Schedule or Declarations for each accident for Uninsured Motorists Coverage is our maximum limit of liability for all \u201cproperty damage\u201d resulting from any one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">However, with respect to any \u201cinsured\u201d who is not a named insured or \u201cfamily member\u201d under this policy, our maximum limit of liability for \u201cbodily injury\u201d is the minimum limit required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">All the words set off in quotation marks are defined on the policy\u2019s definitions page. Unlike the first two paragraphs of this section that specifically address uninsured motorist coverage, the third paragraph makes no reference to either uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. Rather, it simply and clearly states that the insurer\u2019s liability as to any insured who is not a named insured or resident family member is the minimum amount contained in the specifically identified statute. Further, although the first page of the four-page endorsement is captioned \u201cUninsured Motorists,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>there is reference throughout the endorsement to both uninsured and underinsured motorists. Because the step-down provision mentions neither class of drivers, it reasonably follows that the step-down provision applies to underinsured motorists as well as uninsured motorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Plaintiffs reliance upon <em>Skeete v. Dorvius, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 845 A.2d 1265 (App.Div.2004), <em>aff'd </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>5, 875 A.2d 859 (2005), is misplaced. There, we found that the notice to the insured of the step-down language was inadequate. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 845 A.2d 1265. It was included in the renewal policy that was part of a 200-page document sent to the insured over a two-week period. <em>Ibid. </em>Our reasoning in <em>Skeete </em>reflects the longstanding elemental principle of \u201cbusiness morality and decency\u201d articulated by Justice Jacobs in <em>Bauman v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>12, 174 A.2d 585 (1961), that \u201c[a]bsent notification that there have been changes in the restrictions, conditions or limitations of the policy, the insured is justly entitled to assume that they remain the same and that his coverage has not in anywise been lessened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 174 A.2d 585 Here, however, the step-down language in the Haefeles\u2019 policy was contained in the original policy. As such, the Haefeles were subject to another elemental \u201cprinciple of business morality and decency,\u201d namely, \u201c[w]hen an insured purchases an original policy of insurance he may be expected to read it and the law may fairly impose upon him such restrictions, conditions and limitations as the average insured would ascertain from such reading.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Greer v. Naklicki, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 164, 877 A.2d 298 (App.Div.2005). Likewise, we continue to adhere to the maxim that an insured is chargeable with knowledge of the contents of \u201can insurance policy in the absence of fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the carrier.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Prudential Prop. and Cas. Co., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 204, 814 A.2d 1115 (App.Div.2003) (citing <em>Merchants Indem. Corp. v. Eggleston, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>114, 121-22, 179 A.2d 505 (1962)), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>278, 822 A.2d 608 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The Haefeles do not state they failed to read the policy, nor do they indicate that defendant, through any agent or representative, led them to believe the scope of their coverage was extended to all occupants of their vehicle. They simply state their understanding was that the scope of their coverage extended to all occupants. As the Court similarly observed in <em>Zacarias, </em>the policy here is far from perfect. While it may have been more prudent to specifically direct the insured to the step-down language, the entire policy consisted of only fifteen pages. Moreover, the definitions page, in clear and simplistic language, defined \u201cinsured\u201d and \u201cfamily member.\u201d The step-down language clearly stated that coverage for bodily injury was limited for persons other than the named insured or resident family member. Additionally, the step-down language was contained in the section with the capitalized heading, \u201cLIMITS OF LIABILITY.\u201d This heading would alert the average insured that coverage was being limited, and therefore the average insured would have read the provision. <em>Bauman, supra, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 174 A.2d 585. Consequently, when the policy is read in its entirety, it clearly places the insured on notice of the coverage limitations. <em>Zacarias, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 603, 775 A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Plaintiff also advances the claim that AIIC breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to: (1) reflect the \u201cchange\u201d in the declaration sheet; (2) send separate correspondence; or (3) orally notify the Haefeles of the step-down clause. We find no merit to this claim for two reasons. First, as discussed earlier, the step-down clause was included in the original policy issued to the Haefeles. Second, nothing in the amended policy issued to the Haefeles supports the conclusion that defendant acted with \u201cbad motive or intention\u201d in the drafting or placement of the step-down language. <em>Wilson v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>236, 251, 773 A. 2d 1121 (2001). As the Supreme Court recently stated in <em>Brunswick v. Route 18 Shopping Ctr., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>210, 864 A.2d 387 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">Proof of \u201cbad motive or intention\u201d is vital to an action for breach of the covenant. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 251 [773 A.2d 1121]. The party claiming a breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u201cmust provide evidence sufficient to support a conclusion that the party alleged to have acted in bad faith has engaged in some conduct that denied the benefit of the bargain originally intended by the parties.\u201d <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>63:22, at 513-14 (Lord ed.2002) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Wilson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 251 [773 A.2d 1121]; <em>Sons of Thunder v. Borden, Inc., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>396, 420 [690 A.2d 575] (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">[Id. at 225, 864 A.2d 387.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Although the uninsured motorist endorsement section indicates that the endorsement amendment was effective March 1999, there was never any contention that defendant inserted this amendment without notice and then subsequently issued the amendment in a renewal policy sent to the Haefeles. <em>Skeete, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 319, 845 A.2d 1265. No evidence was presented suggesting the step-down language was hidden. The clause was one of seven. It immediately followed the \u201cINSURING AGREEMENT\u201d and \u201cEXCLUSIONS\u201d and preceded \u201cOTHER INSURANCE,\u201d \u201cARBITRATION,\u201d \u201cADDITIONAL DUTIES,\u201d and \u201cOUR RIGHT TO RECOVER PAYMENT\u201d (capitalization in original). The typeface was the same size as that of the other provisions contained in the policy and the clause was only five lines long. Further, there is no evidence that AIIC positioned the clauses or provisions with the intent to deceive or mislead the insured. Therefore, when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, no genuinely disputed issue of fact was presented to the motion judge sufficient to withstand the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant on the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim. <em>Brill v.
