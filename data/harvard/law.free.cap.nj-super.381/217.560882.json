For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Plaintiffs sued their neighbors, John and Rebecca Reed, together with a number of other individuals and entities (collectively defendants)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, in a dispute over use of a common driveway by easement shared by the Jennings and the Reeds. In their seventeen-count complaint, plaintiffs alleged that defendants repeatedly trespassed, tore down and removed mature trees, shrubs, flora and grass; changed the grade of, and fresh water runoff on, the rear portion of their property; dumped excavated dirt and debris in the same location without permission; and engaged in a conspiracy designed to annoy, harass and intimidate them. Defendants answered, denying these allegations and asserting various defenses and counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Following discovery, unsuccessful mediation, weeks of settlement conferences involving exchanges of draft proposals, and adjournment of the first trial date, a peremptory trial date was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>fixed for January 26, 2004. On January 22, 2004, the eve of trial, as a result of a final settlement conference conducted by the judge, the attorneys for the parties negotiated a settlement. The settlement discussions lasted more than three-and-one-half hours during which Ralph Jennings (Jennings) participated with counsel and successfully negotiated alterations to the agreement. At the conclusion of negotiations, counsel advised Jennings not to sign the settlement agreement if he believed it was achieved through duress. Jennings proceeded to execute the settlement agreement on behalf of himself and his wife, Sylvia, who was not present at the conference. The settlement agreement was then placed on the record, but outside the presence of Jennings, who by then had left the courthouse to call another attorney and to visit his psychiatrist across the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">More than three weeks later, on February 17, 2004, plaintiffs on their own sent an ex parte letter to the judge indicating displeasure with the settlement, although failing to identify any provision or term thereof with which they disagreed. Yet, despite their expressed objection and the court\u2019s rejection of their ex parte communication as improper, plaintiffs never thereafter moved to vacate the settlement. Instead, on February 18, 2004, their counsel sought to be relieved from further representation, and two days later, on February 20, 2004, defendants cross-moved to enforce the agreement. By order of April 30, 2004, counsel\u2019s request was granted, but defendants\u2019 enforcement motion was adjourned to allow plaintiffs time to obtain substitute counsel and file opposition, which they did on May 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition was based on the dual claims that Jennings lacked both the mental capacity to consent and the authority to consent on behalf of the absent Sylvia. In support of these claims, plaintiffs submitted four certifications: one from each of them; one from their \u201cpersonal\u201d lawyer, Steven Caputo; and one from Ralph\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Jay Kuris. Although he admits being \u201cgiven the authority to negotiate a settlement on [Sylvia\u2019s] behalf\u2019, Jennings certified that he \u201c... signed the settlement even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>I did not agree to it ...and \u201c... made it abundantly clear to my counsel that I believed I was being coerced into signing the settlement agreement____\u201d Likewise, although she too did not deny giving her husband authority to negotiate a settlement, Sylvia insisted she did not \u201cauthorize[ ] anyone ... to enter any settlement <em>on the record </em>and \u201c... did not approve of the [settlement terms]\u201d, (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Caputo, who was not plaintiffs\u2019 attorney of record in this matter and never entered an appearance, made a similar distinction, certifying that \u201c... Mrs. Jennings had not given anyone ... the authority to enter a settlement <em>on the record </em>----\u201d (emphasis added). Caputo also certified that he ... confirmed with Sylvia Jennings that the agreement was totally overreaching and unacceptable to her\u201d; and \u201c... determined that she was not in agreement with the settlement agreement ...</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Finally, Dr. Kuris, who examined Jennings shortly after the settlement agreement was executed, opined that he \u201cwas in no condition nor capable of making a rational decision that afternoon.\u201d Dr. Kuris attributed Ralph\u2019s anxiety to a long-standing condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">Due to length of these stressful situations and being forced to endure years of severe emotional stress, beyond which any reasonable person could endure, has resulted in their psychiatric injuries becoming more entrenched and chronic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Defendants did not submit any medical testimony as to Jennings\u2019 mental condition. However, defendants\u2019 attorney filed a certification in which he stated that on the day of settlement, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel advised that Jennings had the authority to negotiate a settlement on behalf of his wife; that many of the changes demanded by Jennings during the conference were incorporated into the final agreement; that Jennings was advised by his counsel not to sign the agreement if under duress; and that Jennings informed his attorney, in the presence of defendants\u2019 counsel, that he was voluntarily signing the agreement. Defendants also point to the record at time of settlement wherein plaintiffs\u2019 counsel informed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Mr. Jennings had instructed me, over the past month, not to engage experts; not to retain experts and pay retainer fees; that it was his intention to settle this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">Mr. Jennings has had more than ample time to weigh this case. He has told me several times that it was going to settle. And this is not the first time that he has engaged with me in a fiery altercation, always all of his doing. I don\u2019t really know what I can do. I made sure that I asked him if he was signing under duress, and he indicated no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">With the consent of both parties, the motion judge decided defendants\u2019 application to enforce settlement on the basis of the certifications, without taking any live testimony. He found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">[G]iven those facts \u2014 which are undisputed \u2014 I find, at least for the purposes of executing that document, that there was apparent authority on behalf of Mr. Jennings to sign on behalf of Mrs. Jennings. I just could not have a situation where, after something is signed on behalf of both \u2014 and there\u2019s no separate representation \u2014 that the second party says well, you know, I was merely consulted. There\u2019s nothing on the record to indicate, again, any separate representation. There\u2019s got to be more than a late claim of ... my husband really didn\u2019t have the authority to b[i]nd me. I think we\u2019d have a very chaotic situation if we allowed that kind of procedure to occur. And the steps were not taken here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">The second operative faet[:] ... [plaintiffs] never moved to fax [sic] a settlement, per se. They initially filed an improper letter with Judge Bernhard, several weeks after the hearing, which he rejected. And it was only when there was a motion to be relieved as counsel that they responded with any indication that there was some dissatisfaction with the settlement, in any formal or legal way. And that was really ... four to six weeks after the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">And then, we have their responses to the motion to enforce.... And even to this day, we have no request for affirmative relief \u2014 a request to void. Just, we have ... the motion to enforce....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">The third fact is that ... nothing, in any of the documents, which claims incompetence \u2014 as that category is traditionally recognized. There is a claim of anxiety . . it\u2019s repeated again and again in all the certifications; that there was a question of anxiety here and whether the ... settlement was signed, as a result of anxiety or severe emotional distress. Again, the word \u201cincompetence\u201d has some meaning. The word \u201clack of capacity.\u201d Those words \u2014 as a result of incompetence or some injury \u2014 have some meaning. Anxiety or emotional distress, in connection with a lawsuit, is something many of us feel; whether you\u2019re trying the case or a party to the ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">Now, with respect to the Kuris certification \u2014 again, assuming it\u2019s true at the momeni^-there is no finding of incompetence in that certification. The reference to the condition \u2014 the anxiety \u2014 again, is a reference to the lawsuit and really, nothing further. And one can draw from that inference that if everybody signs a settlement, then they decide they don\u2019t like and goes running to a physician and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>says the devil made me do it, I think ... we\u2019d be undermining or giving parties a very easy out, with respect to settlements. Again, I\u2019m accepting Dr. Kuris\u2019 statements as true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">But, it does strike me \u2014 without any need for any further hearing \u2014 that these statements; these sets of statements, made under these circumstances, are not the proper foundation for a diagnosis. And when you add to that that the diagnosis is a rather vague one \u2014 not related to any recognized category that I can determine of incompetence, inability to understand, incapacity \u2014 then it appears to me that even accepting the statements as \u2014 even accepting what\u2019s said in here as an accurate rendition of what was said to ... the doctor \u2014 that the affidavit, itself, is not probative on the issue of incompetence of incapacity to the consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On the basis of these findings, the motion judge granted defendants\u2019 application to enforce the settlement. Plaintiffs have appealed, arguing there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d giving rise to an enforceable agreement, and that in holding otherwise, the court erred as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As a threshold matter, we note that the judge, with the consent of the parties, ruled on the basis of conflicting certifications without an evidentiary hearing. We find no deprivation of fundamental fairness in this instance given the parties\u2019 consent to the procedure and, more significantly, because plaintiffs would not be entitled to have the settlement agreement vacated even if they proved their allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">We start with the fundamental principle that \u201c[t]he settlement of litigation ranks high in our public policy.\u201d <em>Jannarone v. W.T. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 476, 168 A.2d 72 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>61, 171 A.2d 147 (1961); <em>see also Nolan v.

Bubb, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 136, 325 A.2d 832 (App.Div.1974). The goal of this policy is \u201c \u2018the notion that the parties to a dispute are in the best position to determine how to resolve a contested matter in a way which is least disadvantageous to everyone.'\u201d\u2019 <em>Peskin v. Peskin, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 275, 638 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>A.2d 849 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub.

Consequently, courts \u201cstrain to give effect to the terms of a settlement wherever possible.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Advocate, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 528, 503 A.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">A settlement between parties to a lawsuit is a contract like any other contract, <em>Nolan, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 472, 577 A.2d 143, which \u201cmay be freely entered into and which a court, absent a demonstration of \u2018fraud or other compelling circumstances,\u2019 should honor and enforce as it does other contracts.\u201d <em>Pascarella, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 124-25, 462 A.2d 186 (quoting <em>Honeywell, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 136, 325 A.2d 832). Consequently, \u201c[i]f a settlement agreement is achieved through coercion, deception, fraud, undue pressure, or unseemly conduct, or if one party was not competent to voluntarily consent thereto, the settlement agreement must be set aside.\u201d <em>Peskin, supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 276, 638 A.2d 849; <em>see also Nolan, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 472, 577 A.2d 143. As to the latter, the longstanding rule is that \u201c \u2018where there is not the mental capacity to comprehend and understand, there is not the capacity to make a valid contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolkoff v. Villane, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 287, 672 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1996) (quoting <em>Hillsdale Nat'l Bank v. Sansone, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 399, 78 A.2d 441 (App.Div.1951)). On this score:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">The lest of capacity to make an agreement ... is, that a man shall have the ability to understand the nature and effect of the act in which he is engaged, and the business he is transacting____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">ri]f the mind be so clouded or perverted by age, disease, or affliction, that he cannot comprehend the business in which he is engaging, then the writing is not his deed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\"><em>[Eaton v. Eaton, </em>37 <em>N.J.L. </em>108, 113 (Sup.Ct.1874).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Clearly, the party seeking to set aside the settlement agreement has the burden of proving his incapacity or incompetence to contract or other extraordinary circumstance sufficient to vitiate the agreement. <em>Wolkoff, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 291-92, 672 A.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Here, plaintiffs contend that Jennings lacked the mental capacity to consent to settle, that he was coerced into agreement, and that settlement occurred under duress. Significantly, plaintiffs make no claim of fraud, deception or mistake. Nor do they allege disagreement over any term of settlement, much less a material one, or failure to obtain the benefit of their bargain. Rather, their claim of duress may be distilled simply into one of apprehension that counsel would have withdrawn absent Jennings\u2019 consent to the agreement. But, here too, there is no allegation that the so-called threat emanated from defendants, their agents, or for that matter, anyone who claims the benefit of the contract. <em>Koewing v. Town of W. Orange, </em>89 <em>N.J.L. </em>589, 541, 99 <em>A. </em>203 (E. &amp; A.1916); <em>Travis v. Unkart, </em>89 <em>N.J.L. </em>571, 572-73, 99 <em>A. </em>320 (E. &amp; A.1916). Nor was the alleged statement attributed to counsel proven wrongful or improper. <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 175 (1981); <em>see also Garshman v. Universal Res. Holding, Inc., </em>641 <em>F.Supp. </em>1359, 1364-66 (D.N.J.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>824 F.2d 223 (3d Cir.1987); <em>Brownell v. Schering Corp., </em>129 <em>F.Supp. </em>879 (D.N.J.1955), aff<em>'d, </em>228 F.2d 624, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 <em>U.S. </em>954, 76 <em>S.Ct. </em>849, 100 <em>L.Ed. </em>1477 (1956); <em>Gobac v. Davis, </em>62 <em>N.J.Super. </em>148, 152-53, 162 A.2d 140 (Law Div.1960). Most importantly, plaintiffs have not established that any such threat by counsel, even if wrongful, subverted Jennings\u2019 free will. <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 175; <em>see also Rubenstein v. Rubenstein, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>359, 366, 120 A.2d 11 (1956); <em>Smith v. Whitman, </em>75 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 241, 183 A.2d 89 (App.Div.1962), <em>modified, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>397, 189 A.2d 15 (1963). On the contrary, Jennings made the deliberate choice to sign the settlement agreement after given the option by counsel of rejecting it. Plaintiffs have simply failed to demonstrate that Jennings\u2019 election among reasonable alternatives was the product of anything other than his own free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">And the fact that Jennings was not present when the settlement was later placed on the record does not suggest otherwise. Indeed, formalization in court is not required. <em>See Davidson v. Davidson, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 551, 477 A.2d 423 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>(Ch.Div.1984). The fact that even an oral agreement is not formalized \u201cupon the record\u201d does not make it any less binding. <em>Pascarella, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 124, 462 A.2d 186. There is no legal requirement that there be court approval in such a case. <em>DeCaro v. DeCaro, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>36, 43, 97 A.2d 658 (1953). The practice of spreading the terms of the agreement upon the record, although a familiar practice, is not a procedural requisite to either its validity or enforcement. In <em>Pascarella, supra, we </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acr\">We adopt these principles as consistent with the announced public policy of the jurisdiction favoring settlement of litigation. Settlements of this nature are entered into daily in our courthouse corridors and conference rooms, the court only aware, until informed of the fact of settlement, that counsel and the parties are working toward that desirable end. Adoption of a principle that such agreements are subject to attack because they were not placed upon the record places in unnecessary jeopardy the very concept of settlement and the process by which settlement of litigation is ordinarily achieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">[190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 124, 462 A.2d 186.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\"><em>Accord Green v. John H. Lewis &amp; Co., </em>436 F.2d 389, 390 (3d Cir.1971); <em>Good v. Pa. R.R. Co., </em>384 A.2d 989, 990 (3d Cir.1967); <em>Main Line Theatres, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., </em>298 F.2d 801, 802-03 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 <em>U.S. </em>939, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1585, 8 <em>L.E.2d </em>807 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Even the failure to execute release documents does not void the original agreement, or render it deficient from the outset. Execution of a release is a mere formality, not essential to formation of the contract of settlement. <em>See Hagrish v. Olson, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 603 A.2d 108 (App.Div.1992) (a settlement agreement which required defendants to pay a stated sum of money and which barred plaintiffs from pursuing an appeal is enforceable <em>even though </em>the plaintiffs failed to execute general releases). <em>See also Bistricer v. Bistricer, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>143, 146, 151-52, 555 A.2d 45 (Ch.Div.1987) (case was held <em>settled </em>at settlement conference where parties agreed on <em>essential terms, </em>notwithstanding plaintiffs numerous objections to the written agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Thus, absent any competent evidence of fraud, coercion or other unseemly conduct, plaintiffs may avoid the settlement only if lacking the mental capacity to make a valid contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>See Wolkoff, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286-87, 672 A.2d 242. However, plaintiffs make no claim that Jennings was without understanding of the terms of the agreement, or otherwise unable to appreciate the nature of the business he was transacting. On the contrary, at the time of execution, Jennings insisted upon, and successfully obtained, modifications to the agreement that benefited plaintiffs. Moreover, nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 medical proofs suggests mental incapacity or incompetence to contract. At the very most, Dr. Kuris opined that Jennings suffered anxiety and emotional trauma due to a longstanding mental condition, but nothing in that diagnosis suggests that Jennings, as a result, was unable to comprehend the nature and extent of his acts. And to the extent Dr. Kuris surmised any further, that Jennings was incapable of making a rational decision, the expert\u2019s conclusion was an impermissible net opinion, <em>In re Yaccarino, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>175, 196-97, 564 A.2d 1184 (1989); <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981); <em>Jimenez v. GNOC Corp., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 542-43, 670 A.2d 24 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>374, 678 A.2d 714 (1996), lacking a sufficient factual foundation, <em>Smith v. Estate of Kelly, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>480, 497-98, 778 A.2d 1162 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Having determined that there are no other bars to enforcement of the settlement agreement in this case, we next address the only remaining issue, namely, whether Sylvia Jennings\u2019 counsel of record and her spouse were authorized to enter into such an agreement on her behalf. It is well settled that \u201cstipulations ... made by attorneys <em>when </em>acting within the <em>scope of their authority </em>are enforceable against their clients.\u201d <em>Carlsen v. Carlsen, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 137, 139 A.2d 309 (App.Div.1958) (emphasis added); <em>Davidson, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 551, 477 A.2d 423; <em>see also </em>7A <em>C.J.S. Attorney and Client, </em>\u00a7 205-208, 211 (1980). The general concept has been historically and unqualifiedly accepted in our court. As early as 1888, in <em>Phillips v. Pullen, </em>50 <em>N.J.L. </em>439, 14 A. 222 (E. &amp; A. 1888), a defendant, who gave his lawyer general instructions to negotiate a settlement in a tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>action, was bound by the agreement made by his attorney on his behalf where the defendant, after learning of the lowest sum plaintiff would accept, instructed the attorney to settle on the best terms he could obtain. In <em>Bernstein &amp; Loubet, Inc. v. Minkin, </em>118 <em>N.J.L. </em>203, 205, 191 <em>A. </em>733 (E. &amp; A.1937), the Court stated: \u201cBut it is the clear policy of our courts to recognize acts by the attorneys of the court as valid and presumptively authorized and, unless the contrary appears, it will be presumed that a stipulation was duly authorized.\u201d <em>See also Honeywell, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 136, 325 A.2d 832. Consequently, an attorney is presumed to possess authority to act on behalf of the client, <em>Sur. Ins. Co. of Cal. v. Williams, </em>729 F.2d 581, 582-83 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Bernstein &amp; Loubet, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 205, 191 A. 733, and the party asserting the lack of authority must sustain \u201ca heavy burden to establish that [her] attorney acted without any kind of authority in agreeing to the entry of judgment in the trial court,\u201d <em>Sur. Ins. Co., supra, </em>729 <em>F.2d </em>at 583; <em>see also McKenna v. Pac. Rail Serv., </em>817 <em>F.Supp. </em>498, 520 (D.N.J.1993). This, plaintiffs here failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Plaintiffs have also failed to prove that Jennings lacked either actual or apparent authority to consent to a settlement on his wife\u2019s behalf. Actual authority (express or implied) may \u201cbe created by written or spoken words or other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the agent to believe that the principal desires him so to act on the principal\u2019s account.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 26 (1958). On the other hand, \u201capparent authority ... is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 27. In other words, \u201c[a]pparent authority imposes liability, not as the result of an actual contractual relationship, but because of actions by a principal which have misled a third party into believing that a relationship of authority does, in fact, exist.\u201d <em>Wilzig v. Sisselman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 35, 506 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>417, 517 A.2d 415 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Here, on the eve of a peremptory trial date, Sylvia Jennings, by her own admission, expressly authorized her husband to appear in court and negotiate the terms of a settlement. Her husband confirms this grant of settlement authority. Moreover, Sylvia appeared with her husband jointly throughout the pre-trial phase through the same record counsel who represented them and negotiated the settlement at the final pre-trial session. Separate and apart from Jennings\u2019 express authority, Sylvia, by her own conduct, placed her husband in a position such that opposing counsel and the court were justified in presuming Jennings had the requisite authority. <em>See Am. Well Works v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>109 <em>N.J.L. </em>104, 108, 160 A. 560 (E. &amp; A.1932); <em>Shadel v. Shell Oil Co., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 316, 478 A.2d 1262 (Law Div.1984). Her belated, conclusionary allegation that she withheld authority to place the settlement <em>on the record </em>is simply too little, too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We are satisfied that plaintiffs have failed to present any competent evidence of a lack of either mental capacity, free will, or authority to contract sufficient to vitiate the settlement agreement in issue. Absent proof of any disagreement with the bargain struck, we are left only with plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csecond thoughts [which, quite simply,] are entitled to absolutely no weight as against our [strong public] policy in favor of settlement.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Advocate, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 530, 503 A.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\"> In addition to John and Rebecca Reed, husband and wife, named defendants were James Reed, a brother; J.R.
