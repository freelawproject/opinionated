The statute, which plaintiffs properly concede is specifically authorized in Article II of the New Jersey Constitution, prohibits from voting all people on parole or probation for indictable offenses. The complaint does not allege that the statute was enacted with the invidious purpose of discriminating against African-Americans or Hispanics. Instead, it asserts that the criminal justice system in New Jersey discriminates against African-Americans and Hispanics, thereby disproportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ately increasing their population among parolees and probationers and diluting their political power. This, they say, results in a denial of equal protection under the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The Attorney General moved to dismiss the complaint for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). Judge Miriam M. Span filed a thorough and well-reasoned opinion in support of her order dismissing the complaint, and plaintiffs appealed. Because the statute in question is specifically authorized by the New Jersey Constitution, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The right to vote in New Jersey is granted and limited by Article II of the state Constitution in the following manner. First it gives all United States citizens the right to vote if they satisfy certain age and residency requirements. <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 13. Next it guarantees the right to vote to all military personnel absent from their election districts during a time of war, and empowers the Legislature to provide for absentee voting by members of the armed forces of the United States in time of peace. <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 4. Next it provides that no member of the armed forces of the United States \u201cshall be considered a resident of this State by being stationed ... within this State.\u201d <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 5. Next it denies the right of suffrage to \u201cidiot or insane person[s].\u201d <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 6. And finally in the paragraph directly implicated in this ease, it says this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">The Legislature may pass laws to deprive persons of the right of suffrage who shall be convicted of such crimes as it may designate. Any person so deprived, when pardoned or otherwise restored by law to the right of suffrage, shall again enjoy that right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\"><em>[N.J. Const </em>art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Pursuant to that authority, the Legislature enacted the statute at issue, which, in pertinent part, says this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">No person shall have the right of suffrage\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(8) <em>Who </em>is serving a sentence or <em>is on parole or probation as the result of a conviction of any indictaMe offense </em>under the laws of this or another state or of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>19:4-1(8)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Our duty is to sustain an act of the Legislature \u201cunless its repugnancy to the Constitution is clear beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>23, 41, 678 A.2d 164 (1996). And \u201c[t]he polestar of constitutional construction is always the intent and purpose of the particular provision.\u201d <em>State v. Apportionment Comm\u2019n, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>375, 381, 593 A.2d 710 (1991). Although a literal reading of a Constitutional declaration may be rejected when it is inconsistent with the spirit, policy and true sense of the declaration, <em>Lloyd v. Vermeulen, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>200, 205-06, 125 A.2d 393 (1956), we must presume \u201c \u2018that the words employed [in the Constitution] have been carefully measured and weighed to convey a certain and definite meaning, with as little as possible left to implication.... \u2019 \u201d <em>Apportionment Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 382, 593 A.2d 710 (citation omitted). A \u201cconvenient aid[ ] to the proper judicial implementation of the overriding constitutional purpose and plan\u201d is that \u201cthe general provisions of the Constitution must give way to its particular provisions.\u201d <em>Kervick v. Bontempo, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>469, 479, 150 A.2d 34 (1959). And when interpreting a constitution, \u201creal effect should be given to all the words it uses.\u201d <em>Myers v. United States, </em>272 <em>U.S. </em>52, 151, 47 <em>S.Ct. </em>21, 37, 71 <em>L.Ed. </em>160, 180 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In this case, the critical and specific Constitutional declaration is perfectly clear. Article II authorizes the Legislature to disenfranchise entirely people \u201cconvicted of such crimes as it may designate.\u201d Those convicts may not vote unless pardoned or unless \u201cotherwise restored by law to the right of suffrage____\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 7. The legislation at issue, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:4-1(8), designates the crimes requiring disenfranchisement as \u201cindictable offense[s] under the laws of this or another state or of the United States,\u201d and limits the period of disenfranchisement during a defendant\u2019s actual service on parole or probation. Thus, it clearly complies with this specific constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Relying primarily on Justice Handler\u2019s dissent in <em>State v. Muhammad, supra, </em>and <em>Serrano v. Priest, </em>18 Cal.3d 728, 135 <em>Cal.</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Rptr. </em>345, 557 P.2d 929 (1976), plaintiffs argue that even though the statute is specifically authorized by the state Constitution, it remains subject to judicial review under the equal protection doctrine. Although our state Constitution \u201chas no specific equal protection clause analogous to that in the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d we have consistently construed it as providing \u201canalogous or superior protection to our citizens.\u201d <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of </em>Trs., 77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 79, 389 A.2d 465 (1978). But neither Justice Handler\u2019s dissent nor <em>Serrano </em>support plaintiffs\u2019 position that judicial intervention is proper in the circumstances of this case under the equal protection doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Justice Handler acknowledged that when a specific provision of the state Constitution is intended to limit other rights protected by the state Constitution it must be enforced. <em>State v. Muhammad, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 74, 678 A.2d 164. (Handler, J. dissenting) And in <em>Serrano, </em>the California Supreme Court said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">[a] constitutional provision creating the duty and power to legislate in a particular area always remains subject to general constitutional requirements governing all legislation <em>unless the intent of the Constitution to exempt it from such requirements plainly appears.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">[135 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 372, 557 P.2d 929 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Those principles were accepted by the majority opinion in <em>State v. Muhammad, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 44, 678 A.2d 164, although Justice Handler disagreed with their implementation, and were previously endorsed by our Supreme Court in <em>Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel Township, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>151, 336 A.2d 713, <em>appeal dismissed, cert. denied, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>808, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>18, 46 <em>L.Ed.2d 28 </em>(1975). Thus, for example, if the Legislature had specifically prohibited only African-Americans or Hispanics from voting while on parole or probation, the statute would violate the doctrine of equal protection under the state Constitution despite the general authorization given to legislate in this area. But if the state Constitution specifically provided for denial of suffrage to those groups, as it did with respect to Federal soldiers merely stationed here, Art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 5, and \u201cidiot or insane person[s],\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Art. II, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 6, then the only source of relief would be the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">That is not to suggest that the facially neutral statute at issue could have withstood attack under our state Constitution if it had been enacted with the invidious purpose of denying suffrage to African-Americans and Hispanies. Were that the case, we would grant relief under our doctrine of equal protection, just as the United States Supreme Court did under the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Hunter v. Underwood, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>222, 229, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1916, 1921, 85 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). But plaintiffs do not charge the Legislature with an invidious purpose; rather, they merely argue that the statute inadvertently has a disparate impact on certain minority groups. When, as here, a statute is facially neutral, disparate impact is an insufficient basis for relief under our equal protection doctrine. <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 580, 494 A.2d 294 (1985). Finally, we note that the United States Supreme Court has held that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth amendment is not violated by facially neutral state felon disenfranchisement statutes adopted without a discriminatory purpose. <em>Richardson v. Ramirez, </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>24, 56, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2655, 2671, 41 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>551 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
