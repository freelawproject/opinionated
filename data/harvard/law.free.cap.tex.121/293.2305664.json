It will be noted, however, particularly, that plaintiff\u2019s property herein is only one hundred and fifty feet from the point at which said obstruction is contemplated, and it is undisputed that the railroad companies will totally and permanent obstruct the use of that part of Washington Avenue described in the ordinance.

C. and the T. &amp; N. 0. \u2014 , and on its south side by appellant\u2019s properties, the Shepherd Laundries Company, the Brazos Hotel, and other business establishments; it had then been used as a public way of such relative position in and relationship toward the general travel within and through the City to the extent that, many decades before, it had become a dedicated street within the meaning of R. S. Article 5517, as the recorded maps, the history of the City, and the other evidence makes manifest; such travel at that time had a habit of flowing rather freely to and fro within, into, and out of the City along Washington east and west for the distance between the streets specified through Sixth street as an inlet or outlet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\">\u201cIn 1927, for $52,500.00 cash, appellant bought the property he still owns at the corner of Ninth (or Meek) street on Washington, fronting 103 feet on the south side of the latter and running back 89 feet on the former, purchasing with reference to its location on these two public streets as so then existing and describing it, both as \u2018lots 6 and 7 in Block B-45, north side of Buffalo Bayou in the City of Houston,\u2019 and as \u2018also known as 813-15-17-19-21, Washington Avenue,\u2019 which property, while improved with business buildings for its entire extent and so abutting 103 feet on Washington, does not abut upon that particular part of it \u2018the City is attempting to close, but lies approximately 230 feet west of that portion * * * and is separated from that portion by an intersecting street known as Melnar or Eighth street, which runs south from Washington Avenue, but does not extend in .a northerly direction across Washington Avenue.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201cDuring 1926 the appellee railroad companies had considered the erection of a new passenger station entirely on their own property approximately at the same location as their present one, and had prepared tentative plans therefor, the consummation of which, their executive vice-president testified, would have cost them about a million dollars less than will the completion of the plans for the same purpose they subsequently adopted and are now carrying out in collaboration with the City of Houston.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201cEarly in 1927, the City of Houston, contemplating a rather general public improvement program in that section of the City, with the further purpose of contributing to the elimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tion of traffic hazards and the control of flood waters in Buffalo Bayou,* acting at first \u00bfthrough its \u2018City Planning Commission\u2019 and subsequently by its Mayor and other officers, began negotiations with the two railroads looking to their changing the new station plan above outlined so as to conform instead to a different one the Planning Commission had devised, which contemplated the City\u2019s closing, deeding, and turning over permanently and exclusively to the Railroads for that purpose so much of Washington Avenue as lay between the west line of Sixth street and the east line of Eighth street, and the building of the new Southern Pacific depot terminals on that part of Washington, with a consequent rerouting of adjacent streets to fit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-3\">\u201cThe evidence adduced on the hearing sustains the finding that as the railway station is now located and as the new station was intended by the Railroad Company to be located on the north side of the street and immediately fronting thereon, the traffic along the street was frequently greatly congested and the crossing of the street by pedestrians going to or from the station was dangerous and the use of the street at such times hazardous to the public, and that at least one person had theretofore been killed in crossing the street, and that the change of the location of the station in accordance with the plan of the City greatly reduces such dangers and hazards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\u201cSuch change being thereafter mutually agreed upon, the three parties made a joint-enterprise of the undertaking, which the City\u2019s mayor testified was commonly referred to as \u2018the Southern Pacific Project,\u2019 in the way that is in controlling features, evidenced by, first, an original contract in writing between them of date July 17, 1929, second, an alternate like contract of the same date, and, third, an ordinance passed on January 28, 1981, by the City Council of the City, as in compliance with the latter\u2019s contractual obligations so assumed, which three documents are copied in full in the official Statement of Facts in this cause that accompanies this certificate and is asked to be considered a part thereof for the purpose of including them, the first one from pages 3 to 21, inclusive, the second one from pages 115 to 133, inclusive, and the third one from pages 22 to 45, inclusive, and also including the map found between pages 21 and 22 of such statement of facts, showing the location and connections of the streets involved in the proposed plan of the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe hearing disclosed not only that the original contract had already been measurably and mutually executed \u2014 the Mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>testifying that the City had spent and contracted to spend practically all of the $1,750,000.00 provided by its bond-issue for the project, while the Railroads had spent $825,000.00 in purchasing the Brazos Hotel and Shepherd Laundries properties, which were then in process of demolishment, as well as paid one-half the cost of two underpasses \u2014 but also that the purpose of all parties to it was to fully carry out all their joint and several undertakings according to its terms as soon as practicable \u2014 that is, the City, after having all existing street-car tracks and all sub-surface structures removed therefrom, would actually \u2018vacate, abandon, close and release to the Railroads,\u2019 \u2018all that part of Washington Avenue as now located lying and being situated between the west line of Sixth Street or Acuff Street and the east line of Eighth or Melnar Street,\u2019 \u2018so that hereafter there shall not be vested in the City of Houston, or the people of said City, or in any person whomsoever, any. right, title, or claim, to the same, or any part thereof, as a street or passway,\u2019 and would \u2018make, execute, and deliver to said Houston and Texas Central Railroad Company the quit-claim deed or conveyance of the City of Houston granting, bargaining, selling and conveying to the said Railroad Company, and its successors and assigns, all of the right, title, interest, and claim of said City of Houston, to each and all of the said several tracts and parcels of land.\u2019 While upon their part, the Railroads would \u2018in consideration of the * * * agreements of the City herein contained * * * with all due diligence, as promptly as requisite and practicable, construct a new passenger station in what is now Washington Avenue, between Eighth or Melnar Street, and Sixth or Acuff Street.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-3\">\u201cWithin a few weeks after the quoted ordinance was passed, appellant \u2014 expressly suing both for his individual and private benefit as a tax-paying abutting-owner on Washington, and as a member of the- public and for its benefit, especially for that of all other members of it who were also abutting owners in like or similar situation with himself \u2014 sought an injunction herein, operative both against the City of Houston and the two Railroad Companies, restraining them from carrying out this plan for the closing and future appropriation of the two blocks of Washington Avenue as undertaken under the. herein included contracts and ordinance, on the ground that he and those for whom he sued would thereby be wholly deprived of their vested property rights in the street and in its continued use as such for the private benefit of the two Railroad Companies, without any compensation having \u2022 been' made, or due process of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>had, all in violation of the Constitution of Texas, art. I, secs. 17, 3, and 19, art. XI, sec. Ill, art. Ill, secs. 35 and 57, art. V, sec. 8, and of the Constitution of the United States, sec. 1, of the XIV Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201cThe appellees made common cause in answer, presenting general demurrers and denials, invoking in support of what they had undertaken article 2, section 4, of Houston\u2019s City Charter conferring certain powers over its streets, and specially averring that it was their plan \u2014 for the public safety and benefit \u2014 to close such portion of Washington Avenue in order to eliminate certain grade-crossings and other traffic hazards from having such a thoroughfare directly in front of the railroad terminals, and to provide in lieu thereof a new thoroughfare one block to the south, \u2018which will lead directly into the City with only easy bends therein, and be so located as to provide a parkway and driveway between said main thoroughfare and the railway terminals\u2019; they further charged appellant with laches in delaying the filing of his suit until after they had expended large sums in carrying out-their plan for the rearrangement of Washington and other adjacent streets, which had then been a matter of public knowledge for several years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cThe trial court in all things refused the injunction prayed for, after hearing evidence from both sides, which, while sufficient to support a further finding that the closing of Washington as contemplated \u2014 with the consequent construction of the new station on the site and the proposed parkway in front of it, thus in effect \u2018dead-ending\u2019 it toward the City on the east at Melnar and there abruptly diverting for one block to the south all travel that otherwise would have directly flowed east and west through Washington \u2014 would in a measure constitute a protection to the general public through the elimination of certain now-existing traffic hazards thereon, at the same time compels the self-evident finding also that the use itself of that portion of the street as such would thereby be wholly withdrawn from the appellant, along with all those for whose benefit he sued, and thereafter be appropriated to the exclusive use and control of the Railroad Companies \u2014 either permanently, or at least so long as the obstruction stood or the original contract, together with the ordinance enacted in compliance therewith, should remain extant as recognized obligations of the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cUpon the foregoing statement, we respectfully submit for your decision the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cFirst: Are the contract of the City and the ordinance passed in pursuance thereof, before shown, void for want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>power in the City to close that portion of Washington Avenue before described for the purposes and to the extent stated therein ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u201cSecond: Is the Act of the 41st. Legislature, amending Title 76 of the Revised Statutes (1925), restricting the right to injunction against the closing by a City of a public street of the City to the owner or lessee of real property actually abutting on that part of the street actually closed, unconstitutional?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">\u201cThird: Irrespective of the statute mentioned, will the closing of Washington Avenue, to the extent and ,for the purposes as shown in the original contract and the ordinance enacted in compliance therewith, constitute such a taking of appellant\u2019s property as an abutting owner thereon as entitles him to maintain a suit for injunction to prevent such closing without the City first condemning the property, as provided in our condemnation statutes?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In Bowers v. City of Taylor, 24 S. W. (2d) 817, injunctive relief was permitted under a state of facts somewhat similar to those here.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Soon thereafter, the 41st Legislature at its fifth called session (chapter 84), enacted Senate Bill No. 62, which, omitting caption and enacting clause, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201cSection 1. That Title 76, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas of 1925, be amended by adding thereto Article 4646a, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">\u201cArt. 4646a. \u2014 No injunction shall be granted to stay or prevent the vacating, abandonment or closing, by the City Council or governing body of any incorporated city of this State, of any street or alley in any such incorporated city of this State, except at the suit of the owner or lessee of real property actually abutting on that part of such street or alley actually vacated, abandoned or closed, and then only in the event that the damages of said owner or lessee shall not have been released or shall - not have been ascertained and paid in a condemnation suit by such city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">\u201cSec. 2. Provided that any person, who under existing laws has the right to enjoin a city from vacating, abandoning or closing any street or alley of such city and whose right to such injunction is denied by this Act, shall have the right to an action for damages for any injury that he may sustain by reason of the vacating, abandoning or closing of any street or alley by such city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201cSec. 3. The fact that there is much confusion in reference to whether or not the right to enjoin a city from abandoning and closing a street applies only to abutting property owners, and the further fact that the decisions of the Courts of this State have rendered it doubtful as to what are the rights of the city, and the rights of property owners with reference to closing streets, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity which requires that the Constitutional Rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be, and the same is hereby suspended, and that this Act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\">\u201cApproved April 4, 1930.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">\u201cEffective 90 days after adjournment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">This act has the effect of denying injunctive relief in a class of cases where theretofore such relief was, under certain circumstances, available, and unless in contravention of the Constitution, must be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In construing section 17, article I, of the Constitution, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cNo person\u2019s property shall be taken, damaged or destroyed, for, or applied to public use without adequate compensation being made, unless by the consent of such person; and\", when taken, except for the use of the State, such compensation shall be first made, or secured by a deposit of money; and no irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities, shall be made; but all privileges and franchises granted by the Legislature, or created under its authority shall be subject to the control thereof,\u201d our courts have drawn a distinction between the terms property \u201ctaken\u201d and property \u201cdamaged or destroyed,\u201d in so far as requiring that when \u201ctaken\u201d (except for use of the State) compensation shall be first made or secured by a deposit of money, whereas, when only \u201cdamaged or destroyed\u201d that requirement does not obtain because there is no such \u201ctaking\u201d within the meaning of the Constitution as requires payment in advance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">This distinction is important when the aid of equity is invoked, because (unless there is a \u201ctaking\u201d) if there be available an adequate remedy at law in damages, equity will not intervene by injunctive relief. McCammon &amp; Lang Lumber Company v. Texas &amp; B. V. Ry. Co., 104 Texas, 9, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.), 662, 30 A. &amp; E. Ann. Cases, 1913E, 870; Johnson v. Lancaster, 266 S. W., 565; Duvall v. City of Dallas, 27 S. W. (2d) 1105; 2 Elliott Roads &amp; Streets, sec. 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In Duvall v. City of Dallas (writ of error refused), supra, the city\u2019s charter, as that of the City of Houston here, gives plenary power to the city over its streets and alleys, including the authority to \u201cvacate and close the same\u201d; the court held that where the closing of a street amounts to simply the infliction of an incidental injury such as where an easement is partially or wholly destroyed, and not a physical invasion or appropriation of the property, an adequate remedy at law exists in the recovery of damages and injunction will not issue to restrain progress of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">In the instant case, while a portion of Washington Street was ordered closed, its replacement by another street to be opened south of it is provided for, affording access to the business district of the city and elsewhere, and there will be no complete obstruction to the right of thoroughfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">It has been held that there is no provision of the Constitution requiring pre-payment of compensation where the construction or operation of the work causes damage to the plaintiff but no property of his has been appropriated; the distinction between a \u201ctaking\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d is thus controlling when the question is whether the work should be enjoined because of the non-payment or non-securing of compensation in advance as required by the Constitution. 16 Texas Jur., pp. 927 to 931. Where the vacated part is beyond the next connecting highway from the plaintiff\u2019s property so that he has access in both directions, the great weight of authority is to the effect that there is no \u201ctaking\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s property though the closing of the street at the point in question renders his property less valuable. 1 Lewis Eminent Domain (3rd Ed.), secs. 206, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In Dallas Cotton Mills v. Industrial Company, 296 S. W., 503, the parties claimed under a common source proprietor who had subdivided the land and dedicated the streets platted thereon and purchase was with direct reference to this sub-divisional and dedicatory plat. The City vacated and closed the street in question there, and Judge Nickels said that the city held a public easement, and the individual purchaser acquired a private easement; that the two could exist in contemporaneous and harmonious operation, or the one could be destroyed without necessary impairment of the other, and proper execution of the city\u2019s authority to \u201cvacate and close\u201d the street would enable it to relinquish-the public easement but the private rights would be left intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number> If, as contended by the city, the closing of the street in question is for the protection of the public in the elimination and relief of traffic and other hazards, and in lieu thereof other streets are opened, relocated and widened, then such closing, is for a public purpose and within the power of the city, but that of course cannot affect any private rights or easements, and the holders of such private rights and easements still have their remedy, either by injunction, if an abutting owner \u2014 if not, for damages, as may be proper. 1 Lewis Eminent Domain (3rd ed.), sec. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">Under the facts certified, we recommend that the questions be answered as follows\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><em>1st, </em>\u2014 The first question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>2nd </em>\u2014 The act of the 41st Legislature amending Title 76 of the Revised Statutes of 1925 by adding thereto, article 4646a, is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>3rd. </em>\u2014 The proposed closing of Washington Avenue by the city, is, in the present case, not such a taking of appellant\u2019s property as entitles him to an injunction- to prevent such closing without the city first condemning the property, as provided in our condemnation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering the certified questions is adopted and ordered certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">C.
