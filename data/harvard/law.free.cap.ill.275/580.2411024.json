One of the grounds urged for sustaining the judgment of the court is that the act of 1911 violates section 22 of article 4 of the constitution and\u2019is invalid. This question was presented and determined in People'v. Wei's, on this page, where the contentions of the parties in this case were fully considered. For the reasons there given the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b581-3\" pgmap=\"581\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b581-4\" pgmap=\"581\">Mr. Justice Farmer, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
