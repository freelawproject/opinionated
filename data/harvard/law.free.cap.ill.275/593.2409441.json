This precise question has been determined in People v. Weis, (ante, p. 581,) where the contentions of the parties in this case were carefully considered. For the reasons given in that case the Township High School act of June 5, 1911, is invalid, and the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"A3T\" pgmap=\"593\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b593-14\" pgmap=\"593\">Mr. Justice Farmer, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
