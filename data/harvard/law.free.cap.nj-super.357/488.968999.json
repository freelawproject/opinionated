We reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">O\u2019Callaghan and his wife, Robin, together own a house located at 850 Ocean Avenue in Sea Bright. The property is across the street from the ocean and the rear abuts the Shrewsbury River. The O\u2019Callaghans also own' a house in Princeton, where Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan works for Educational Testing Service. Their two sons attended Christian Brothers Academy (CBA) in Lineroft and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Mr. O\u2019Callaghan lived at the Sea Bright house during the week with the boys because it was closer to their school as well as closer to his work. Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan stayed in Princeton because it was closer to her work. The family would reunite on weekends, sometimes in Sea Bright, more often in Princeton. The family resided together in Sea Bright during the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Various neighbors had, over the years, indicated to O\u2019Callaghan an interest in buying the house if he ever decided to sell. During these discussions, O\u2019Callaghan consistently replied that he would not sell the house until his youngest son had graduated from CBA, an event scheduled to occur in 2001. Neighbors who had expressed an interest in the property included Mr. O\u2019Shea, who owned the property next door to O\u2019Callaghan, Mr. DeSio, who lived a few houses down the street, and Mr. Chimento, who owned a beach club further up Ocean Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Plaintiff LoBiondo owns the Surfrider Beach Club that is diagonally across Ocean Avenue from the O\u2019Callaghan home. He was particularly interested in buying the property, both to provide a residence for his son, James, who managed the beach club, and to provide additional parking for the business. LoBiondo maintained that as a result of his discussions with Mr. O\u2019Callaghan, he at first had an oral contract for the purchase of the house that was later transformed into an oral right of first refusal. Defendant O\u2019Callaghan denied any such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Discussions between O\u2019Callaghan and LoBiondo commenced in 1996 and spanned several years. Nothing was ever reduced to writing between the two. Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan, despite being a joint owner, took no part in these discussions. The trial court, after a four-day bench trial, found for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">According to LoBiondo, the two men met in the winter of 1998-1999 to discuss a possible sale. During the meeting, they discussed the condition of the property and the fact that the bulkhead was in need of extensive repair. LoBiondo said they agreed at this meeting that the property was worth approximately $280,000. LoBiondo also testified that during this meeting, O\u2019Cal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>laghan said he could not agree then to sell the property to LoBiondo because he had already promised Chimento the first opportunity to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">LoBiondo said the two next met in late 1999 or early 2000; by that time O\u2019Callaghan knew that Chimento was no longer interested in buying the O\u2019Callaghan home. LoBiondo said he told O\u2019Callaghan in April 2000 that for business reasons he would like to buy the property in 2000 but that he would permit O\u2019Callaghan to remain in the house until his son finished high school. LoBion-do maintained that O\u2019Callaghan was willing to sell on those terms. He said the two had further discussions on price and agreed $300,000 was a fair price.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">LoBiondo said he told O\u2019Callaghan that another nearby neighbor, Guch, was planning to sell his house and that he, LoBiondo, would buy that house if O\u2019Callaghan did not want to sell in 2000. O\u2019Callaghan responded by producing a survey of his property to demonstrate to LoBiondo why his property would be superior, for LoBiondo\u2019s purposes, to Guch\u2019s. '</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">LoBiondo said he wanted to commence repairs on the bulkhead and demolish a wall on the property which would permit him both greater access to the bulkhead and facilitate the parking of cars. LoBiondo testified O\u2019Callaghan was agreeable to both proposals and LoBiondo secured a number of estimates on having the bulkhead repaired. When LoBiondo settled on the contractor, he wanted a deposit before proceeding to request the necessary permits. LoBiondo said he called O\u2019Callaghan to make sure they still had a deal and O\u2019Callaghan said they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">LoBiondo planned to begin demolishing the wall on Monday, June 19, 2000. Mrs O\u2019Callaghan learned of this on June 18 and immediately objected. She also insisted that the couple list the property with a real estate broker to see if they would realize more on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">O\u2019Callaghan went across the street to inform LoBiondo of his wife\u2019s position. LoBiondo said he was chagrined but did not insist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>that the two had a contract for $300,000. He said he did not want O\u2019Callaghan in the future to feel he had sold at too low a price. LoBiondo said that O\u2019Callaghan promised he would give LoBiondo the opportunity to match any offer that was received and that he would put into the listing contract a provision that LoBiondo could purchase the property without a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">O\u2019Callaghan later returned to LoBiondo and told him that he and his wife had listed the property with a local broker for $425,000. Both O\u2019Callaghan and LoBiondo felt that price was unrealistic. O\u2019Callaghan further told LoBiondo that while the realtor had refused to include within the listing agreement a provision relieving LoBiondo from the scope of her commission, she had said that if LoBiondo bought the property within a week she would not charge a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The O\u2019Callaghans signed the listing agreement on July 26, 2000. On August 6, the realtor called to tell them she had received an offer to pay the full asking price, with no contingencies. They agreed to meet the following day to sign the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan were in Princeton and had to drive from there to the broker\u2019s office. On August 7, they did not proceed directly to the broker\u2019s office, however, for Mr. O\u2019Callaghan wanted to stop in Sea Bright to talk to the various neighbors who had expressed an interest in the property over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">He first tried to reach Mr. O\u2019Shea, his next door neighbor, but he was unsuccessful in contacting O\u2019Shea. He did talk to Mr. DeSio and told him of the $425,000 offer. DeSio was a builder who had intended on knocking down the existing house and building a new one; he did not think the property was worth that much and simply congratulated O\u2019Callaghan on receiving such a large offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">O\u2019Callaghan then walked across the street to LoBiondo\u2019s beach club. He met LoBiondo and told him of the $425,000 offer. LoBiondo was surprised at the size of the offer and, according to his testimony, asked for time to consult with his wife whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>match the offer but O\u2019Callaghan refused, saying they were on their way to the real estate agent\u2019s. O\u2019Callaghan, on the other hand, testified that LoBiondo did not ask for time to talk to his wife but only asked for the return of the deposit he had given to the bulkhead contractor. The trial court found LoBiondo\u2019s version credible and rejected O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">LoBiondo called O\u2019Callaghan the following day and said he was prepared to match the offer and would offer an additional $25,000. O\u2019Callaghan, despite the three-day attorney review provision in the contract, said it was too late because he had already signed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">LoBiondo then began this action, naming as defendants O\u2019Callaghan and the offeror, John Mulheren, who happened to own the property directly across the river from O\u2019Callaghan. The trial court restrained the sale of the property pending trial. Plaintiff did not join as a defendant Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan, who was a joint owner of 850 Ocean Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court issued a twenty-three page written decision in which it found that O\u2019Callaghan, had granted LoBiondo a right of first refusal, that the right was enforceable, and that Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan had authorized Mr. O\u2019Callaghan to act on her behalf in connection with the property. Within its opinion, the trial court specifically refused to rest its decision on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the alternate basis to plaintiffs claim for relief. <em>Pop\u2019s Cones v. Resorts Intern. Hotel, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 704 A.2d 1321 (App.Div.1998); <em>Malaker Corp. Stockholders Protective Comm. v. First Jersey Nat. Bank, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 395 A.2d 222 (App.Div.1978), <em>certif. denied, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>488, 401 A.2d 243 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">O\u2019Callaghan raises, essentially, three points on appeal: that the evidence was insufficient to permit the trial court to find an enforceable right of first refusal, that even if LoBiondo had such a right of first refusal, he lost it by not exercising it when first told of the Mulheren offer, and the trial court erred by entering an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>order compelling him to sell to LoBiondo. We agree with O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s first argument and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">There is no essential dispute on the standard of review which we are called upon to utilize in considering this matter. We will not interfere with the trial court\u2019s findings of fact to the extent they find support within the record. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 470, 724 A.2d 234 (1999); <em>Abtrax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Elkins-Sinn, Inc., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>499, 655 A.2d 1368 (1995). The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, are not entitled to such deference; they are subject to plenary review. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Township Committee, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Until recently, New Jersey followed the historical common law rule that oral agreements to transfer an interest in real property were unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. In 1996, however, the Legislature substantially amended the statute and provided that such oral agreements could be enforceable if proven by clear and convincing evidence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:l-13(b). <em>Prant v. Sterling, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 378, 753 A.2d 758 (Ch.Div.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 753 A.2d 715 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The parties at trial did not factually dispute much of what occurred between LoBiondo and O\u2019Callaghan. The one clear area of dispute related to LoBiondo\u2019s initial reaction upon hearing of the $425,000 offer. As we noted earlier, the trial court accepted LoBiondo\u2019s testimony in that regard and that credibility assessment is binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The parties did, however, dispute the legal significance of what transpired between the two men. Having reviewed the record in detail, we consider the critical issue on appeal to be the relationship of Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan to this transaction. The trial court concluded that Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan acted as to vest her husband with apparent authority in his dealings with LoBiondo; it is in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>conclusion that we are satisfied the trial court erred in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Within its letter opinion, the trial court carefully noted that plaintiff was required to prove the existence of a right of first refusal by clear and convincing evidence but was only required to prove the remaining aspects of his case by a preponderance of the evidence. To the extent that the trial court concluded that plaintiff did not have to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. O\u2019Callaghan had apparent authority, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In <em>O\u2019Reilly v. Keim, </em>54 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>418, 34 <em>A. </em>1073 (E. &amp; A. 1896), the Court of Errors and Appeal held that while parol evidence could prove an agent\u2019s authority to bind his principal for the sale of real estate, the evidence had to be \u201cclear and decisive\u201d on the point. There has been no retreat from that principle since. Nothing within the 1996 amendments to the Statute of Frauds indicates that the Legislature intended to lessen the burden of proving the existence or scope of an agent\u2019s authority by parol evidence. Rather, it would only be logical, if clear and convincing evidence is required to prove the existence of an oral agreement relating to the sale of real estate, to continue the requirement that the agent\u2019s authority be proven by \u201cclear and decisive\u201d proof. It would be counter to the thrust of the amended statute of frauds, in our judgment, if preponderance of the evidence was a sufficient evidential basis to find apparent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">That is particularly so in the context of this case, in which Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan was an equal owner of the property. To permit a finding of apparent authority based upon a preponderance of the evidence would have the result of finding an enforceable oral contract with her on the preponderance of the evidence, rather than the statutorily mandated clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">We have reviewed the record in this matter in great detail to determine whether plaintiff could be considered to have demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>strated by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. O\u2019Callaghan had apparent authority from Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan to enter into an enforceable agreement for this property. If the evidence presented during trial was clear and convincing, the trial court\u2019s reference to a preponderance of the evidence would be deemed harmless error. We are satisfied, however, that plaintiffs evidence cannot meet the clear and convincing threshold and that the reasons given by \u2022 the trial court to support its conclusion that Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan had vested her husband with apparent authority are legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u201cApparent authority arises when a principal \u2018acts in such a manner as to convey the impression to a third party that the agent has certain power which he may or not possess.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Hudson County Collision Co., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>213, 220, 686 A.2d 776 (App.Div.1997). \u201cLiability will be imposed upon the principal in cases involving apparent authority where the actions of a principal have misled a third party into believing that a relationship of authority existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 686 A.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Under the doctrine of apparent authority,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">[t]he principal is bound by the acts of his agent within the apparent authority which he knowingly permits the agent to assume, or which he holds the agent out to the public as possessing. The question in every case depending upon the apparent authority of the agent is whether the principal has by his voluntary act placed the agent in such a situation that a person of ordinary prudence, conversant with business usages and the nature of the particular business, is justified in presuming that such agent has authority to perform the particular act in <em>question----[Legge, Ind. v. Kushner Hebrew Acad., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 560, 756 A.2d 608 (App.Div. 2000) (quoting <em>American Well Works v. Royal Indemnity Co., </em>109 <em>N.J.L. </em>104, 108, 160 A. 560 (E. &amp; A.1932)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Thus, a conclusion that a party has acted with apparent authority must rest upon the actions of the principal, not the alleged agent. <em>Wilzig v. Sisselman, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 35, 506 A.2d 1238 (App. Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The trial court cited six reasons for its conclusion that Mr. O\u2019Callaghan had apparent authority to negotiate an enforceable agreement with LoBiondo: (1) he spent more time at the property than did his wife; (2) he had held numerous discussions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>LoBiondo over the years about the property; (3) there was no evidence Mr. O\u2019Callaghan ever told LoBiondo that he did not speak for his wife or that would have given LoBiondo reason to doubt O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s authority; (4) the only time Mr. O\u2019Callaghan mentioned his wife to LoBiondo was when he said she insisted on listing the property with a broker; (5) Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan testified that when her husband went to LoBiondo on August 7 to inform him of the offer, he was authorized to speak for her; and (6) Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan never told anyone her husband acted without her authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The first three factors are immaterial to the question of Mr. O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s apparent authority for they are actions of Mr. O\u2019Callaghan, the alleged agent, not Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan, the alleged principal. <em>Wilzig v. Sisselman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The same analysis applies to the fourth factor. This factor, moreover, evidences Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s unwillingness to let her husband handle the sale of this property. The only reasonable conclusion LoBiondo could have drawn from being told that Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan wanted the property listed with a real estate broker and refused to have the wall taken down would be that Mr. O\u2019Callaghan did not speak for his wife in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The fifth factor, Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s testimony that her husband was authorized to speak for her on August 7 when he went to LoBiondo, is also legally insufficient to support a finding of apparent authority because the trial court found that the oral contract for a right of first refusal was entered into, not on August 7, but some time earlier, when O\u2019Callaghan told LoBiondo his wife insisted on listing the property with a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Nor can Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s testimony to this effect be considered a ratification on her part for there is no testimony that Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan ever knew that her husband had purported to convey a right of first refusal to LoBiondo and Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan specifically denied such knowledge. <em>Passaic-Bergen Lumber Co. v. U.S. Trust Co., </em>110 <em>N.J.L. </em>315, 318,164 <em>A. </em>580 (E. &amp; A.1933) (\u201cIn order that ratification may be shown, it is incumbent on defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>prove that the plaintiff had full knowledge of all the material facts.\u201d); <em>MacLeod v. Ajax Distributing Co., </em>22 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 127, 91 A.2d 635 (App.Div.1952) (\u201cTo ratify means to approve and sanction. It presupposes knowledge or at least some alerting circumstantial information of the unauthorized action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The sixth factor, that Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan never testified her husband acted without her authority, is also insufficient for it has the effect of placing the burden of proof on defendant to disprove authority, rather than upon plaintiff, who is asserting its existence. Mrs. O\u2019Callaghan did testify, moreover, that she expected to be consulted before there would ever be a final deal for the sale of the house she jointly owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Plaintiff argues that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed under the principles of promissory estoppel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">There are four elements to the doctrine of promissory estoppel: 1) a clear and definite promise, 2) made with the expectation that the promisee will rely upon it, 3) reasonable reliance upon the promise, 4) which results in definite and substantial detriment. <em>Malaker Corp. Stockholders Protective Committee v. First Jersey Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 479, 395 A.2d 222 (App.Div.1978) (holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that an alleged oral promise by a bank to provide additional loans to a creditor was unenforceable under principles of promissory estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">This court has recently indicated that in certain contexts the party invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel need not provide \u201cclear and definite\u201d proof of such an express promise. <em>Pop\u2019s Cones v. Resorts Intern. Hotel, supra, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 469, 704 A.2d 1321 (plaintiff, who held a franchise to sell yogurt products, established a prima facie ease for damages when defendant withdrew its oral promise to lease space to plaintiff and plaintiff had surrendered its lease at its original location in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>reliance on that promise). We carefully pointed out, however, that plaintiff in that case was seeking damages relating to the surrender of its location, not damages based upon losing a location on the Boardwalk. We said, \u201cThis [permitting a party to proceed without \u2018clear and definite\u2019 proof] is particularly true where, as here, a plaintiff does not seek to enforce a contract not fully negotiated, but instead seeks damages resulting from its detrimental reliance upon promises made during contract negotiations despite the ultimate failure of those negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469-70, 704 A.2d 1321. Here, however, plaintiff is attempting to utilize the theory of promissory estoppel to obtain specific performance of the alleged contract at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Plaintiff having failed to prove his claim by clear and convincing evidence was not entitled to a judgment for specific performance and we reverse the order for judgment and remand this matter for entry of a judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
