THE MOTION COURT\u2019S APPLICATION OF <em>N.J.S. </em>34:15-40 WAS ILLOGICAL AND UNFAIR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The reply brief recognizes that the statutory workers\u2019 compensation lien accords the employer\u2019s compensation carrier a dollar for dollar off-set and, thus, \u201cdoes not require examination of whether an injured claimant has been made whole.\u201d <em>See Utica Mut. Ins. v. Maran &amp; Maran, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>609, 613, 667 A.2d 680 (1995); <em>Frazier v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>590, 602, 667 A.2d 670 (1995). Indeed, the lien attaches to the entire amount of third party proceeds and not just those monies which match the compensation benefits. <em>DeLane ex rel. DeLane v. City of Newark, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 233-35, 778 A.2d 511 (App.Div.2001). But plaintiff distinguishes this statutory lien from an \u201coff-setting anti-duplication credit\u201d which, he claims, is \u201can entirely different kettle of fish,\u201d appearing, as a creation of decisional law, in \u201cat least four different scenarios.\u201d In this respect, the reply brief asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-X\">First, an off-setting anti-duplication credit may appear in the familiar context of successive torts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">Prior to the adoption of the Comparative Negligence Act, the courts in New Jersey formulated a separate \u201ccredit\u201d concept designed to avoid duplicating compensation in cases in which the injured party settled with one tortfeasor and then instituted separate litigation against a person whose subsequent negligence aggravated the initial tort. The subsequent aggravation in those cases typically occurred as a result of medical malpractice. The courts reasoned that the torts in those eases were \u201csuccessive\u201d rather than \u201cjoint,\u201d thus precluding a contribution credit under the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law. Nevertheless, the courts acknowledged the possibility that the plaintiff may have received partial or total compensation for the subsequent tort as a result of the settlement with the initial tortfeasor. <em>Consequently, the courts ultimately required that the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>second tortfeasor receive what was in effect a pro tanto credit in the amount by which the first settlement exceeded the damages attributable to the settling party\u2019s tort.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">[Brian E. Mahoney, <em>New Jersey Comparative Fault and Liability Apportionment Law </em>(Gann 2002), see. 14:8, pp. 344-345 (emphasis added, citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Second, an offsetting anti-duplication credit may appear in the context of \u201csecond-collision\u201d (or \u201ccrashworthiness\u201d) cases which, in the appropriate circumstances, may warrant a \u201ccredit\u201d to the defendant vehicle manufacturer to subtract duplicative damages recovered by a plaintiff from the negligent] defendants in an earlier action. <em>Id. </em>at 15:6-6, p. 437 and at 14:8, p. 348, discussing <em>Crispin v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>336, 346, 476 A.2d 250 (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">Third, an offsetting anti-duplication credit may be warranted in the unusual context of a wrongful life suit which was preceded by a wrongful birth suit. <em>Moscatello v. UMDNJ, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 361-362, 776 A.2d 874 (App.Div.) [<em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>207, 785 A.2d 435 (2001)] (contemplating a credit in a disabled child\u2019s wrongful life suit for amounts received by his parents in a settlement of earlier litigation based on a wrongful birth theory).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">Fourth and finally, an off-setting anti-duplication credit is plainly what the New Jersey Supreme Court [in <em>Millison </em>] had in mind for an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d suit against an employer who had earlier paid workers\u2019 compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">These instances of \u201coff-setting anti-duplication credit,\u201d plaintiff argues, \u201cwork different than a workers\u2019 compensation lien.\u201d The argument is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">enforcement of a workers\u2019 compensation lien does not require examination of whether an injured claimant has been made whole. In contrast, however, by its nature, an offsetting anti-duplication credit analysis <em>may require </em>an examination of whether an injured claimant has been made whole. On the one hand, if the injured claimant has proceeded to verdict before a faet-finder and prevailed (and all the recoverable New Jersey damages components have been fully aired before the fact-finder), it stands to reason that the fact-finder\u2019s determination establishes the full measure of plaintiffs damages in the eyes of the law, and the defendant/judgment-debtor is entitled to a <em>pro tanto </em>(or dollar-for-dollar) reduction in liability in an amount equivalent to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits previously paid. The Court in <em>Millison </em>evidently contemplated that the offsetting credit would be subtracted from the ultimate findings of the \u201ctrier of fact\u201d where plaintiff has \u201cprevailed\u201d and a \u201ccivil damage award\u201d has been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">On the other hand, if plaintiff has settled his Superior Court action, there is no assurance that plaintiff has been made whole and the direct subtraction of off setting credits hardly serves to prevent a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d \u2014 it may well unjustly exacerbate what is already an \u201cunder recovery.\u201d A settlement usually represents a compromise on both sides, with many variables, and does not necessarily \u201cmake whole\u201d the injured claimant. <em>Werner v. Latham, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 79, 84-85, 752 A.2d 832 (App.Div.2000); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Two West Hanover Co., </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 795 A.2d 907 (App.Div.2002).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Thus, where there has been a <em>settlement </em>of an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d ease against an employer, plaintiffs counsel is entitled to ask the motion court to determine that the settlement represents a substantial compromise, that there has <em>not </em>been a double recovery, and that <em>NO </em>off-setting anti-duplication credit is appropriate____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In essence, where there is an employer intentional wrong tort litigation settlement, plaintiff asks us to treat the workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s lien as an equitable lien, subject to such equitable considerations as whether plaintiff has yet been fully recompensed for his injuries and to credit the carrier with only so much of the tort settlement as reflects an excess. The result here would be that the carrier would have no lien against the tort settlement proceeds as plaintiff contends those proceeds, even when combined with his workers\u2019 compensation benefits, do not fully compensate him for his injuries. And, to be sure, we have in other contexts imposed similar equitable lien concepts. <em>See Werner v. Latham, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 752 A.2d 832 (App.Div.2000) (health benefits insurer\u2019s contractual hen upon tort settlement proceeds requires equitable considerations and matter was remanded for a hearing to determine whether plaintiff had been fully compensated for his damages before hen could attach); <em>Charnecky v. American Reliance Ins. Co., 249 N.J.Super. </em>91, 592 A.2d 17 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>188, 603 A.2d 512 (1992) (where uninsured motorist settlement and workers\u2019 compensation benefits, combined, may not fully compensate injured employee, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 does not apply, rather, equitable considerations required a determination of whether employee was made whole and hen could attach only to excess), <em>overruled, Frazier v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins., supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 667 A.2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Plaintiffs arguments are not entirely without merit. Defendants are plaintiffs employers. They are not \u201cthird person\u201d entities, so to speak. The statutory hen, then, could reasonably be said not to apply to a recovery from them in the intentional tort litigation. And, while <em>Millison </em>did recognize that credit for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits would be appropriate, the credit the court envisioned was to be accorded <em>\u201cto the extent </em>that the civil damages award [or monies received by plaintiff employee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>settlement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] <em>would serve as a </em>double recovery.\u201d <em>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 501 A.2d 505 (emphasis added). The use of the phrases \u201cto the extent\u201d and \u201cwould serve as a double recovery\u201d could be construed as calling for an equitable lien because, if the monies received in the tort litigation and the workers\u2019 compensation benefits do not fully compensate plaintiff, as is contended here, how can there be a double recovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Moreover, the \u201cdouble recovery\u201d that a workers\u2019 compensation lien is intended to prevent does not neatly fit the circumstances here. As explained in 6 Arthur Larson and Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 110.02 at 110-3 to -4 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">It is equally elementary that the claimant should not be allowed to keep the entire amount both of his or her compensation award and of the common-law damage recovery. The obvious disposition of the matter is to give the employer so much of the negligence recovery as is necessary to reimburse it for its compensation outlay, and to give the employee the excess. <em>This is fair to everyone concerned: the employer, who, in a fault sense, is neutral, comes out even; the third person pays exactly the damages he or she would ordinarily pay, </em>which is correct since to reduce the third party\u2019s burden because of the relation between the employer and the employee would be a windfall that the third party has done nothing to deserve; and the employee gets a fuller reimbursement for actual damages sustained than is possible under the compensation system alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Where, however the tortfeasor is the employer, the employer is not \u201cneutral\u201d and, if entitled to a lien, would not in the tort litigation \u201cpay[s] exactly the damages he or she ordinarily pay ...,\u201d or \u201ccome out even.\u201d This is so because, facially, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>employer has paid damages from its tort pocket, but took some of that payment back from its workers\u2019 compensation pocket.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Nonetheless, we think the workers\u2019 compensation carrier was properly accorded a dollar for dollar lien here for two reasons. First, the \u201cdouble recovery\u201d referred to by the <em>Millison </em>Court within the context of an injured employee\u2019s receipt of both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and civil damages for the same injuries focuses upon the notion that an employee cannot have both. As the Court observed in <em>Frazier v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins., supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 596-98, 667 A.2d 670:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as enacted in 1911 [L. 1911, c. 95], did not provide for the employer\u2019s recovery from the third person alleged to be responsible for the injuries sustained.\u201d <em>Johns-Manville Prods. Corp. v. Dronebarger, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 524, 511 A.2d 1304 (Law Div.1986). Hence, an employee who recovered against a liable third party was entitled to keep 100% of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits, as well as 100% of any third-party recovery. \u201cThus, an injured employee was in some instances permitted a double recovery.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">To overcome the inequity of double recovery, the Legislature amended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in 1913 by adding <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40 (section 40), (L. 1913, c. 174, \u00a7 8). <em>Newark Paving Co. v. Klotz, </em>85 <em>N.J.L. </em>432, 91 A. 91 (Sup.Ct.), <em>aff'd, </em>86 <em>N.J.L. </em>690, 92 A. 1086 (E. &amp; A.1914). With minor changes in 1931 (L. 1931, c. 279, \u00a7 3), 1936 <em>(L. </em>1936, c. 162, \u00a7 1), 1951 <em>(L. </em>1951, c. 169, \u00a7 1), and 1956 (L. 1956, c. 141, \u00a7 6), the 1913 amendment became codified in <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\n<em>[s]ection 10 provides that an employee will be \u201cguaranteed recovery for his common-law damages against contributing third-party tortfeasors or for his [workers\u2019] compensation award, whichever is greater, but he may not duplicate these recoveries. \u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">That is to say, while an employee may pursue both compensation benefits and common-law tort damages, he may not keep both. Allowing equitable considerations to permit an employee to retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>all or a part of both his or her compensation benefits and tort proceeds would allow recovery of both. Further, the \u201cto the extent\u201d language in <em>Millison </em>probably reflects the Court\u2019s recognition that employer intentional wrong is difficult to prove and a plaintiff, therefore, may well not obtain any monies at all in the tort litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Second, we agree with the motion judge\u2019s characterization of the tort litigation as the equivalent of a \u201cthird person\u201d action. In this respect, the \u201cthird person\u201d concept in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 has been broadly applied to both true third person tortfeasors and tortfeasors who are the \u201cfunctional equivalent.\u201d <em>Frazier v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins., supra, </em>142 at 598, 667 A.2d 670 (statutory lien applied to attorney malpractice damages); <em>Midland Ins. Co. v. Colatrella, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>612, 618, 510 A.2d 30 (1986) (statutory lien applied to uninsured motorist insurance recovery). We are convinced the intentional wrong civil tort litigation against defendants is the functional equivalent of a \u201cthird person\u201d tortfeasor suit. Where an employee has pierced the threshold of the compensation bar, he or she has established that the employer\u2019s conduct is beyond the \u201cnatural risk[s] of\u2019 employment and does not \u201carise[ ] out of\u2019 the employment relationship. <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc. </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 606, 790 A.2d 884 (2002). In effect, the employer has stepped out of its employer shoes into those of an actionable tortfeasor. <em>See N.J. Practice Series, </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, \u00a7 17.13 \u201cThird-Party Liens\u201d (\u201cThe lien of the employer may be asserted upon any third party including those that involve intentional wrong\u201d <em>(citing Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 501 A.2d 505)); 6 Arthur Larson and Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, supra, </em>\u00a7 103.02 at 103-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Other states that have considered the issue, usually in the context of whether the employee must elect one or the other remedy, have required an offset or lien. For instance, the Supreme Court of Connecticut, in holding that an employee may seek both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and civil tort damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>where the employer commits an intentional tort, also held that the employer must be entitled to an offset for the compensation benefits paid to avoid double recovery, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">This approach is not without precedent. <em>See, e.g., Whitney-Fidalgo Seafoods, Inc. v. Beukers, </em>554 P.2d 250, 254 (Alaska 1976) (court held that mere acceptance of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by the employee did not constitute an election and therefore the employee could bring his common law suit, but payments made would be applied against any damage judgment he obtained); and <em>Worthington v. Industrial Commission of Arizona, </em>85 <em>Ariz. </em>310, 316, 338 <em>P.2d </em>363 (1959) (court held that receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits did not cause a widow to lose her rights to bring a wrongful death action although the sum received in the tort settlement could be offset against the amount of any compensation recovery); <em>Mike v.

Baldridge, </em>612 So.2d 732, 736 (La.1993) (employer entitled to offset in intentional wrong suit, but only for monies received for past and future wages and medical expenses.). On the other hand, a few states have strictly required an election, thus obviating the necessity for a lien or offset. <em>See </em>6 Arthur Larson and Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation, </em>\u00a7 115.02 at 115-2. Only Ohio has allowed an employee to seek both types of remedies and keep both the compensation and tort damages award. <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co., </em>15 <em>Ohio St. </em>3d 90, 472 N.E.2d 1046 (1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Irrespective of foreign jurisdiction law on the issue, <em>Millison </em>has clearly permitted an employee to pursue both remedies, but recognized that the employer retains the right to a lien or offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>for compensation benefits against monies obtained in the tort litigation. We are convinced this is a section 40 lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> The workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to plaintiff Manuel Calalpa (hereinafter plaintiff) were paid by defendant C &amp; K Moulding Co., Inc.\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. The tort litigation settlement monies were paid by defendant Dae Ryung Co., Inc.\u2019s liability insurance carrier. But, although separate corporate entities, the record fairly well establishes a close interrelationship \u2014 both operate out of the same premises, both engage in the same work, both have the same corporate agent who also is their landlord, both filed joint tax returns, both, in this litigation, filed a joint answer (although Dae Ryung later filed a separate answer), and, finally, deposition testimony of their employees and representatives can fairly be read to describe them as indistinguishable. Indeed, when both defendants initially, albeit unsuccessfully, moved for summary judgment relying upon the workers' compensation bar, they asserted they were plaintiff's joint employers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"> We recognize that <em>Millison </em>refers to a \u201ctrier-of-fact\u201d adjudication. <em>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 501 <em>A.2d </em>505. But we find it hard to ascribe to our Supreme Court a lack of understanding that many of these cases are settled. We are sure the offsetting credit was thought to encompass all monies a plaintiff might obtain from an intentional wrong tort employer, whether by verdict or by settlement, just as would occur in what might be considered the typical third person tort litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b260-11\"> Under the particular facts here, the appearance of the employer giving from one pocket and taking back from the other is not entirely accurate. As we have previously said, the workers' compensation benefits were paid by C &amp; K Moulding's insurance carrier whereas the tort settlement was paid by Dae Ryung Co.'s liability carrier. We suppose in most instances of employer intentional wrong tort actions there will be two different pockets \u2014 the workers' compensation insurance carrier and the liability insurance carrier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> <em>Jones </em>was superceded by the Ohio Tort Reform Act, <em>Ohio Rev.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 2317.45, that required collateral benefits received by a party to be deducted from a jury verdict. <em>Felden </em>v. <em>Ashland Chem.
