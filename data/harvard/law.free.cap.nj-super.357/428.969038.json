According to the prosecutor, \u201cdefendant\u2019s criminal history, his previous apathy towards rehabilitation and his prior poor performance on probation more than justified the prosecutor\u2019s position\u201d rejecting the \u201cDrug Court\u201d application. The State also objects to the fact that the judge decided to permit defendant\u2019s entry into the program before the charges were disposed of and, after the sentence was imposed, vacated the stay of sentence before the appeal was decided. We conclude that the admission of defendant into the program over the prosecutor\u2019s objection was improper, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">According to the State\u2019s submission to the trial court, on August 8, 2001, a Morristown police officer observed the defendant ingesting CDS while sitting on a bench in Abbett Avenue Park. The officer approached defendant and \u201ca fold containing suspected heroin residue was recovered from the bench.\u201d Defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>arrested, and incident thereto, another fold was recovered. A plastic bag containing 50 \u201csmall \u2018corner bags\u2019 of suspected cocaine\u201d was found during a search of defendant at the time of his commitment to the County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Defendant was 42 years old at the time of arrest. As reported in a \u201cChemical Dependency Evaluation\u201d prepared for the Office of the Public Defender by Thomas Melahn, a licensed social worker, defendant began consuming alcohol when he was seventeen years old. He began using cocaine while socializing in New York City in his twenties. Within six months of his first introduction to cocaine, he began purchasing cocaine in the Morristown area, and ingesting cocaine three to four nights during the week and on the weekends. Defendant became \u201chooked\u201d on heroin immediately after first using it in July 2001. He used two bags each day until his arrest on August 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Defendant held several jobs over his lifetime. In 1979, he worked as an orderly in the Morris View Nursing Home. After a year there, he worked in a Friendly\u2019s Kestaurant. From 1982 to 1993, he worked in the bookstore and the kitchen at the College of Saint Elizabeth. In 1996, he worked cleaning floors with an uncle. After this uncle moved from the area, he worked at the Mennen Arena in Morristown and at other jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Defendant has six prior convictions; all were drug-related. On April 16, 1992, he was convicted of third degree distribution of cocaine, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(b)(3). He was sentenced to two years of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 23,1992, he was placed on probation for two years for possession of cocaine under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a). On August 6, 1993, defendant was again placed on probation for possession of CDS, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l). He was required to enroll in an inpatient drug program as a condition of that probation. On October 2, 1997, defendant was sentenced on two accusations charging possession of cocaine and possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>cocaine and heroin, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l). He was placed on probation for two years with 50 days to be served in the county jail. He was required to \u201cattend and com[p]lete an outpatient-drug/alcohol treatment program approved by probation.\u201d On April 4, 1998, defendant was again sentenced for possession of cocaine in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l). The court ordered him to serve two years probation with urine monitoring. On December 22, 1998, defendant was again convicted of possession of cocaine under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l) and sentenced to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for four years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On March 19, 2002, defendant filed an \u201cApplication to the Drug Court Program\u201d with respect to the August 8, 2001 arrest. On April 22, 2002, the State filed a letter memorandum in opposition to the application,, asserting that (1) defendant\u2019s performance while on probation \u201cwas horrendous,\u201d (2) he failed to take advantage of an earlier opportunity to enter an inpatient drug treatment program in lieu of the four year custodial sentence, (3) he was a \u201csignificant street-level drug dealer,\u201d (4) he was found with fifty bags of cocaine in a playground \u201cfrequented by juveniles,\u201d and (5) the community\u2019s \u201cinterest in seeing the defendant punished\u201d outweighed his \u201cinterest in rehabilitation.\u201d On May 3, 2002, the Morris County Drug Program issued a \u201cNotice of Legal Eligibility Decision\u201d rejecting the application because defendant posed a \u201csignificant threat to the community,\u201d and because of his \u201cprofit motive\u201d in dealing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Defendant appealed the rejection and, on June 17, 2002, the prosecutor filed a letter \u201cbrief in opposition\u201d to his appeal. The State noted the pending charges of possession of cocaine and heroin and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and added that \u201c[ajlthough not charged on a complaint, there is probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cause to believe that [defendant] committed the crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 500 feet of a public park in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7.1.\u201d The State noted that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(c) provided that the court could not place defendant in the program over the State\u2019s objection because of the \u201cearlier distribution conviction,\u201d and \u201crejected the defendant\u2019s Drug Court application\u201d because of his prior conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5 and \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the current offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On June 20, 2002, the trial court held a hearing on the application. The defendant offered the Melahn report. In his report, Melahn analyzed the nine criteria for admission into the program, as embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a). In a supplemental report, Melahn concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">Prior to his introduction to narcotics, [defendant] was a gainfully employed individual with no prior criminal history ... He has not shown in any manner to be a threat to the community. Even his criminal history has no acts of violence. Mr. Hester may have difficult time coming to the reality of his drug problems and a need to gain treatment, but he is certainly a viable candidate for rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Additionally, the Drug Court\u2019s \u201ctas[c] evaluator,\u201d Samantha Brennan, noted at the hearing that defendant \u201cappears motivated\u201d and that \u201cwhatever his motivation is, clinically he is appropriate for Drug Court.\u201d Also, defendant asserted that his willingness to remain in the County Jail while his application was being processed and until program bed space became available, without obtaining post-judgment credits, reflected his commitment to the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">On June 27, 2002, the judge \u201coverrule[d] the rejection,\u201d and found that the State committed a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion\u201d in rejecting defendant\u2019s application. He applied the standard used in evaluating the State\u2019s decisions on admissions to the Pretrial Intervention Program (\u201cPTI\u201d), although he \u201c questioned] the application of this standard\u201d with respect to the Drug Court program because PTI dealt with pretrial diversion from prosecution. In finding a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion,\u201d the judge noted that defendant\u2019s prior convictions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>symptomatic of his drug addiction. The judge concluded that defendant\u2019s prior conviction for distribution of a \u201csmall amount of CDS\u201d was motivated by his need to generate income to purchase drugs for his own consumption and not \u201cstrictly for profit.\u201d He determined that the State was incorrect in labeling defendant a \u201cstreet level dealer\u201d without reference to his addiction. The judge found that defendant\u2019s possession of fifty bags of cocaine in this case was not conclusively for sale because the record indicated that an addict could consume such amounts and the defendant was supported by his mother, with whom he lived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge further found that the prosecutor failed to acknowledge that defendant\u2019s prior behavior, including his non-compliance with probation, was caused by relapse to drug use. The judge also concluded that the State neglected to consider the need to help solve defendant\u2019s addiction in opposing his admission for treatment. The judge felt defendant had reached \u201crock bottom\u201d and was committed to the program. There was support for the judge\u2019s conclusions in Me-lahn\u2019s report and the comments of Ms. Brennan.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The judge also made specific findings regarding the program. He cited to documents published by the State as providing guidance in sentencing defendants to Drug Court programs. He quoted the New Jersey State Judiciary publication, \u201cDrug Courts: A Plan for Statewide Implementation,\u201d for the proposition that the program is aimed at both punishing defendants for drug-related crimes and addressing the \u201croot causes\u201d of such crimes by ensuring proper drug rehabilitation where appropriate. The judge referenced the \u201cDrug Court Manual,\u201d for the principle that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Program saves costs because it prevents recidivism and future offenses by helping defendants with their addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The judge concluded that defendant qualified for special probation because his circumstances met the legislative purpose behind the program. He found that defendant was a drug addict and needed rehabilitation to control his addiction and not \u201cre-offend.\u201d The judge also found that defendant committed the present offenses \u201cwhile under the influence\u201d of drugs and \u201cto get money to support his heroin habit.\u201d He emphasized that defendant had committed \u201cno acts of violence,\u201d and absent his addiction, could become a \u201cproductive\u201d member of the community. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a). In essence, he found that the prosecutor\u2019s objection to admitting the defendant to the program constituted a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion,\u201d because he used \u201cinappropriate factors\u201d in formulating his position and made a \u201cclear error of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">On July 12, 2002, defendant entered a negotiated guilty plea to an accusation embodying the offenses of August 8, 2001. The accusation charged defendant with possession of heroin, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(l) (count one), possession of cocaine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(1) (count two), possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(a)(l), -5(b)(3) (count three), and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 500 feet of a public housing facility, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7.1 (count four). Defendant executed a \u201cwaiver of indictment and trial by jury\u201d and pled guilty to counts three and four. The prosecutor agreed to dismiss counts one and two and recommended a seven year sentence in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, \u201cwith 30 months parole ineligibility,\u201d pursuant to <em>State v. Brimage, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>1, 706 A.2d 1096 (1998).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant \u201creserve[d] his right to withdraw from his plea agreement if his sentence to the Morris County Drug Court Program is overturned by a higher court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>In entering the guilty plea, defendant admitted that he possessed fifty bags of cocaine, at least some of which he intended to \u201cdistribute\u201d or \u201cshare ... with other individuals.\u201d He also acknowledged that he was arrested with these bags in his possession in a playground that was within 500 feet of public housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The State\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration of the decision to admit defendant into the program was denied, and defendant was sentenced on August 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The judge merged the offenses for the purpose of sentencing and found that \u201caggravating factors on a straight sentence would outweigh the mitigating factors were it not for the Drug Court option.\u201d He sentenced defendant to seven years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections with thirty months to be served before parole eligibility,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but thereupon suspended the sentence and placed defendant on probation for five years with \u201cspecial conditions\u201d related to completion of \u201cthe Morris County Drug Court Program.\u201d The judgment of conviction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Defendant is placed on probation for a period of five years with the usual conditions, plus the following special conditions: complete the Morris County Drug Court Program, including but not limited to: enter and complete a six (6) month inpatient drug treatment program, complete all aftercare drug treatment programs; refrain from alcohol use; refrain from possession, use and distribution of CDS and associating with those who do; remain arrest free; refrain from possession of weapons; random urine monitoring; appear- at all court proceedings and for appointments with drug court personnel; abide by all terms and conditions of probation and the drag court, including all the terms of the participation agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The judge gave the following statement of reasons for the sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">This 43 year old defendant has pled guilty to one count each of possession of CDS with intent to distribute and possession of CDS with intent to distribute within 500 ft of a public park. He has a prior adult criminal history consisting of five felony convictions. The offenses are grounded in a continuing drug habit, an association with the drug culture and a financial need to deal with drug use. He is in need of probationary supervision with an inpatient drug treatment program followed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>intensive aftercare program. A period of incarceration is necessary to deter further criminal aetivity[;] however, if defendant successfully completes the Morris County Drug Court Program, the jail term of this sentence will be suspended. Defendant has a drug habit and he is sincere about getting the necessary help for his addiction. The court accepts the plea agreement due to the circumstances of the offense and the terms of the plea agreement which provides for entry into the Drug Court Program. In this regard, aggravating factors 3 (risk of reoffense)[,] 6 (prior criminal hislory)[,] &amp; 9 (deterrence) apply and are outweighed by mitigating factor 10 (response to probation). Given their quality and nature, the mitigating factors preponderate over the aggravating factors. Defendant is legally and clinically eligible for Drug Court and is sentenced into that program based upon the circumstances and reasons set out in the presentence report and on the record at the time of sentencing and taking of the plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The same day, the judge issued an \u201cOrder Staying Sentence\u201d \u201cpending the State\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Division.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On August 6, 2002, the State filed its Notice of Appeal with this court, appealing the judgment \u201csentenc[ing] defendant to special probation (Drug Court) over the [pjrosecutor\u2019s objection.\u201d On September 23, 2002, further argument was conducted on the State\u2019s stay application before the trial judge. On October 9, 2002, the judge entered an order consistent with his oral opinion of September 23, 2002, which denied a further stay of defendant\u2019s sentence pending a decision on appeal. The judge ordered defendant\u2019s transfer to a substance abuse program as soon as placement was made available. The order further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">FURTHER ORDERED <em>nunc pro tune </em>that Paragraph One (1) of the Court\u2019s August 1, 2002 order is hereby amended to accurately reflect the Court\u2019s decision granting a limited ten (10) day stay of the imposition of the August 1, 2002 sentence to allow the State to file a Notice of Appeal pursuant to 2C:35-14(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In deciding this appeal, we emphasize that defendant has not moved to dismiss the appeal or argued that the appeal cannot be considered in light of the October 9, 2002 order. <em>See, e.g., State v. Sanders, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>609, 620-22, 527 A.2d 442 (1987); <em>State v. Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>1, 429 A.2d 332 (1981); <em>State v. Watson, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 484, 444 A.2d 603 (App.Div.1982); <em>R. </em>2:9-3(d),(e). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>See also State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 257, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute provides for a stay of sentence to permit the State ten days in which to appeal so that, in the event of an appeal, the sentence is stayed pending the appeal. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(c). We also note that, consistent with the Code\u2019s provisions governing suspension of sentence and probation, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:45-1, -2, the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14, governing special probation for \u201cDrug and Alcohol Dependent Persons,\u201d do not permit the imposition of a sentence and its suspension before imposing the probationary sentence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Baylass, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>169, 553 A.2d 326 (1989); <em>State v. Dove, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 495 A.2d 487 (Law Div.1985). <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:35-14 contemplates that entry into the program be implemented by a \u201csentence of special probation,\u201d after a verdict or guilty plea, in which both the facts of the case and defendant\u2019s background are developed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a) (referring to person \u201cconvicted of or adjudicated delinquent for an offense\u201d), -14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14 was amended in 1999 to provide for the program of \u201cspecial probation.\u201d L.1999, e. 376, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To qualify for the Drug Court program and five year sentence of special probation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a) requires the court to find that defendant is \u201cdrug or alcohol dependent,\u201d committed the underlying offense while \u201cunder the influence\u201d of a controlled dangerous substance, \u201cdid not possess a firearm\u201d at the time of offense or any pending charge, and that defendant will \u201cbenefit\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>program which \u201cwill thereby reduce the likelihood that [he or she] will thereafter commit another offense.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a)(l)-(5). Defendants convicted of certain offenses and charged with certain crimes are <em>per se </em>ineligible, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a)(6),(7), and a licensed facility approved by the Department of Health must agree \u201cto provide appropriate treatment services,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a)(8). Moreover, the court must find that \u201cno danger to the community will result from the person being placed on special probation,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(a)(9). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14(a) also requires that the court consider \u201call relevant circumstances\u201d including those developed at \u201cthe trial, plea hearing or other court proceedings,\u201d as well as the \u201cpresentence report and the results of the professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent the person is drug or alcohol dependent and would benefit from treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Independent of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14(a), the statute also lists other crimes for which a defendant is disqualified from the program, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(b), which does not apply in this case, and charges for which the prosecutor must consent to enrollment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3o-14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(b) and (c) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">b. A person shall not be eligible for special probation pursuant to this section if the person is convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">(1) a crime of the first degree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">(2) a crime of the first or second degree enumerated in subsection d. of N.J.S. 20:43-7.2; <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">(3) a crime, other than that defined in N.J.S. 20:35-7, for which a mandatory minimum period of incarceration is prescribed under chapter 35 of this Title or any other law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">(4) an offense that involved the distribution or the conspiracy or attempt to distribute a controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog to a juvenile near or on school property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>c.

A person convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a crime of the second degree or of a violation of section 1 of P.L.1987, c. 101 (C.2C:35-7), or who previously has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for an offense under subsection a. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:35-5 or a similar offense under any other law of this State, any other state or the United States, who is placed on special probation under this section shall be committed to the custody of a residential treatment facility licensed and approved by the Department of Health and Senior Services, whether or not residential treatment was recommended by the person conducting the diagnostic assessment. The person shall be committed to the residential treatment facility immediately, unless the facility cannot accommodate the person, in which case the person shall be incarcerated to await commitment to the residential treatment facility. The term of such commitment shall be for a minimum of six months, or until the court, upon recommendation of the treatment provider, determines that the person has successfully completed the residential treatment program, whichever is later, except that no person shall remain in the custody of a residential treatment facility pursuant to this section for a period in excess of five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The guilty plea in this ease included the second degree crime of possession of CDS with intent to distribute within 500 feet of a public park in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7.1. That statute provides that any person possessing with intent to distribute or distributing a controlled dangerous substance within 500 feet of a public housing facility, a public park, or a public building is a second degree crime (with an exception with respect to marijuana). There is, therefore, a \u201cpresumption of imprisonment pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ant to subsection d of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:44-1,\u201d and the prosecutor had the right to object \u201cto the person being placed on special probation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(c). Accordingly, pursuant to the statute, the court could not place defendant on \u201cspecial probation,\u201d because of the prosecutor\u2019s objection, \u201cexcept upon a finding by the court of a gross and patent abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, defendant had previously been convicted of a crime under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(a), and the same right of the prosecutor to object is applicable thereto. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3.5-14(0).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion\u201d standard has evolved from our case law regarding PTI. Significantly, the standard was developed because PTI was initially adopted by court rule, <em>R. </em>3:28, and to resolve the constitutional challenge resulting from the diversion and dismissal of criminal cases over prosecutorial objection. <em>See State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 371-76, 381-82, 375 A.2d 607 (1977). That standard was incorporated into the review of the denial of PTI applications when the pretrial intervention program was codified in the Code of Criminal Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 and 13. <em>See State v. Dalglish, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>503, 508-15, 432 A.2d 74 (1981) (finding legislative intent to maintain the standard and employing it notwithstanding the absence of separation of powers issue); <em>see also State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996). Because of the long history, known to the Legislature, with respect to that standard, there is little doubt that the same construction of the term \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion\u201d is applicable in connection with review of prosecutorial objections to admission into a Drug Court program and imposition of the conditions of probation pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See State v. N.I., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, 319-20, 793 A.2d 760 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>(App.Div.2002), referring to the standard under <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:35-14, in connection with an application under <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The trial judge in this case raised concern that the PTI standard may not be appropriate in reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s decision to oppose admission to a Drug Court program because the decisions take place at different stages of the proceedings. The judge asserted that a decision to admit a defendant to PTI comes before trial, thereby affecting the Executive Branch\u2019s authority to prosecute, while the decision to admit a defendant to a Drug Court program is essentially a sentencing decision. The judge suggested that the prosecutor\u2019s decision in denying PTI may be accorded more deference than opposition to admission to a Drug Court program because the former deals with the decision to prosecute. <em>See State v. Leonardis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">However, the Drug Court program and the ability to impose a specific sentence is a legislative matter, <em>see, e.g., State v. Des Marets, 92 N.J. </em>62, 77-81, 455 A.2d 1074 (1983) (upholding Graves Act legislation preventing suspended sentences), and the question before us relates to the legislative intent concerning the availability of the disposition or sentence alternative. The Statement accompanying the 1999 amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14 declared that the \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion ... formulation codifies the current standard of review used to determine whether a prosecutor inappropriately refused to join the defendant\u2019s application under current law.\u201d <em>Statement, Senate Bill No. 1253, State of New Jersey, 208th Legislature; Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee Statement with Committee Amendments, December 2, 1999; Senate Law and Public Safety Commit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>tee Statement with Committee Amendments, January 25, 1999. </em>The \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion\u201d standard was well known to the Legislature in light of the history of PTI and, in any event, the meaning of the phrase was well-established in our case law, and was expressly adopted in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">To succeed on this appeal, therefore, \u201cdefendant must show that the prosecutor\u2019s decision \u2018(a) was not premised upon a consideration of all relevant factors, (b) was based upon a consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors, or (c) amounted to a clear error in judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brooks, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>215, 225, 814 A.2d 1051 (2002) quoting <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 93, 402 A.2d 217 (1979). Moreover, to rise to the level of \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion,\u201d it must be shown \u201cthat the prosecutorial error complained of will clearly subvert the goals underlying\u201d the Drug Court program. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26, 814 A.2d 1051; <em>see also, e.g., State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 445, 690 A.2d 594 (1997); <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 581-86, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996); <em>State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 253-54, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995). Thus, \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s decision to reject a [Drug Court] applicant \u2018will be rarely overturned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 226-26, 814 A.2d 1051, quoting <em>Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 585, 684 A.2d 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">This case involves no disputed fact-finding. The trial judge found that the prosecutor placed undue emphasis on the defendant\u2019s offenses, while ignoring his addiction, thereby considering inappropriate factors. The judge stated that the defendant was \u201ca suffering drug addict and he needs help.\u201d The judge, therefore, concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s opposition was a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d because the defendant was \u201cnot a violent offender\u201d and \u201cnot a danger to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">As noted at the outset, the State argues that it did not commit a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion\u201d in opposing the defendant\u2019s application to the Program for several reasons. The State insists its \u201cdecision makes sense\u201d in light of defendant\u2019s \u201cprior performance on probation and his attitude towards rehabilitation,\u201d and that the judge incorrectly found that it considered inappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>factors by relying on its determination that the defendant was a drug dealer and the fact that the offense was committed in a public park. The State also claims that the judge ignored the finding by the program that the defendant\u2019s sale of drugs was \u201cmotivated by profit\u201d and that defendant posed a \u201cdanger to the community,\u201d particularly because he engaged in drug dealing for profit. His defense expert Melahn noted in his evaluation that defendant \u201chad in his possession 30-40 bags of Cocaine for the intent of distribution to obtain financial gain and support his Heroin addiction\u201d and a separate bag \u201cfor personal use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Like the development of <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b) and <em>R. </em>3:28 (PTI) programs in the 1970s and the Intensive Supervision Program in the 1980s and 1990s (ultimately enacted as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-11), the development of the Drug Court program is a significant and important initiative designed to avoid criminal activity and recidivism. While certain charges and convictions present disqualifications and prosecutorial consent is needed for others, prior convictions for possessory offenses under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10 present no bar to admission. <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:35-14(a)(6).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hence, the program is designed to help the defendant with a history or record of possessory offenses, and, in turn, to protect the public from these offenders.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We express confidence that prosecutors share the most commendable goals of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In this case, defendant had both a prior conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5 and pled guilty to a second degree crime. As a result, the prosecutor\u2019s consent to participation in the Drug Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>program was required on both grounds. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14(c). Significantly, the prosecutor\u2019s rejection was not based merely on defendant\u2019s prior conviction for violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5, or because of the present charge of a second degree crime. <em>See, e.g., State v. Caliguiri, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>28, 726 A.2d 912 (1999); <em>State v. Baynes, supra </em>(rejection cannot be based on offense alone). Rather, the articulated rejection, or lack of consent, was attributable to the totality of circumstances relating both to the defendant, including his prior unsuccessful opportunities for treatment on probation, and the specifics of the present offense which included possession of 50 bags of cocaine with intent to distribute in a public park. On that basis, and given the nature of the offenses and the factual basis for defendant\u2019s ultimate guilty plea, we cannot say that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s decision could not have been reasonably made upon weighing the relevant factors\u201d or constituted a patent and gross abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 589, 684 A.2d 1355; <em>State v. Nwobu, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 254, 652 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\"> <em>See also R. </em>2:3-1(b)(6) permitting appeals by the State where \"provided by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> As a result, defendant was exposed in this case to an extended terra with a mandatory ineligibility terra under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6f. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Lagares, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>20, 601 A.2d 698 (1992); <em>see also State v.
