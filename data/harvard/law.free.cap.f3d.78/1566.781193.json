Charles W. Daff, Trustee in Bankruptcy for Triad Microsystems, Inc. (\u201cTriad\u201d), appeals the August 15, 1994 decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims in <em>Daff v. United States, </em>31 Fed.Cl. 682 (1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that decision, following a trial, the court sustained the termination for default of Triad\u2019s contract through the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) with the United States Army Missile Command (\u201cMI-COM\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the court granted the government recovery on its counterclaim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>the return of unliquidated progress payments and awarded it penalties and damages under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729-31 (1994). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AWke\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">In September 1984, MICOM awarded Triad Contract No. SB9-84r-l-1636 for the production of 1,432 TOW Missile Vehicle Power Conditioners (\u201cTVPCs\u201d). <em>Daff </em>31 Fed.Cl. at 686. TOW missiles are guided missiles that maintain contact, by means of a wire, with the source from which they are fired. <em>Id. </em>The missile operator focuses on the target, thereby guiding the missile. <em>Id. </em>A TVPC is a device that allows the missile to interface with a vehicle, such as a jeep. <em>Id. </em>Because it is exposed to the elements, the TVPC must be weatherproof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Several contract provisions are pertinent to the instant dispute. The first of these provisions concerned the type of flux to be used when assembling the TVPCs. Flux, which is used to clean corrosion and residue from metal parts before they are soldered together, increases the ability of solder to adhere to metal. The metal to be soldered is dipped first in the flux and then in the molten solder. The solder, which is usually a tin-lead alloy, binds together the pieces of metal to be joined. The contract distinguished between RA (rosin activated) flux and RMA (rosin mildly activated) flux. RA flux contains solvents such as chlorine and bromine. If these solvents are not removed from a surface to be cleaned, they can form corrosive substances that degrade the metal underneath the soldered surface. RMA flux, in contrast, contains milder acid residues, which do not corrode the underlying metal. Section 3.2.2 of the contract stated as follows: \u201cRosin based fluxes conforming to QQ-S-571 and MIL-F-14256 shall be utilized. Type RA flux may be used only on printed board assemblies without stranded wires.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The contract also contained a provision relating to the physical integrity of the TVPC chassis. An O-ring seals the chassis of the TVPC. Note 22 on Drawing 1206 of the contract required that the fit between the O-ring and the chassis be tight enough to allow the TVPC to emit no more than one bubble per minute when pressurized and submerged in three to ten inches of water. <em>Daff, </em>31 Fed. Cl. at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Finally, the contract incorporated by reference a number of standard government contract provisions, including the default clause set forth at Federal Acquisition Regulations (\u201cFAR\u201d) \u00a7 52.249-8, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.249-8 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">The TVPC contract became effective September 21, 1984. By letter dated May 9, 1988, the contracting officer informed Triad that he was terminating the contract for default on the grounds that Triad had delivered defective goods and had falsified contract records. The letter concluded by stating that it was the final decision of the contracting officer. The letter was not preceded by a cure notice. At the time of the default letter, Triad had received $11,166,-479.00 in progress payments, and had furnished MICOM with 673 allegedly operational TVPCs. <em>Daff </em>31 Fed.Cl. at 687. After the default termination, MICOM tested the TVPCs it had received from Triad and made repairs where necessary, incurring $240,-714.74 in expenses in the process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">On May 11,1988, Triad filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws in California, its state of incorporation. Subsequently, on May 20,1988, it instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>reinstatement of the TVPC contract. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on July 5, 1988, after the district court concluded that the action was governed by the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">In June and September of 1988, the government filed proofs of claim against Triad in the bankruptcy proceeding. In so doing, it asserted entitlement to $6,251,924.78 in un-liquidated progress payments. <em>Id. </em>The contracting officer demanded the return of the progress payments in a letter to Triad dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>July 28, 1988. This letter was not in the form of a final decision, however. Subsequently, on January 3, 1990, the contracting officer sent Triad a letter that was in the form of a final decision, in which he sought the return of the progress payments. On September 7, 1990, the bankruptcy court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the government\u2019s claims and transferred the case to the Court of Federal Claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">On November 20, 1990, Triad formally brought suit in the Court of Federal Claims. In its suit, it challenged the contracting officer\u2019s final decisions of May 9, 1988, and January 3, 1990, which, respectively, terminated the TVPC contract for default and demanded the return of unliquidated progress payments. Triad asserted that the court had jurisdiction under both the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (1994), and the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">On November 12, 1991, Triad submitted a claim to the contracting officer seeking to have the May 9, 1988 default termination converted to a termination for the convenience of the government and requesting the payment of convenience termination costs in the amount of $5,977,438.00. On March 12, 1992, after the contracting officer had failed to issue a final decision on the claim, Triad filed a Fourth Amended Complaint in the Court of Federal Claims, in which it joined the termination for convenience claim with its pending challenges to the default termination and the government\u2019s demand for the return of unliquidated progress payments. In its answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint, the government alleged as an affirmative defense that Triad\u2019s claims were barred by \u201cfraud and illegality\u201d relating to the con-eealment and falsification of TVPC test results. The government also counterclaimed against Triad for the unliquidated progress payments under the TVPC contract. Subsequently, on November 10, 1992, the government amended its answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint. In so doing, it repeated its counterclaim for the return of the unliquidated progress payments. In addition, it asserted a counterclaim under the False Claims Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The government based this second counterclaim on the allegation that Triad had defrauded the government (i) by using RA flux when the contract required RMA flux; (ii) by using Vaseline to conceal leak test failures, again contrary to the provisions of the contract; and (iii) by concealing its actions from MICOM. The government sought both penalties and damages under the False Claims Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Both before and after trial, Triad argued t that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction because of various alleged deficiencies in the May 9, 1988 decision of the contracting officer terminating the contract for default. These arguments were rejected. <em>Doff, </em>31 Fed.Cl. at 687-88. On the merits, following trial, the court upheld the termination for default and awarded the government judgment on its counterclaims. <em>Id. </em>at 686. The court found that Triad had breached the TVPC contract and had committed fraud by using RA flux on stranded wires, <em>id. </em>at 691, by applying Vaseline to O-rings to seal units failing leak tests, and by concealing its actions, <em>id. </em>at 694. The court directed Triad to repay unliquidated progress payments in the amount of $5,602,177.36 and imposed on Triad a $5,000.00 civil penalty and $600,000.00 in treble damages under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>False Claims Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 697. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Transamerica Ins. Corp. v. United States, </em>973 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1992). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). We review issues of law <em>de novo. Triax-Pacific v. Stone, </em>958 F.2d 351, 353 (Fed.Cir. 1992). Jurisdiction is an issue of law. <em>Transamerica, </em>973 F.2d at 1576.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Triad argues that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction over both its claims and the government\u2019s counterclaims. It bases its argument on the contention that the contracting officer\u2019s letter of May 9,1988 terminating the TVPC contract for default was defective as a jurisdictional prerequisite for a CDA action. A valid contracting officer\u2019s decision is a prerequisite for a suit under the CDA. <em>Sharman Co. v. United States, </em>2 F.3d 1564, 1568 (Fed.Cir.1993). Starting from this premise, Triad claims that the contracting officer\u2019s May 9 final decision was not valid because the contracting officer \u201clacked the authority to issue a CDA type termination decision on the basis of allegations of fraud on Triad\u2019s part.\u201d In making this argument, Triad points to 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a), which states, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-9\">[a]ll claims by the government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be the subject of a decision by the contracting officer____ This section shall not authorize any agency head to settle, compromise, pay, or otherwise adjust any claim involving fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">Triad also points to FAR \u00a7 33.010, which states, in relevant part, that a contracting officer\u2019s authority \u201cto decide or settle all claims arising under or relating to a contract subject to the [CDA]\u201d does not extend to \u201c[a] claim involving fraud.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 33.010 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Finally, Triad cites <em>Somali Development Bank v. United States, </em>508 F.2d 817, 205 Ct.Cl. 741 (1974), and <em>Mulholland v. United States, </em>361 F.2d 237, 245, 175 Ct.Cl. 832 (1966), for the proposition that, in a CDA case, \u201c[i]f there is no jurisdiction over the primary claim, then any government counterclaim must be dismissed as beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d From that starting point, Triad argues that the Court of Federal Claims did not have jurisdiction to hear the government\u2019s counterclaims because the claims against which the government was asserting its counterclaims \u2014 Triad\u2019s challenge to the default termination and its related claim for convenience termination costs\u2014 were not properly before the court in the first place by reason of the contracting officer\u2019s lack of authority to issue the May 9, 1988 final decision terminating the contract for default.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">As is evident from the foregoing, the linchpin of Triad\u2019s jurisdictional argument is the proposition that the contracting officer terminated the TVPC contract on account of fraud. The contracting officer\u2019s May 9, 1988 final decision letter to Triad stated, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-15\">You are hereby notified that your [contract ... is hereby terminated pursuant to the contract clause entitled \u201cDefault\u201d. Such termination will be effective immediately upon receipt of this notice of termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asr-dedup-0\">This contract is terminated because of acts or omissions constituting the default as follows: Solderers performing work on this contract did not receive the minimum required level of training which resulted in defective and non-operational hardware delivered to the Government, and required records for certification of solderers have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>been intentionally falsified resulting in damage to the Government. Your right to proceed further with performance of the contract is terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In his letter, the contracting officer stated two separate and distinct reasons for the default termination. The first reason was the delivery by Triad of \u201cdefective and nonoperational hardware\u201d as a result of solderers who worked on the contract not having received \u201cthe minimum required level of training.\u201d The second reason was the alleged intentional falsification of required records relating to the certification of solderers. Thus, we read the contracting officer\u2019s letter as terminating the TVPC contract for default (1) because Triad had failed to perform in accordance with the requirements of the contract and (\u00fc) because Triad had committed fraud.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">As noted above, the TVPC contract incorporated by reference one of the standard FAR default clauses. That clause, set forth in FAR \u00a7 52.249-8, provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-7\">[t]he Government may, ... by written notice of default to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">(i) Deliver the supplies or to perform the services within the time specified in this contract or any extension;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-9\">(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-10\">(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.249-8. \u201c[I]n order for the contractor to render \u2018timely performance,\u2019 two basic requirements must be satisfied: (1) the product ... must conform to the required design/performanee specifications, and (2) the product must be delivered or the work completed by the specified due date.\u201d John Cibinic, Jr. and Ralph C. Nash, Jr., <em>Administration of Government Contracts </em>908 3d ed. 1995); <em>see also Mega Const. Co. v. United States, </em>29 Fed.Cl. 396 (1993). Thus, a contracting officer is entitled to terminate a supply contract for default when, as was alleged here, the contractor furnishes the government with goods that do not meet the requirements of the contract. <em>Radiation Technology, Inc. v. United States, </em>366 F.2d 1003, 1006, 177 Ct.Cl. 227 (1966). In short, FAR \u00a7 52.249-8 plainly granted the contracting officer authority to terminate the TVPC contract for default on account of defective contract performance. The contracting officer exercised that authority, and we see no reason to hold that his authority was in any way diminished by the fact that he asserted fraudulent conduct on the part of Triad as an additional ground for the default termination. Thus, the contracting officer\u2019s May 9, 1988 letter constituted a valid final decision for purposes of establishing jurisdiction under the CDA, because the letter set forth a ground for the termination that the contracting officer was authorized to assert, <em>i.e., </em>failure to perform according to the terms of the contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">Triad contends, however, that to the extent the default termination was premised upon the delivery of non-conforming goods, it was \u201ctechnically defective\u201d because \u201c[t]here was <em>no </em>cure notice as required under ... FAR 52.249-8.\u201d We understand Triad to be arguing that the lack of a cure notice rendered the contracting officer\u2019s May 9, 1988 final decision invalid and therefore ineffective as a jurisdictional predicate for a CDA claim. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that any deficiencies in the TVPCs furnished by Triad were minor and that Triad thus substantially complied with the requirements of the contract, so that it was entitled to a reasonable period of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>in which to cure the defects, <em>see Radiation Technology, </em>366 F.2d at 1006, the error of terminating the contract for default without issuing a cure notice would not have any effect on CDA jurisdiction. Quite simply, Triad is urging us to find a jurisdictional defect because the default termination on the merits was premature. The contention is without merit and we reject it. That a default termination may be improper as a matter of government contract law has no bearing on the jurisdiction of the tribunal hearing the case under the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Because the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction to hear Triad\u2019s challenge to the termination for default, it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the government\u2019s counterclaims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2508, the Court of Federal Claims is authorized to enter judgment in favor of the United States against a plaintiff in the amount in which the plaintiff is found to be indebted to the United States as a result of any \u201cset-off, counterclaim, claim for damages, or other demand [which] is set up on the part of the United States against any plaintiff making claim against the United States in said court____\u201d Additionally, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction \u201cto render judgment upon any setoff or demand by the United States against any plaintiff in such court.\u201d Thus, the court had jurisdiction with respect to both the government\u2019s demand for the return of unliquidated progress payments and its fraud claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over Triad\u2019s challenge to the default termination and its claim for convenience termination costs. We also conclude that the court had jurisdiction over the government\u2019s counterclaim for the return of unliquidated progress payments, as well as its counterclaim under the False Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">As noted above, the trial court found that Triad defrauded the government by using RA flux when RMA flux was required, by applying Vaseline to O-rings to hide leak test failures, and by hiding its actions. Triad\u2019s first challenge to these findings is a legal one. With respect to the flux issue, it points to the fact that section 3.4.3 of the contract stated: \u201cMore active fluxes than those specified in 3.2.2 may be used, provided that all ionic and non-ionic contaminants are removed within one hour from the time that the item was returned.\u201d Triad argues that this provision allowed the use of RA flux on stranded wires. With respect to the issue of Vaseline being used as a sealant, Triad claims that it \u201cchose to lubricate the O-Ring to assure its proper installation because the standard trade practice indicated this process was necessary for successful and proper lubrication and sealing of the O-Ring.\u201d Triad asserts that a note on the O-Ring contract drawing indicated to \u201ca knowledgeable engineer ... that standard industry practice should be used for the installation of the O-Ring.\u201d Triad thus contends that its use of Vaseline did not violate the provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">Contract interpretation is an issue of law that we review <em>de novo. C. Sanchez &amp; Son, Inc. v. United States, </em>6 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>1539, 1544 (Fed.Cir.1993). As far as soldering is concerned, the contract stated in section 3.2.2 that \u201cRA flux may be used only on printed board assemblies without stranded wires.\u201d In the face of this clear and unequivocal provision, the general language in section 3.4.3 of the contract quoted above does not help Triad. We view that general language as only allowing the contractor to use more active fluxes than the fluxes \u201cspecified in 3.2.2.\u201d The fluxes \u201cspecified in 3.2.2\u201d are \u201c[r]osin based fluxes conforming to QQ-S-571 and MIL-F-14256.\u201d Section 3.4.3, upon which Triad relies, makes no reference to the prohibition against the use of RA flux on stranded wires that is contained in section 3.2.2. Triad\u2019s argument fails because it runs afoul of the rule that specific contract provisions prevail over general provisions. <em>See Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States, </em>351 F.2d 972, 980, 169 Ct.Cl. 384 (1965) (referring to the \u201csettled rule that where an agreement contains general and specific provisions which are in any respect inconsistent or conflicting, the provision directed to a particular matter controls over the provision which is general in its terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">We also reject Triad\u2019s argument relating to the O-ring issue. It is important to recognize that the trial court\u2019s fraud finding on this issue was not based merely on the fact that Triad used Vaseline in installing 0-rings. The court characterized as \u201cinnocent\u201d Triad\u2019s use of Vaseline to lubricate or clean O-rings prior to installation. <em>Dajf, </em>31 Fed. Cl. at 694. What the court found to be \u201cpernicious\u201d and what formed the basis for the court\u2019s finding of fraud was the application of Vaseline to TVPCs that failed leak tests before they were retested: \u201cThere was no pretense at this point that the vaseline was used to help the O-ring seat better, or to clean off talcum powder. The sole purpose of liberal applications of vaseline was to avoid the effects of a failed, and unrecorded, leak test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Assuming that the note on the 0-ring drawing did incorporate trade practice into the contract \u2014 a proposition that the note hardly supports \u2014 and assuming further that trade practice would allow the use of Vaseline for certain limited purposes, it goes without saying that trade practice would not allow the contractor to use Vaseline-in order to conceal the failure of tests that were required under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Next, Triad attacks the trial court\u2019s findings of fact on the ft\u2019aud issue. In determining that Triad had committed fraud, the court relied upon the testimony of government employees and former Triad employees. The testimony of the former Triad employees pointed to Triad\u2019s consistent use of RA flux on stranded wires and of Vaseline on O-rings as a sealant after TVPCs had failed the leak test required by the contract. Triad characterizes the testimony of these witnesses as \u201cquestionable\u201d and argues that the witnesses did not provide any evidence that Triad actually violated any of the contract provisions. We do not find this argument persuasive. The trial court\u2019s fraud finding rests on the testimony of witnesses the court found credible.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such credibility determinations are \u201cvirtually unreviewable.\u201d <em>Hambsch v. Department of the Treasury, </em>796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed.Cir.1986). We see no clear error in the trial court\u2019s finding that the government proved by clear and convincing evidence, <em>see Hageny v. United States, </em>570 F.2d 924, 933, 215 Ct.Cl. 412 (1978), that Triad committed fraud under the TVPC contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Finally, Triad contends that the trial court erred in its monetary award because the government presented no evidence as to the exact quantum of repair costs for fraud damages, and because the court should have offset the value of contract inventory in the government\u2019s possession against the award of unliquidated progress payments. As for the evidence presented regarding repair costs, Triad has failed to convince us that the court clearly erred in its finding that, with one minor exception, the government presented sufficient evidence regarding the expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>incurred in testing and repairing defective TVPCs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">As far as the contract inventory issue is concerned, the trial court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5C\">[a]t the time of issuance of the government claims and as late as the time of filing the complaint, the manufacturing materials in question were not in the government\u2019s possession or control____ Events subsequent to the claim and the complaint cannot add to the jurisdiction defined by the claims appealed____ [U]nder the present circumstances, the court has before it only the government\u2019s demand for unliquidated progress payments, offset by accepted product. Accordingly, there is no occasion for the court to deal with the question of title to the manufacturing materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-8\"><em>Daff, </em>31 Fed.Cl. at 696-97. Thus, the court did not offset against its award of unliquidated progress payments to the government the value of any manufacturing materials purportedly in the government\u2019s possession. This was not error. The default clause incorporated into the contract required that \u201c[t]he Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause.\u201d FAR \u00a7 52.249 \u2014 8(f), 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.249-8. Before the value of any inventory in the government\u2019s possession could be offset against the award to the government of unliquidated progress payments, Triad had to submit a claim to the contracting officer to that effect. <em>See Joseph Morton Co. v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 1273, 1280 (Fed.Cir.1985) (claims \u201cnot inextricably linked with liability for fraud[ ] must first be the \u2018subject of a decision by a contracting officer\u2019 \u201d) (citing 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a)). Because Triad had not submitted such a claim, the trial court was correct in concluding that it had no jurisdiction to decide the issue of the value of the inventory materials in the government\u2019s possession and then offset that value against the progress payments award.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Because the contracting officer terminated the TVPC contract based upon Triad\u2019s alleged failure to provide goods complying with the requirements of the contract, the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction with respect to Triad\u2019s challenge to the default termination, Triad\u2019s claim for convenience termination costs, and the government\u2019s counterclaims. As far as the merits are concerned, neither the finding of the trial court that Triad committed fraud nor the trial court\u2019s monetary award in favor of the government is clearly erroneous or tainted by legal error. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-15\">.

This is not a case in which a contracting officer terminated a contract by relying solely on allegations of fraud. We therefore do not need to address the question of whether a jurisdictional defect would have existed if the termination for default letter had asserted fraud, and nothing more, as the ground for the termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\">. Prior to October 29, 1992, the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over a challenge to a default termination only when that challenge included a monetary claim. <em>See Overall Roofing and Constr. Inc. v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 687, 688 (Fed.Cir.1991). When Triad brought suit in the Court of Federal Claims on November 20, 1990, that court had jurisdiction because Triad challenged not only the May 9, 1988 default termination but also the January 3, 1990 demand for the return of unliquidated progress payments that flowed from the default termination. Additionally, in its Fourth Amended Complaint, Triad added a claim for the payment of convenience termination costs. In October of 1992, Congress amended the Tucker Act to give the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over pure default terminations in which no monetary claim was asserted.

From the record before us, it does not appear that the contracting officer issued a final decision asserting the claims set forth in the government's November 13, 1992 fraud counterclaim.
