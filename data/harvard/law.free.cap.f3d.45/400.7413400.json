The district court sentenced McLymont to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment. The issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it ordered Appellant\u2019s sentence for carrying and using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentences. Appellant\u2019s position is that USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b) requires a concurrent sentence in this case because Appellant was prosecuted in federal and state court for the same criminal conduct. Appellee\u2019s position is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and the Sentencing Guidelines mandate a consecutive sentence. For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b) required the district court to impose a concurrent sentence overlooks the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(a), both of which mandate the imposition of a consecutive sentence. Section 924(e) provides for a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment for persons who use or carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. This statute specifically limits the district court\u2019s discretion in sentencing by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq8H\"><em>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>the court shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection, <em>nor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection run concurrently </em>with any other term of imprisonment including that imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in which the firearm was used or carried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In interpreting the language of the statute, this Court must assume that Congress used the words of the statute as they are commonly and ordinarily understood and must construe the statute so each of its provisions is given full effect. <em>United States v. Rawlings, </em>821 F.2d 1543, 1545 (11th Cir.) (interpreting penalty provision of \u00a7 924(c) for \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 979, 108 S.Ct. 494, 98 L.Ed.2d 492 (1987). Further, the plain meaning of the statute controls unless the language is ambiguous or leads to absurd results. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>957 F.2d 835, 836 (11th Cir.1992) (interpreting the phrase \u201cduring and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 924(c) to include trading guns for drugs), aff'd, - U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Under these rules of statutory construction, the plain meaning of \u00a7 924(c) reflects a congressional mandate that a person who carries a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime serve an additional term of imprisonment. Congress\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d makes it clear that Congress intended the penalty provisions of \u00a7 924(c) to take precedence over any preexisting or subsequently-enacted sentencing legislation, including the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Moreover, Congress\u2019 use of the language \u201cnor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection ran concurrently with any other term of imprisonment\u201d clearly evinces a Congressional intent that the mandatory punishment be in addition to any other term of imprisonment, regardless of whether the other terms of imprisonment were for the type of related conduct described in USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b). As such, this Court has recently stated that \u201c[t]he plain language of [section 924(e) ] expressly states that a <em>term </em>of imprisonment imposed under section 924(e) cannot <em>run </em>concurrently with any other <em>term </em>of imprisonment, period. No exceptions are provided.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>33 F.3d 1349, 1350 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">Congressional intent that violations of \u00a7 924(c) be punished by mandatory consecutive sentences is also reflected in USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(a), which provides in pertinent part that \u201cIf the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was convicted under [18 U.S.C. 924(c) ] ..., the term of imprisonment is that required by statute.\u201d The comments to USSG \u00a7 2K2.4 state that: \u201cIn each case, the statute requires a term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ment imposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-2\">In light of the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(a), it is clear that USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b) has no application to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and its mandatory sentencing provision. The district court properly ordered that Appellant\u2019s sentence for carrying and using a firearm run consecutively to his undischarged state sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
