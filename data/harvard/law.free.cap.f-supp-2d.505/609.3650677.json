The Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND with respect to the Fifth Cause of Action for conversion and the Sixth Cause of Action for unfair business practices insofar as it is based on violations of sections of the Labor Code other than \u00a7 227.3. Wal-Mart\u2019s Motion to Strike is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages and DENIED in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">This is a consolidated action against defendant, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., brought in two separate actions. The Smith and Wiggins action (C 06-2069 SBA) was commenced in this District on March 20, 2006 with the filing of the original Complaint. Plaintiffs Ballard and Lyons commenced an action in the Los Angeles County Superior Court on May 17, 2006. That action was subsequently removed, and the Central District transferred the matter to this District (C 06-05411 JSW).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">The Ballard and Lyons action was reassigned to this Court as being related to the Smith and Wiggins case. <em>See </em>Docket No. 57. On January 9, 2007, the Court ordered that the two cases be consolidated for all purposes and that a single \u201cConsolidated Class Action Complaint\u201d be filed, pursuant to Stipulation. <em>See </em>Docket No. 67. By stipulation approved by the Court, plaintiffs were granted leave to file the First Amended Consolidated Complaint (\u201cFACC\u201d). <em>See </em>Docket No. 78. The FACC was filed on March 27, 2007. <em>See </em>Docket No. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Plaintiffs assert six claims for relief against Wal-Mart, alleging that Wal-Mart has \u201cadministered and employed a corporate policy, practice and/or custom\u201d of engaging in the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-14\">(1) violations of California Labor Code sections 201-203 by late payment of wages at termination, FACC \u00b6\u00b6 42-50;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-15\">(2) violations of California Labor Code section 227.3 by nonpayment of accrued vacation at termination, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51-58;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-16\">(3) violations of California Labor Code sections 500, 510 and 1194 for failure to pay overtime to non-exempt employees, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 59-69;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-17\">(4) violations of California Labor Code section 226 by failure to accurately record and report wages, id \u00b6\u00b6 70-75;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-18\">(5) unfair business practices under California Business and Professions Code sections 17200 ef <em>seq., </em>based on the same alleged violations set out in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>through fourth and the sixth claims for relief, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 76-82; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeF\">(6) conversion of wages. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 83-95.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af_\">Plaintiffs purport to bring their claims on behalf of a class composed of all former employees of Wal-Mart who fit within one of four subclasses. FACC \u00b6 32. The four subclasses are defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">(1) The \u201cTerminated Sub-Class\u201d is defined as terminated employees who \u201cdid not receive all of the wages due them at the time of termination, and/or did not receive their final wages in a timely manner as mandated by California law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">(2) The \u201cVacation Sub-Class\u201d seeks to include all employees who \u201chave not received full and complete compensation for all vested \u2018vacation pay\u2019 as the same is defined under California law and IWC regulations, including, but not limited to, vacation pay, personal time, holiday pay, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">(3) The \u201cCompensation Sub-Class\u201d includes employees who are \u201cproperly classified hourly-pay employees of Defendant ... who have not received all compensation due them for hours worked, including overtime worked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">(4) The \u201cItemized Statement SubClass\u201d purports to include employees \u201cwho have not received an accurate and complete itemization of wages earned, rates of pay, etc.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Plaintiffs allege that \u201c[a]ll of the named Plaintiffs herein are members of\u2019 each sub-class. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 33. Each named plaintiff is a former employee of Wal-Mart who worked for Wal-Mart between September 2003 and March 2006. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26, 28-30. Plaintiff Smith was a salaried manager, and the other three named plaintiffs were hourly employees. <em>Id. </em>Further, each of the named plaintiffs allegedly was not paid accrued vacation pay, personal time pay and/or holiday pay, and allegedly was given a final wage statement that was incorrect. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-30. Nothing further is alleged with respect to Plaintiffs Smith, Ballard and Lyons. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-30. With respect to plaintiff Wiggins, plaintiffs allege that \u201cWal-Mart would \u2018shave off time from [Wiggins\u2019] time cards whereby Mr. Wiggins was not paid for all of the hours he worked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 27. Plaintiffs further allege, that \u201cwhen Mr. Wiggins worked a graveyard shift, Wal-Mart would count the hours worked before midnight as working one day, and all the hours worked after midnight as hours worked on another day, thereby denying Mr. Wiggins overtime pay.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">\n<em>LEGAL STANDARD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">I. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss should be granted if the plaintiff is unable to delineate \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014- U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (abrogating. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). For purposes of such a motion, the complaint is construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff and all properly pleaded factual allegations are taken as true. <em>Jenkins v. McKeithen, </em>395 U.S. 411, 421, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969); <em>Everest &amp; Jennings, Inc. v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>23 F.3d 226, 228 (9th Cir.1994). All reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Jacobson v. Hughes Aircraft, </em>105 F.3d 1288, 1296 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">The court does not accept as true unreasonable inferences or conclusory legal allegations cast in the form of factual allegations. <em>Western Mining Council v. Watt, </em>643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir.1981); <em>see Miranda v.

Motion to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides that a court \u201cmay order stricken from any pleading ... any redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous matter.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f). \u201c \u2018Immaterial\u2019 matter is that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief or the defenses being pleaded.\u201d <em>Fantasy, Inc. v.

Alco Pacific, Inc., </em>217 F.Supp.2d 1028, 1033 (C.D.Cal.2002). Motions to strike are \u201cgenerally not granted unless it is clear that the matter sought to be stricken could have no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation.\u201d <em>Rosales v. Citibank, Federal Sav. Bank, </em>133 F.Supp.2d 1177, 1180 (N.D.Cal.2001). Any doubt concerning the import of the allegations to be stricken weighs in favor of denying the motion to strike. <em>See In re 2The-Mart.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.Supp.2d 955, 965 (C.D.Cal.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A96\">I. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">A. The Class Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Wal-Mart argues that plaintiffs\u2019 class allegations should be either dismissed or stricken because the series of subclasses that plaintiffs delineate in the FACC are defined by the merits of their legal claims, and such merits-based class definitions im-permissibly force the Court to engage in a fact-intensive inquiry in order to determine the scope of each putative subclass. Plaintiffs counter that the members of each class can be determined by \u201cmerely reviewing objective criteria,\u201d namely Wal-Mart\u2019s employment records. Opp at 9:4-7. However, plaintiffs do not explain how the review of such records will determine the members of the subclasses. Moreover, plaintiffs, perhaps indirectly conceding that the class definitions are potentially inappropriate, state that \u201c[depending on the Court\u2019s desire,\u201d \u201ca definition as str[a]ightforward as \u2018all employees of Defendant who [were] terminated during the class period\u2019 could be fashioned.\u201d Opp. at 9:26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Wal-Mart cites numerous cases for the proposition that the class definitions must be sufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the Court to determine whether a particular individual is a member without delving into the merits of the claim. However, nearly all of these cases considered the issue of the appropriate contours of class definitions in the context of a motion for class certification. <em>See Hagen v. City of Winnemucca, </em>108 F.R.D. 61 (D.Nev.1985); <em>Daniels v. City of N.Y., </em>198 F.R.D. 409, 414 (S.D.N.Y.2001); <em>Sanneman v. Chrysler Corp., </em>191 F.R.D. 441 (E.D.Pa.2000). Generally, courts review class allegations through a motion for class certification. <em>See, e.g. Moreno v. Baca, </em>No. CV007149ABCCWX, 2000 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>33356835, *2 (C.D.Cal.2000) (finding defendants\u2019 motion to strike class allegations premature because no motion for class certification was before the court). Such a motion should be filed \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after a defendant answers. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ.P. 23(c)(1). Wal-Mart has not yet answered the FACC.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">While Wal-Mart correctly cites <em>Kamm v. Cal. City Development Co., </em>509 F.2d 205, 212 (9th Cir.1975), for the proposition that class allegations may be stricken at the pleading stage, the granting of motions to dismiss class allegations before discovery has commenced is rare. Indeed, while there is little authority on this issue within the Ninth Circuit, decisions from courts in other jurisdictions have made clear that \u201cdismissal of class allegations at the pleading stage should be done rarely and that the better course is to deny such a motion because \u2018the shape and form of a class action evolves only through the process of discovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Myers v. Med-Quist, Inc., </em>No. 05-4608, 2006 WL 3751210, *4 (D.N.J.2006) (internal citations omitted) (declining to strike class allegations because discovery had not yet commenced and observing that most courts deny such motions if brought prior to discovery); <em>see also Abdallah v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>No. Civ.A. L98CV3679-RW, 1999 WL 527835 (N.D.Ga.1999) (dismissal of class allegations prior to discovery premature); <em>see also </em>7AA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary K. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure Civil </em>\u00a7 1785.3 (3d 2005) (the practice employed in the overwhelming majority of class actions is to resolve class certification only after an appropriate period of discovery). While Wal-Mart cites <em>Palmer v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, </em>No. 02 C 1764, 2003 WL 466065, *2 (N.D.Ill.2003), for the proposition that it is sometimes possible to determine from the pleadings alone that the class requirements cannot possibly be met and in such cases striking class allegations before commencing discovery is appropriate, the court in <em>Palmer </em>declined to dismiss the class allegations because there were insufficient indicia in the pleadings for the court to determine whether the class allegations were appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Here, the Court notes that plaintiffs\u2019 class definitions are somewhat suspicious. For example, the \u201cTermination\u201d subclass includes all terminated employees \u201cwho did not receive all of the wages <em>due </em>them at the time of termination, and/or who did not receive their final wages in a timely manner as mandated by California law.\u201d FACC \u00b6 33 (emphasis added). The notion of wages \u201cdue\u201d in the context of the complaint appears to be a legal one based on a factual determination, and therefore it appears that the determination of which plaintiffs were not paid the wages they were \u201cdue\u201d cannot be determined without first determining the underlying issue_ i.e. whether defendant withheld wages that were \u201cdue\u201d to terminated employees. Similarly, to determine proper membership in the \u201cVacation Subclass,\u201d the Court would need to determine who has not received <em>\u201cfull and complete\u201d </em>compensation for all vested vacation pay. The definition of this subclass requires the Court to determine what \u201cfull and complete\u201d compensation is in order to determine who the members of the class are, which, again, would appear to involve a legal determination based on the facts relevant to an individual potential class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Nevertheless, Wal-Mart has not answered in this case, discovery has not yet commenced, and no motion for class certification has been filed. In the absence of any discovery or specific arguments related to class certification, the Court is not prepared to rule on the propriety of the class allegations and explicitly reserves such a ruling. While plaintiffs\u2019 class definitions are suspicious and may in fact be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>improper, plaintiffs should at least be given the opportunity to make the case for certification based on appropriate discovery of, for example, the electronic employment lists that they claim will identify the class members. Accordingly, Wal-Mart\u2019s motions to dismiss or strike the class allegations are premature and are denied, but without prejudice as to Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to move to strike or dismiss the class allegations if and when class certification is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Overtime Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third claim for relief seeks overtime pursuant to Labor Code sections 500, 510 and 1194. The FACC alleges with respect to plaintiff Wiggins: (1) that \u201cWal-Mart would \u2018shave off time from [Wiggins\u2019s] time cards whereby Mr. Wiggins was not paid for all of the hours he worked;\u201d and (2) \u201cwhen Mr. Wiggins worked a graveyard shift, Wal-Mart would count the hours worked before midnight as working one day, and all the hours worked after midnight as hours worked on another day, thereby denying Mr. Wiggins overtime pay\u201d (referred to herein as the \u201cshift designation\u201d claim). FACC \u00b627. Wal-Mart argues that neither theory is sufficient to state a claim for relief because (1) the FACC does not allege that Wiggins ever actually worked overtime that was not paid due to the alleged \u201ctime-shaving,\u201d and (2) Wal-Mart\u2019s practice of failing to pay overtime wages for hours worked in excess of eight where some hours are worked in a single shift fall before midnight and other hours after midnight is entirely compliant with California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">1. Time Shaving</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\u201cTime-shaving\u201d is the practice of doctoring hourly employees\u2019 time sheets to reduce their pay. <em>See </em>Cynthia Estlund, <em>Rebuilding the Law of the Workplace in an Era of Self-Regulation, </em>105 Colum. L.Rev. 319, 392 (2005) (citing Steven Greenhouse, <em>U.S. Jury Cites Unpaid Work at Wal-Mart, N.Y. Times, </em>Dec. 20, 2002, at A26). The FACC states the following with respect to the alleged time shaving: \u201cDuring Plaintiff Michael Wiggins\u2019 employment with Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart failed to pay overtime. Wal-Mart would \u2018shave off time from his time cards whereby Mr. Wiggins would not be paid for all the hours he worked.\u201d FACC \u00b6 27. Wal-Mart argues that this allegation is insufficient to state a claim for overtime wages because \u201cWiggins does not allege that he ever worked overtime that was not paid due to this alleged \u2018time-shaving....\u2019 Plaintiffs merely mention \u2018time-shaving\u2019 and conclude that Wiggins was not paid for all hours worked.\u201d Wal-Mart\u2019s argument is disingenuous: there is simply no way to interpret the FACC\u2019s allegations concerning time-shaving other than as claiming that Wiggins was not paid overtime <em>because </em>Wal-Mart engaged in time-shaving. To argue otherwise is to succumb to sophistry, and Wal-Mart\u2019s argument accordingly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">2. Overtime for Hours Worked in Two Different \u201cWorkdays\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Plaintiffs argue that Wal-Mart improperly fails to pay overtime wages for hours worked in excess of eight, where some hours worked in a single shift fall before midnight and others after midnight. Wal-Mart counters that this practice entirely compliant with California Law. California Labor Code section 510(a) states in pertinent part: \u201cEight hours of labor constitutes a day\u2019s work. Any work in excess of eight hours in one workday ... shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for an employee.\u201d Cal. Lab.Code \u00a7 510. Labor Code section 500, in turn, defines \u201cworkday\u201d as \u201cany consecutive 24-hour period commencing at the same time each calendar day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 500(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The California Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (\u201cDLSE\u201d) has interpreted Labor Code section 500 to mean that \u201c[t]he beginning of an employee\u2019s workday need not coincide with the beginning of that employee\u2019s shift, and an employer may establish different workdays for different shifts,\u201d DLSE Enforcement Policies and Interpretations Manual (\u201cDLSE Manual\u201d), at \u00b6 48.1.2. Thus, Wal-Mart argues, if the end of one workday and beginning of the next is set at midnight, only hours worked in excess of eight in <em>one or the other </em>workday entitle an employee to overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The issue of whether an employer may circumvent the overtime pay provisions of the Labor Code by setting the beginning of the \u201cworkday\u2019 in the middle of a shift that would otherwise require overtime pay appears to be one of first impression. Wal-Mart points to the following illustration provided in the DLSE Manual as support for its argument that such a practice does not violate the Labor Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">A factory worker whose usual shift is 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. has an established workday beginning at 7 a.m. On Tuesday night she is asked to work a special extra shift from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Wednesday. <em>Since she has already worked eight hours on Tuesday, </em>she is due time and a half beginning at 11 p.m. on Tuesday night until 3 a.m. and double time from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m. However, <em>because her workday begins at 7 a.m. she may be paid straight time wages from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. (her regular shift) on Wednesday regardless of the fact that the time worked is continuous.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 48.1.2.1 (emphasis added). While the illustration does state that an employee is not due overtime for two consecutive shifts that span two workdays, it does not state that an employee working a <em>single shift </em>usually spanning two workdays should not receive overtime. Moreover, the point of the illustration appears to be that the employee does not receive double overtime recovery; the employee is in fact awarded overtime for her work on Tuesday, but is not again awarded additional overtime for her work on Wednesday. Accordingly, the hypothetical does not provide support for Wal-Mart\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In any case, the first sentence of Labor Code section 510(a) bluntly states: \u201cEight hours of labor constitutes a day\u2019s work.\u201d In the context of an overtime statute, this sentence clearly conveys the legislature\u2019s intent that, other than in the case of specific enumerated exceptions, a shift of more than eight hours of consecutive work qualifies for overtime pay. California\u2019s overtime laws are remedial and are to be construed so as to promote employee protection. <em>Sav-on Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>34 Cal.4th 319, 340, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 906, 96 P.3d 194 (2004). Additionally, the California Supreme Court has held that interpretations contained in the DLSE Manual are non-binding and are entitled to no deference. See <em>Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. v. Bradshaw, </em>14 Cal.4th 557, 568, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 927 P.2d 296 (1996). Therefore, to the extent that the DLSE\u2019s opinion that \u201c[t]he beginning of an employee\u2019s workday need not coincide with the beginning of that employee\u2019s shift, and an employer may establish different workdays for different shifts\u201d is inconsistent with the Labor Code\u2019s goal of promoting employee protection, this opinion should be ignored. <em>See Tomlinson v. Indymac Bank, F.S.B, </em>359 F.Supp.2d 891, 895 (C.D.Cal.2005) (finding DLSE reasoning and examples unpersuasive because \u201cin California, \u2018agency interpretations are not binding or ... authoritative\u2019 and \u2018[c]ourts must, in short, independently judge the text of a statute.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Bonnell v. Medical Board of California, </em>31 Cal.4th 1255, 1264, 8 Cal.Rptr.3d 532, 82 P.3d 740 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>(2003)). Accordingly, the Court holds that plaintiffs have properly alleged a claim for failure to pay overtime in violation of Labor Code sections 500, 510 and 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">C. Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 fifth claim for relief is for conversion. Plaintiffs base this claim on the same conduct alleged against Wal-Mart in the first through fourth claims for relief, i.e., violations of the Labor Code. Plaintiffs allege that \u201c[b]y failing to pay earned wages, actual damages, and penalty wages to Plaintiffs and the others similarly situated, defendant wrongfully obtained and held the monies belonging to Plaintiffs and others similarly situated.\u201d FACC \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Conversion is a tort consisting of the wrongful exercise of dominion over personal property of another. 5 B.E. Witkin, <em>Summary of California Law </em>\u00a7 610 (9th ed.1988). A claim for conversion properly lies where there is substantial interference with possession of the property or the right to it. <em>Id. </em>Property that may be the subject of a claim for conversion includes tangible personal property, intangible property represented by documents such as bonds, notes, and bills of exchange, and money, so long as a specific, identifiable sum is at issue. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 612-14; <em>see also Green v. Party City Corp., </em>No. CV-01-09681 CAS, 2002 WL 553219, *4 (C.D.Cal.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Under California law, where a statute creates a right that did not exist at common law and provides a comprehensive and detailed remedial scheme for its enforcement, the statutory remedy is exclusive. <em>Rojo v. Kliger, 52 </em>Cal.3d 65, 79, 276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373 (1990); <em>see </em>also <em>Stevenson v. Superior Court, </em>16 Cal.4th 880, 900, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997) (\u201cWhere a new right is created by statute, the party aggrieved by its violation is confined to the statutory remedy.\u201d). Wal-Mart argues that all of the allegations in the FACC seek relief under the comprehensive scheme implemented by the Labor Code, and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 only recourse is through the procedures prescribed by that regulatory scheme. Reply at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In response, plaintiffs argue that California courts have specifically recognized wages as a proper subject of conversion claim, citing <em>DLSE v. UI Video Stores, Inc., 55 </em>Cal.App.4th 1084, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 457 (1997). In that case, the DLSE had negotiated a settlement with Blockbuster for reimbursement of funds paid by employees for uniforms in contravention of California law. <em>Id. </em>at 1095-96, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 457. Rather than abide by the terms of the settlement, which directed Blockbuster to send the checks directly to the DSLE, Blockbuster mailed the checks directly to the employees and then retained the checks that were returned as undeliverable, refusing to hand them over the DSLE and thereby retaining the funds. The court found that DSLE had properly alleged a claim for conversion in arguing that Blockbuster had unlawfully retained the checks. <em>Id. VI Video Stores </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the DSLE was not suing for enforcement of the Labor Code, but was rather suing for a breach of the settlement agreement. <em>Id. VI Video Stores </em>did not involve, as does this case, plaintiffs seeking wages pursuant to the Labor Code and simultaneously alleging a cause of conversion based on the same underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">While there are no California cases on point, two federal courts have considered this argument under strikingly similar circumstances and held that a claim for unpaid wages under the Labor Code cannot form the basis for a claim of conversion given the existence of the Labor Code\u2019s \u201cdetailed remedial scheme for violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>its provisions.\u201d <em>Green, </em>2002 WL 553219 at*4; <em>see also Pulido v. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., </em>No. EDCV06-406VAP, 2006 WL 1699328, *9 (C.D.Cal.2006). <em>Green </em>directly considered the question in the context of overtime wages, and <em>Pulido </em>considered the issue with respect to penalties for forcing the plaintiffs to work through meal and rest periods. <em>Pulido, </em>2006 WL 1699328 at *9. The rationale adopted in both <em>Green </em>and <em>Pulido </em>is persuasive. With the exception of <em>UI Video Stores, </em>which is distinguishable, plaintiffs identify no case in which a claim for unpaid wages under the Labor Code was properly held to also state a claim for conversion. Moreover, it should be noted that, were the Court to agree with plaintiffs that a claim for \u201cearned wages, actual damages, and penalty wages\u201d constitutes a conversion claim, such a rule would in effect transform <em>every </em>claim for damages and statutory penalties into a conversion claim, thereby providing punitive damages for every breach of a statute that implements a penalty for its breach. While plaintiffs apparently included this cause of action for the purpose of claiming punitive damages, <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b682 (\u201cPlaintiffs and others similarly situated are entitled to punitive damages <em>... as well as </em>all damages allowed under [the] California Labor Code\u201d(emphasis added)), the cause of action for conversion is improper and is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">B. Business and Professions Code Section 17200</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 sixth claim for relief alleges unfair business practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200, <em>et seq., </em>also known as the state\u2019s Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d). As with the cause of action for conversion, plaintiffs base this cause of action on the same allegations that support the First through Fourth Causes of Action for violations of the Labor Code. While Wal-Mart initially moved to dismiss the UCL claim <em>in toto, </em>in its reply brief, Wal-Mart, presumably responding to plaintiffs\u2019 citation of on-point authority, <em>Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., </em>23 Cal.4th 163, 177, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706 (2000) (concluding that orders for payment of wages unlawfully withheld from an employee pursuant to Labor Code \u00a7 227.3 are a restitutionary remedy authorized by section 17203), concedes that plaintiffs have properly alleged an \u201cunlawful business practice\u201d based upon the alleged failure to pay accrued vacation pay in violation of Labor Code \u00a7 227.3. <em>See </em>Reply at 11 (\u201cThe Court should grant Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the sixth claim with respect to any alleged \u201cunlawful business practice\u201d <em>other than </em>the alleged violation of section 227.3\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">For their part, plaintiffs concede that under <em>Tomlinson, supra, </em>359 F.Supp.2d at 895, claims pursuant to Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 203 and 226 cannot support a \u00a7 17200 claim. <em>See Id. </em>at 895 (granting judgment on the pleadings on ground that Labor Code \u00a7 203 provides for a penalty, not wages, which cannot be raised through \u00a7 17200 claim). Accordingly, as the parties are correctly in agreement as to the scope of plaintiffs UCL claim, Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to dismiss the Sixth Cause of Action is granted with respect to claims based on \u00a7\u00a7 203 and 226 and denied with respect to claims under \u00a7 227.3. <em>See Cortez, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at 177, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">II. Motion to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">A. The Class Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">As the Court has already determined that Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to dismiss the class allegations should be denied as premature, so does the Court deny the motion to strike the class allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>B. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Wal-Mart argues that the Court should strike plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for punitive damages because none of the claims asserted allows the imposition of punitive damages. Specifically, Wal-Mart argues that 1) because the Labor Code sections provide for remedies for violations of those sections, including specific penalties, plaintiffs are precluded from seeking punitive damages as such damages would amount to double recovery; 2) it is settled law that punitive damages are not available under \u00a7 17200, <em>et seq.; </em>and 3) plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim fails and therefore provides no basis for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Where a right is created by statute and the statute does not expressly permit punitive damages, punitive damages under California Civil Code section 3294 are not available. <em>See Turnbull &amp; Turnbull v. ARA Transp., Inc., </em>219 Cal. App.3d 811, 826-27, 268 Cal.Rptr. 856 (1990) (stating, \u201cwhen a new right ... is created by statute and a statutory remedy for the infringement thereof is provided, such remedy is exclusive of all others\u201d) (citing <em>Orloff v. L.A. Turf Club, </em>30 Cal.2d 110, 112-13, 180 P.2d 321 (1947)); <em>see also Czechowski v. Tandy Corp., </em>731 F.Supp. 406, 410 (N.D.Cal.1990) (Schwarzer, J.) (penalty provision provided by Labor Code precludes award of punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In <em>Czechowski, </em>this Court considered the very issue being raised by plaintiffs, i.e., whether punitive damages are available under Labor Code sections 227.3 and 203 or California Business <em>&amp; </em>Professions Code sections 17200 and 17203, and concluded that they are not. This Court held that because section 203 provides for the award of statutory penalties when an employer \u201cwillfully fails to pay\u201d wages due upon termination, the Legislature\u2019s provision of such statutory penalties precludes an award of punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 410. (citing <em>Marshall v. Brown, </em>141 Cal.App.3d 408, 418-19, 190 Cal.Rptr. 392 (1983)). This Court further noted that claims under section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code will not support an award of punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Newport Components v. NEC Home Electronics, </em>671 F.Supp. 1525, 1550-51 (C.D.Cal.1987)). Indeed, it is settled law that punitive damages are not available under section 17200. <em>See Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>29 Cal.4th 1134, 1148, 131 Cal. Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937 (2003) (\u201cWhile the scope of conduct covered by the UCL is broad, its remedies are limited. A UCL action is equitable in nature; damages cannot be recovered.... We have stated that under the UCL, \u2018[prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Dozier v. Maispace, </em>No. C-05-1761, 2007 WL 518622, *10 (N.D.Cal.2007) (Trumbull, Mag. J.) (holding that neither compensatory nor punitive damages are recoverable under section 17200) (citing <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Santa Cruz County Superior Court, </em>209 Cal.App.3d 1093,1096, 257 Cal.Rptr. 655 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"Apc\">Plaintiffs urge this Court to overturn its prior ruling on this very issue in <em>Czechowski, </em>relying on a 104 year-old case, <em>Greenberg v. Western Turf Ass\u2019n, </em>140 Cal. 357, 73 P. 1050 (1903). In <em>Greenberg, </em>the California Supreme Court upheld the imposition of punitive damages where a statutory penalty had already been awarded because it determined that the civil penalty was not meant to punish. Based on <em>Greenberg, </em>plaintiffs attempt to argue that the Labor Code penalties they seek to impose in this case are not meant to \u201cpunish.\u201d Opp. at 18:24-19:5 (citing <em>Marshall v. Brown, </em>141 Cal.App.3d 408, 190 Cal. Rptr. 392 (1993)) (punitive damages not available where purpose of treble damages provision of Labor Code \u00a7 1054 was to punish). However, as the California Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>preme Court noted in <em>Murphy v. Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc., </em>Labor Code sections 203 and 226 do in fact impose \u201cpenalties\u201d explicitly labeled as such. 40 Cal.4th 1094, 1108-09, 56 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 155 P.3d 284 (2007). As the Labor Code provides for compensatory damages <em>in addition </em>to statutory penalties, it is difficult to fathom how such penalties are not meant to \u201cpunish\u201d employers who willfully violate the provisions of the Labor Code. As this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Czechowski </em>was sound, the Court declines to overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that the Court should allow plaintiffs to seek punitive damages because the \u201cstatutory remedies may be inadequate.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 argument appears to be that because the statutory penalties provided by the Labor Code are not substantial enough (i.e., are limited to a maximum of 30 days worth of wages per former employee), they are insufficient to deter Wal-Mart or others from \u201ccommitting the same acts in the future.\u201d Opp. at 20:28. Thus, in essence, plaintiffs seek to have this Court substitute its own judgment for that of legislature\u2019s regarding the appropriate punishment for violations of the Labor Code. This Court declines to do so. <em>See Wynn v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1112 (C.D.Cal.2002) (\u201cWhen the Legislature has spoken, the court is not free to substitute its judgment as to the better policy.\u201d) (citing <em>City and County of San Francisco v. Sweet, </em>12 Cal.4th 105, 121, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 42, 906 P.2d 1196 (1995)). Accordingly, plaintiffs prayer for punitive damages is stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">For the foregoing reasons, Wal-Mart\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED with respect to the Third Cause of Action for overtime, the Sixth Cause of Action for unfair business practices insofar as it is based on violations of Labor Code \u00a7 227.3, and the class allegations. The Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND with respect to the Fifth Cause of Action for conversion and the Sixth Cause of Action for unfair business practices insofar as it is based on violations of sections of the Labor Code other than \u00a7 227.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Wal-Mart\u2019s Motion to Strike is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages and DENIED in all other respects. Paragraph 7 of the Prayer for Relief is STRICKEN. Plaintiffs are granted leave to file an amended complaint no later than 20 days of this Order <em>only if </em>they can allege an adequate basis for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
