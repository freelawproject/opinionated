In accordance with the plea agreement, County Court sentenced defendant, as a second felony offender, to concurrent prison terms of five years, followed by two years of postrelease supervision, and 1\u00bd to 3 years, respectively. On appeal, defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment as counsel for defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues that can be raised on appeal. Upon our review of the record, defense counsel\u2019s brief and defendant\u2019s pro se submission, we disagree. Defendant\u2019s pro se brief challenges the validity of the waiver of his right to appeal, as well as the validity of the indictment charging him with conspiracy in the fourth degree. Inasmuch as these issues cannot be characterized as \u201cwholly frivolous,\u201d the application of defense counsel to be relieved of his assignment is granted and defendant will be as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>signed new counsel to address these issues and any other issues that the record may disclose <em>(People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633, 636 [2001]; <em>see People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979 [1985], <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650 [1986]).</p>\n<judges id=\"b1058-3\">McCarthy, J.P., Garry, Rose, Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"ANf\">Ordered that the decision is withheld, application to be relieved of assignment granted and new counsel to be assigned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
