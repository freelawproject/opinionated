It was admitted that Smith had title to lots 1132 and 1923, at the time of the issuing of the warrant, and that these two lots destroyed the contiguity of the others. Naylor then asked leave to have his certificate amended, so as to embrace lots 1121, 1122 and 1131. Upon this question the Chancellor delivered the following opinion and order.]</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b542-11\">The Chancellor:</author>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">In this case it is manifest and is conceded, that the <em>caveat </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Smith must bo ruled good, and the only question is, whether, according to the rules and practice of the land office, Naylor may not have his certificate corrected by excluding lots numbered 1134 and 1920, which by the intervention of Smith\u2019s lots are separated from the other lots comprehended in the certificate of the former.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b543-6\">Thos. Perry, for the Caveators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AO8\">Geo. A. Pearre, for the Caveatee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">This question appears to me, to be conclusively settled by the case of <em>Issachar Schoffield </em>vs. <em>Beall, </em>reported in the <em>Landholders\u2019 Assistant, </em>420, 421. Indeed if that case and this are distinguishable at all, it is in circumstances which make this case stronger in favor of the right to have the correction made, and, therefore, I shall pass an order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">It is, thereupon, adjudged and ordered, that the <em>caveat </em>of George Smith be, and the same is hereby ruled good, and that the certificate of \u201cNaylorsville\u201d be corrected by excluding lots numbered 1132, 1923,1134 and 1920. And that the surveyor of Alleghany county make the said correction and return the corrected certificate along with the original to this office.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
