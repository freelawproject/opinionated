This is a question of law as to whether the facts alleged in the complaint and the exhibits made a part of it by reference, if true, entitle this plaintiff to a new trial of the original action on the ground of newly-discovered evidence. General Statutes, \u00a7 5850. Applications for new trials are addressed to the sound discretion of the court and its conclusion will not be disturbed unless its discretion has been improperly exercised. The matter of hew trials is controlled by well-established rules. <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Conn. 576, 578, 54 Atl. 199; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brock</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>haus, </em>72 Conn. 109, 111, 43 Atl. 850; <em>Selleck </em>v. <em>Head, 77 </em>Conn. 15, 17, 58 Atl. 224; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>83 Conn. 477, 76 Atl. 1002; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 518, 521, 80 Atl. 712; <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>107 Conn. 164, 167, 140 Atl. 114; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>86 Conn. 684, 688, 86 Atl. 560. From this record it appears that Rogers, while upon the witness stand, was asked by his counsel, evidently referring to the time of the injury, \u201cWhat were you working at?\u201d and he replied, \u201cInternational Silver Company, Factory H.\u201d He was further asked, \u201cand what was your weekly wages?\u201d and he answered, \u201cThirty seven dollars\u2014$38 a week.\u201d \u201cQ. Thirty eight dollars a week?\u201d \u201cA. Thirty seven dollars\u2014$38 in a week.\u201d In another exhibit, also made a part of the complaint by reference, it appears that Rogers did not work \u201cfull time\u201d every week, but for his last full week he received $38.65; and for the full weeks he worked from this time back in their order he received $36.71, $38.77, $33.12; $30.14, $41.16, $39.19, $36.47, $36.08, $36.23, $41.59, $41.23. Without following the figures further, it thus appears that for the eleven \u201cfull weeks\u201d of work immediately preceding the injury his average was $37.33 per week. The closing statement of Rogers that his weekly wages were \u201cThirty seven dollars\u2014$38 in a week,\u201d so far from being \u201cfalse testimony,\u201d as alleged, appears to have been fair and truthful and a very close approximation to his actual full weekly earnings. That the questions put to Rogers and his answers thereto, referred to his wages for full weeks and not to part time earnings, is too obvious to merit discussion. The city was put on notice, if it did not know before, of the place of Rogers\u2019 employment, and the means were at its disposal to easily and quickly obtain the information which it now offers as newly-discovered evidence. It is alleged that the direct examination before us is all the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>given on this subject and it thus appears that Rogers was not cross-examined thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201c \u2018To entitle a party to a new trial for newly-discovered evidence, it is indispensable that he should have been diligent in his efforts fully to prepare his cause for trial; and if the new evidence relied upon could have been known with reasonable diligence, a new trial will not be granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>86 Conn. 684, 688, 86 Atl. 560; <em>White </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>81 Conn. 325, 328, 70 Atl. 1065; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>43 Conn. 187, 191. Moreover, a new trial will not be granted save for strong reasons, upon which a court acting reasonably, would feel bound to act. <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Wildman, </em>72 Conn. 262, 270, 44 Atl. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The city alleges in paragraph five of the complaint, that it was \u201cunable\u201d to discover this evidence \u201cbefore or during said trial, as said plaintiff did not know where the said Rogers was employed,\u201d yet paragraph three of the complaint annexes the testimony of Rogers upon that trial and therein he clearly stated where, by whom, for how long, and at what compensation he was employed. These allegations are contradictory and not proper pleading. A demurrer admits such facts only as are properly pleaded. <em>Eliot\u2019s Appeal, </em>74 Conn. 586, 601, 51 Atl. 558. \u201cA demurrer does not admit any averment contradicting what before appears certain on the record.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>81 Conn. 325, 328, 70 Atl. 1065. The record thus far considered does not disclose the indispensable requisite of prior due diligence in the discovery at the time of the trial, of the evidence now submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Where a plaintiff testified that he had a motor vehicle license, but was not cross-examined upon that point and defendant\u2019s counsel made no effort to ascertain the truth of the statement by consulting the office of the motor vehicle commissioner, and after judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>for the plaintiff, defendant secured an injunction against levy of execution and brought action for a new trial on the ground of perjury by the plaintiff, a new trial was denied. In affirming the action of the trial court, Mr. Justice Keeler remarked: \u201cWe have to observe at the outset that the trial judge has found a lack of diligence as an ultimate fact, which must stand if reasonably supported by the subordinate facts appearing in the record. . . . The fact assumed great importance in the mind of Andrews\u2019 counsel directly after judgment in the action. That he did not realize its importance before, is a clear indication of negligent preparation, and an example of wisdom after the event. Due diligence is manifested by foresight, and a want of it is not excused by activity following disaster.\u201d <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Olaff, </em>99 Conn. 530, 537, 538, 122 Atl. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">It may further be said that in our view of the essential accuracy of the original testimony of Rogers\u2014 the presentation of the evidence now offered could not be expected to change the result of that trial. This in itself would justify denial of the petition. <em>Apter </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>94 Conn. 139, 141, 108 Atl. 548; <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>91 Conn. 23, 25, 98 Atl. 295; 1 Swift\u2019s Digest, pp. 786, 788 (Rev. Ed. 1862, p. 816); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>89 Conn. 401, 403, 94 Atl. 277; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>86 Conn. 684, 690, 86 Atl. 560; <em>Widman </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>96 Conn. 254, 258, 114 Atl. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
