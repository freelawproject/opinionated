The special damages might reasonably have been found to be $2315.25. The physical injury was severe and included a twenty-five per cent permanent partial disability to plaintiff\u2019s left leg. Although he was seventy-one years of age at the time of this accident it cannot be held as matter of law that the assessment of damages of $4200 for the injury plaintiff suffered is excessive, giving due weight to the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
