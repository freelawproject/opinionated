When he reached a point about one hundred feet from the plaintiff\u2019s car without warning or signal he turned a sharp angle to his left and started to cross over to the northerly half of the highway on which the plaintiff\u2019s car was approaching and directly in its path with the apparent intention of continuing to the northerly edge of that highway. Hazen immediately applied his brakes in an effort to avert the collision (which did not occur) and in so doing caused his car to skid into a tree causing damage to the car. The appellant\u2019s exceptions to the finding are without merit. The conclusions of the court that the defendants were negligent in having violated \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6 of Chapter 334 of the Public Acts of 1921, and in failing to keep a proper lookout, and that Hazen acted in the situation confronting him as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under like circumstances, were amply justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
