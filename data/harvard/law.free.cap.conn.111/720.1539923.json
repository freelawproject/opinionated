Our examination of the evidence has satisfied us that we cannot hold, as matter of law, that the trial court was in error in its conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent did not by her own negligence materially contribute to the accident which resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The trial court saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to weigh the evidence, find the facts and draw the conclusion than we are upon a mere study of the printed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
